The Company's principal line of business is the design, construction,
and marketing and sales of single family residential homes in Austin, Texas.

Revenue from sales of homes is recognized at the time of closing when
title, possession, and other attributes of ownership have been transferred
to the home buyer.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment, consisting primarily of office furniture and fixtures
and model home furniture, are carried at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to ten years.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Organization

Clark Wilson Homes, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on May 12, 1992.
The Company's principal line of business is the design, construction,
marketing and sale of single family resident homes in Austin, Texas.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from sales of homes is recognized at the time of closing when title,
possession, and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the
home buyer.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment, consisting primarily of office furniture and fixtures
and model home furniture, are carried at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to ten years.

Inventories

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost (using the specific
identification method) or net realizable value and include lots, construction
costs, and certain related indirect costs and expenditures. Interest on
indebtedness and real estate taxes are capitalized during the development and
construction period to the point of substantial completion of construction.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Income Taxes

The Company has elected Subchapter S Corporation filing status for federal
income tax purposes. As such, no provision for income taxes is necessary in
these financial statements because, as an S Corporation, the Company is not
subject to federal income tax and the tax effect of its activities accrues to
its stockholders.

2. LOT AQUISITION:

The Company aquires lots by means of option contracts, some of which require
specific performance by the Company. Option contracts generally require the
payment of a cash deposit for the rights to acquire lots during a specified
period of time at a certain price. The aggregate purchase price of all lots
under option contracts was $4,590,000 and $2,428,000 at December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively.

3. NOTES PAYABLE:

Notes payable consist of the following:

institutions bearing interest at prime plus 1%-31/2%,

PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into
effective as of November 10, 1994, by and between CLARK N. WILSON and AUDREY
WILSON, each as an individual (collectively, "Seller"), J.M. PETERS COMPANY,
INC., a Delaware corporation, together with any assignee thereof pursuant to
Section 5.4 below ("Purchaser"), and Clark Wilson Homes, Inc., a Texas
corporation (the "Company").

ARTICLE I
PURCHASE AND SALE

1.1 Purchase and Sale of Shares. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser agrees to purchase and acquire from
Seller, and Seller agrees to sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Purchaser,
100% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company and 100% of the
outstanding capital stock of Fairway Financial Corp., a Texas corporation
("Fairway Financial") (the shares of the Company and the shares of Fairway
Financial are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the "Shares").

1.2 Purchase Price. In consideration for the Shares,
Purchaser shall pay Seller an aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price"),
payable as follows:

(i) In cash, the sum of Three Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,500,000) (the "Cash Portion"); and

(ii) A nonrecourse Promissory Note in the amount
of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Note"). The Note shall be secured
by a Stock Pledge Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B,
encumbering the shares (the "Stock Pledge Agreement").

ARTICLE II
CLOSING

2.1 Closing. Subject to Purchaser's rights under Section
4.1, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall occur on or before December 27, 1994, subject to Purchaser's
right to close earlier at any time immediately upon written notice upon at
least 48 hours' written notice from Purchaser to Seller. Seller and Purchaser
acknowledge that the Purchase Price has been calculated based upon the
financial position of the Company on September 1, 1994, as reflected in the
Financial Statements (as defined in

<PAGE> 6
Section 3.1(l), and that the intent of Seller's indemnity in Section 4.5 as to
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1(l) is, among other
things, to accomplish an accounting cutoff of September 1, 1994 or such later
date on or before the Closing Date as Purchaser shall elect (such election to
be made within 180 days after the Closing Date). Accordingly, although the
Closing will occur on a later date, the parties agree that for accounting
purposes, Purchaser's acquisition of the Shares shall be deemed to be effective
as of September 1, 1994 or such later date on or before the Closing Date as
Purchaser shall elect (such election to be made within 180 days after the
Closing Date) on the basis that Purchaser effectively gained control of the
Company on or about September 1, 1994. In addition, Purchaser's acquisition of
the Shares shall be deemed to be effective for tax purposes as of September 1,
1994 or such later date on or before the Closing as Purchaser shall elect (such
election to be made within 180 days after the Closing Date), which date may be
different from the effective date for accounting and other purposes elected by
Purchaser pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section. The Closing
shall take place at the Company's offices at 1717 West Sixth Street, Suite 140,
Austin, Texas 78703-4775. The date upon which the Closing occurs is referred
to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date." At the Closing on the Closing
Date, the following shall occur:

(a) Deliveries by Purchaser. Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller:

(i) the sum of Three Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,500,000) as the Cash Portion of the
Purchase Price, by cashier's check or wire transfer;

(ii) the Note, executed by Purchaser and
dated as of the Closing Date;

(iii) the Stock Pledge Agreement, executed
by Purchaser and dated as of the Closing Date; and

(iv) the certificate required of Purchaser
pursuant to Section 3.3.

(b) Deliveries by Seller. Seller shall deliver
(and, as appropriate, shall cause the Company to deliver) to Purchaser:

(i) one or more stock certificates
representing the Shares, endorsed by Seller in blank or accompanied by
stock powers endorsed by Seller in blank and dated as of the Closing
Date;

(ii) such resignations of the officers
and directors of the Company and Fairway Financial as Purchaser may
request dated as of the Closing Date;

2
<PAGE> 7
(iii) the Irrevocable Proxy in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C (and another for Fairway Financial in
substantially identical form), executed by Seller and dated as of the
Closing Date;

(iv) the certificate required of Seller
and the Company pursuant to Section 3.3; and

(v) such other documents as are
reasonably required of Seller to effect the transactions contemplated 
by this Agreement.

(c) Simultaneous Delivery. All proceedings to
take place on the Closing Date shall be considered to take place
simultaneously, and no delivery or payment shall be considered to have been
made on such date until all deliveries, payments and proceedings due to occur
under this Agreement on such Closing Date have been completed.

2.2 Payment to Brokers. Purchaser agrees to pay to the
brokers described in Section 3.1(k) and 3.2(k) in the shares directed by such
brokers the sum of $69,000 if and when the Closing occurs.

or provisions of the Company's or Fairway Financial's Articles of Incorporation
or Bylaws or any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, lease, loan

beneficial owner of the Shares. No other person or entity has any right,
title, or interest, beneficially or of record, in or to the Shares. The Shares

default under any such agreement in the future.

(i) Violations of Law. Except as otherwise set
forth in attached Exhibit G, each of the Company and Fairway Financial holds

accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the
period indicated (except as specifically disclosed therein), fairly present the
financial condition of the Company at the dates thereof and the results of
operations of the Company for the periods indicated, respectively, and are true
and correct in all material respects and did not omit any liability or
contingent liability of the Company at the dates thereof, respectively. The
amount of reserves for expenses specified in the Financial Statements contained
in Exhibit I (which amount is zero) are sufficient to cover all expenses of the
Company allocable to periods prior to August 31, 1994. There has been no
adverse change in the business, financial condition, operations, results of
operations or future prospects of the Company since August 31, 1994.

(m) No Employment Agreements. Except for the
Company's contract with Administaff pursuant to which the Company "leases"
Administaff's employees, there are no employment agreements to which the
Company or Fairway Financial is a party or is otherwise bound, and all persons
employed for the Company's account can be terminated at the Company's election
given to Administaff. Except as disclosed in the Schedule of Expenses included
in attached Exhibit I, neither the Company nor Fairway Financial is subject to
any agreements or arrangements which may obligate the Company or Fairway
Financial for the payment of any

6
<PAGE> 11
bonuses, incentives or other amount to Administaff's employees or other persons
engaged in work on the Company's or Fairway Financial's account.

(n) Projections. The parties acknowledge that
representatives of the Company and Seller have prepared certain financial
plans, models and projections regarding the future performance of the Company,
which have been delivered to Purchaser (the "Projections"). The Company and
Seller have used their best efforts to prepare the Projections based upon what
they believe in good faith after diligent inquiry to be accurate factual
information and reasonable assumptions. The Projections represent the
Company's and Seller's good faith, best estimates as to the future performance
of the Company.

(o) No Adverse Developments. Except as described
in the Exhibits to this Agreement, neither Seller nor the Company has any
knowledge of any fact, circumstance, condition or event which has or may have
an adverse affect on the Company or Fairway Financial or their current or
contemplated business or business plan.

For the purposes of this Section, "knowledge of" as to Seller means the actual
knowledge of Clark N. Wilson or Audrey Wilson, together with the knowledge that
either would have after diligent inquiry regarding the matter in question, and
"knowledge of" as to the Company means the actual knowledge of any of the
current corporate officers of the Company together with the knowledge that any

Purchaser represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

(a) Authority and Enforceability. Upon the
Closing, all actions on the part of Purchaser necessary for the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, will have been duly and validly taken. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and constitutes a
valid and legally binding obligation of such Purchaser enforceable against
Purchaser in accordance with its terms.

(b) No Registration. Purchaser understands that
the Shares have not been, and will not be at the Closing, registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws, and are being transferred
to Purchaser in reliance upon federal and state exemptions for transactions not
involving any public offering.

(c) No Brokers. Except for Barry Clark and Bill
Kochwelp, no person or any other entity is entitled to any brokerage
commission, finder's fee or like payment in connection

<PAGE> 12
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, due to any agreement,
engagement or representation made by or on behalf of Purchaser.

3.3 Remaking and Survival of Representations and
Warranties. Each of the representation and warranties of the parties set forth
in this Article III shall be remade on the Closing Date by a certificate
delivered by Seller to Purchaser as to the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.1, and a certificate by Purchaser to Seller as to the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2. Seller shall not take
any action or refrain from taking any action that will cause any of Seller's
representations or warranties set forth in Section 3.1 to be untrue or
inaccurate at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing. The
representations and warranties of the parties set forth in this Article III
shall survive the Closing.

ARTICLE IV
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

4.1 Purchaser's Due Diligence. Seller and the Company
shall provide Purchaser and its agents with full access to all of the Company's
books, records, property, employees and agents for the Purchaser's purposes of
investigating and conducting due diligence regarding the Company's assets,
liabilities and business operations, and Seller and the Company and its
employees and agents shall fully cooperate with Purchaser in its
investigations, both before and after the Closing Date. In connection with
Purchaser's due diligence, Purchaser shall be entitled to conduct a full audit
of the Company since its inception by Arthur Andersen or another certified
public accountancy firm selected by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to
Seller, and Seller and the Company agree to cause all of its employees and
agents to cooperate fully in connection with such audit. The cost of the audit
shall be paid by Purchaser; provided, however, that if the Closing occurs,
one-half of the cost of the audit shall be borne by Seller and one-half by the
Company, and if the audit reveals that the net income of the Company for any
year, as reflected in the Financial Statements, is inaccurate by more than five
percent (5%), Seller shall pay the entire cost of the audit. If Purchaser
discovers during its investigations of the Company matters which may be of
concern to Purchaser in its sole and absolute discretion, Purchaser may give
Seller written notice of termination of this Agreement at any time prior to the
Closing, in which event neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any further
rights or obligations under this Agreement except as to breaches or other
matters occurring prior to such termination. Purchaser's obligations under
this Agreement are expressly contingent upon approval of this Agreement and all
transactions contemplated hereby by Purchaser's Board of Directors in its sole
and absolute discretion.

<PAGE> 13
4.2 Continued Operation of the Company. Seller shall not
permit the Company to undergo any material change in its operations,
indebtedness or other liabilities and shall not permit the Company to transfer
any assets or any right or interest therein except for cash sales of homes
individually in the ordinary course of business. In addition, since September
1, 1994 Seller has not accepted, and Seller shall not accept, any payments from
the Company, whether by the way of dividends, repayments of debt, salary or
otherwise, or permit the Company to make any payments to any other party,
except for continued payments of regular salaries to existing employees
(provided that Clark Wilson's salary shall not exceed $20,000 per month after
September 1, 1994) and required payments to lenders, subcontractors, material
suppliers and other vendors of the Company under existing agreements, in each
case, as they become due and payable, all as set forth in the Schedule of
Expenses included in attached Exhibit I.

4.3 Non-Dilution. Prior to the earlier of the Closing or
December 1, 1994, Seller shall not, voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation
of law, assign or transfer any of the Shares, and Seller and the Company shall
not permit the Company to issue any additional stock or other equity interest
in the Company or otherwise take any steps which would dilute the Shares. In
any event, 100% of the stock or other equity interest in the Company and in
Fairway Financial shall be subject to this Agreement and Purchaser's rights
hereunder to acquire all of the stock and other equity interest in the Company
and in Fairway Financial at the Closing for the Purchase Price.

4.4 Tax Elections and Reporting. Purchaser shall have
the right to make the election under Internal Revenue Code Section 338(h)(10)
(which election shall be effective as of any date from September 1, 1994
through the Closing Date as elected by Purchaser within the time period
permitted by applicable law or regulation) to treat this transaction as an
asset sale for tax purposes, and Seller agrees to join in any federal or state
elections or other documents relating thereto and otherwise cooperate as
reasonably requested by Purchaser in order to give effect to such election.
Purchaser and Seller agree and acknowledge that, upon the Closing, the purchase
and sale between Seller and Purchaser shall be recorded in the books and
records of the Company utilizing push-down accounting (including all
consideration being considered inter-company debt). The excess of the Purchase
Price over the net assets acquired (i.e., goodwill) will be amortized ratably
over a five-year period. Seller and Purchaser further acknowledge that, after
the Closing, the net income of the Company for all purposes under this
Agreement shall be determined under generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") after giving effect to the push-down accounting described above.
Seller specifically acknowledges that the tax elections described above will
have the effect of increasing state and federal income and franchise taxes, at
both

9
<PAGE> 14
the Company and Seller level, above what would otherwise be owing if such
elections were not made, and that Seller agrees to pay all such amounts.

4.5 Indemnity by Seller. The parties acknowledge that
the Company currently has (and has had in the past) projects in various stages
of completion, including lots subject to option but not yet purchased, owned
lots, units under construction, completed units in inventory, completed units
subject to reservations or purchase agreements and units already sold and
subject to warranty claims and other potential claims for defects in materials
and workmanship, breaches of contracts, etc. (collectively, "Sales Claims").
Seller hereby agrees to indemnify Purchaser and the Company and Fairway
Financial and their respective officers, employees, directors and other agents,
and hold them harmless and defend them (by counsel selected by them reasonably
acceptable to Seller) from and against any and all claims, demands,
liabilities, liens, costs, expenses, penalties, damages and losses, including,
but not limited to, attorneys' fees and court costs actually and reasonably
incurred by Purchaser and arising out of (i) Sales Claims relating to any
dwelling unit sold by the Company prior to the Closing Date or any transaction
relating to any such dwelling unit, (ii) any breach of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller or the Company or Fairway
Financial contained in this Agreement, specifically including refund of any
amounts received by Seller in violation of Section 4.2 and the representations
as to the adequacy of reserves (i.e., zero reserves) as set forth in the
Company's August 31, 1994 financial statements (even if the damaged party knew,
had reason to know or is deemed to know of any such breach at the time of the
Closing Date), (iii) any federal, state or local income, franchise, employment,
workers' compensation, property or other tax or similar imposition against
Seller or the Company or Fairway Financial required to be paid or withheld, but
not so paid or withheld, prior to the Closing Date or payable by Seller in
connection with the transactions under this Agreement (including the increased
taxes described at the end of Section 4.4), (iv) any disputes or claims,
whether in contract or tort or otherwise, pertaining to the Company or Fairway
Financial any asset or liability of the Company or Fairway Financial occurring,
or arising out of any event occurring, prior to the Closing Date, including,
but not limited to, all claims of contractors, subcontractors, materials
suppliers, governmental entities or agencies, neighboring landowners,
predecessors in interest, employees, former employees, employees of
Administaff, utilities companies, consultants and others, (v) any claims which
may arise out of any substance, material or waste which is or becomes
designated, classified or regulated as being "toxic" or "hazardous" or a
"pollutant" under any applicable federal, state or local law or regulation
(specifically including, but not limited to, asbestos, petroleum, and petroleum
products, PCBs and radioactive substances) which may be located in, on or under
any

10
<PAGE> 15
property owned by the Seller or the Company or Fairway Financial as of the
Closing Date (or after the Closing Date but due to events occurring prior to
the Closing Date), and (vi) any other liability or obligation of the Company or
Fairway Financial or Seller relating to the Company or Fairway Financial
accruing, or arising out of any event occurring, prior to the Closing Date,
except for liabilities contained in the Financial Statements or described in
attached Exhibits F, G or H attached hereto. Since it is possible that a claim
indemnified pursuant to the provisions of this Section may not be known prior
to the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser specifically acknowledge that, in
addition to Purchaser's rights to collect damages or pursue other remedies
available under applicable law, Purchaser will have a right to offset against
amounts otherwise owing under the Note any amount that may become owing by
Seller to Purchaser pursuant to this Section or otherwise under this Agreement
(specifically including any amounts by which the reserves specified in the
Addendum to the Financial Statements are not sufficient to cover the expenses
and liabilities identified in the Financial Statements and Addendum). Such
right of offset by Purchaser shall not limit the extent of Seller's liability
under this Section or any other provision of this Agreement.

4.6 Payoff of Company's Indebtedness. Seller and
Purchaser acknowledge that the Company is a borrower under several loans
described in Exhibit J attached hereto ("the Project Loans"). Seller and
Purchaser agree that, upon the Closing, Purchaser shall make loans to the
Company as necessary to repay in full all of the Project Loans, each of which
loans by Purchaser (the "Purchaser Loans") shall be on substantially identical
terms and conditions as the corresponding existing Project Loan (including
first-priority deeds of trust and other security), except that (i) the loan
terms may be modified at Purchaser's option as may be determined by Purchaser's
Executive Committee to be appropriate to make such terms consistent or
coordinate with the existing or contemplated future operations or indebtedness
of Purchaser or its other affiliates (ii) the interest rate under each
Purchaser Loan (and all other advances of the Company to Purchaser or its
affiliates from time to time) shall be 13.5%, (iii) without limiting Seller's
obligations pursuant to this Agreement, Seller shall not be required to give
any guaranty or indemnities with respect to the Purchaser Loans, and (iv)
notwithstanding the repayment schedules under the Project Loans, repayment of
each Purchaser Loan shall be accomplished by payment of all net proceeds from
sales of units within the corresponding project until such Purchaser Loan is
repaid in full (subject to earlier payment required as a condition to
enforcement of remedies under the Stock Pledge Agreement as set forth in the
Stock Pledge Agreement). Concurrently with the Closing, the Company shall use
the Purchaser Loans to repay in full all of the Project Loans. To the extent
the Purchaser Loans are not evidenced by loan documents at the time of the
Closing, Purchaser shall have the

11
<PAGE> 16
right to cause the Company to enter into documents thereafter to carry out the
provisions of this Section.

4.7 Covenants Not to Compete. Without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, neither Clark Wilson nor Audrey Wilson shall directly or
indirectly (whether through any partnership which Clark Wilson or Audrey Wilson
is a partner, as a consultant, through a trust of which Clark Wilson or Audrey
Wilson is a beneficiary or trustee, through a corporation or other association
in which Clark Wilson or Audrey Wilson has any interest, legal or equitable, or
as an employee or in any other capacity whatsoever) engage in the businesses of
acquisition, ownership, development, construction or sale of dwelling units in
any county in the United States in which Purchaser or the Company may conduct
business from time to time. Clark Wilson's and Audrey Wilson's covenants not
to compete shall extend for five (5) years as to Travis, Williamson, Hays,
Harris, Montgomery, Liberty, Waller, Brazoria, Fort Bend, Dallas, Tarrant,
Denton, Collin, Ellis, Rockwall or Bexar County, Texas, and for three (3) years
as to any other county in the United States in which Purchaser or the Company
conducts business from time to time, such period as to each of Clark Wilson and
Audrey Wilson being measured from the date on which he or she, respectively,
ceases to be engaged by the Company or Purchaser or any affiliates as an
employee or independent contractor and continuing until three or five years (as
specified above) after the date on which both Clark Wilson and Audrey Wilson
and all affiliated parties (i.e., any member of Clark Wilson's or Audrey
Wilson's immediate family or any partnership, corporation, trust or other
association in which Clark Wilson or Audrey Wilson or any member of their
immediate family has a legal or equitable interest) are no longer engaged by
the Company or Purchaser or any affiliates as an employee or independent
contractor. In addition to the foregoing, during the same periods neither
Clark Wilson nor Audrey Wilson shall hire, solicit for hire, or otherwise
engage in any business transaction with, any current or future employee of the
Company, whether as an employee, associate, partner, consultant or other
business relation. Clark Wilson and Audrey Wilson and Purchaser agree that
the duration and area as to which Clark Wilson's and Audrey Wilson's covenant
not to compete and nonsolicitation covenant are to be effective are reasonable
and directly relate to providing Purchaser with the reasonable benefits of its
bargain as to the value of the Shares and to the Company's ability to be
reasonably profitable in the future. In the event that any court determines
that Clark Wilson's or Audrey Wilson's covenant not to compete or
nonsolicitation covenant is unreasonable and unenforceable as to time period or
area, or both, Clark Wilson and Audrey Wilson and Purchaser agree that Clark
Wilson's and Audrey Wilson's covenants shall remain in full force and effect
for the greatest time period and in the greatest area that does not render the
covenants unenforceable. Clark Wilson and Audrey Wilson and Purchaser intend
that Clark Wilson's and Audrey Wilson's covenant not to compete and
nonsolicitation

12
<PAGE> 17
covenant each shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants, one for
each and every county described above in this Section.

4.8 Confidentiality. Except as otherwise required by
law, Seller and the Company and all of their respective agents and employees
and the Company shall keep strictly confidential all information and
documentation relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the fact that such transactions are contemplated), and shall not
disclose any information or documentation relating to such transactions to any
person or entity other than those employees or agents of the Company to the
extent that such disclosure is necessary to permit the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the Closing does not occur,
the foregoing provisions of this Section will continue in force in perpetuity.
Upon the Closing, if it occurs, the form and content of all press releases or
other public communications by or on behalf of Seller or the Company shall be
subject to the approval of Purchaser, and, except as otherwise required by law,
Seller and the Company and their respective agents and employees shall continue
to keep the terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement strictly confidential and shall not disclose them to any person or
entity other than private communications to Seller's or the Company's
attorneys, accountants and other parties to the extent they reasonably need to
know such information.

4.9 Employment of Clark Wilson. Purchaser agrees that,
upon the Closing, the Company shall employ or shall cause Administaff to employ
Clark Wilson as the President of the Company to serve in such capacity at the
pleasure of the Board of Directors of the Company on a month-to-month basis for
so long as the Board desires. Clark Wilson's employment shall be full-time
employment, and Seller shall not engage in any business activities during such
employment that require Seller to expend more than five (5) hours per week of
Seller's time. Further, so long as either Seller or Audrey Wilson is employed
for the Company's account, neither Seller nor Audrey Wilson shall become a
partner, shareholder, member, officer, director, agent, consultant or other
independent contractor in, or otherwise invest in, or lend money to, any
enterprise engaged in residential development, building, lending, brokerage,
sales or leasing or any business in which the Company or Purchaser or its
affiliates may be engaged from time to time. The employment of Clark Wilson
shall be on a strictly at-will basis, and neither this Agreement nor any other
written or oral communication shall be interpreted to be an employment
agreement or any commitment by Purchaser or the Company to continue the
employment of Clark Wilson for any period of time. Until the Board of
Directors of the Company shall determine otherwise, Clark Wilson shall be paid
$20,000 per month in salary. The other terms and conditions of Clark Wilson's
employment, including benefits, hours, vacation,

13
<PAGE> 18
policies and procedures, etc., shall be consistent with those of other Company
executives from time to time. In addition, so long as Clark Wilson is employed
as the President of the Company, then (i) until the Note is paid in full, the
Company shall allocate 3% of its before-tax net income (calculated as set forth
in Section 4.4) for each fiscal year to a bonus pool to be distributed among
the employees (other than Clark Wilson) engaged for the Company's account as
determined in the reasonable discretion of Clark Wilson, as President, and (ii)
after the Note is paid in full, the Company shall allocate 10% of its
before-tax net income (calculated as set forth in Section 4.4) for each fiscal
year to a bonus pool to be distributed among the employees (including Clark
Wilson) engaged for the Company's account as determined in the reasonable
discretion of Clark Wilson, as President. The provisions of this Section are
intended for the mutual benefit of Buyer and Seller, and no past, present or
future employee of the Company or Administaff (or any other person or entity
engaged in work for the Company) shall be considered a third-party beneficiary
to the provisions of this Section or any other provision of this Agreement.
