REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders
Industrial Retaining Ring Company

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of INDUSTRIAL
RETAINING RING COMPANY AND AFFILIATES as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related combined statements of operations, cash flows and owners' equity for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Industrial
Retaining Ring Company and Affiliates as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
their results of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

INDUSTRIAL RETAINING RING COMPANY AND AFFILIATES

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 - Summary of significant accounting policies:
Principles of combination:
The accompanying combined financial statements include
the accounts of Industrial Retaining Ring Company ("IRR")
and its affiliates, Retainers, Inc. ("Retainers") and
Industrial Advertising ("Advertising"), all of which are
owned by members of the same family. Accordingly, the
financial statements have been combined on the basis of
common ownership and control. As used herein, the
"Company" refers to IRR, Retainers and Advertising,
collectively. IRR engages in the manufacture and sale of
metal retaining rings to customers located primarily
throughout the United States. Retainers leases real
property to IRR and Advertising provides services to IRR.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in combination.

Concentrations of credit risk:
Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of cash and trade accounts receivable. The
Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts
which, at times, may exceed Federally insured limits.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
receivables are limited due to the large number of
customers comprising IRR's customer base, their
disposition across different geographic areas, and
generally short payment terms. In addition, IRR routinely
assesses the financial strength of its customers.

Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out basis) or market.

Depreciation:
Provision is made for depreciation of property, equipment
and improvements on straight-line and declining balance
methods by annual charges to operations calculated to
absorb costs of assets over their estimated useful lives.

Income taxes:
IRR has elected to be treated as an "S" Corporation under
the applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code and
files a separate "S" Corporation tax return on a calendar
year basis. Under these sections, corporate income or
loss, in general, is allocated to the stockholders for
inclusion in their personal income tax returns.
Advertising files a separate partnership tax return on a
calendar year basis. Accordingly, there is no provision
for Federal income tax related to IRR and Advertising in
the accompanying combined financial statements. Retainers
files a separate "C" Corporation Federal income tax
return with a fiscal year end of June 30.

INDUSTRIAL RETAINING RING COMPANY AND AFFILIATES

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 - Summary of significant accounting policies (concluded):
Change in accounting method:
In January 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," ("FAS 109"). The adoption of FAS 109
changed the Company's method of accounting for income
taxes from the deferred method to an asset and liability
approach. Previously, the Company deferred the past
effects of timing differences between financial reporting
and taxable income. The asset and liability approach
requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be
computed annually for differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that
will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the
future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to
the periods in which the differences are expected to
affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are
established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets
to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense
is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or
minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets
and liabilities.

The adoption of FAS 109 has been applied prospectively.
The cumulative effect of the change in the method of
accounting for income taxes on years prior to 1993 is not
material.

Interim unaudited financial information:
The financial information included herein as of June 30,
1994 and for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and 1993
is unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflects
all adjustments (which include only normal recurring
accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the
Company's combined financial position as of that date and
the combined results of operations for those periods.

Note 2 - Inventories:

Note 5 - Employee benefit plan:
IRR maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
covering all full-time eligible employees. Benefits begin to
vest after one year of service and are based on years of
service and average annual earnings as defined by the plan.

IRR's policy is to fund pension costs by contributing
annually at least the minimum amount required by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

pension expense for each of the years in the period ended
December 31, 1993 was 8%. The assumed rate of increases in
future compensation levels was 6%.

Note 7 - State income tax:
The disproportion provision for state income tax for the six
months ended June 30, 1994 is due to the election by IRR,
effective January 1, 1994, to be treated as an "S"
Corporation for New Jersey state income tax purposes.

Deferred state tax assets, resulting from temporary
differences attributable to the capitalization of certain
inventory overhead costs, and deferred state tax
liabilities, resulting primarily from temporary differences
attributable to depreciation, are not material.

Note 8 - Subsequent event:
Effective August 31, 1994, the Company's
stockholders/partners sold all of the common shares of IRR
and Retainers and the net assets of Advertising for cash and
other consideration.
