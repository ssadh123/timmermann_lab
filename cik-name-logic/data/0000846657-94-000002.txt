Item 5 Other Events

On February 3, 1994, Eljer Industries, Inc. (the "Company") announced that
the federal appeals court in Chicago affirmed substantially all of a previously-
announced arbitration award in favor of Kowin Development Company and against
the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Eljer Manufacturing, Inc ("Eljer
Manufacturing"). The appeals court vacated a portion of the damages award in
the amount of $1 million which, together with the Company's estimate of
approximately $725,000 of associated interest charges, will reduce the
aggregate award of damages, interest and attorneys' fees from approximately
$13.2 million to approximately $11.5 million. The Company previously posted
$13.2 million cash in lieu of an appeal bond against any payments it might
ultimately owe in this litigation. The arbitration award were included in a
charge against earnings in 1992.

The arbitration concerned claims against Household Manufacturing, Inc.
("Household"), the predecessor to Eljer Manufacturing, relating to a failed
joint venture in the People's Republic of China to manufacture and sell files.
Household's interest was sold in 1988. The claims do not involve any of Eljer
Manufacturing's current business operations.

The Company is currently analyzing the appeals court decision and is
seeking reimbursement for this arbitration award from Household.

The press released dated February 3, 1994, describing the above is filed as
