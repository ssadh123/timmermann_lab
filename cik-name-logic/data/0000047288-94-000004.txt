Item 5. Other Events.

On January 12, 1994, the Registrant announced that it had
signed a new data processing contract with Systematics Financial
Services, Inc., a provider of software development and data
processing services to the banking industry worldwide. The new
contract will begin in early 1995 and is expected to provide
substantial savings in the Registrant's data processing costs over
its eight-year term. The Registrant recorded a $12.0 million non-
recurring charge in the fourth quarter of 1993 to reflect costs
associated with this change in vendors and related software.

The Registrant also announced on January 12, 1994 that it had
recorded a $17.5 million negative provision for loan losses in the
fourth quarter of 1993, resulting in a full-year negative provision
of $6.2 million.
