Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

a) On October 7, 1994, Noble Drilling Corporation (the "Company")
dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP ("Arthur Andersen") as the principal
independent accountants for the Company.

b) Arthur Andersen's report on the Company's financial statements for
either of the past two years did not contain an adverse opinion or a
disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

c) The decision to change accountants was recommended by the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and approved by the
full Board of Directors.

d) During the Company's two most recently-completed fiscal years and the
subsequent interim period preceding such dismissal, there were no
disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of
Arthur Andersen, would have caused it to make a reference to the
subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report.

e) No "reportable events" (as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v)
of Regulation S-K) occurred during the Company's two most
recently-completed fiscal years and the subsequent interim period
preceding Arthur Andersen's dismissal.

f) On October 7, 1994, the Company engaged Price Waterhouse LLP ("Price
Waterhouse") as the principal independent accountants to audit 
the financial statements of the Company. During the Company's two 
most recently-completed fiscal years and the subsequent interim 
period preceding such engagement, Price Waterhouse was not consulted 
by the Company (or anyone on behalf of the Company) regarding any of 
the matters requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 304(a)(2) of 
Regulation S-K.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

c) Exhibits

16 Letter from Arthur Andersen to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
