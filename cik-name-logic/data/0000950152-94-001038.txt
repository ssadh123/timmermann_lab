3. CONSIDERATION FOR THE ACQUIRED ASSETS

3.1 CONSIDERATION. As consideration for the
Acquired Assets and the covenant not to compete in Section 12, Fabri-Centers
will cause FCA Ohio to assume and agree to pay and discharge, to satisfy in
full without any recourse to Sellers, and to hold Sellers harmless and
indemnify Sellers from and against, the Assumed Liabilities and pay Cloth World
cash in an amount equal to the Net LIFO Book Value of Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries as of the Time of Closing (as defined in Section 3.6). To this
end, at the Time of Closing, Fabri-Centers will cause FCA Ohio to assume the
Assumed Liabilities and to:

(a) Pay to Cloth World $61,000,000 by delivery
of a bank check drawn on a bank in St. Louis, Missouri; and

(b) Deposit $1,000,000 with a bank in St. Louis,
Missouri that is reasonably satisfactory to both parties, as Escrow
Agent (the "Escrow Agent"), pursuant to an Escrow Agreement
substantially in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit
3.1(b).

The amount payable under clause (a) will be reconciled with the Net LIFO Book
Value as of the Time of Closing in accordance with Sections 3.2 through 3.6.
The consideration, as adjusted, will be allocated among the Acquired Assets and
the covenant not to compete on the basis set forth in the Allocation Schedule
attached to this Agreement as Schedule 3.1.

3.2 CLOSING DATE STATEMENT. As soon as practicable
following the Time of Closing (and in no event later that 60 days following the
Time of Closing), Brown Group will cause to be prepared and deliver to
Fabri-Centers an audited consolidated balance sheet of Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries as of the Time of Closing (the "Closing Date Statement"), as well
as audited consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows of Cloth World
and the Subsidiaries for the period from January 29, 1994 to the Time of
Closing. These financial statements will be audited by Ernst & Young, a
nationally recognized firm of

8

Page 17 of 196
<PAGE> 13
certified public accountants; Ernst & Young will not, however, be required to
sign its audit report until after the resolution of any dispute pursuant to
Section 3.5. Fabri-Centers' representatives will be consulted with respect to
the planning and scope of the audit. The Closing Date Statement will be based
upon the books and records of Brown Group and Cloth World and prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
consistent with the audited consolidated balance sheet of Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries as of January 29, 1994 (the "January 1994 Balance Sheet"), except
that (a) the value of Inventory will be determined on a LIFO basis in
accordance with Section 3.3, (b) the amount of accruals for prorated charges
will be determined in accordance with Section 3.4, and (c) Retained Assets and
Retained Liabilities will be excluded. Brown Group will provide Fabri-Centers
with sufficient detail to enable Fabri-Centers to reconcile the Schedules used
in delineating the Acquired Assets, Retained Assets, Assumed Liabilities, and
Retained Liabilities (e.g., the Tangible Personal Property List, Owned Real
Property List, Personal Property Lease List, Security and Other Deposits List,
Proprietary Rights List, and Retained Assets List) with the Closing Date
Statement.

3.3 INVENTORY COUNT; VALUATION AND OBSOLESCENCE
RESERVE. Brown Group will take a physical count of the Inventory in all stores
and the Warehouse (except for stores already counted subsequent to May 20,
1994) in accordance with the Inventory Instructions attached to this Agreement
as Schedule 3.3(a). Fabri-Center's representatives will be permitted to
observe and perform reasonable testing of the count. The count of the
Inventory will occur during the period from the date of this Agreement through
October 1, 1994. The method for valuing the Inventory (using the LIFO method
of accounting) and determining the amount of the obsolescence reserve will be
in accordance with the past practices and procedures of Cloth World as
illustrated in the Inventory Materials attached to this Agreement as Schedule
3.3(b).

3.4 PRORATED CHARGES. All rent (including
percentage rent), common area charges, utility charges, fuel charges, and other
obligations under the Store Leases, Personal Property Leases, and Executory
Contracts will be prorated as of the Time of Closing (the "Prorated Charges")
and reflected in the Closing Date Statement and supported by a list showing the
amount owed under each of the Store Leases, Personal Property Leases, and
Executory Contracts. The accrual for the percentage rent, if any, due under
each Store Lease will be determined by multiplying (a) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the gross sales for the Store from the first day of the
current lease year to the Time of Closing and the denominator of which is the
projected annual gross sales at that Store for the current lease year, by (b)
the

9

Page 18 of 196
<PAGE> 14
total projected percentage rent for the current lease year under the Store
Lease. The projected annual gross sales and the projected percentage rent for
the current lease year under each Store Lease will be delivered to Buyers at
the Time of Closing.

3.5 REVIEW OF CLOSING DATE STATEMENT; RESOLUTION OF
ANY DISPUTE. Following receipt of the Closing Date Statement, Fabri-Centers
will be afforded a period of 30 days to review the Closing Date Statement and
to complete a review of any work papers prepared in connection with the
preparation or audit of the Closing Date Statement. At or before the end of
the 30-day review period, Fabri-Centers will either (a) accept the Closing Date
Statement in its entirety or (b) deliver to Brown Group written notice
identifying the items in the Closing Date Statement that Fabri-Centers
disputes. If Fabri-Centers does not deliver any such written notice within the
30-day review period, Fabri-Centers will be deemed to have accepted the
Closing Date Statement. Within a period of 14 days from the end of the 30-day
review period, the parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any disputed
items. If they are unable to do so, the remaining disputed items will be
referred to the St. Louis, Missouri offices of Price Waterhouse, a nationally
recognized firm of certified public accountants, for resolution. The parties
will share equally the cost of the certified public accountants. The book
value of the disputed items, as determined by the certified public accountants,
will be binding on the parties.

3.6 PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. If the consolidated
net book value of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries shown in the Closing Date
Statement, after the resolution of any dispute pursuant to Section 3.5, (the
"Net LIFO Book Value") is less than $62,000,000, FCA Ohio will have the right
to recover, from funds on deposit with the Escrow Agent, the amount by which
$62,000,000 exceeds the Net LIFO Book Value, together with interest. To the
extent that the funds on deposit with the Escrow Agent are not sufficient to
pay the full amount due to FCA Ohio, Cloth World will pay the balance due to
FCA Ohio, together with interest. If the Net LIFO Book Value is more than
$62,000,000, FCA Ohio will pay to Cloth World the amount by which the Net LIFO
Book Value exceeds $62,000,000, together with interest, and all funds on
deposit with the Escrow Agent will be remitted to Cloth World. Interest will
accrue, from the Time of Closing to the date of payment, at a rate equal to the
average monthly LIBOR plus 75 basis points. Any such payment will be payable
by check delivered within 5 business days after (a) the acceptance by
Fabri-Centers of the Closing Date Statement or (b) the resolution of any
dispute pursuant to Section 3.5, as the case may be.

formerly owned, leased, or operated by Cloth World or any of the Subsidiaries

environmental permits, laws, rules, regulations, and orders of Governmental
Entities. No Governmental Entity has made, issued, filed in any court, or
threatened to make, issue, or file in any court, any notice of liability,
notice of violation, demand, claim, request for information, lien, citation,
summons, complaint, or order regarding an alleged violation of any such
permits, laws, rules, regulations, or orders.

ground storage tanks in violation of law are located at any real property now

Schedule lists all insurance policies and bonds obtained by Sellers and in
force with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Business and, for each such
policy, identifies the insurer, type of coverage, policy limits and
deductibles, and expiration date. All such policies are in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms, will remain in such full
force and effect to the Time of Closing, and are believed to be sufficient in
all material respects for compliance by Cloth World and the Subsidiaries with
all applicable requirements of law and of all agreements to which any of them
is a party.

4.24 SUPPLIERS. Section 4.24 of the Disclosure
Schedule identifies each supplier from which Cloth World and the Subsidiaries

engage in any of the transactions referred to in Section 4.8 without
the prior written consent of Fabri-Centers.

(c) BUSINESS POLICIES. Neither Cloth World nor any
of the Subsidiaries will change in any material respect any of their
business policies, including but not limited to advertising, pricing,
promotional, purchasing, inventory, and personnel policies, without
the prior written consent of Fabri-Centers. Without limiting the
foregoing, neither Cloth World nor any of the Subsidiaries will
mark-down retail prices except in accordance with existing pricing
policies applied on a basis consistent with past practices. Cloth
World will from time to time upon its reasonable request advise
Fabri-Centers of, and consult with Fabri-Centers regarding, the types,
mix, and quantities of inventory that it intends to maintain in the
Stores through the end of the current fiscal year.

(d) STORE LEASES, PERSONAL PROPERTY LEASES, AND

of this Agreement until the Time of Closing, Brown Group will (a) permit
Fabri-Centers and its representatives to review the books and records relating
to Cloth World, the Subsidiaries, and the Business and furnish such additional
financial and

26

Page 35 of 196
<PAGE> 31
operating information relating thereto as Fabri-Centers may reasonably request
and (b) cause Cloth World and the Subsidiaries to permit authorized
representatives of Fabri-Centers, at mutually agreeable times, to inspect the
Stores and to interview key officers and employees of Cloth World and the
Subsidiaries. All of Fabri-Center's investigations will be conducted in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Brown Group's normal business
activities. Fabri-Centers agrees to treat all proprietary information received
from Brown Group, Cloth World, and the Subsidiaries as confidential.

6.3 TRAINING OF PERSONNEL. Prior to the Time of
Closing, Brown Group will cause Cloth World and the Subsidiaries to permit
Fabri-Centers and its representatives to enter the Stores and to train
employees of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries in the operation of
Fabri-Center's point-of-sale cash registers and in other procedures practiced

the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the
extent requested by Fabri-Centers, Brown Group and Cloth World will use all
reasonable efforts to assist in obtaining a waiver or modification of all
Radius Clauses to the extent that they would result in an increase in rentals
due to the proximity of Stores owned or operated by Fabri-Centers or any of its
affiliates. Fabri-Centers will control the discussions with landlords
regarding any such waiver or modification; neither Brown Group, Cloth World,
nor any of the Subsidiaries will, without the prior written consent of
Fabri-Centers, agree to an increase in the rents, to any other material change
in the terms of any Store Lease, or to any payment to landlords in connection
with any such waiver or modification.

27

Page 36 of 196
<PAGE> 32
6.6 STORE LEASE CONSENTS.

(a) In connection with the sale and transfer of the
Store Leases in accordance with Section 1.1(c), Brown Group, Cloth
World, and Fabri-Centers will use all reasonable efforts to obtain all
Store Lease Consents prior to the Time of Closing. Notwithstanding
any such sale and transfer of the Store Leases hereunder, neither
Brown Group nor Cloth World will transfer any Store Lease hereunder
unless the related Store Lease Consent is obtained. If and to the
extent necessary to obtain any such Store Lease Consent, Fabri-Centers
will provide the landlord with all financial and business information
about Fabri-Centers reasonably requested by such landlord or of a type
previously furnished by Fabri-Centers to its own landlords.
Fabri-Centers will control the discussions with landlords regarding
the Store Lease Consents and, if necessary, regarding the cost of
terminating any Store Lease that cannot be transferred to FCA Ohio;
neither Brown Group, Cloth World, nor any of the Subsidiaries will,
without the prior written consent of Fabri-Centers, agree to an
increase in the rents, to any other material change in the terms of
any Store Lease, or to any payment to landlords in connection with the
termination of any Store Leases that cannot be transferred.

(b) In the event that Fabri-Centers, in order to
secure a Store Lease Consent agrees to an increase in rents or makes a
lump sum or other payment to the landlord, in either case for the
remaining current lease term only, Fabri-Centers and Brown Group will
each pay one half (1/2) of the cost, subject to the overall
limitations upon Sellers' obligations for Capped Liabilities set forth
in Section 6.9. For this purpose, the cost of any increase in rents
will be expressed as a present value, calculated using a discount rate
equal to 175 basis points in excess of the yield to maturity on the
average US Treasury security having a duration equal to the lease
duration, and settled in cash as soon as the amount is calculated.

(c) In the event of the failure to obtain one or
more Store Lease Consents prior to the Time of Closing, Brown Group
and Cloth World will continue for a period of eighteen (18) months
thereafter to use all reasonable efforts to obtain the Store Lease
Consents as soon as practicable. Until these Store Lease Consents are
obtained or upon the expiration of such

28

Page 37 of 196
<PAGE> 33
period, whichever is earlier, Brown Group and Cloth World will
(i) to the extent they are legally able to do so, consider FCA Ohio a
sublessee under any such Store Leases and make available to FCA Ohio
any benefits Brown Group or Cloth World receives, will receive, or
are available to Brown Group or Cloth World under such Store Leases, 
or (ii) cooperate reasonably in devising another lawful arrangement 
for transferring to FCA Ohio such benefits of the related Store
Leases, including, in the case of Store Leases transferred into or
held by Subsidiaries, the transfer to FCA Ohio of the capital stock of
the Subsidiaries. If, notwithstanding these efforts, one or more
Store Lease Consents are not obtained and the parties are unable to
devise another arrangement for transferring to FCA Ohio the benefits
of the related Store Leases, Brown Group will remain (as between
itself and the landlord or landlords in question) as primary obligor
under the Store Leases and, subject to the overall limitations upon
Sellers' obligations for Capped Liabilities set forth in Section 6.9, 
pay future rents, the costs of terminating the Store Leases, the costs
of any associated litigation, and all other amounts due under the
Store Leases ("Store Lease Liabilities").

(d) Sellers' obligations with respect to the Store
Leases will be limited to the foregoing undertakings. There will be
no adjustment in the purchase price as a result of any failure or
failures on the part of Buyers to have received a Store Lease Consent
or any right of occupancy or use of any property under a Store Lease.

(e) Any other term or provision in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, at such time as Sellers have paid the
Aggregate Cap (as defined in Section 6.9) for the Capped Liabilities
(as defined in Section 6.9), Buyers will pay, discharge, satisfy in
full without any recourse to Sellers, and indemnify and hold Sellers
harmless from and against, any and all remaining liabilities with
repect to the Store Leases, including without limitation the Store
Lease Liabilities, although Buyers will not be deemed thereby to have
assumed any Store Leases for which the requisite Store Lease Consents
have not been obtained.

6.7 DIVESTITURE OF ANY STORES REQUIRED TO OBTAIN
GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. In the event that the divestiture of one or more of
the Stores is required in order to obtain any governmental approval required
for the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including but not limited to approval by the Federal Trade Commission or the

29

Page 38 of 196
<PAGE> 34
Justice Department of the United States ("Required Divestitures"),
Fabri-Centers will carry out the divestiture in a manner that it, in its
judgment, considers to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances;
Fabri-Centers will not, however, be required to take, or cause to be taken, any
action that would result in divestitures or other conditions or requirements
that Fabri-Centers, in its reasonable judgment, deems to be materially
burdensome. At the time each such Store is divested, Brown Group will, subject
to the overall limitations upon Sellers' ogligations for Capped Liabilities set
forth in Section 6.9, pay to FCA Ohio one half (1/2) of the amount determined
with respect to that Store using the following formula:

[A times (B / C)] plus D minus E minus F

Where:

A = $62,000,000, adjusted in accordance with Section 3.6.

B = Gross sales at that Store for the fiscal year ended January
29, 1994 (or, if the Store was not open for the full fiscal
year, gross sales at the Store for that fiscal year on an
annualized basis).

C = Gross sales at all of the Stores for the fiscal year ended
January 29, 1994.

D = The costs incurred by Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio in connection
with the divestiture, including any amounts paid in connection
with the transfer of the related Store Lease, associated
attorneys' fees, and other out-of-pocket expenses.

E = The proceeds, if any, realized upon the transfer of the
related Store Lease.

F = The book value of the Inventory at the Store, net of
obsolescence reserve, as of the Time of Closing, as reflected
in the Closing Date Statement.

Any other term or provision in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, Sellers' liability under this Section 6.7 will be
subject to the overall limitations upon Sellers' obligations for Capped
Liabilities set forth in Section 6.9. That is to say, at such time as Sellers
have paid the Aggregate Cap for the Capped Liabilities, Buyers will pay,
discharge, satisfy in full without any recourse to Sellers, and indemnify and
hold Sellers harmless from and against, any and all remaining liabilities with
repect to the Required Divestitures.

30

<PAGE> 35
6.8 SEVERANCE OBLIGATIONS.

(a) TO DONALD RICHEY AND WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEES.
Sellers will retain all obligations and liabilities arising prior to
the Time of Closing that they may have to Mr. Donald Richey and to
employees of Sellers at the Warehouse (other than the manager of the
Warehouse), including any obligation to provide severance pay or other
benefits following termination of employment or the sale of the
Business. These obligations and liabilities will not be subject to
the Aggregate Cap.

(b) TO ALL OTHER EMPLOYEES. Subject to the
provisions of this Section 6.8(b) which follow, Brown Group and Cloth
World will also retain all obligations and liabilities to provide
severance pay to employees of Cloth World and its Subsidiaries other
than Hired Employees, Donald Richey, and the Warehouse employees
referred to in Section 6.8(a), and will reimburse Fabri-Centers and
FCA Ohio for any severance pay that they are required to pay to Hired
Employees whose employment is terminated for any reason within six
months after the Time of Closing ("Capped Severance Obligations"),
subject in each case to the overall limitations upon Sellers'
obligations for Capped Liabilities set forth in Section 6.9. Although
Sellers will administer the payment of all such Capped Severance
Obligations, any other term or provision in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, Sellers' liability under this Section 6.8
will be subject to the overall limitations upon Sellers' obligations
for Capped Liabilities set forth in Section 6.9. That is to say, at
such time as Sellers have paid the Aggregate Cap for the Capped
Liabilities, Buyers will pay, discharge, satisfy in full without any
recourse to Sellers, and indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from and
against, any and all remaining liabilities with repect to the
Severance Obligations.

(c) Sellers will be responsible for and discharge
any and all obligations to Warehouse employees (other than the manager
of the Warehouse) under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act ("WARN"), and Buyers will be responsible for and
discharge any and all obligations under WARN with respect to all other
employees of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries, although Sellers will
provide any notices called for under WARN as directed by Buyers.

6.9 OVERALL LIMITATION ON SELLERS' OBLIGATIONS FOR
CAPPED LIABILITIES. Any other term or provision in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, Sellers' aggregate payment obligations with respect
to Store Lease Liabilities,

31

Page 40 of 196
<PAGE> 36
Required Divestitures, and Capped Severance Obligations ("Capped Liabilities")
will be limited to an overall cap of $1,900,000 (the "Aggregate Cap"). It will
be at Buyers' reasonable discretion which category or categories of expenses
are paid by Sellers in reaching the Aggregate Cap. Once the Aggregate Cap is
reached, Sellers will have no further obligations whatsoever, Buyers will pay
and discharge all liabilities with respect to Store Leases, Required
Divestitures, or Capped Severance Obligations, and Sellers will have no further
obligations whatsoever with respect thereto. Sellers will receive full credit
against the Aggregate Cap for any and all payments they make directly to third
parties in connection with Capped Liabilities.

6.10 ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITS. As soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, FCA Ohio may, at its expense, obtain an
environmental audit by a firm of nationally recognized experts in the field who
are reasonably acceptable to Sellers of any Real Property that it elects to
have audited. If such environmental audit discloses, with respect to any
portion of the Real Property, the presence of Hazardous Substances or other
conditions that violate applicable environmental permits, laws, rules,
regulations, or orders of Governmental Entities, FCA Ohio may elect to exclude
from the Acquired Assets any portion of the Real Property requiring remediation
("Remediation Property"), in which case the Remediation Property will be
excluded from the Closing Date Statement. In such event, Sellers may elect not
to proceed with the sale of any Acquired Assets hereunder and to terminate all
their obligations under this Agreement.

6.11 TRANSITION SERVICES. Effective as of the Time
of Closing, Brown Group and Fabri-Centers will enter into a transition services
agreements providing for warehouse services, computer services, and other
transition services for a reasonable period of time after the closing, but in
no event for longer than six months (the "Transition Services Agreements").
Fabri-Centers will reimburse Brown Group for the direct costs of all employees
who work full time to provide these services, for an agreed upon percentage of
the direct costs of all employees who work part time to provide these services,
and for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, indirect and
overhead expenses (to the extent that such expenses represent a reasonable
allocation of the actual cost of the related services), and incentive expenses
approved by Fabri-Centers that are incurred by Brown Group in providing these
services, including amounts due under the lease of the Warehouse attributable
to the period in which the warehouse services are provided.

7. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATION OF FABRI-CENTERS AND FCA OHIO

The obligation of Fabri-Centers and FCA Ohio to
complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is subject to the
satisfaction, in all material respects, at or before the Time of Closing of the
following conditions:

7.1 PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS. Brown Group and
Cloth World have performed in all material respects all obligations to be
performed by them under this Agreement at or before the Time of Closing.

7.2 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The
representations and warranties made by Brown Group and Cloth World in this
Agreement are true in all material respects at and as of the Time of Closing as
though the representations and warranties had been made at and as of the Time
of Closing.

7.3 NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. Between the date of
this Agreement and the Time of Closing, there has been no material adverse
change in the consolidated financial condition, the consolidated results of
operations, or the Business of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries, it being
understood, however, that any material adverse change proximately resulting
from either a negligent or wrongful act or omission of Buyers or from the
disclosure of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it will not
permit the Buyers to refuse to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

7.4 DUE DILIGENCE CONDITION. In the course of
completing its due diligence investigation, nothing has come to the attention
of Fabri-Centers that causes it reasonably to believe, and it does in fact so
believe (all as evidenced with specificity in resolutions of Buyers' Boards of
Directors promptly delivered to Sellers), that (i) the financial and other
information disclosed to Fabri-Centers before the date of this Agreement does
not represent, in all material respects, the value and financial performance of
Cloth World and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the value of Cloth
World and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, premised on information available
to Fabri-Centers after the date of this Agreement is materially less than the
value of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries premised on information disclosed to
Fabri-Centers before the date of this Agreement.

7.5 FINANCING. Fabri-Centers has obtained
financing, on terms reasonably satisfactory to it, for the cash portion of the
consideration for the Acquired Assets. If this Agreement is terminated due to
the failure by Fabri-Centers to obtain financing, Fabri-Centers will promptly
(and in no event

33

Page 42 of 196
<PAGE> 38
later than 30 days after receipt of an invoice from Sellers) reimburse Brown
Group and Cloth World for all of their document out-of-pocket expenses
(including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of their counsel)
reasonably incurred by them in connection with the negotiation, execution, and
performance of this Agreement or of any other Closing Document or in connection
with the due diligence conducted by Fabri-Centers.

7.6 NO INJUNCTION. No temporary restraining order
or preliminary or final injunction prohibiting the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement has been issued (other than at the
instance of Buyers) and is in effect. No action, suit, proceeding, order, or
investigation (other than at the instance of Buyers) is pending or threatened
before any federal, state, municipal, or other court or Governmental Entity
that, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial condition, the consolidated results of operations, or
the Business of Cloth World and the Subsidiaries or could materially impair the
ability of Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio to operate the Business from and after
the Time of Closing as presently and ordinarily conducted.

7.7 HSR ACT. All applicable pre-merger notification
and waiting period requirements under the HSR Act have been satisfied.

7.8 OTHER THIRD-PARTY CONSENTS AND GOVERNMENTAL
APPROVALS. All third-party consents and governmental approvals required for
the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than

Page 47 of 196
<PAGE> 43
specified above will thereupon expire and will be forever barred.

Indemnification undertakings will expire concurrently
with expiration of the respective covenants, representations, or warranties on
which they are based.

11.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY BROWN GROUP AND CLOTH WORLD.
Subject to Sections 11.1 and 11.5, Brown Group and Cloth World will, jointly
and severally, indemnify Fabri-Centers and FCA Ohio for any claim, loss, cost,
liability, or expense (including attorneys' fees and costs of litigation) that
may be asserted against or incurred by them as a proximate result of (a) the
incorrectness of any of the representations or warranties made by Brown Group
or Cloth World in this Agreement, (b) the breach of any of the covenants made
by Brown Group or Cloth World in this Agreement, or (c) the assertion against
Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio of any of the Retained Liabilities.

11.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY FABRI-CENTERS AND FCA OHIO.
Subject to Sections 11.1 and 11.5, Fabri-Centers and FCA Ohio will, jointly and
severally, indemnify Brown Group, Cloth World, and the Subsidiaries for any
claim, loss, cost, liability, or expense (including attorneys' fees and costs
of litigation) that may be asserted against or incurred by Brown Group or Cloth
World as a proximate result of (a) the incorrectness of any of the
representations or warranties made by Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio in this
Agreement, (b) the breach of any of the covenants made by Fabri-Centers or FCA
Ohio in this Agreement, (c) the assertion against Brown Group, Cloth World, or
the Subsidiaries of any of the Assumed Liabilities or, after Sellers have paid
the Aggregate Cap for the Capped Liabilities, the assertion against Brown
Group, Cloth World, or the Subsidiaries of any of the Capped Liabilities, (d)
any damage or injury proximately resulting from an act or omission of Buyers or
their agents or employees while on Sellers' premises in connection with any due
diligence investigation or training activity prior to the Time of Closing.

11.4 NOTICE AND DEFENSE OF CLAIMS. A party (the
"Asserting Party") claiming indemnification under this Agreement, including
indemnification under Section 2.1, 3.1, 6.9, or 11 of this Agreement, will
promptly notify in writing the party from whom indemnification is being sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") of the nature and basis of the claim for
indemnification; the failure to give any such notice will not, however, relieve
the Indemnifying Party from its obligation to provide indemnification under
this Section 11. If the claim relates to a claim or other action by a third
party against the Asserting Party or any fixed or contingent liability to a
third party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnifying Party may elect to assume
the defense of the

39

Page 48 of 196
<PAGE> 44
Third Party Claim at its own expense with counsel selected by it. The
Indemnifying Party may not, however, assume the defense if the named partes to
the Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the
Indemnifying Party and the Asserting Party and the representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them; in any such case, the Asserting Party will
have the right to employ, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, counsel
approved by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for
any fees or expenses of counsel for the Asserting Party incurred in connection
with the Third Party Claim (except in the case of potential differing
interests, as provided in the preceding sentence). If the Indemnifying Party
does not assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Asserting Party will
have the right to settle the Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's
expense. The Asserting Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in the
defense of any claim, action, or proceeding covered by this Section 12. The
Asserting Party will make available to the Indemnifying Party or its
representatives all records and other materials reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party for use in contesting any Third Party Claim.

11.5 DEDUCTIBLE. No action may be brought against
any party hereto on account of or in any way related to any representation or
warranty in any Closing Document (as hereinafter defined), or for any indemnity
for breach of any such representation or warranty, unless and until the person
or entity claiming to have been injured thereby has sustained actual damages in
excess of $300,000 (the "Deductible") as a proximate result of such party's
misrepresentations or breaches of warranty. Such action will be limited to
recovery of only those damages which exceed the Deductible. The limitation in
this Section 11.5 does not apply to any indemnification under Sections 11.2(b),
11.2(c), 11.3(b), 11.3(c) or 11.3(d).

12. COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE

For a period of five years after the Time of Closing,
Brown Group and Cloth World will not, and will cause their affiliates not to,
own or operate any retail store that sells sewing fabrics, apparel fabric, home
furnishings, notions, patterns, craft fabric, crafts, seasonal goods, or
flowers of a type sold on the date of this Agreement at the Stores, or at
Fabri-Centers' Jo-Ann Fabrics stores, at any place within the continental
United States; except that, this Section 12 will not prohibit Brown Group,
Cloth World or any of their affiliates from owning not more than five percent
in the aggregate of the

40

Page 49 of 196
<PAGE> 45
outstanding shares of any corporation whose shares are traded on a national
securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market.

provided in this Agreement, Brown Group will pay all fees and expenses incurred

after the Time of Closing, in connection with the transactions contemplated by

incurred by Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio, whether before or after the Time of
Closing, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Sellers will pay all sales and use taxes and transfer fees arising out of the
transfer of the Acquired Assets to FCA Ohio, and Buyers will pay all recording
fees resulting from the recording of assignments of the Store Leases.

13.3 WAIVER AND AMENDMENT. Any provision of this
Agreement may be waived in writing by the party that is entitled to the benefit
of that provision. This Agreement may be amended or supplemented at any time,
although no such amendment or supplement will be effective unless it is in
writing and signed by both Brown Group and Fabri-Centers.

13.4 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO RIGHTS OR REMEDIES TO OTHER
PERSONS. This Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits to this
Agreement, (a) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties on its
subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements, both written and oral, and
(b) is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any individual or
organization other than the parties. The Confidentiality Agreement, however,
between Brown Group and Fabri-Centers dated as of May 10, 1993 (including the
Addendum thereto dated August 9,1994) is hereby confirmed, will survive

OPINION OF BROWN GROUP'S COUNSEL

[SUBJECT TO FURTHER REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY BRYAN CAVE OPINION COMMITTEE]

October 2, 1994

Fabri-Centers of America, Inc. and
FCA of Ohio, Inc.
5555 Darrow Road
Hudson, Ohio 44238

Attention: Robert Norton,
Vice Chairman

Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to Brown Group, Inc., a New York
corporation ("Brown Group"), and Cloth World, Inc., a Missouri corporation
[("Cloth World") and, together with Brown Group, sometimes referred to herein
individually and collectively as the "Sellers"] in connection with the
negotiation, execution and delivery by the Sellers of that certain Asset
Purchase Agreement dated as of August 24, 1994 among the Sellers and you as
Buyers and covering substantially all the operating assets of Cloth World
(which Agreement, together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, is herein
referred to as the "Purchase Agreement").

Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used herein
without definition will have the respective meanings set forth in the Purchase
Agreement.

In preparation for giving this opinion, we have examined
copies of (i) the Purchase Agreement, (ii) the Articles and/or Certificate of
Incorporation of the Sellers as certified to by the Secretaries of State of New
York and Missouri under certificates dated ______ __________ and
______________, and as further certified to by the Secretaries of the Sellers
under certificates dated the date of this letter, (iii) the bylaws of the
Sellers as certified to by the Secretaries of the Sellers under certificates
dated the date of this letter, and (iv) certain corporate resolutions of the
Sellers authorizing the execution and delivery of the

1

Page 69 of 196
<PAGE> 65
Purchase Agreement. We have also received certain information, reports and
certificates from representatives of the Sellers and from public officials of
the States of New York and Missouri. We have, without investigation or
independent verification, relied upon and assumed the accuracy, authenticity
and completeness of such documents, resolutions, information, reports and
certificates.

We have, without investigation or independent verification,
also assumed that:

1. Except for the persons signing on behalf of the
Sellers, the signatures of persons signing all Closing Documents are genuine;

2. The execution, delivery and performance of all
Closing Documents have been authorized by all necessary corporate and other
action of all signatories thereto other than the Sellers;

3. All documents submitted to us as originals or
duplicate originals are authentic; and

4. All documents submitted to us as copies, whether
certified or not, conform to the authentic original documents.

We have examined such provisions of Missouri law and the
corporate laws of the State of New York as we have deemed appropriate to the
giving of this opinion. We express no opinion as to the laws of, or the effect
or applicability of the laws of, any jurisdiction other than the laws of the
State of Missouri, the applicable corporate laws of the State of New York and
the applicable Federal laws of the United States.

Based upon and subject to the qualifications and
limitations stated in this letter, we are of the opinion that:

1. ORGANIZATION OF BROWN GROUP AND CLOTH WORLD. Brown
Group and Cloth World are corporations duly organized, validly existing, and in
good standing under the laws of the States of New York and Missouri,
respectively.

2. SUBSIDIARIES. Each of the Subsidiaries is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the
laws of the state in which it is incorporated.

2

Page 70 of 196
<PAGE> 66
3. AUTHORITY. Brown Group and Cloth World have sufficient
corporate power to enter into and perform their obligations under the
Agreement. The execution, delivery, and performance of the Agreement by Brown
Group and Cloth World have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on their part. Assuming the due authorization, execution, and delivery
of the Agreement by Fabri-Centers and FCA Ohio, the Agreement is a valid and
binding obligation of Brown Group and Cloth World enforceable against them in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, and other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and to
the discretion of a court in granting equitable relief.

4. NO VIOLATION. The execution and delivery of the
Agreement by Brown Group and Cloth World do not, and the performance by Brown
Group and Cloth World of their obligations under the Agreement will not, result
in any violation of or default under, or give rise to a right of modification,
termination, or acceleration of any obligation under, any provision of the
charter or bylaws of Brown Group, Cloth World, or any of the Subsidiaries; of
any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, or other
agreement or instrument known to us to which Brown Group, Cloth World, or any
of the Subsidiaries is a party (including but not limited to any Store Lease,
Personal Property Lease, or Executory Contract); of any permit, license,
judgment, order, or decree known to us by which Brown Group, Cloth World, or
any of the Subsidiaries is bound; or of any statute, ordinance, rule, or
regulation by which Brown Group, Cloth World, or any of the Subsidiaries is
bound; except, in each case, for matters revealed in the Agreement or Schedules
thereto. To our knowledge, no authorization, consent or approval of, or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the performance by Brown Group
of its obligations under the Agreement, except, in each case, for matters
revealed in the Agreement or Schedules thereto or in the case of compliance
with the HSR Act.

Whenever our opinion with respect to the existence or
absence of facts is indicated to be based upon our knowledge or awareness, we
are referring only to the actual knowledge of Bryan Cave attorneys who have
represented the Sellers during the course of our engagement in connection with
the negotiation and execution of the Purchase Agreement. We have not
undertaken any investigation other than as described herein to determine the
truth of such facts.

This opinion is intended solely for your use in connection
with the purchase of the Acquired Assets contemplated by the Agreement and may
not be used by you for
3

Page 71 of 196
<PAGE> 67
any other purpose, or by any other individual or organization for any purpose,
without our prior written consent. By rendering the foregoing opinion, we do
not undertake to advise you of any changes in laws or facts which may occur or
come to our attention after the date hereof.

Very truly yours,

BRYAN CAVE

Attention:

Gentlemen:

As counsel to Fabri-Centers of America, Inc.

the preparation and negotiation of an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of
August 24, 1994 (the "Agreement"), among Fabri-Centers, FCA Ohio, Brown Group,
Inc. ("Brown Group"), and Cloth World, Inc. ("Cloth World"). This opinion is
being given to you pursuant to Section 9.3(d) of the Agreement. Unless
otherwise defined in this opinion, each of the defined terms used in this
opinion has the meaning given to it in the Agreement.

For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to
us as originals, the conformity to the original documents of all documents
submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of all such original documents.

We have examined such certificates of public
officials and of officers of Fabri-Centers, other documents, and matters of law
as we have deemed necessary for purposes of this opinion.

Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

1. ORGANIZATION. Fabri-Centers and FCA Ohio are
corporations duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Ohio.

2. AUTHORITY. Fabri-Centers and FCA Ohio have
sufficient corporate power to enter into and perform their obligations under

of the Agreement by Brown Group and Cloth World, the Agreement is a valid and
binding obligation of Fabri-Centers and FCA Ohio enforceable against them in
accordance with its terms, subject to

Page 85 of 196
<PAGE> 81
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and other laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and to the discretion of a court in granting
equitable relief.

3. NO VIOLATION. The execution and delivery of the
Agreement by Fabri-Centers and FCA Ohio do not, the performance by
Fabri-Centers and FCA Ohio of their obligations under the Agreement will not,
result in any violation of or default under, or give rise to a right of
modification, termination, or acceleration of any obligation under, any
provision of the Articles of Incorporation or Regulations of Fabri-Centers or
FCA Ohio; of any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
lease, or other agreement or instrument known to us to which Fabri-Centers or
FCA Ohio is a party; of any permit, license, judgment, order, or decree known
to us by which Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio is bound; or of any statute,
ordinance, rule, or regulation by which Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio is bound or
which relates to their business. No authorization, consent, or approval of, or
filing with, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the performance by
Fabri-Centers or FCA Ohio of their obligations under the Agreement, except for
compliance with the HSR Act.

We are registered to practice law only in the State
of Ohio; we express no opinion as to any laws other than the laws of the State
of Ohio and federal laws of the United States of America.

This opinion is intended for your use in connection
with the sale of the Acquired Assets contemplated by the Agreement and may not
be used by you for any other purpose, or by any other individual or

indemnification provisions of this Article 3. The Borrower shall bear all
risks related to the giving of a Notice of Borrowing telephonic or by such

notice from a Bank prior to the date, except in the case of Prime Rate Loans in
which case prior to the time, of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Bank

Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made its
Ratable Portion of the Revolving Credit Borrowing available to the Agent on the
date of the Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with Section 3.1(e). In
reliance upon such assumption, the Agent may, but shall not be obligated to,
make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding portion of the
Revolving Credit Borrowing. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have
made available to the Agent its Ratable Portion of the Loan to be made as to
the Revolving Credit Borrowing, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to
repay to the Agent, immediately upon demand, the corresponding portion of the
Revolving Credit Borrowing, together with interest thereon, for each day from
the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Agent (i) in the case of the Borrower, at the interest
rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Credit Loans comprising such
Revolving Credit Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Bank, at the Fed Funds

Ratable Portion as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing.

Loan to be made by it as its Ratable Portion of any Revolving Credit Borrowing
shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation hereunder to make its Loan
on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing.

Borrowing into Prime Rate Loans so as to comprise a Revolving Credit Borrowing,

on the day which is three (3) Banking Days prior to the Banking Day upon which
the Borrower desires to convert any LIBOR Loans having a particular Interest
Period comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing into LIBOR Loans having a
different permissible Interest Period so as to comprise a Revolving Credit
Borrowing, (vi) on the day which is one (1) Banking Day prior to the Banking

Rate Conversion or Rate Continuation shall be subject to the following:

(A) each Rate Conversion or Rate Continuation shall be
funded among the Banks based upon each Bank's Ratable Portion of such
converted or continued Revolving Credit Loans comprising a Revolving
Credit Borrowing;

(B) if less than all the outstanding principal amount of
the Revolving Credit Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing is
converted or continued, the aggregate principal amount of such

(C) each Rate Conversion or Rate Continuation shall be
effected by each Bank by applying the proceeds of the Loan resulting
from such Rate Conversion or

21

Page 117 of 196
<PAGE> 31
Rate Continuation to the Loan of such Bank being converted or
continued, as the case may be, and the accrued interest on any
such Loan (or portion thereof) being converted or continued shall
be paid to the Agent on behalf of each Bank by the Borrower at the 
time of such Rate Conversion or Rate Continuation;

(D) LIBOR Loans and Fed Funds Rate Loans may not be
converted or continued at a time other than the end of an Interest
Period applicable thereto unless the Borrower shall pay, upon demand,
any amounts due to the Banks pursuant to Section 3.3(d) or 3.3(e), as
the case may be;

(E) Revolving Credit Loans comprising a Revolving Credit

Funds Rate Loans less than one month prior to the last day of the
Commitment Period or for an Interest Period which continues after the
last day of the Commitment Period;

(F) Revolving Credit Loans comprising a Revolving Credit
Borrowing that cannot be converted into or continued as LIBOR Loans by

(G) in connection with any Rate Conversion or Rate
Continuation, no Interest Period can be selected which ends after the
date of any reduction in the Maximum Availability Amount unless, after
giving effect to such selection, the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of any then outstanding Prime Rate Loans taken together with the
principal amount of any then outstanding LIBOR Loans or Fed Funds Rate
Loans having Interest Periods ending on or prior to the date of such
reduction shall be at least equal to the principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Loans due and payable on or prior to such date.

Each such request for a conversion or continuation (a "Rate
Conversion/Continuation Request") in respect of Revolving Credit Loans
comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be transmitted by the Borrower to
the Agent, by telecopier, telex or cable (in the case of telex or cable,
confirmed in writing prior to the effective date of the Rate Conversion or Rate
Continuation requested), in substantially the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto,
specifying (A) the identity and amount of the Revolving Credit Loans comprising
a Revolving Credit Borrowing that the Borrower requests be converted or
continued, (B) the Type of Revolving Credit Loans into which such Revolving
Credit Loans are to be converted or continued, (C) if such notice requests a
Rate Conversion, the date of the Rate Conversion (which shall be a Banking Day)
and (D) in the case of Revolving Credit Loans comprising a Revolving Credit
Borrowing being converted into or continued as LIBOR Loans or Fed Funds Rate
Loans, the Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans or Fed Funds Rate Loans, as the
case may be. The Borrower may make Rate Conversion/Continuation Requests
telephonically so long as written confirmation of such Revolving Credit
Borrowing is received by the Agent by 1:00 p.m. (Cleveland, Ohio time) on the
same day of such telephonic Rate Conversion/Continuation Request. The Agent
may rely on such telephonic Rate Conversion/Continuation Request to the same
extent that the Agent

22

Page 118 of 196
<PAGE> 32
may rely on a written Rate Conversion/Continuation Request. Each Rate
Conversion/Continuation Request, whether telephonic or written, shall be
irrevocable and binding on the Borrower and subject to the indemnification
provisions of this Article 3. The Borrower shall bear all risks related to
giving any Rate Conversion/Continuation Request telephonically or by such other
method of transmission as Borrower shall elect. The Agent shall promptly
deliver on the day received a copy of each such Rate Conversion/Continuation
Request to the Banks by telecopier.

SECTION 3.2 OPTIONAL REDUCTIONS; TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS;
MANDATORY REDUCTION; EXTENSION OF COMMITMENT PERIOD.

(a) OPTIONAL REDUCTION; TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS. The Borrower
may, at any time and without payment of premium or penalty except as set forth
in Section 3.3, terminate in whole (provided no Time Drafts accepted by the
Letter of Credit Bank, Acceptances or Letters of Credit are then outstanding)
or from time to time in part reduce the Total Commitment Amount of the Banks by
delivering to the Agent, not later than 12:00 noon (Cleveland, Ohio time) two
(2) Banking Days immediately preceding the effective date of the reduction, a
notice of such reduction (a "Reduction Notice"), in the form of Exhibit B-3
hereto, stating the amount by which the Total Commitment Amount is to be
reduced and the effective date of such reduction. Each reduction shall be
subject to the following: (i) each such reduction shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or any
integral multiple thereof and (ii) each such reduction shall be in an amount
such that the Total Commitment Amount as so reduced, is not less than an amount
equal to the aggregate of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving
Credit Loans then outstanding hereunder plus (ii) the aggregate Risk
Participation Exposure. The Borrower shall not be permitted to reduce the Total
Commitment Amount unless, concurrently with any reduction, the Borrower shall
make a principal payment on each Bank's then outstanding Revolving Credit Loans
in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of such Revolving Credit Loans PLUS
the aggregate Risk Participation Exposure over the Commitment of such Bank as
so reduced. The Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of its proportionate
amount and the date of each such reduction. From and after each such
reduction, the Unused Commitment Fees and Facility Fees payable hereunder shall
be calculated upon the Commitments of the Banks as so reduced. Each reduction
of the aggregate Commitments shall be made among the Banks in accordance with
its Ratable Portion. Any partial reduction in the Total Commitment Amount shall
be irrevocable and effective during the remainder of the Commitment Period and
shall not have the effect of reducing the Maximum Availability Amount from time
to time except to the extent that the Total Commitment Amount as so reduced is
less than the Maximum Availability Amount. Any partial reduction of the Total
Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) shall not alter the
obligation of the Borrower to prepay any amounts in excess of the Maximum
Availability Amount pursuant to Section 3.2(c) hereof. If the Borrower
terminates in whole the Commitments of the Banks, on the effective date of such
termination (the Borrower having prepaid in full the unpaid principal balance,
if any, of the Notes outstanding together with all interest (if any) and Unused
Commitment Fees and Facility Fees accrued and unpaid and all other amounts due
to the Agent or the Banks hereunder) all of the Notes outstanding shall be
delivered to the Agent marked "Cancelled" and redelivered to the Borrower.

23

Page 119 of 196
<PAGE> 33
(b) MANDATORY REDUCTION. In the event that the Acquisition shall
not have been consummated on or before November 1, 1994, the Total Commitment
Amount shall be automatically reduced to One Hundred Seventy-Five Million
Dollars ($175,000,000). Each reduction of the Total Commitment Amount shall be
made among the Banks each in accordance with its Ratable Portion. In the event
that such reduction of the Total Commitment Amount results in the aggregate
outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loans PLUS the aggregate Risk
Participation Exposure exceeding the Total Commitment Amount as so reduced, the
Borrower shall on such day prepay an aggregate principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Loans in an amount at least equal to such excess, together
with accrued interest to the date of such reduction on the principal amount
paid pursuant hereto, to the Agent for application to the Banks each in
accordance with its Ratable Portion. Any such reduction in the Total
Commitment Amount shall be effective during the remainder of the Commitment
Period and shall not have the effect of reducing the Maximum Availability
Amount from time to time except to the extent that the Total Commitment Amount
as so reduced is less than the Maximum Availability Amount. Any reduction of
the Total Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall not alter the
obligation of the Borrower to prepay any amounts in excess of the Maximum
Availability Amount pursuant to Section 3.2(a) hereof.

(c) EXTENSION OF COMMITMENT PERIOD. After the Borrower shall have
furnished its annual audit report pursuant to Section 8.1(b) hereof, commencing
with such financial statements for the 1995 Fiscal Year, the Borrower may
request in writing that the Commitment Period be extended one (1) year to the
Anniversary Date next following the last day of the Commitment Period then in
effect, which request shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B-4 hereto
(an "Extension Request and Consent") addressed to the Agent on behalf of the
Banks. The Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of each such Extension Request
and Consent to each of the Banks. The Banks agree to give consideration to
each such request and to respond in writing to the Borrower affirmatively or
negatively as to such request no later than sixty (60) days after such request
is received by the Agent. No Bank shall be obligated to grant the Borrower any
such extension, and unanimous written consent of all the Banks shall be
required to extend the Commitment Period. In the event of the failure of any
of the Banks to so respond affirmatively or negatively in writing within such
sixty (60) day period, such request for extension shall be deemed to have been
denied.

SECTION 3.3 REPAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS; PREPAYMENT COMPENSATION.

(a) REPAYMENT. The Borrower shall repay to the Agent for account
of the Banks the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and
the accrued and unpaid interest, Facility Fees and Unused Commitment Fees and
any other amounts owing to the Banks, or any thereof, under this Agreement on
the last day of the Commitment Period or upon acceleration pursuant to Section
11.1 or 11.2.

(b) PERMITTED PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower may prepay, not later than
12:00 noon (Cleveland, Ohio time), upon at least two (2) Banking Days' notice
to the Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the
prepayment, and, upon such notice, shall prepay the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans comprising

24

Page 120 of 196
<PAGE> 34
part of the same Revolving Credit Borrowing in whole or ratably in part,
together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal
amount prepaid; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each partial prepayment of Revolving
Credit Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) or additional increments of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or
any integral multiple thereof. Any prepayment of any LIBOR Loans or Fed Funds
Rate Loans made on other than the last day of an Interest Period shall obligate
the Borrower to reimburse the Banks in respect thereof pursuant to Sections
3.3(d) or (e) hereof, respectively. Upon receipt by the Agent of a notice
pursuant to this Section 3.3(b), the Agent shall promptly forward a copy of
such notice, by telecopier in the case of a prepayment of LIBOR Loans or Fed
Funds Rate Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing, to each of the Banks.

(c) MANDATORY PREPAYMENT. If on any Banking Day the aggregate
outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit Loans PLUS the aggregate Risk
Participation Exposure exceeds the Maximum Availability Amount then in effect,
the Borrower shall on such day prepay an aggregate principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Loans in an amount at least equal to such excess, together
with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount
prepaid, to the Agent for the account of each of the Banks ratably in
accordance with their Commitments.

(d) PREPAYMENT COMPENSATION; LIBOR LOANS. In any case of
prepayment of any LIBOR Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing, the
Borrower agrees that if Adjusted LIBOR as determined as of 11:00 a.m. London
time, two (2) Banking Days prior to the date of prepayment of any LIBOR Loans
comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing (hereinafter, "Prepayment LIBOR") shall
be lower than the last Adjusted LIBOR previously determined for those LIBOR
Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing with respect to which prepayment
is intended to be made (hereinafter, "Last LIBOR"), then the Borrower shall,
upon written notice by the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent, for the account of
each of the Banks, in immediately available funds, compensation for such
prepayment measured by a rate (the "LIBOR Prepayment Compensation Rate") which
shall be equal to the difference between the Last LIBOR and the Prepayment
LIBOR. In determining the Prepayment LIBOR, the Agent shall apply a rate equal
to Adjusted LIBOR for a deposit approximately equal to the amount of such
prepayment which would be applicable to an Interest Period commencing on the
date of such prepayment and having a duration as nearly equal as practicable to
the remaining duration of the actual Interest Period during which such
prepayment is to be made. The LIBOR Prepayment Compensation Rate shall be
applied to all or such part of the principal amounts of the Notes as related to
the LIBOR Loans to be prepaid, and the prepayment compensation shall be
computed for the period commencing with the date on which such prepayment is to
be made to that date which coincides with the last day of the Interest Period
previously established when the LIBOR Loans, which are to be prepaid, were
made. In the event the Borrower cancels a Notice of Borrowing with respect to
a Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of LIBOR Loans subsequent to the
delivery to the Agent of such notice such cancellation shall be treated as a
prepayment as to which the Banks shall be entitled to the aforementioned
prepayment compensation.

(e) PREPAYMENT COMPENSATION RATE; FED FUNDS RATE LOANS. In any
case of prepayment of any Fed Funds Rate Loans comprising all or any part of a
Revolving Credit

25

Page 121 of 196
<PAGE> 35
Borrowing, the Borrower agrees that if the Fed Funds Rate as determined as of
11:00 a.m. Cleveland time, one (1) Banking Day prior to the date of prepayment
of any Fed Funds Rate Loans (hereinafter, "Prepayment Fed Funds Rate") shall be
lower than the last Fed Funds Rate previously determined for those Fed Funds
Rate Loans with respect to which prepayment is intended to be made
(hereinafter, "Last Fed Funds Rate"), then the Borrower shall, upon written
notice by the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent, for the account of each of the
Banks, in immediately available funds, a prepayment penalty measured by a rate
(the "Fed Funds Prepayment Compensation Rate") which shall be equal to the
difference between the Last Fed Funds Rate and the Prepayment Fed Funds Rate.
In determining the Prepayment Fed Funds Rate, the Agent shall apply the Fed
Funds Rate which would be applicable to a Fed Funds Rate Loan approximately
equal to the amount of such prepayment having an Interest Period commencing on
the date of such prepayment and having a duration as nearly equal as
practicable to the remaining duration of the actual Interest Period during
which such prepayment is to be made. The Prepayment Fed Funds Compensation
Rate shall be applied to all or such part of the principal amounts of the
Revolving Credit Notes as related to the Fed Funds Rate Loans to be prepaid,
and the prepayment penalty shall be computed for the period commencing with the
date on which such prepayment is to be made to the date which coincides with
the last day of the Interest Period previously established when the Fed Funds
Loans, which are to be prepaid, were made. In the event the Borrower cancels a
proposed Fed Funds Rate Loan subsequent to the delivery to the Agent of a
Notice of Borrowing with respect a Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Fed
Funds Rate Loans, such cancellation shall be treated as a prepayment as to
which the Banks shall be entitled to the aforementioned prepayment
compensation.

SECTION 3.4 FEES.

(a) FACILITY FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to each Bank,
through the Agent on the last day of each Fiscal Quarter commencing with the
Fiscal Quarter ending October 29, 1994, and on the date on which the
Commitments of such Bank shall be terminated or assigned in whole as provided
herein, a facility fee (a "Facility Fee") at a rate per annum, determined on a
daily basis, equal to the Applicable Fee Percentage from time to time in effect
as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(c) below, payable in arrears, on the
amount of the Commitment of such Bank, whether used or unused, determined on a
daily basis, during the preceding calendar quarter (or short period commencing
with the Closing Date, and ending with the last day of the Commitment Period or
any date on which the Commitment of such Bank shall be terminated or assigned
in whole).

(b) UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to each
Bank, through the Agent, on last day of each Fiscal Quarter commencing with the
Fiscal Quarter ending October 29, 1994, and on the date on which the
Commitments of the Banks shall have been terminated or assigned in whole as
provided herein, an unused commitment fee (an "Unused Commitment Fee") at a
rate per annum, determined on a daily basis, equal to the Applicable Fee
Percentage from time to time in effect as determined pursuant to Section 3.4(c)
below, payable in arrears, on the average daily unused portion of the
Commitment of such Bank, determined on a daily basis, during the preceding
calendar quarter (or short period commencing with the Closing Date and ending
with the last day of the Commitment Period or any date on

26

Page 122 of 196
<PAGE> 36
which the Commitment of such Bank shall be terminated or assigned in whole).
For the purposes of calculating Unused Commitment Fees in respect of
Commitments, any portion of such Commitment unavailable due to Revolving Credit
Loans, outstanding Time Drafts in respect of Commercial Letters of Credit,
outstanding Standby Letters of Credit and outstanding Acceptances shall be
deemed to be usage. Any portion of such Commitment unavailable due to
outstanding Sight Drafts under Commercial Letters of Credit shall not be deemed
to be usage for the purposes of computing the Unused Commitment Fee.
Negotiated Bid Loans and Pre-Closing Date Acceptances shall not be deemed to be
usage for the purposes of computing the Unused Commitment Fee.

(c) DETERMINATION OF APPLICABLE FEE PERCENTAGE. So long as no
Event of Default shall exist, the Applicable Fee Percentage shall be adjusted
as herein specified as of the first day of the Fiscal Quarter ("Fee Adjustment
Date") during which (or, in the case of the first Fiscal Quarter of any Fiscal
Year, subsequent to which) the Agent shall have received (A) financial
statements required by Sections 8.1(a) (or, in the case of the case of the
first Fiscal Quarter of any Fiscal Year, by Section 8.1(b)) for the period
ending as of the last day of the Fiscal Quarter (or, in the case of the first
Fiscal Quarter of any Fiscal Year, the Fiscal Year) immediately preceding such
Fee Adjustment Date (each a "Fee Determination Date") and (B) a certificate
complying with Section 8.1(c)(ii) certifying the Borrower's Consolidated Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio and the Borrower's Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of any
such Fee Determination Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, subject to the provisions of
the last sentence of this Section 3.4(c), the Applicable Fee Percentage to be
in effect from the Closing Date until the earlier of the delivery of the
Borrower's financial statements for the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal Year or one
hundred twenty days (120) after the last day of the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal
Year, shall be .225%; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, with respect to any increase or
decrease in the Unused Commitment Fee and Facility Fee for the first Fiscal
Quarter of each Fiscal Year, such increase or decrease, as the case may be
shall be paid by an adjustment to the Unused Commitment Fee or Facility Fee, as
the case may be, payable for the second Fiscal Quarter of such Fiscal Year. As
of any such Fee Adjustment Date, the Applicable Fee Percentage shall be the
Applicable Fee Percentage indicated in the definition of the term "Applicable
Fee Percentage" corresponding to the Borrower's Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio and the Borrower's Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of any such
Fee Determination Date. Any such adjustment of the Applicable Fee Percentage
shall cease to be effective from the earlier of the next Fee Adjustment Date or
the date on which an Event of Default shall occur. The Applicable Fee
Percentage effective from such earlier date and from time to time thereafter
shall be the Applicable Fee Percentage as may be applicable at such time
pursuant to this Section 3.4(c); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if an Event of
Default shall have occurred, the Applicable Fee Percentage shall be 0.25%.

(d) RISK PARTICIPATION FEE. The Letter of Credit Bank shall share
with the Banks, on a pro rata basis, a risk participation fee (the "Risk
Participation Fee") with respect to each Standby Letter of Credit and each Time
Draft accepted by the Letter of Credit Bank in an amount equal to the per annum
rate equal to the Applicable Loan Percentage in effect pursuant to Section
3.5(b) times the face amount of each such Standby Letter of Credit and each
accepted Time Draft. The Letter of Credit Bank shall pay such Risk
Participation Fees to the Agent for the account of the Banks on the last day of
each calendar quarter commencing December 31, 1994.

27

Page 123 of 196
<PAGE> 37
(e) AGENT'S FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the
sole account of the Agent an annual fee as set forth in the Agent's Fee Letter.

(f) ACCEPTANCE COMMISSION. The Borrower agrees to pay the Agent,
on behalf of the Banks, acceptance commissions ("Acceptance Commissions") with
respect to each Acceptance created by the Agent pursuant to the terms hereof in
an amount equal to the per annum rate equal to Applicable Loan Percentage in
effect pursuant to Section 3.5(b) hereof times the face amount of each
Acceptance created, for the period from the date of the creation of such
Acceptance to the date of its maturity; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, from the
Closing Date until the earlier of the delivery of the Borrower's financial
statements for the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal Year or one hundred twenty days (120)
after the last day of the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal Year, the Applicable Loan
Percentage for the purposes of this Section 3.4(f) shall be 1.75%. Each Bank
other than the Agent shall be entitled to receive an Acceptance Commission in
an amount based upon ninety-two and one-half per cent (92-1/2%) of its
Acceptance Exposure in each such Acceptance. The entire remainder of the
Acceptance Commission shall in each case be paid to and retained by the Agent.
For purposes of effecting payment of such commissions, the Borrower hereby
irrevocably directs the Agent, and the Agent agrees, to deduct on the due date
of the commission, the amount thereof from the proceeds of the discount of such
Acceptance effected by the Agent on such date.

(g) LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Letter of Credit Bank for the sole account of the Letter of Credit Bank the
fees set forth in the Letter of Credit Bank's Fee Letter.

(h) FEES NONREFUNDABLE. All fees set forth in this Section 3.4
and closing fees payable pursuant to Section 6.11 shall be paid on the date
due, in immediately available funds, to the Agent for distribution, if and as
appropriate, to the Banks and once paid, none of such fees shall be refundable
under any circumstances.

SECTION 3.5 INTEREST.

(a) REGULAR INTEREST. The Borrower shall pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by each Bank from the date of such
Loan until such principal amount shall be paid in full at the following times
and rates per annum:

(i) PRIME RATE LOANS. During such periods as a Revolving
Credit Loan is a Prime Rate Loan, a rate per annum equal at all times
to the Prime Rate, payable quarterly, in arrears, on the last day of
each Fiscal Quarter and on the date such Prime Rate Loan shall be
converted or paid in full (whether at maturity, by reason of
acceleration or otherwise).

(ii) FED FUNDS RATE LOANS. During such periods as a
Revolving Credit Loan is a Fed Funds Rate Loan, a rate per annum equal
at all times during each Interest Period for such Loan to the sum of
the Fed Funds Rate for such Interest Period for such Loan plus the
Applicable Loan Percentage in effect at the time of the making, the

28

Interest Period and on the date such Fed Funds Rate Loan shall be
converted or paid in full (whether at maturity, by reason of
acceleration or otherwise).

(iii) LIBOR LOANS. During such periods as a Revolving
Credit Loan is a LIBOR Loan, a rate per annum equal to the sum of the
Adjusted LIBOR plus the Applicable Loan Percentage in effect from time
to time from and after each Interest Adjustment Date occurring on or
prior to the date of the making, the conversion or the continuation of
such Loan, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 3.1(h),
payable (A) on the last day of each Interest Period and (B) if such
Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, three months
after the first day of such Interest Period and (C) on the date such
LIBOR Loan shall be converted to a Prime Rate Loan or a Fed Funds Rate
Loan or paid in full (whether at maturity, by reason of acceleration
or otherwise).

(b) APPLICABLE LOAN PERCENTAGE; TERMS OF ADJUSTMENT.

(i) COMMENCEMENT; CONDITIONS. So long as no
Event of Default shall exist, the Applicable Loan Percentage shall be
adjusted as herein specified as of the Closing Date and as of the
first day of the calendar month (each an "Interest Adjustment Date")
commencing after the date the Agent shall have received (A) financial
statements required by Sections 8.1(a) or 8.1(b) for the period ending
as of the last day of the Fiscal Quarter or Fiscal Year immediately
preceding such Interest Adjustment Date (each a "Determination Date")
and (B) a certificate complying with Section 8.1(c)(ii) certifying the
Borrower's Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and the Borrower's
Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of any such Determination
Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, subject to the provisions of clause (ii)

statements for the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal Year or one hundred twenty
days (120) after the last day of the Borrower's 1995 Fiscal Year,
shall be 1.75%.

(ii) CALCULATION AND DURATION OF ADJUSTMENT. On
each Interest Adjustment Date the Applicable Loan Percentage shall be
the Applicable Loan Percentage indicated in the definition of the term
"Applicable Loan Percentage" corresponding to the Borrower's
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and the Borrower's
Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of any such Determination Date. Any
such adjustment of the Applicable Loan Percentage shall cease to be
effective commencing on the earlier of (x) the next Interest
Adjustment Date, (y) the Banking Day following the day on which the
financial statements required to be delivered under Section 8.1(a) or
8.1(b), as the case may be, for the period ending as of the last day
of the Fiscal Quarter or Fiscal Year immediately preceding the date
upon which the then Applicable Loan Percentage shall cease to be

Page 125 of 196
<PAGE> 39
applicable at such time pursuant to this Section 3.5(b); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that (A) if an Event of Default (other than an Event of 
Default under Section 10.1) shall occur, the Applicable Loan 
Percentage shall be 2.50% and (B) if an Event of Default under 
Section 10.1 shall occur, the interest rate shall be the interest 
rate in effect pursuant to Section 3.5(c).

(c) DEFAULT INTEREST. If any principal, interest or fees due
under this Agreement shall not be paid when due or if any Revolving Credit Note
shall not be paid at maturity, whether such maturity occurs by reason of lapse
of time or by operation of any provision of acceleration of maturity therein
contained, the principal thereof and the unpaid interest and fees thereon shall
bear interest, payable on demand, for Prime Rate Loans, LIBOR Loans and Fed
Funds Rate Loans, at a rate per annum which shall be equal at all time to the
greater of (x) two percent (2.0%) in excess of the rate per annum required to
be paid on such Loans immediately prior to the date on which such amount became
due or (y) two percent (2.0%) in excess of the Prime Rate from time to time in
effect. The Borrower acknowledges that this calculation will result in the
accrual of interest on interest and the Borrower expressly consents and agrees
to this provision.

(d) INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION.

(i) AGENT DETERMINATION; NOTICE. The Agent shall
determine the Adjusted LIBOR and the Fed Funds Rate in accordance with
the definition of LIBOR Rate and Fed Funds Rate and Adjusted LIBOR set
forth in Section 1.1. The Agent shall give prompt notice to the
Borrower and the Banks of the applicable interest rate determined by
the Agent for purposes of Section 3.5(a)(i) or (ii) or (iii).

(ii) FAILURE OF BORROWER TO ELECT. If no
Interest Period is specified in any Notice of Borrowing for any LIBOR
Rate Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing or any Fed Funds
Rate Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Borrower shall
be deemed to have selected an Interest Period with a duration of the
one month with respect to LIBOR Loans and seven days with respect to
Fed Funds Rate Loans. If the Borrower shall not have given notice in
accordance with Section 3.1(h) to continue any LIBOR Rate Loans
comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing into a subsequent Interest
Period (and shall not have otherwise delivered a Rate
Conversion/Continuation Request in accordance with Section 3.1(h) to
convert such Loans), subject to the limitations set forth in Section
3.1(h) such LIBOR Rate Loans shall, at the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms hereof),
automatically continue as LIBOR Rate Loans having the same Interest
Period as the immediately preceding Interest Period for such LIBOR
Loans; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, such LIBOR Loans shall be converted to
Prime Rate Loans. If the Borrower shall not have given notice in
accordance with Section 3.1(h) to continue or convert any Fed Funds
Rate Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing into a subsequent
Interest Period (and shall not have otherwise delivered a Rate
Conversion/Continuation Request in accordance with Section 3.1(h) to
convert such Fed Funds Rate Loans), such Fed Funds

30

Page 126 of 196
<PAGE> 40
Rate Loans shall, at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms hereof), automatically
convert to Prime Rate Loans.

SECTION 3.6 PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.

(a) PAYMENTS. The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and
under the Notes with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts
relating to Revolving Credit Loans, not later than 11:00 A.M. (Cleveland, Ohio
time) on the day when due in dollars to the Agent in immediately available
funds by deposit of such funds to the Agent's account maintained at the Payment
Office. Payments received after 12:00 noon (Cleveland time) on any day shall
be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Banking Day. The Agent
will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the
payment of principal, interest, Unused Commitment Fees or Facility Fees or
other fees or other amounts which may be received in respect of the Obligations
of the Borrower under this Agreement ratably (other than as provided in Section
3.4(f) and amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.4(e) and 3.4(g) solely to the
Agent or the Letter of Credit Bank, as the case may be) to each of the Banks
for the account of its respective Lending Office, and like funds relating to
the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank to such Bank for the
account of its Lending Office. The funds so distributed to each Bank shall in
each case be applied by such Bank in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

(b) AUTHORIZATION TO CHARGE ACCOUNT. If and to the extent payment
owed to any Bank is not made when due hereunder or under the Note held by such
Bank, the Borrower hereby authorizes such Bank to charge from time to time
against any or all of the Borrower's general deposit accounts with such Bank
any amount so due.

(c) COMPUTATIONS OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of
interest, commitment fees and letter of credit fees and all other fees shall be
made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days in each case for the
actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each
determination by the Agent (or, in the case of Section 3.7, by a Bank) of an
interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

(d) PAYMENT NOT ON BANKING DAY. Whenever any payment hereunder or
under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Banking Day,
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Banking Day, EXCEPT, that, if
such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of LIBOR Loans
to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on
the immediately preceding Banking Day. Any such extension or reduction of time
shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest,
Commitment Fee or Facility Fee, as the case may be.

(e) PRESUMPTION OF PAYMENT IN FULL BY BORROWER. Unless the Agent
shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such
payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower will make or has made
such payment in full to the Agent on such date. In reliance upon such
assumption, the Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, distribute to each

31

Page 127 of 196
<PAGE> 41
Bank on such due date the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent the
Borrower shall not have made such payment in full to the Agent, each Bank shall
repay to the Agent promptly upon demand the amount distributed to such Bank
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate plus the amount of any costs, expenses,
liabilities or losses incurred by the Agent in connection with its distribution
of such funds.

SECTION 3.7 RESERVES; TAXES; INDEMNITIES.

(a) RESERVES OR DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS. If at any time any Law,
treaty or regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation D of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or the interpretation thereof by
any governmental authority charged with the administration thereof or any
central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority shall impose (whether
or not having the force of Law), modify or deem applicable any reserve and/or
special deposit requirement (other than reserves included in the Reserve
Percentage, the effect of which is reflected in the interest rate(s) of the
LIBOR Loan(s) in question) against assets held by, or deposits in or for the
amount of any loans by, any Bank, and the result of the foregoing is to
increase the cost (whether by incurring a cost or adding to a cost) to such
Bank of making or maintaining hereunder LIBOR Loans or to reduce the amount of
principal or interest received by such Bank with respect to such LIBOR Loans,
then upon demand by such Bank the Borrower shall pay to such Bank from time to
time on Interest Adjustment Dates with respect to such loans, as additional
consideration hereunder, additional amounts sufficient to fully compensate and
indemnify such Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount, assuming (which
assumption such Bank need not corroborate) such additional cost or reduced
amount was allocable to such LIBOR Loans. A certificate as to the increased
cost or reduced amount as a result of any event mentioned in this Section
3.7(a), setting forth the calculations therefor, shall be promptly submitted by
such Bank to the Borrower and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, after any such demand for compensation by any
Bank, the Borrower, upon at least three (3) Banking Days' prior written notice
to such Bank through the Agent, may prepay the affected LIBOR Loans in full or
convert all LIBOR Loans to Prime Rate Loans or Fed Funds Rate Loans regardless
of the Interest Period of any thereof. Any such prepayment or conversion shall
entitle the Banks to the prepayment compensation provided for in Section 3.3
hereof. Each Bank will notify the Borrower as promptly as practicable (with a
copy thereof delivered to the Agent) of the existence of any event which will
likely require the payment by the Borrower of any such additional amount under
this Section.

(b) IMPOSITION OF TAXES. In the event that by reason of any Law,
regulation or requirement or in the interpretation thereof by an official
authority, or the imposition of any requirement of any central bank whether or
not having the force of Law, any Bank shall, with respect to this Agreement or
any transaction under this Agreement, be subjected to any tax, levy, impost,
charge, fee, duty, deduction or withholding of any kind whatsoever (other than
any tax imposed upon the total net income of such Bank) and if any such
measures or any other similar measure shall result in an increase in the cost
to such Bank of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or in a reduction in the
amount of principal, interest or

32

Page 128 of 196
<PAGE> 42
commitment fee receivable by such Bank in respect thereof, then such Bank shall
promptly notify the Borrower stating the reasons therefor. The Borrower shall
thereafter pay to such Bank upon demand from time to time on Interest
Adjustment Dates with respect to such LIBOR Loans, as additional consideration
hereunder, such additional amounts as will fully compensate such Bank for such
increased cost or reduced amount. A certificate as to any such increased cost
or reduced amount, setting forth the calculations therefor, shall be submitted
by such Bank to the Borrower and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, after any such demand for compensation by any
Bank, the Borrower, upon at least three (3) Banking Days prior written notice
to such Bank through the Agent, may prepay the affected LIBOR Loans in full or
convert all LIBOR Loans to Prime Rate Loans or Fed Funds Rate Loans regardless
of the Interest Period of any thereof. Any such prepayment or conversion shall
entitle the Banks to prepayment compensation provided for in Section 3.3
hereof.

(c) EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS UNAVAILABLE OR INTEREST RATE
UNASCERTAINABLE. In respect of any LIBOR Loans, in the event that the Agent or
any Bank shall have determined that dollar deposits of the relevant amount for
the relevant Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans are not available to the
Reference Bank in the applicable Eurodollar market or that, by reason of
circumstances affecting such market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist
for ascertaining the LIBOR rate applicable to such Interest Period, as the case
may be, the Agent or such Bank shall promptly give notice of such determination
to the Borrower and (i) any notice of new LIBOR Loans (or conversion of
existing loans to LIBOR Loans) previously given by the Borrower and not yet
borrowed (or converted, as the case may be) shall be deemed a notice to make
Prime Rate Loans, and (ii) the Borrower shall be obligated either to prepay or
to convert any outstanding LIBOR Loans on the last day of the then current
Interest Period or Periods with respect thereto. Any such prepayment or
conversion shall entitle the Banks to prepayment compensation provided for in
Section 3.3 hereof.

(d) OTHER INTEREST RATE UNATTAINABLE. In respect of any Fed Funds
Rate Loans, in the event that the Agent or any Bank shall have determined that,
by reason of circumstances affecting such market, adequate and reasonable means
do not exist for ascertaining the Fed Funds Rate applicable to such Interest
Period, the Agent or such Bank shall promptly give notice of such determination
to the Borrower and (i) any notice of new Fed Funds Rate Loans (or conversion
of existing Loans to Fed Funds Rate Loans) previously given by the Borrower and
not yet borrowed (or converted, as the case may be) shall be deemed a notice to
make Prime Rate Loans, and (ii) the Borrower shall be obligated either to
prepay or to convert any outstanding Fed Funds Rate Loans on the last day of
the then current Interest Period or Periods with respect thereto. Any such
prepayment or conversion shall entitle the Banks to prepayment compensation
provided for in Section 3.3 hereof.

(e) INDEMNITY. Without prejudice to any other provisions of this
Article 3, the Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each Bank against any loss
or expense which such Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of any default
by the Borrower in payment when due of any amount due hereunder in respect of
any LIBOR Loan or Fed Funds Rate Loan, including, but not limited to, any loss
of profit, premium or penalty incurred by such Bank in

33

Page 129 of 196
<PAGE> 43
respect of funds borrowed by it for the purpose of making or maintaining such
LIBOR Loan or Fed Funds Rate Loan, as determined by such Bank in the exercise
of its sole but reasonable discretion. A certificate as to any such loss or
expense shall be promptly submitted by such Bank to the Borrower and shall, in
the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount
thereof.

(f) CHANGES IN LAW RENDERING LIBOR LOANS UNLAWFUL. If at any time
any new Law, treaty or regulation, or any change in any existing Law, treaty or
regulation, or any interpretation thereof by any governmental or other
regulatory authority charged with the administration thereof, shall make it
unlawful for any Bank to fund any LIBOR Loans which it is committed to make
hereunder with moneys obtained in the Eurodollar market, the commitment of such
Bank to fund LIBOR Loans shall, upon the happening of such event forthwith be
suspended for the duration of such illegality, and such Bank shall by written
notice to the Borrower and the Agent declare that its Commitment with respect
to such Loans has been so suspended and, if and when such illegality ceases to
exist, such suspension shall cease and such Bank shall similarly notify the
Borrower and the Agent. If any such change shall make it unlawful for any Bank
to continue in effect the funding in the applicable Eurodollar market of any
LIBOR Loan previously made by it hereunder, such Bank shall, upon the happening
of such event, notify the Borrower, the Agent and the other Banks thereof in
writing stating the reasons therefor, and the Borrower shall, on the earlier of
(i) the last day of the then current Interest Period or (ii) if required by
such Law, regulation or interpretation, on such date as shall be specified in
such notice, either convert all LIBOR Loans to Prime Rate Loans or Fed Funds
Rate Loans to the extent permissible under this Agreement or prepay all LIBOR
Loans to the Banks in full. Any such prepayment or conversion shall entitle
the Banks to prepayment compensation as provided in Section 3.3 hereof.

(g) FUNDING. Each Bank may, but shall not be required to, make
LIBOR Loans hereunder with funds obtained outside the United States.

SECTION 3.8 CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If any Bank shall have determined,
that, whether in effect at the date of this Agreement or hereafter in effect,
any applicable Law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy,
or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law) of any such authority,
central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Bank's capital allocated to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (or the capital of its holding company) as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank
(or its holding company) could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's policies or the policies of
its holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by
such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after demand
by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its holding
company) for such reduction. Each Bank will designate a different lending
office

34

Page 130 of 196
<PAGE> 44
if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming compensation
under this section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be
paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In
determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods. Within four (4) months following the date such
certificate is furnished claiming compensation by any such Bank (the "Affected
Bank"), the Borrower may replace the Affected Bank with a lending institution
satisfactory to the Agent (the consent to which may not be unreasonably
withheld by the Agent), upon such terms and conditions as are satisfactory to
the Majority Banks. Failure on the part of any Bank to demand compensation for
any reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall not
constitute a waiver of such Bank's rights to demand compensation for any
reduction in return on capital in such period or in any other period. The
protection of this Section 3.8 shall be available to each Bank regardless of
any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the Law,
regulation or other condition which shall have been imposed.

SECTION 3.9 TAXES.

(a) TAXES; WITHHOLDING. Any and all payments by the Borrower
hereunder, under the Notes or the other Related Writings shall be made, in
accordance with the provisions of Article 3, free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, EXCLUDING,
in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes
imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the Laws of which such Bank is
organized or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by Law
to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under
any Note to any Bank or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.9) such
Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such
deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
Law. All such Taxes shall be paid by the Borrower prior to the date on which
penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that,
if any such penalties or interest become due, the Borrower shall make prompt
payment thereof to the appropriate governmental authority. The Borrower shall
indemnify each Bank for the full amount of such Taxes (including any Taxes on
amounts payable under this Section 3.9) paid by the Bank and any liability
(including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Any
indemnification payment shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date the
Bank makes written demand therefor.

(b) STAMP TAXES. The Borrower agrees to pay, and will indemnify
each Bank and the Agent for, any present or future stamp or documentary taxes
or any other excise or

35

Page 131 of 196
<PAGE> 45
property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made
hereunder or under the Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration
of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c) OTHER TAXES. The Borrower will indemnify each Bank and the
Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this section 3.10) paid by such Bank or the Agent (as the case
may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally asserted. Any indemnification payment shall be made
within thirty (30) days from the date such Bank or the Agent (as the case may
be) makes written demand therefor.

(d) REMOVAL OF BANK. Within four (4) months following the date
the Agent or a Bank shall make a written demand for Taxes or Other Taxes
pursuant to this Section 3.9, the Borrower may replace the Affected Bank with a
lending institution satisfactory to the Agent (the consent to which may not be
unreasonably withheld by the Agent), upon such terms and conditions as are
satisfactory to the Majority Banks (exclusive of each Affected Bank and be
computed without consideration of the Commitment of each such Affected Bank).
Failure on the part of any Bank to demand compensation for any reduction in
return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of
such Bank's rights to demand compensation for any reduction in return on
capital in such period or in any other period. The protection of this Section
shall be available to each Bank regardless of any possible contention of the
invalidity or inapplicability of the law, regulation or other condition which
shall have been imposed.

(e) REQUEST FOR REFUND. At the reasonable request of the
Borrower, a Bank or the Agent shall apply at the Borrower's expense for a
refund in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes previously paid by the Borrower
pursuant to this Section 3.9 if in the opinion of such Bank or the Agent there
is a reasonable basis for such refund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Banks or the Agent shall be obligated to pursue such refund if, in its sole
good faith judgment, such action would be disadvantageous to it. If any Bank
subsequently receives from a taxing authority a refund of any Tax previously
paid by the Borrower and for which the Borrower has indemnified the Bank
pursuant to this Section 3.9, such Bank shall within thirty (30) days after
receipt of such refund, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, pay to
the Borrower the net amount of any such recovery after deducting taxes and
expenses attributable thereto.

(f) EXEMPTION CERTIFICATE. Not later than the Closing Date or, in
the case of any bank or financial institution that becomes a Bank after the
Closing Date, pursuant to Article 13, the date of the instrument of assignment
pursuant to which such bank or financial institution became a Bank, and
annually on each Anniversary Date thereafter or at such other times as the
Agent or the Borrower may request, (i) each Bank organized under the Laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States shall provide the Agent and the Borrower
with duly completed copies of Form 1001 or Form 4224 or any successor form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States certifying that
such Bank is exempt from United States withholding taxes with respect to all
payments to be made to such Bank hereunder or other

36

Page 132 of 196
<PAGE> 46
document satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent indicating that all
payments to be made to such Bank hereunder are not subject to such taxes and
(ii) each other Bank shall provide the Agent and the Borrower with a written
statement that it is not a non-resident alien or foreign corporation and which
otherwise satisfies Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-5(b) or any successor
regulation under the Internal Revenue Code (each such certificate or statement,
an "Exemption Certificate"). Unless the Agent and the Borrower have received
an Exemption Certificate from such Bank, the Borrower, or the Agent if the
Borrower has not withheld, may withhold taxes from such payments at the
applicable statutory rate (subject, in the case of the Borrower to the
requirements of Section 3.9(a)); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Borrower has
withheld it shall so notify the Agent. If the Borrower is required to pay
additional amounts to any Bank pursuant to this Section 3.9, such Bank shall
use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office if such
designation will thereafter avoid the need for any additional payments under
this Section 3.9 and will not, in the sole judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank. A Bank which ceases to be exempt from United
States withholding taxes shall notify the Agent and the Borrower promptly
thereof.

(g) FURNISHING OF CERTIFICATE. Within 30 days after the date of
any payment of Taxes, the Borrower will furnish to the Agent, at its address
set forth on the signature page of the Agent to this Agreement or such other
address as the Agent notifies the Banks, the original or a certified copy of a
receipt evidencing payment thereof. The Borrower hereby represents and warrants
to the Agent and each of the Banks that no Taxes are payable in respect of any
payment made hereunder. If Taxes ever become payable in respect of any payment
hereunder or under the Notes made during a Fiscal Quarter, thereafter the
Borrower will furnish to the Agent, within (30) days after the end of such
Fiscal Quarter, at such address, a certificate from the Borrower stating that
any payments made during such Fiscal Quarter are exempt from or not subject to
Taxes.

(h) SURVIVAL OF PROVISION. Without prejudice to the survival of
any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and liabilities
of the Borrower contained in this Section 3.9 shall survive the payment in full
of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, Facility Fees, Unused Commitment
Fees, Acceptance Fees, Risk Participation Fees, interest and termination of the
Commitments hereunder.

SECTION 3.10 PRO RATA TREATMENT. Except as required by Section
3.7 or Section 11.4(b) or as permitted under Section 3.9, each Revolving Credit
Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Revolving Credit
Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Revolving Credit Loans, each payment
of the Facility Fees, each payment of the Unused Commitment Fees, each payment
of Risk Participation Fees, each payment of Acceptance Fees, each reduction of
the Commitments, each Rate Conversion or Rate Continuation of Revolving Credit
Loans comprising a Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be allocated among the
Banks in accordance with each Bank's Ratable Portion of the Total Commitment
Amount (or if the Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in
accordance with the respective principal amounts of each Bank's Revolving
Credit Loans).

37

<PAGE> 47
ARTICLE 4
ACCEPTANCES

SECTION 4.1 AGREEMENT TO CREATE ACCEPTANCES. Subject to the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Agent on behalf of the Banks agrees
to extend credit in United States Dollars to the Borrower from time to time
during the Commitment Period by creating Acceptances for the Borrower;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall (a) the aggregate Risk Participation
Exposure exceed Sixty Million Dollars ($60,000,000) or (b) the aggregate
principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans PLUS the aggregate Risk
Participation Exposure exceed the Total Commitment Amount.

SECTION 4.2 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. The Borrower shall have the
option, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to request
Acceptances hereunder (i) having a face amount not less than Two Million United
States Dollars (U.S. $2,000,000) or additional increments of Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000) or any integral multiple thereof (or such lesser
amount as may be acceptable to the Agent), payable in United States Dollars,
drawn by the Borrower on the Agent in accordance with this Agreement, either to
the order of the Borrower, in which case such draft shall be endorsed by the
Borrower in blank, or to the order of the Agent, (ii) covering a specified
shipment or shipments being purchased or sold by the Borrower, and (iii)
maturing on a Banking Day not more than 180 days after the date of such draft
and not more than 210 days after the date of such shipment or shipments, all as
specified in the relevant Acceptance Request; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
Acceptance shall (a) have a tenor in excess of the period of time which is
usual and reasonably necessary to finance transactions of similar character,
(b) be, together with all other financings relating to the shipment in which
such Acceptance relates, in an aggregate face amount in excess of the c.i.f.
value of such shipment, (c) be created more than thirty (30) days after or more
than thirty (30) days before the date of the shipment to which such Acceptance
relates, or (d) extend beyond the termination of the Commitment Period.

SECTION 4.3 CONDITIONS TO ACCEPTANCES. The obligation of Agent
to create each Acceptance hereunder is subject to the following conditions
precedent: (i) such Acceptance shall comply with the provisions of Section 4.5
hereof and shall also comply with applicable regulations of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States governing banker's
acceptances and shall (if accepted and endorsed by a member bank of the Federal
Reserve System or a bank authorized to create eligible acceptances) be eligible
under such regulations for purchase or, if such Acceptance has a maturity at
the time of discount of not more than ninety (90) days sight, exclusive of days
of grace, for discount by the Federal Reserve Banks.

SECTION 4.4 ACCEPTANCE OBLIGATIONS. The Borrower is obligated,
and hereby unconditionally agrees, to pay the Agent the face amount of each
Acceptance created by the Agent in accordance with the Acceptance Request sent
pursuant to Section 4.5 hereof on the maturity date thereof, or on such earlier
date as may be required pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement.

38

Page 134 of 196
<PAGE> 48
SECTION 4.5 ACCEPTANCE REQUEST. The obligation of the Agent to
create Acceptances hereunder is conditioned, in the case of each Acceptance,
upon receipt by the Agent not later than 12:00 noon (Cleveland, Ohio time) of
each requested creation of an Acceptance by a request by the Borrower on the
Banking Day which is the requested date of the Acceptance. Each such request
(an "Acceptance Request") shall be transmitted by the Borrower to the Agent by
telecopier or such other means as the Agent agrees to in writing, substantially
in the form of Exhibit B-5, specifying therein the requested (A) date of the
Acceptance, (B) number of days such Acceptance is to remain outstanding and the
maturity date thereof and (C) containing the information and certifications
contained in the Acceptance Request in the form of Exhibit B-8 attached hereto.
The Borrower may make an Acceptance Request telephonically so long as written
confirmation of such Acceptance Request is received by the Agent by 1:00 p.m.
(Cleveland, Ohio time) on the day of such telephonic request. The Agent may
rely on such telephonic request to the same extent that the Agent may rely on a
written Acceptance Request. Each Acceptance Request, whether written or
telephonic, shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower and subject to the
indemnification provisions of Article 3. The Borrower shall bear all risks
relating to the method of communicating an Acceptance Request elected by the
Borrower. The Agent may shall give to each Bank prompt notice on the day
received of each such Acceptance Request by telecopier.

SECTION 4.6 DISCOUNT. The Agent agrees, on the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, that on the date of the creation by it of each
Acceptance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement the Agent will (i)
discount such Acceptance at the Agent's then current discount rate for prime
banker's acceptances of equal tenor and face amount and (ii) pay to the
Borrower an amount equal to the difference between the proceeds of such
discount and the Acceptance Commission payable to the Agent for distribution to
the Banks in respect of such Acceptance under Section 3.4(f) hereof.

SECTION 4.7 SUPPLY OF DRAFTS. To enable the Agent to create
Acceptances in the manner specified herein, the Borrower shall supply the Agent
immediately after the execution of this Agreement, and thereafter promptly upon
request by the Agent, with a sufficient number of blank drafts conforming with
the requirements of this Agreement and duly executed on behalf of the Borrower,
which the Agent shall hold in safekeeping prior to use hereunder. The Agent
shall indemnify the Borrower or any Bank for any loss the Borrower or any Bank
may suffer resulting solely from the improper use of any of such blank drafts
by any of Agent's officers, directors or employees and the creation of any
acceptances other than those authorized by the Borrower pursuant to Section 4.5
hereof. The Agent is irrevocably authorized to complete such draft in the
manner specified in the Acceptance Request. In case any authorized signatory
of the Borrower whose signature shall appear on any draft shall cease to have
such authority before the creation of an Acceptance with respect to such draft,
the obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under such Acceptance shall
nevertheless be valid for all purposes as if such authority had remained in
force until such creation.

39

<PAGE> 49
SECTION 4.8 PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS; OVERDUE PAYMENTS;
CANCELLATION OF DRAFTS.

(a) PAYMENTS. Unless otherwise provided herein, all payments of
principal, interest, Acceptance Obligations, premiums, penalties, fees and
other amounts which may become due hereunder, shall be made to the Agent in
immediately available funds for the account of the Banks, and the Agent shall
promptly distribute to each Bank in immediately available funds its ratable
share of the amount of principal, interest, premiums, penalties, Acceptance
Commissions, fees and other amounts which may become due hereunder, received by
it for the account of such Bank in accordance with the provisions of Section
3.10.

(b) PAYMENTS NOT ON BANKING DAY. Whenever any payment pertaining
to an Acceptance Obligation or Time Draft accepted by the Letter of Credit Bank
to be made hereunder shall become due on a day other than a Banking Day, then
such due date shall be the immediately succeeding Banking Day and the Borrower
agrees to pay interest on such amount, in respect of each day during the period
from the date such amount was originally due until the immediately succeeding
Banking Day at a rate per annum equal to (i) the discount rate applicable to
the Acceptance with respect to which such Acceptance Obligation was payable or
(ii) the Prime Rate from time to time in effect with respect to such Time
Draft, as the case may be.

(c) OVERDUE PAYMENTS. Without limiting the rights of the Agent or
any Bank under this Agreement or under applicable Law, the Borrower agrees to
pay interest, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, on any amount payable
under any Acceptance which shall not have been paid when due, in respect of
each day during the period from the date such amount became due until the same
shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum which shall be two percent (2.0%) in
excess of the Prime Rate from time to time in effect.

(d) COMPUTATIONS. All computations of interest, the Acceptance
Commission, and the applicable discount rate pertaining to Acceptances shall be
made based on a year having 360 days and calculated for the actual number of
days elapsed.

SECTION 4.9 CANCELLATION OF DRAFTS. Upon payment by the Agent of
an Acceptance, the Agent shall, if the face amount of the Acceptance has been
received by the Agent from the Borrower, cancel the draft with respect to which
payment of the Acceptance was made and forward such cancelled draft, or a
photocopy thereof, to the Borrower.

SECTION 4.10 ACCEPTANCE OF RISK PARTICIPATION. The Agent hereby
agrees that it will sell simultaneously with the creation of each Acceptance,
and each Bank hereby agrees that it will buy simultaneously with the creation
of each such Acceptance (subject to the following sentence) an undivided pro
rata participation in any payment which Agent makes for the account of the
Borrower under any Acceptance for which payment Agent is not otherwise
immediately reimbursed by the Borrower. The aggregate principal amount of all
outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of such Bank PLUS such Bank's aggregate Risk
Participation Exposure (after taking into effect such Bank's Ratable Portion of
the risk participation created under this Section 4.10) shall not exceed such
Bank's Commitment in effect from time to time. The sale

40

Page 136 of 196
<PAGE> 50
of the risk participation by the Agent, and the purchase thereof by each Bank
respectively, shall occur simultaneously with and shall be evidenced by each
Acceptance.

SECTION 4.11 REIMBURSEMENT OF AGENT. The Agent will notify each
other Bank promptly if the Agent makes any payment under an Acceptance which is
not immediately reimbursed by the Borrower. Upon demand by the Agent, each
Bank shall pay to the Agent that Bank's Ratable Portion of each such payment
made by the Agent. Each such payment shall for all purposes hereunder be deemed
to be a Prime Rate Loan (it being understood that (i) each Bank's obligation to
make such payment is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by
any event or circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence of any Default
or Possible Default hereunder or the failure of any condition precedent set
forth in Article 7 to be satisfied and (ii) each such payment shall be made
without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever). In
addition, upon demand by the Agent, each Bank will pay an amount equal to such
Bank's pro rata share of all costs and expenses not reimbursed by the Borrower
which have been incurred or made by the Agent as the result of, or in
connection with, any action including, but not limited to, legal action which
may be taken by Agent to obtain reimbursement for payments made by Agent under
any Acceptance. The principal amount, fees, interest and premiums with respect
to unpaid Acceptance Obligations deemed to be Prime Rate Loans pursuant to this
Section 4.11 shall be recorded on or in respect of the Revolving Credit Note by
each Bank from time to time on any ledger or other record of each Bank and each
Bank shall record such information by such other method as such Bank may
generally employ in accordance with Section 3.1(c); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
failure to make any such record shall in no way detract from the Borrower's
obligations under such Bank's Revolving Credit Note. The aggregate unpaid
Acceptance Obligations shown on the aforesaid records of such Bank shall be
rebuttably presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing and unpaid on
such Revolving Credit Note.

SECTION 4.12 CONTINUANCE OF ACCEPTANCES. The Agent, the Banks,
the Letter of Credit Bank and the Borrower agree that with respect to those
certain banker's acceptances or time drafts identified on the Supplemental
Schedule attached hereto which have been issued for the account of the Borrower
by Society prior to the date of this Agreement (a) such banker's acceptances
("Pre-Closing Date Acceptances") shall be deemed to be Acceptances under this
Agreement as of the date this Agreement is becomes effective pursuant to
Section 14.7, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (except
that the Borrower shall not be required by virtue of this Section 4.12 to pay
any additional Acceptance Commission or discount fees for the deemed issuance
of Pre-Closing Date Acceptances hereunder) and (ii) the Borrower shall have all
obligations hereunder in respect of such Pre-Closing Date Acceptances and the
Agent shall be deemed to be the issuer or acceptor thereof.

SECTION 4.13 TERMINATION OF COMMITMENT; INDEMNIFICATION;
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

(a) TERMINATION OF COMMITMENT. In the event that (i) any
restriction is imposed on the Agent (including, without limitation, any legal
lending or acceptance limits imposed by the United States of America or any
political subdivision thereof) which in the judgment of the

41

Page 137 of 196
<PAGE> 51
Agent after consultation with the Borrower would prevent the Agent from
creating Acceptances or maintaining its commitment to create Acceptances or
(ii) there shall have occurred, at any time during the term of this Agreement
(a) any adverse change or a development involving a prospective adverse change
affecting the condition of the Borrower which would materially impair the
ability of the Borrower to meet its Acceptance Obligations, (b) any outbreak of
hostilities or other national or international crisis or change in economic
conditions if the effect of such outbreak, crisis or change would make the
creation of Acceptances or the discount or sale thereof impracticable, (c) the
enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any statute,
regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which
would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Borrower to perform
its obligations under this Agreement, or (d) the taking of any action by any
government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which would
have a material adverse effect on the creation or marketing of banker's
acceptances in the United States of America, then the Agent, in the case of the
occurrence of any event described above, shall give written notice of the
occurrence of such event to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon the
commitment of the Agent to create Acceptances shall terminate on the effective
date of such notice. The Borrower shall forthwith pay to the Agent all
Acceptance Obligations on the maturity date of the Acceptance to which each
Acceptance Obligation relates.

(b) SPECIAL INDEMNIFICATION FOR INELIGIBILITY. In the event that
any Acceptance for any reason whatsoever is deemed by the Agent not to be
eligible for discount under the Federal Reserve Act (12 USC 372), the Borrower
agrees to indemnify Agent and each Bank on demand for any and all additional
costs, expenses or damages incurred by Agent or any Bank, directly or
indirectly arising out of such ineligibility, including, without limitation,
any costs of maintaining reserves in respect to any such Acceptance and any
costs or expenses arising in any manner from the illiquidity of the market for
ineligible bankers' acceptances. A statement as to additional amounts owed to
the Agent or any Bank, showing in detail the basis for the calculation thereof,
submitted in good faith to the Borrower by the Agent or any such Bank, shall be
final, conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error.

(c) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, except for
gross negligence or willful misconduct, for any action taken or omitted under
or in connection with any Acceptance, any draft to which an Acceptance relates
or any documents which in turn relate or pertain to any such draft. When
dealing with any such Acceptance, draft or related documents, Agent shall be
entitled to act and shall be fully protected, against any claim of loss by the
Borrower (except as otherwise provided in this Article 4) occasioned by the
lack, or claimed lack, of authenticity or authority of the issuance of any
draft or any signature thereon, in acting upon any telegram, telex, teletype,
bank wire, cable or radiogram or any writing, application, notice, report,
statement, certificate, resolution, request, order, consent, letter or other
instrument or communication reasonably believed by Agent to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent or made by an authorized person.

Page 140 of 196
<PAGE> 54
Borrower in an amount equal to such Bank's Ratable Portion. The aggregate
principal amount of all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of such Bank PLUS
such Bank's aggregate Risk Participation Exposure (after taking into effect
such Bank's Ratable Portion of the risk participation created under this

provided it has exercised reasonable care, as to any document presented under a
Letter of Credit, or any renewal or extension thereof, which appears to be
regular on its face and appears on its face to conform to the terms of the
Letter of Credit and to make reasonable reference thereto, for the validity or
sufficiency of any signature or endorsement, for delay in giving any notice or
failure of any instrument to bear adequate reference to the Letter of Credit,
or to any renewal or extension thereof, or failure of documents not clearly
specified in the Letter of Credit to accompany any instrument at negotiation,
or for failure of any person to note the amount of any draft on the reverse of

issued hereunder will, except to the extent otherwise expressly provided, be
governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993

(e) TERMINATION OF LETTER OF CREDIT COMMITMENT. In the event that
(i) any restriction is imposed on the Letter of Credit Bank (including, without
limitation, any legal lending or acceptance limits imposed by the United States

Letter of Credit Bank after consultation with the Borrower would prevent the
Letter of Credit Bank from issuing Letters of Credit or maintaining its
commitment to issue Letters of Credit or (ii) there shall have occurred, at any
time during the term of this Agreement (a) any adverse change or a development
involving a prospective adverse change affecting the condition of the Borrower
which would materially impair the ability of the Borrower to meet its
obligations under this Article 5, (b) any outbreak of hostilities or other
national or international crisis or change in economic conditions if the effect
of such outbreak, crisis or change would make the creation of Letters of
Credit, Time Drafts or the discount or sale thereof impracticable, (c) the
enactment, publication, decree or other promulgation of any statute,
regulation, rule or order of any court or other governmental authority which
would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Borrower to perform
its obligations under this Agreement, or (d) the taking of any action by any
government or agency in respect of its monetary or fiscal affairs which would
have a material adverse effect on the creation or marketing of Time Drafts in

certain letters of credit or time drafts identified on the Supplemental

by Society prior to the date of this Agreement (a) such letters of credit or
time drafts shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit or Time Drafts under this
Agreement as of the date this Agreement becomes effective pursuant to Section
14.7, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (except that the
Borrower shall not be required by virtue of this Section 5.4 to pay any

Drafts hereunder) and (ii) the Borrower shall have all obligations hereunder in
respect of such Letters of Credit and the Letter of Credit Bank shall be deemed

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Subject to the exceptions in the Supplemental Schedule, the Borrower

SECTION 9.1 EXISTENCE. The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries
is a corporation duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the state of its incorporation and is duly qualified and authorized
to do business wherever it owns any real estate or personal property or
transacts any substantial business (except in jurisdictions in which failure to
so qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 9.2 POWER, AUTHORIZATION AND CONSENT. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Notes or any Guaranty of
Payment by the Borrower and any Subsidiary, as the case may be, and of all
Related Writings to which it is party (a) are within the Borrower's or the
Subsidiary legal power and authority, (b) have been duly authorized by all
necessary or proper action of such the Borrower or the Subsidiary, (c) do not
require the consent or approval of any governmental body, agency, authority or
any other Person which has not been obtained and (d) will not violate (i) any
provision of Law applicable to the Borrower or the Subsidiary, (ii) any
provision of the Borrower's or the Subsidiary, as

62

Page 158 of 196
<PAGE> 72
the case may be, certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws or
regulations, or (iii) any material agreement or material indenture by which the
Borrower or the Subsidiary or the property of the Borrower or the Subsidiary is
bound, except where such violation specified in this clause (iii) would not
have a materially adverse effect on the Borrower or the Subsidiary, or (e) will
not result in the creation or imposition of any lien or encumbrance on any
property or assets of the Borrower or the Subsidiary except as provided herein.
The execution, delivery and performance of the Purchase Agreement by the

power and authority, (b) have been duly authorized by all necessary or proper
action of the Borrower and FCA of Ohio, and (C) will not violate any provision

Incorporation or Regulations.

SECTION 9.3 LITIGATION; PROCEEDINGS. No action, suit,
investigation or proceeding is now pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower,
threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries at Law, in equity or
otherwise, or with respect to this Agreement, any Guaranty of Payment or any
Related Writing, before any court, board, commission, agency or instrumentality
of any federal, state, local or foreign government or of any agency or
subdivision thereof, or before any arbitrator or panel of arbitrators which
would or might reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 9.4 ERISA COMPLIANCE. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary has incurred any material accumulated funding deficiency within the
meaning of the ERISA, and the regulations thereunder. No Reportable Event has
occurred with respect to any Plan which may result in any material liability
against the Borrower or any Subsidiary. The Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, established under ERISA has not asserted that the Borrower or any
Subsidiary has incurred any material liability in connection with any Plan. No
Lien has been attached and no person has, to the best of the Borrower's
knowledge, threatened to attach a lien on any property of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary as a result of the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's failing to comply

measure of a matter of significance which shall be determined as being an
amount equal to five per cent (5%) of the Borrower's Consolidated Tangible Net
Worth.

SECTION 9.5 FINANCIAL CONDITION. The consolidated financial
statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Year ending
January 29, 1994, previously delivered to the Banks, are true and complete
(including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a disclosure of
all material contingent liabilities), have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with
those used during their next preceding Fiscal Year (except as noted therein)
and fairly present their then financial condition and operations for the Fiscal
Year then ending. Except as otherwise disclosed in the Form 10-Q Report filed
by the Borrower with the SEC for the Fiscal Quarter ending July 30, 1994, there
has been no material change in the Borrower or any Subsidiary's financial
condition, properties or business since that date.

SECTION 9.6 PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION. The PRO FORMA
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at July 30,
1994, but after giving effect to the Acquisition, in the good faith judgment of
the Borrower presents fairly on a PRO FORMA

63

Page 159 of 196

basis what is the consolidated financial position of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries would be on and as of such date were the Acquisition to be
consummated on such date.

SECTION 9.7 SOLVENCY. The Borrower has received consideration
which is the reasonable equivalent value of the obligations and liabilities
that the Borrower has incurred to the Banks. The Borrower is not insolvent as
defined in any applicable state or federal statute, nor will the Borrower be
rendered insolvent by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Note
to the Banks. The Borrower is not engaged or about to engage in any business
or transaction for which the assets retained by it shall be an unreasonably
small capital, taking into consideration the obligations to the Banks incurred
hereunder. The Borrower does not intend to, nor does it believe that it will,
incur debts beyond its ability to pay them as they mature.

SECTION 9.8 DEFAULT. No Possible Default exists hereunder, nor
will any begin to exist immediately after the execution and delivery hereof.

SECTION 9.9 LAWFUL OPERATIONS. Except as set forth in the
Supplemental Schedule, the operations of the Borrower and the operations of
each of its Subsidiaries are in full compliance as of the Closing Date with all
requirements imposed by Law or regulation, whether federal, state or local
including (without limitation) all Environmental Laws, occupational safety and
health Laws and zoning ordinances except where the noncompliance with any such
Laws could not be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this Section 9.9 shall not apply to any noncompliance
if and to the extent that the same is being contested in good faith by timely
and appropriate proceedings which are effective to stay enforcement thereof and
against which appropriate reserves have been established.

SECTION 9.10 INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT STATUS. Neither the Borrower
nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or an "affiliated
person" of, or "promoter" or "principal underwriter" for, an "investment
company", as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (15 U.S.C. Section 80(a)(1), ET SEQ.).

SECTION 9.11 REGULATION G/REGULATION U/REGULATION X COMPLIANCE.
Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as
one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying "margin stock" (as defined by Regulation U of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States (as
amended from time to time) and all official rulings and interpretations

(a) EQUALIZATION OF ADVANTAGE. Subject to the provisions of
Section 11.4(b) below, each Bank agrees with the other Banks that if it at any
time shall obtain any Advantage over the other Banks in respect of the
Borrower's Obligations to the Banks (except under Section 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 or 14.4
hereof), it will purchase from the other Banks, for cash and at par, such
additional participation in the Borrower's Debt to the Banks as shall be
necessary to nullify the Advantage. If any said Advantage resulting in the
purchase of an additional participation as aforesaid shall be recovered in
whole or in part from the Bank receiving the Advantage, each such purchase
shall be rescinded, and the purchase price restored (but without interest
unless the Bank receiving the Advantage is required to pay interest on the
Advantage to the person recovering the Advantage from such Bank) ratably to the
extent of the recovery. Each Bank further agrees with the other Banks that if
it at any time shall receive any payment for or on behalf of the Borrower on
any indebtedness owing by the Borrower to that Bank by reason of offset of any
deposit or other indebtedness, it will apply such payment first to any and all
indebtedness owing by the Borrower to that Bank pursuant to this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any participation purchased or to be purchased
pursuant to this Section 11.4) until the Borrower's Obligations have been paid
in full. The Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from
the other Banks pursuant to this Section may exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Bank were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

(b) SHARING OF PAYMENTS. Upon the occurrence and continuation of
an Event of Default, the Borrower, the Agent and each of the Banks under this
Agreement, each of the Banks having Negotiated Bid Loans, Outside Loans or
loans under the Swingline Facility then outstanding (collectively, the "Sharing
Banks") agree that all payments made to any Bank in respect of the Revolving
Credit Loans, the Negotiated Bid Loans, the Outside Loans or loans in respect
of the Swingline Facility (such loans to be collectively referred to in the
aggregate as the "Subject Loans") shall be remitted to the Agent by the
Borrower, or by any Sharing Bank receiving any such payment after the
occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, for application
by the Agent as follows: all payments made to the Agent in respect of the
Subject Loans shall be made (i) to each Sharing Bank in respect of the
Revolving Credit Loans, the interest and fees due in respect of such Revolving
Credit Loans, and the Swingline Facility and such interest as may be due
Society in respect of outstanding loans under the Swingline Facility on a pro
rata basis based upon the percentage such Subject Loans of such Bank bear to
the aggregate of all such Subject Loans then outstanding and (ii) upon payment
in full of all amounts to be paid pursuant to the preceding clause (i), to the
Sharing Banks on a pro rata basis based upon the percentage the aggregate of
then outstanding Negotiated Bid

69

Page 165 of 196
<PAGE> 79
Loans and the then outstanding Outside Loans of such Sharing Bank bears to the
aggregate of all of the Negotiated Bid Loans and the Outside Loans then
outstanding. Each Sharing Bank may apply any such payment received pursuant to
this Section 11.4(b) to the amounts owing to such Sharing Bank in respect of
such the Subject Loans of such Sharing Bank in such manner and in such order as
such Sharing Bank shall determine in its sole discretion. Each Sharing Bank
agrees the such Sharing Bank shall provide that any transferee (whether by
absolute assignment or participation) of all or any portion of any Negotiated
Bid Loan, Outside Loan or any loan in respect of the Swingline Facility shall
be bound by the provisions of this Section 11.4(b) and Article 12 hereof.

correct and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or
agents shall have any responsibility to the Borrower on account of the failure
of or delay in performance or breach by any Bank of any of its obligations

EXHIBIT 10(b)

RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of April 22, 1994, is between Robert L. Norton
("Norton") and FABRI-CENTERS OF AMERICA, INC., an Ohio corporation ("FCA").

FCA is considering the possibility of an acquisition (the "Acquisition") of
the Cloth World division ("CW") of The Brown Group, a major retailer of
fabrics, notions, crafts, and sewing machines in the United States. Norton is
assisting in the evaluation of the Acquisition and, if the Acquisition is
consummated, FCA anticipates that he will assist in the integration of CW with
FCA. FCA desires to enter into this Agreement in order to ensure Norton's
assistance in these matters, as well as the continued performance by him of
other responsibilities, in the event the Acquisition is consummated.

In consideration of their mutual covenants in this Agreement, and subject to
the consummation of the Acquisition, Norton and FCA agree as follows:

1. EMPLOYMENT. FCA will employ Norton, and Norton will render services to FCA,
as Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. These services will be
rendered at FCA's Hudson, Ohio, headquarters. In addition to his duties as
Chief Financial Officer, Norton will use his best efforts (i) to assist in
the integration of FCA and CW, including the selection of the new management
team and realignment of personnel and responsibilities associated with that
integration, (ii) to support the new combined management team once it is in
place, including the new Chief Operating Officer and the other executive
officers, and (iii) toward the end of the term of his employment, to work
with and assist his designated successor in the assumption of his
responsibilities, except that this clause (iii) shall not apply if the
parties have mutually agreed to extend the term of Norton's employment
beyond the Normal Termination Date (as defined in Section 3).

2. COMPENSATION; BENEFITS. During the term of his employment, FCA will provide
the following compensation and benefits to Norton:

a. BASE SALARY; EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT. FCA will pay to Norton an annual base
salary of $312,000, payable in bi-weekly installments, subject to normal
withholding. In addition, FCA will reimburse Norton for reasonable and
ordinary business expenses incurred by him in the performance of his
services to FCA, provided Norton keeps and renders to FCA such records as
FCA may reasonably require.

Page 189 of 196
<PAGE> 2
b. BONUS. Norton will be entitled to participate in FCA's Key Management
Incentive Plan or any incentive plan that replaces it (the "Incentive
Plan") on the same terms and conditions as FCA's other executive officers.

c. FRINGE BENEFITS. During the term of his employment, Norton will be
entitled to participate in any retirement plan, group term life insurance,
profit-sharing plan, group health and hospitalization coverage,
disability, club memberships, supplemental retirement plan, split-dollar
insurance, and other benefits that are currently provided to him and
continue to be provided to other executive officers of FCA during the term
of his employment. In addition, Norton will be entitled to the use of the
company car currently used by him, together with all car maintenance and
related expenses as have been paid by FCA in the past. To the extent any
of these benefits is contributory for other executive officers of FCA,
Norton will contribute to the cost of the benefits on the same terms as
other executive officers. Except as otherwise explicitly provided
elsewhere in this Agreement or required by applicable law, Norton will not
be entitled to continue to participate in any of the benefit plans and
arrangements referred to in this paragraph (c) for any period after the
effective termination of his employment. Without limiting the generality
of the immediately preceding sentence, the split dollar life insurance
arrangement currently maintained for Norton's benefit will end as of the
effective date of the termination of his employment for any reason other
than death.

d. STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK. Stock options previously granted to
Norton will become exercisable, and shares of restricted stock will vest,
in accordance with their terms, subject to the provisions of Section 4.

3. TERM OF EMPLOYMENT. Unless extended by the mutual agreement of the parties,
the term of Norton's employment will expire at the close of business on the
later of (i) the second anniversary date of the effective date of the
Acquisition and (ii) August 2, 1996 (the later of these dates is referred to
as the "Normal Termination Date"), subject to early termination as follows:

a. EARLY TERMINATION BY NORTON. Norton may, in his discretion, terminate his
employment effective as of August 1, 1995 by giving written notice of
termination to FCA on or before May 1, 1995. In any such event, Norton
will be entitled to the compensation and benefits set forth in Section
4(a) and Norton will also be entitled to spend a reasonable amount of time
during the period from May 1, 1995 through July 31, 1995 to search for
other employment.

2

Page 190 of 196
<PAGE> 3
b. EARLY TERMINATION BY FCA WITHOUT CAUSE. FCA may, in its discretion,
terminate Norton's employment at any time without cause, effective at such
time as FCA may provide in the notice of termination, in which event
Norton will be entitled to the compensation and benefits set forth in
Section 4(a).

c. EARLY TERMINATION BY FCA FOR CAUSE. FCA may terminate Norton's employment
at any time for cause, in which event Norton will be entitled to the
compensation and benefits set forth in Section 4(b). For this purpose,
"cause" means (i) dishonesty, theft, or fraud by Norton in connection with
his employment, (ii) material breach by Norton of his obligations under
this Agreement (including, without limitation, any persistent failure by
Norton to perform his duties under this Agreement, including the duties
set forth in Section 1), or (iii) material breach of his obligations under
Section 5. Any termination of Norton's employment for Cause shall be
effective immediately upon FCA giving notice of termination of employment
to Norton. However, if any breach or failure on Norton's part referred to
in clause (ii) of this Section 3(c) is curable, FCA shall not give Norton
notice of termination for Cause based upon that breach or failure unless
the Board has first given Norton written notice of that breach or failure
setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of the breach or failure and
the actions necessary to correct the breach or failure and Norton has
failed to effect a cure within 30 days of the receipt of that notice.

4. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS PAYABLE UPON EARLY TERMINATION.

a. EARLY TERMINATION BY NORTON; EARLY TERMINATION BY FCA WITHOUT CAUSE. In
the event Norton terminates his employment early in accordance with
Section 3(a), or in the event FCA terminates Norton's employment early
without cause, Norton will be entitled to receive the following
compensation and benefits: (i) FCA will continue to pay Norton's base
salary up to the Normal Termination Date, (ii) Norton will participate in
the Incentive Plan for any fiscal year completed prior to the effective
date of the termination of his employment (the "Early Termination Date"),
but not for any subsequent fiscal year, (iii) FCA will not provide Norton
with any fringe benefits referred to in Section 2(c) after the Early
Termination Date except that the group health and hospitalization coverage
and group term life insurance will continue until the earlier of the
Normal Termination Date or the date on which Norton first obtains other
employment that provides group health and hospitalization coverage or

3

Page 191 of 196
<PAGE> 4
group life insurance and (B) title to the company car currently used by 
Norton will be transferred to him, as soon as practicable after the Early
Termination Date, upon the assumption by him of responsibility for
insurance and other expenses related to the operation of the car, (iv)
stock options that would become exercisable after the Early Termination 
Date and on or before the Normal Termination Date if Norton's employment
continued through the Normal Termination Date will be accelerated so that
they become exercisable on the Early Termination Date and may be exercised
at any time within three months after the Early Termination Date (and the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of FCA will exercise its
discretion to permit such exercises during that three month period), but
stock options that are scheduled to become exercisable after the Normal
Termination Date will expire as of the Early Termination Date, (v) the
vesting of shares of restricted stock that would vest on or before the
Normal Termination Date if Norton's employment continued through the
Normal Termination Date will be accelerated so that those shares of
Restricted Stock will vest on the Early Termination Date, but shares of
restricted stock that are scheduled to vest after the Normal Termination
Date will be forfeited, and (vi) FCA will provide Norton with outplacement
services through a firm that is reasonably satisfactory to Norton.

b. EARLY TERMINATION BY FCA FOR CAUSE: EARLY TERMINATION BY NORTON OTHER
THAN PURSUANT TO SECTION 3(A). In the event FCA terminates Norton's
employment early for cause in accordance with Section 3(c), or Norton
terminates his employment early other than pursuant to Section 3(a),
Norton will be entitled to receive the following compensation and
benefits: (i) FCA will continue to pay Norton's base salary up to the
effective date of the termination of his employment, (ii) Norton will
participate in the Incentive Plan for any fiscal year completed prior to
the effective date of the termination of his employment, but not for any
subsequent fiscal year, (iii) FCA will provide Norton with the fringe
benefits referred to in Section 2(c) up to the effective date of the
termination of his employment, and (iv) any stock options that have not
been exercised on or before the effective date of the termination of his
employment will expire, and any shares of restricted stock that have not
vested on or before the effective date of the termination of his
employment will be forfeited.

c. EARLY TERMINATION DUE TO DISABILITY. In the event of the early
termination of Norton's employment due to disability that prevents him
from performing his duties under this Agreement, Norton will be entitled
to receive the same benefits that he would have been entitled to receive

4

Page 192 of 196
<PAGE> 5
under Section 4(a) (offset, in the case of continuing compensation 
payments, by the amount of any disability benefits payable to Norton under
any disability income insurance program sponsored by FCA), including
acceleration of the date on which stock options become exercisable and 
restricted stock vests.

d. EARLY TERMINATION DUE TO DEATH. If Norton's employment is terminated
before the Normal Termination Date as a result of Norton's death, (i)
stock options that would otherwise become exercisable after his death and
on or before the Normal Termination Date if Norton's employment continued
through the Normal Termination Date will be accelerated so that they
become exercisable on the date of death and may be exercised at any time
within three months after the date of death (and the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of FCA will exercise its discretion to
permit such exercises during that three month period), but stock options
that are scheduled to become exercisable after the Normal Termination Date
will expire as of the date of death, and (ii) the vesting of shares of
restricted stock that otherwise would vest on or before the Normal
Termination Date if Norton's employment continued through the Normal
Termination Date will be accelerated so that those shares of Restricted
Stock will vest on the date of death, but shares of restricted stock that
are scheduled to vest after the Normal Termination Date will be forfeited
as of the date of death, and (iii) none of the other benefits referred to
in Section 4(a) will be continued beyond the date of death.

5. COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE OR SOLICIT: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

a. COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE OR SOLICIT. During the term of Norton's
employment and for a period of three years thereafter (the "Noncompetition
Period"), Norton will not have any financial or other interest in or
become involved, directly or indirectly, as a proprietor, partner,
shareholder, officer, employee, consultant, or agent or in any other
capacity, with any person or organization listed on Exhibit A or with any
subsidiary, affiliate, franchise, partnership, joint venture, successor in
interest, or assign of any such person or organization. During the
Noncompetition Period, without the prior written consent of the Chief
Executive Officer of FCA, Norton will not recruit, solicit, or recommend
for employment any employee of FCA or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise
seek to induce any employee of FCA to terminate his or her employment with
FCA or any of its subsidiaries.

b. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Norton will not, at any time during or after
the term of his employment, disclose any confidential information gathered
or

5

Page 193 of 196
<PAGE> 6
learned by him in the course of his employment by FCA. Confidential 
information includes, but is not limited to, oral or written information 
regarding business plans, management reports, vendor agreements, store
performance records, and other information of a similar nature regarding 
FCA or its subsidiaries.

c. REMEDIES. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 3 and 4, in the
event of a material breach by Norton of his obligations under this Section
5, (i) FCA's obligation to provide compensation and benefits to Norton
will cease, any stock options that have not been exercised will expire,
and any shares of restricted stock that have not vested will be forfeited
and (ii) Norton will refund to FCA all compensation and the value of all
benefits provided to him after the effective date of the termination of
his employment pursuant to Section 4, including the value of all stock
options that were exercised after the effective date of the termination of
his employment and the value of all shares of restricted stock that vested
after the effective date of the termination of his employment. Norton
acknowledges that any breach of his obligations under this Section 5 would
result in irreparable harm to FCA that could not be adequately remedied by
an award of monetary damages; accordingly, Norton agrees that FCA will be
entitled to injunctive relief to enforce his obligations under this
Section 5, in addition to any other rights or remedies that FCA may have
at law or in equity, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

6. RELATIONSHIP TO CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT. Norton and FCA are parties to
an employment agreement dated November 30, 1988 (the "Change of Control
Agreement") intended to become operative only upon the occurrence of a
"Change of Control" (as defined in that agreement).

a. The Acquisition shall not be treated as a Change of Control for purposes
of this Agreement or the Change of Control Agreement and, if the
Acquisition would otherwise constitute a Change of Control for those
purposes, the Change of Control Agreement is hereby amended so that the
Acquisition will not constitute such a Change of Control.

b. If a Change of Control occurs during the term of Norton's employment under
this Agreement, Norton shall thereafter be entitled to assert rights under
either (i) this Agreement or (ii) the Change of Control Agreement but not
under both. If Norton asserts rights under either this Agreement or the
Change of Control Agreement, he shall thereupon forfeit his rights under
the other agreement.

6

Page 194 of 196
<PAGE> 7
c. If Norton's employment is terminated for whatever reason before a Change
of Control occurs, the Change of Control Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect.

7. MISCELLANEOUS. If Norton's employment with FCA ends on the Normal
Termination Date, (a) the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
of FCA will exercise its discretion to permit the exercise, at any time
during the three month period after the Normal Termination Date, of any
stock options that were exercisable on the Normal Termination Date, and (b)
FCA will provide Norton with outplacement services through a firm that is
reasonably satisfactory to Norton. FCA will pay the reasonable fees of
Norton's counsel incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution
of this Agreement. If Norton's employment with FCA terminates before the
Normal Termination Date under circumstances entitling Norton to continuation
of health and hospitalization coverage under this Agreement, FCA will
provide Norton the right to continue health and hospitalization coverage, at
his expense, as generally required by the Consolidated Omnibus
Reconciliation Act of 1985, for a period of 18 months after the Normal
Termination Date. This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced in
accordance with Ohio law. This Agreement expresses the entire understanding
between the parties on its subject matter and, except as provided in Section
6, above, supersedes all prior understandings between them on that subject
matter. The obligations of the parties under this Agreement are subject to
the consummation of the Acquisition; in the event the Acquisition is not
consummated by November 30, 1994, this Agreement will be void.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, FCA and Norton have signed this Agreement as of the date
first above written.
