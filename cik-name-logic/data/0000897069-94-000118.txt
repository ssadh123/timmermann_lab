Item 5. Other Events.

On May 14, 1994, the shareholders of Harley-Davidson, Inc. (the
"Company") approved a proposed restructuring of the Company's Motorcycle
Division. On November 28, 1994, the Company effected certain actions
pursuant to that authority. Prior to November 28, the Company held
substantially all the assets of its Motorcycle Division directly and held
the assets of its Transportation Vehicles Division separately through
Holiday Rambler. As a result of asset and liability transfers on November
28, (i) H-D Michigan, Inc., a newly-formed Michigan corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Michigan"), now holds
substantially all Harley-Davidson trademark rights and copyrights and
certain other intellectual property rights previously owned by the Company
and (ii) Harley-Davidson Motor Company, a newly-formed Wisconsin
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Michigan ("Motor"), owns
substantially all of the other assets of the Motorcycle Division that were
previously owned directly by the Company and has assumed related
liabilities. Among other things, Motor now owns the office, manufacturing
and testing facilities, machinery and equipment in Milwaukee and Tomahawk,
Wisconsin, York, Pennsylvania, and Talladega, Alabama, and substantially
all of the employees of the Motorcycle Division have been transferred to
Motor.
