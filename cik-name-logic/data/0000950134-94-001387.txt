ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On November 1, 1994, Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. ("the Company")
purchased the Summerfield Apartments, a 224 unit apartment complex in Orlando,
Florida for $5.6 million, exclusive of commissions and closing costs. The
Company paid $800,000 in cash and assumed a first mortgage in the amount of
$4.8 million. The mortgage bears interest at a variable rate and requires
monthly payments of principal and interest of $43,240. The mortgage matures in
March 2024. The $5.6 million purchase price of the Summerfield Apartments is
approximately 3.0% of the Company's consolidated assets at December 31, 1993.
Although not a significant acquisition in itself, when aggregated with the
other acquisitions completed by the Company in 1994, as described below, such
acquisitions constitute a significant acquisition.

In addition to the Summerfield Apartments acquisition discussed above, the
Company has purchased three industrial properties and two office buildings in
1994. The three industrial properties and one of the office buildings are
located in Virginia, and the other office building is located in Dallas, Texas.
The properties were purchased for a total of $21.7 million and represent
approximately 9.4% of the Company's consolidated assets at December 31, 1993.
The Company paid a total of $3.7 million in cash and financed the remainder of
the purchase prices. The mortgages secured by the properties bear interest at
rates ranging from 6.0% to 10.0% per annum and mature in 1999 and 2006. Two of
these acquisitions occurred prior to September 30, 1994 and are accordingly
reflected in the September 30, 1994 "actual balance sheet" of the Company, as
presented.

In 1994, the Company has also sold one apartment complex, one office building,
its general partnership interest in two partnerships and its limited partner
interest in one partnership. In connection with the sales, the Company
received cash totaling $1.6 million and provided an additional $100,000 in
purchase money financing. These sales all occurred prior to September 30, 1994
and are accordingly reflected in the Company's "actual balance sheet" as of
September 30, 1994, as presented.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Partners
Griffin Orlando, A Limited Partnership
Minneapolis, Minnesota

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of SUMMERFIELD APARTMENTS OF
GRIFFIN ORLANDO, A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (HUD Project Number 067-10561) as of
December 31, 1993, and the related statements of profit and loss, changes in
Project equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Project's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
and Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of SUMMERFIELD APARTMENTS as of
December 31, 1993, and the results of its operations and its changes in Project
equity and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Our audit for the year ended December 31, 1993, was conducted for the purpose
of forming an opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole. The
supporting information included in the report (shown on pages 10 to 13) are
presented for the purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of
the basic financial statements of SUMMERFIELD APARTMENTS. Such information has
been subjected to the audit procedures applied in the audit of the financial
statements and, in our opinion, is fairly presented in all material respects in
relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.

The accompanying financial statements and supplementary information have been
prepared assuming that the entity will continue as a going concern. Because of
operating losses and negative current ratio, conditions raise substantial doubt
about the ability of SUMMERFIELD APARTMENTS to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements and supplementary information do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Summerfield Apartments - Summerfield Apartments (the 
"Project") is a 224 unit apartment complex located in Orlando, Florida 
owned and operated by Griffin Orlando, A Limited Partnership (the 
"Partnership"). The Partnership contributed $2,554,802 for the purchase
of the Project on March 14, 1984.

Basis of Presentation - The accompanying financial statements and 
supplemental schedules are presented in the format prescribed by the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD").

Property and Depreciation - Property is stated at cost and is 
depreciated using the straight-line method over its estimated useful 
life (buildings, 40 years; furnishings and equipment, 5 years). For 
tax purposes, the Partnership depreciates the buildings over 15, 18, 19
and 27.5 years using the Accelerated Cost Recovery System and the 
Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System.

Income Taxes - The financial statements of the Project do not include a
provision for income taxes as the income and losses of the Project are
allocated to the individual partners of the Partnership for inclusion 
in their tax returns.

Rental Revenues - Rental revenue is recognized in the period earned.

2. Organization

partner, GO Associates, a Minnesota general partnership, to acquire
existing, income-producing real properties for rental purposes. GO

the sale of the Partnership properties, are allocated 95% to

5. Contingencies - Going Concern

As shown in the accompanying form HUD-92410 statement of profit and
loss, the project incurred a net loss of $219,680 during the year
ended December 31, 1993, and as of that date, the project's current
liabilities exceeded its current assets by $163,413. These factors
create an uncertainty about the project's ability to continue as a
going concern. The ability of the project to continue as a going
concern is dependent on improved tenant occupancy and improved
operations of the project. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might be necessary if the project is unable to
continue as a going concern.
