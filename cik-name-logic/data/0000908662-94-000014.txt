FLEET FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

Underwriting Agreement

New York, New York
August 30, 1994

To the Representatives
named in Schedule I
hereto of the Under-
writers named in Schedule II
hereto

Dear Sirs:

Fleet Financial Group, Inc., a Rhode Island 
corporation (the "Company"), proposes to sell to the 
underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), 
for whom you are acting as representatives (the 
"Representatives"), the principal amount of its debt securities 
identified in Schedule I hereto (the "Debt Securities"), to be 
issued under an indenture dated as of October 1, 1992, (the 
"Indenture") between the Company and the trustee named in 
Schedule I hereto (the "Trustee"). If so indicated on Schedule 
I hereto, the Company also proposes to issue warrants (the 
"Warrants") to purchase the aggregate principal amount listed 
in Schedule I hereto of the debt securities identified in 
Schedule I hereto (the "Warrant Securities"). The Warrants, if 
any, are to be issued pursuant to the Warrant Agreement listed 
in Schedule I hereto (the "Warrant Agreement") between the 
Company and the Warrant Agent listed in Schedule I hereto (the 
"Warrant Agent"). The Debt Securities and the Warrants, if 
any, are hereinafter referred to as the "Purchased 
Securities". The Purchased Securities and the Warrant 
Securities are referred to herein as the "Securities". If the 
firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the 
firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms 
"Underwriters" and "Representatives", as used herein, shall 
each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms.

1. Representations and Warranties. The Company 
represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter 
as set forth below in this Section 1. Certain terms used in 
this Section 1 are defined in paragraph (c) hereof.

(a) If the offering of the Securities is a Delayed 
Offering (as specified in Schedule I hereto), paragraph (i) 
below is applicable and, if the offering of the Securities 
is a Non-Delayed Offering (as so specified), paragraph (ii) 
below is applicable.

(i) The Company meets the requirements for the 
use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the 
"Act") and has filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement 
(the file number of which is set forth in Schedule I 
hereto) on such Form, including a basic prospectus, 
for registration under the Act of the offering and 
sale of the Securities. The Company may have filed 
one or more amendments thereto, and may have used a 
Preliminary Final Prospectus, each of which has 
previously been furnished to you. Such registration 
statement, as so amended, has become effective. The 
offering of the Securities is a Delayed Offering and, 
accordingly, it is not necessary that any further 
information with respect to the Securities and the 
offering thereof required by the Act and the rules 
thereunder to be included in the Final Prospectus have 
been included in an amendment to such registration 
statement prior to the Effective Date. The Company 
will next file with the Commission pursuant to Rules 
415 and 424(b) (2) or (5) a final supplement to the 
form of prospectus included in such registration 
statement relating to the Securities and the offering 
thereof. As filed, such final prospectus supplement 
shall include all required information with respect to 
the Securities and the offering thereof and, except to 
the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing 
to a modification, shall be in all substantive 
respects in the form furnished to you prior to the 
Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the 
Execution Time, shall contain only such specific 
additional information and other changes (beyond that 
contained in the Basic Prospectus and any Preliminary 
Final Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, 
prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made 
therein.

(ii) The Company meets the requirements for the 
use of Form S-3 under the Act and has filed with the 
Commission a registration statement (the file number 
of which is set forth in Schedule I hereto) on such 
Form, including a basic prospectus, for registration 
under the Act of the offering and sale of the 
Securities. The Company may have filed one or more 
amendments thereto, including a Preliminary Final 
Prospectus, each of which has previously been 
furnished to you. The Company will next file with the 
Commission either (x) a final prospectus supplement 
relating to the Securities in accordance with Rules 
430A and 424(b)(l) or (4), or (y) prior to the 
effectiveness of such registration statement, an 
amendment to such registration statement, including 
the form of final prospectus supplement. In the case 
of clause (x), the Company has included in such 
registration statement, as amended at the Effective 
Date, all information (other than Rule 430A 
Information) required by the Act and the rules 
thereunder to be included in the Final Prospectus with 
respect to the Securities and the offering thereof. 
As filed, such final prospectus supplement or such 
amendment and form of final prospectus supplement 
shall contain all Rule 430A Information, together with 
all other such required information, with respect to 
the Securities and the offering thereof and, except to 
the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing 
to a modification, shall be in all substantive 
respects in the form furnished to you prior to the 
Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the 
Execution Time, shall contain only such specific 
additional information and other changes (beyond that 
contained in the Basic Prospectus and any Preliminary 
Final Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, 
prior to the Execution Time, will be included or made 
therein.

(b) On the Effective Date, the Registration Statement 
did or will, and when the Final Prospectus is first filed 
(if required) in accordance with Rule 424(b) and on the 
Closing Date, the Final Prospectus (and any supplement 
thereto) will, comply in all material respects with the 
applicable requirements of the Act and the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the 
respective rules thereunder; on the Effective Date, the 
Registration Statement did not or will not contain any 
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any 
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in 
order to make the statements therein not misleading; on the 
Effective Date and on the Closing Date the Indenture did or 
will comply in all material respects with the requirements 
of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust 
Indenture Act"), and the rules thereunder; and, on the 
Effective Date, the Final Prospectus, if not filed pursuant 
to Rule 424(b), did not or will not, and on the date of any 
filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the 
Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) 
will not, include any untrue statement of a material fact 
or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make 
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances 
under which they were made, not misleading; provided, 
however, that the Company makes no representations or 
warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration 
Statement which shall constitute the Statement of 
Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust 
Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information 
contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or 
the Final Prospectus (or any supplement thereto) in 
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished 
in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any 
Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for 
use in connection with the preparation of the Registration 
Statement or the Final Prospectus (or any supplement 
thereto).

(c) The terms which follow, when used in this 
Agreement, shall have the meanings indicated. The term 
"the Effective Date" shall mean each date that the 
Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment or 
amendments thereto became or become effective. "Execution 
Time" shall mean the date and time that this Agreement is 
executed and delivered by the parties hereto. "Basic 
Prospectus" shall mean the prospectus referred to in 
paragraph (a) above contained in the Registration Statement 
at the Effective Date including, in the case of a 
Non-Delayed Offering, any Preliminary Final Prospectus. 
"Preliminary Final Prospectus" shall mean any preliminary 
prospectus supplement to the Basic Prospectus which 
describes the Securities and the offering thereof and is 
used prior to filing of the Final Prospectus. "Final 
Prospectus" shall mean the prospectus supplement relating 
to the Securities that is first filed pursuant to Rule 
424(b) after the Execution Time, together with the Basic 
Prospectus or, if, in the case of a Non-Delayed Offering, 
no filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) is required, shall mean 
the form of final prospectus relating to the Securities, 
including the Basic Prospectus, included in the 
Registration Statement at the Effective Date. 
"Registration Statement" shall mean the registration 
statement referred to in paragraph (a) above, including 
incorporated documents, exhibits and financial statements, 
as amended at the Execution Time (or, if not effective at 
the Execution Time, in the form in which it shall become 
effective) and, in the event any post-effective amendment 
thereto becomes effective prior to the Closing Date (as 
hereinafter defined), shall also mean such registration 
statement as so amended. Such term shall include any Rule 
430A Information deemed to be included therein at the 
Effective Date as provided by Rule 430A. "Rule 415", "Rule 
424", "Rule 430A" and "Regulation S-K" refer to such rules 
or regulation under the Act. "Rule 430A Information" means 
information with respect to the Securities and the offering 
thereof permitted to be omitted from the Registration 
Statement when it becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430A. 
Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the 
Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the 
Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include 
the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to 
Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act 
on or before the Effective Date of the Registration 
Statement or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any 
Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as 
the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms 
"amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the 
Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any 
Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall 
be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any 
document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of 
the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Basic 
Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final 
Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated 
therein by reference. A "Non-Delayed Offering" shall mean 
an offering of securities which is intended to commence 
promptly after the effective date of a registration 
statement, with the result that, pursuant to Rules 415 and 
430A, all information (other than Rule 430A Information) 
with respect to the securities so offered must be included 
in such registration statement at the effective date 
thereof. A "Delayed Offering" shall mean an offering of 
securities pursuant to Rule 415 which does not commence 
promptly after the effective date of a registration 
statement, with the result that only information required 
pursuant to Rule 415 need be included in such registration 
statement at the effective date thereof with respect to the 
securities so offered. Whether the offering of the 
Securities is a Non-Delayed Offering or a Delayed Offering 
shall be set forth in Schedule I hereto.

2. Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and 
conditions and in reliance upon the representations and 
warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each 
Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not 
jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the purchase price 
set forth in Schedule I hereto the principal amount of the 
Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in 
Schedule II hereto, except that, if Schedule I hereto provides 
for the sale of Securities pursuant to delayed delivery 
arrangements, the respective principal amounts of Securities to 
be purchased by the Underwriters shall be as set forth in 
Schedule II hereto less the respective amounts of Contract 
Securities determined as provided below. Securities to be 
purchased by the Underwriters are herein sometimes called the 
"Underwriters' Securities" and Securities to be purchased 
pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts as hereinafter provided 
are herein called "Contract Securities".

If so provided in Schedule I hereto, the Underwriters 
are authorized to solicit offers to purchase Securities from 
the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts ("Delayed 
Delivery Contracts"), substantially in the form of Schedule III 
hereto but with such changes therein as the Company may 
authorize or approve. The Underwriters will endeavor to make 
such arrangements and, as compensation therefor, the Company 
will pay to the Representatives, for the account of the 
Underwriters, on the Closing Date, the percentage set forth in 
Schedule I hereto of the principal amount of the Securities for 
which Delayed Delivery Contracts are made. Delayed Delivery 
Contracts are to be with institutional investors, including 
commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension 
funds, investment companies and educational and charitable 
institutions. The Company will enter into Delayed Delivery 
Contracts in all cases where sales of Contract Securities 
arranged by the Underwriters have been approved by the Company 
but, except as the Company may otherwise agree, each such 
Delayed Delivery Contract must be for not less than the minimum 
principal amount set forth in Schedule I hereto and the 
aggregate principal amount of Contract Securities may not 
exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount set forth in 
Schedule I hereto. The Underwriters will not have any 
responsibility in respect of the validity or performance of 
Delayed Delivery Contracts. The principal amount of Securities 
to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule II 
hereto shall be reduced by an amount which shall bear the same 
proportion to the total principal amount of Contract Securities 
as the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the 
name of such Underwriter bears to the aggregate principal 
amount set forth in Schedule II hereto, except to the extent 
that you determine that such reduction shall be otherwise than 
in such proportion and so advise the Company in writing; 
provided, however, that the total principal amount of 
Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters shall be the 
aggregate principal amount set forth in Schedule II hereto less 
the aggregate principal amount of Contract Securities.

3. Delivery and Payment. Delivery of and payment 
for the Underwriters' Securities shall be made on the date and 
at the time specified in Schedule I hereto (or such later date 
not later than five business days after such specified date as 
the Representatives shall designate), which date and time may 
be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the 
Company or as provided in Section 8 hereof (such date and time 
of delivery and payment for the Underwriters' Securities being 
herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the 
Underwriters' Securities shall be made to the Representatives 
for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against 
payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives 
of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the 
Company by either certified or official bank check or checks 
drawn on or by a New York Clearing House bank and payable in 
next day funds or in Federal or similar same day funds as set 
forth in Schedule I. Delivery of the Underwriters' Securities 
shall be made at such location as the Representatives shall 
reasonably designate at least one business day in advance of 
the Closing Date and payment for the Securities shall be made 
at the office specified in Schedule I hereto. Certificates for 
the Underwriters' Securities shall be registered in such names 
and in such denominations as the Representatives may request 
not less than three full business days in advance of the 
Closing Date.

The Company agrees to have the Underwriters' 
Securities available for inspection, checking and packaging by 
the Representatives in New York, New York, not later than 1:00 
p.m. on the business day prior to the Closing Date.

4. Agreements. The Company agrees with the several 
Underwriters that:

(a) The Company will use its best efforts to cause 
the Registration Statement, if not effective at the 
Execution Time, and any amendment thereto, to become 
effective. Prior to the termination of the offering of the 
Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the 
Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final 
Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the 
Basic Prospectus unless the Company has furnished you a 
copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any 
such proposed amendment or supplement to which you 
reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the 
Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly 
completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the 
Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 
424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide 
evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely 
filing. The Company will promptly advise the 
Representatives (i) when the Registration Statement, if not 
effective at the Execution Time, and any amendment thereto, 
shall have become effective, (ii) when the Final 
Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been 
filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (iii) 
when, prior to termination of the offering of the 
Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement 
shall have been filed or become effective, (iv) of any 
request by the Commission for any amendment of the 
Registration Statement or supplement to the Final 
Prospectus or for any additional information, (v) of the 
issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the 
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the 
institution or threatening of any proceeding for that 
purpose and (vi) of the receipt by the Company of any 
notification with respect to the suspension of the 
qualification of the Securities for sale in any 
jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any 
proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best 
efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, 
if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal 
thereof.

(b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the 
Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any 
event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as 
then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a 
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary 
to make the statements therein in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or 
if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration 
Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with 
the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules 
thereunder, the Company promptly will prepare and file with 
the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph 
(a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which 
will correct such statement or omission or effect such 
compliance.

(c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make 
generally available to its security holders and to the 
Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the 
Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the 
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under 
the Act.

(d) The Company will furnish to the Representatives 
and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of 
the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) 
and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter 
or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of any 
Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and 
any supplement thereto as the Representatives may 
reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of 
printing or other production of all documents relating to 
the offering.

(e) The Company will arrange for the qualification of 
the Securities for sale under the laws of such 
jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will 
maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required 
for the distribution of the Securities and will arrange for 
the determination of the legality of the Securities for 
purchase by institutional investors.

(f) Until the business day following the Closing 
Date, the Company will not, without the consent of the 
Representatives, offer, sell or contract to sell, or 
announce the offering of, any senior debt securities.

(g) The Company confirms as of the date hereof that 
it has complied with all provisions of Section 1 of Laws of 
Florida, Chapter 92-198, An Act Relating to Disclosure of 
Doing Business with Cuba, and the Company further agrees 
that if it commences engaging in business with the 
government of Cuba or with any person or affiliate located 
in Cuba after the date the Registration Statement becomes 
or has become effective with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission or with the Florida Department of Banking and 
Finance (the "Department"), whichever date is later, or if 
the information reported in the Prospectus, if any, 
concerning the Company's business with Cuba or with any 
person or affiliate located in Cuba changes in any material 
way, the Company will provide the Department notice of such 
business or change, as appropriate, in a form acceptable to 
the Department.

5. Conditions to the Obligations of the 
Underwriters. The obligations of the Underwriters to 
purchase the Underwriters' Securities shall be subject to 
the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the 
part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution 
Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the 
statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant 
to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company 
of its obligations hereunder and to the following 
additional conditions:

(a) If the Registration Statement has not become 
effective prior to the Execution Time, unless the 
Representatives agree in writing to a later time, the 
Registration Statement will become effective not later than 
(i) 6:00 p.m. New York City time, on the date of 
determination of the public offering price, if such 
determination occurred at or prior to 3:00 p.m. New York 
City time on such date or (ii) 12:00 Noon on the business 
day following the day on which the public offering price 
was determined, if such determination occurred after 3:00 
p.m. New York City time on such date; if filing of the 
Final Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, is required 
pursuant to Rule 424(b), the Final Prospectus, and any such 
supplement, shall have been filed in the manner and within 
the time period required by Rule 424(b); and no stop order 
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement 
shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose 
shall have been instituted or threatened.

(b) The Company shall have furnished to the 
Representatives the opinion of Edwards & Angell, counsel 
for the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:

(i) each of the Company and Fleet National Bank 
("Fleet Bank-RI") and any other subsidiary or 
subsidiaries which the Representatives may reasonably 
request (individually a "Subsidiary" and collectively 
the "Subsidiaries") has been duly incorporated and is 
validly existing as a corporation or national banking 
association in good standing under the laws of the 
jurisdiction in which it is chartered or organized, 
with full corporate power and authority to own its 
properties and conduct its business as described in

do business as a foreign corporation under the laws of 
the State of New York and neither the Company nor 
Fleet Bank-RI or any such other Subsidiaries is

company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as 
amended;

(ii) all the outstanding shares of the capital 
stock of Fleet Bank-RI and any such other Subsidiaries 
have been duly and validly authorized and issued and 
are fully paid and (except as provided in 12 U.S.C. 
Section 55) nonassessable, and, except as otherwise set 
forth or incorporated by reference in the Final 
Prospectus, all outstanding shares of capital stock of 
Fleet Bank-RI and such other Subsidiaries are owned by 
the Company free and clear of any perfected security 
interest and, to the knowledge of such counsel, after 
due inquiry, any other security interests, claims, 
liens or encumbrances;

(iii) the Purchased Securities conform to the 
description thereof contained in the Final Prospectus; 
and, if the Securities are to be listed on any stock 
exchange, authorization therefor has been given, 
subject to official notice of issuance and evidence of 
satisfactory distribution, or the Company has filed a

authorized for listing, subject to official notice of 
issuance and evidence of satisfactory distribution;

(iv) the Indenture and the Warrant Agreement, if 
any, have been duly authorized, executed and

remedies which are discretionary with the courts); and 
the Securities have been duly authorized and, when

Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement, in the case 
of the Underwriters' Securities, or by the purchasers 
thereof pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, in the 
case of any Contract Securities, will constitute 
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company 
entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;

(v) to the best knowledge of such counsel, there 
is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding 
before any court or governmental agency, authority or 
body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries, of a character required to be 
disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not 
adequately disclosed in the Final Prospectus, and 
there is no franchise, contract or other document of a 
character required to be described in the Registration 
Statement or Final Prospectus, or to be filed as an 
exhibit, which is not described or filed as required;

(vi) the Registration Statement has become 
effective under the Act; any required filing of the 
Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and 
the Final Prospectus, and any supplements thereto, 
pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner 
and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); to 
the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop order 
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration 
Statement has been issued, no proceedings for that 
purpose have been instituted or threatened, and the 
Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other 
than the financial statements and other financial and 
statistical information contained therein as to which 
such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to 
form in all material respects with the applicable 
requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the 
respective rules thereunder; and such counsel has no 
reason to believe that at the Effective Date the 
Registration Statement contained any untrue statement 
of a material fact or omitted to state any material 
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to 
make the statements therein not misleading or that at 
the Closing Date the Final Prospectus includes any 
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state 
a material fact necessary to make the statements 
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which 
they were made, not misleading;

(vii) this Agreement and any Delayed Delivery 
Contracts have been duly authorized, executed and 
delivered by the Company;

(viii) without expressing any opinion with 
respect to the Warrant Securities, no consent, 
approval, authorization or order of any court or 
governmental agency or body is required for the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein 
or in any Delayed Delivery Contracts, except such as 
have been obtained under the Act and such as may be 
required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction 
in connection with the purchase and distribution of 
the Securities by the Underwriters and such other 
approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been 
obtained;

(ix) neither the issue and sale of the 
Securities, nor the consummation of any other of the 
transactions herein contemplated nor the fulfillment 
of the terms hereof or of any Delayed Delivery 
Contracts will conflict with, result in a breach of, 
or constitute a default under the charter or by-laws 
of the Company or the terms of any indenture or other 
agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to 
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a 
party or bound, or any order or regulation known to 
such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, 
administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator 
having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries; and

(x) no holders of securities of the Company have 
rights to the registration of such securities under 
the Registration Statement.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to 
matters involving the application of laws of any 
jurisdiction other than the State of Rhode Island or the 
United States, to the extent deemed proper and specified in 
such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel of good 
standing believed to be reliable and who are satisfactory 
to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of 
fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of 
responsible officers of the Company and public officials. 
References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph (b) 
include any supplements thereto at the Closing Date.

(c) The Representatives shall have received from 
Cravath, Swaine & Moore, counsel for the Underwriters, such 
opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect 
to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, 
any Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Registration Statement, 
the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) 
and other related matters as the Representatives may 
reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to 
such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose 
of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

(d) The Company shall have furnished to the 
Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the 
Chairman of the Board, the President or any Executive Vice 
President and the principal financial or accounting officer 
or treasurer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the 
effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully 
examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, 
any supplement to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement 
and that:

(i) the representations and warranties of the 
Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all 
material respects on and as of the Closing Date with 
the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the 
Company has complied with all the agreements and 
satisfied all the conditions on its part to be 
performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;

(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness 
of the Registration Statement has been issued and no 
proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, 
to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and

(iii) since the date of the most recent financial 
statements included in the Final Prospectus (exclusive 
of any supplement thereto), there has been no material 
adverse change in the condition (financial or other), 
earnings, business or properties of the Company and 
its subsidiaries, whether or not arising from 
transactions in the ordinary course of business, 
except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final 
Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).

(e) At the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, KPMG 
Peat Marwick shall have furnished to the Representatives a 
letter or letters (which may refer to letters previously 
delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated as 
of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to 
the Representatives, confirming that they are independent 
accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange 
Act and the respective applicable published rules and 
regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:

(i) in their opinion the audited consolidated 
financial statements and financial statement schedules 
included or incorporated in the Registration Statement 
and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them 
comply in form in all material respects with the 
applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the 
Exchange Act and the related published rules and 
regulations;

(ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest 
unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements 
made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; 
carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an 
audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters 
of significance with respect to the comments set forth 
in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the 
meetings of the stockholders, directors and the 
executive and audit committees of the Company; and 
inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have 
responsibility for financial and accounting matters of 
the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions 
and events subsequent to the date of the most recent 
audited financial statements in or incorporated in 
the Final Prospectus, nothing came to their attention 
which caused them to believe that:

(1) the amounts in the unaudited "Summary 
Consolidated Financial Data", if any, included in 
the Final Prospectus do not agree with the 
corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated 
condensed financial statements or analyses 
prepared by the Company from which such amounts 
were derived; or

(2) any unaudited consolidated financial 
statements included or incorporated in the 
Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus 
do not comply in form in all material respects 
with applicable accounting requirements and with 
the published rules and regulations of the 
Commission with respect to financial statements 
included or incorporated in quarterly reports on 
Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said 
unaudited consolidated condensed financial 
statements are not in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles applied on a basis 
substantially consistent with that of the audited 
consolidated financial statements included or 
incorporated in the Registration Statement and 
the Final Prospectus;

(3) with respect to the period subsequent to 
the date of the most recent consolidated 
financial statements (other than any capsule 
information), audited or unaudited, in or 
incorporated in the Registration Statement and 
the Final Prospectus, there were any changes, at 
a specified date not more than five business days 
prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term 
debt of the Company or capital stock of the 
Company or decreases in the stockholders' equity 
of the Company as compared with the amounts shown 
on the most recent consolidated balance sheet 
included or incorporated in the Registration 
Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the 
period from the date of the most recent 
consolidated financial statements included or 
incorporated in the Registration Statement and 
the Final Prospectus to such specified date there 
were any decreases, as compared with the 
corresponding period in the preceding year; in 
consolidated net interest income, consolidated 
net interest income after provision for possible 
loan losses, consolidated income before income 
taxes or in total or per share amounts of 
consolidated net income of the Company, except in 
all instances for changes or decreases set forth 
in such letter, in which case the letter shall be 
accompanied by an explanation by the Company as 
to the significance thereof unless said 
explanation is not deemed necessary by the 
Representatives; or

(4) the amounts included in any unaudited 
"capsule" information included or incorporated in 
the Registration Statement and the Final 
Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set 
forth in the unaudited financial statements for 
the same periods or were not determined on a 
basis substantially consistent with that of the 
corresponding amounts in the audited financial 
statements included or incorporated in the 
Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; 
and

(iii) they have performed certain other specified 
procedures as a result of which they determined that 
certain information of an accounting, financial or 
statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, 
financial or statistical information derived from the 
general accounting records of the Company and its 
subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement 
and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the 
Registration Statement, including the information set 
forth under the captions "Fleet Financial Group, 
Inc.", "Recent Developments" and "Consolidated Ratios 
of Earnings to Fixed Charges" in the Final Prospectus, 
the information included or incorporated in Items 1, 6 
and 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K 
incorporated in the Registration Statement and the 
Prospectus, and the information included in the 
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations" included or 
incorporated in the Company's Quarterly Reports on 
Form 10-Q, incorporated in the Registration Statement 
and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting 
records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding 
any questions of legal interpretation.

References to the Final Prospectus in this 
paragraph (e) include any supplement thereto at the date of 
the letter.

(f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, 
the dates as of which information is given in the 
Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) 
and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement 
thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or 
decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in 
paragraph (e) of this Section 5 or (ii) any change, or any 
development involving a prospective change, in or affecting 
the business or properties of the Company and its 
subsidiaries the effect of which, in any case referred to 
in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the judgment of the 
Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it 
impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or 
the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the 
Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) 
and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement 
thereto).

(g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not 
have been any decrease in the ratings of any of the 
Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized 
statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes 
of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any 
intended or potential decrease in any such rating.

(h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have 
furnished to the Representatives such further information, 
certificates and documents (including an opinion of counsel 
for the Company with respect to the foreign qualification 
of specified subsidiaries) as the Representatives may 
reasonably request.

(i) The Company shall have accepted Delayed Delivery 
Contracts in any case where sales of Contract Securities 
arranged by the Underwriters have been approved by the 
Company.

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 
shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and 
as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and 
certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement 
shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory 
in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for 
the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the 
Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior 
to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such 
cancelation shall be given to the Company in writing or by 
telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.

6. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the 
sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated 
because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters 
set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied or because of 
any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to 
perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision 
hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the 
Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters 
severally upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including 
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have 
been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase 
and sale of the Securities.

7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The 
Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter 
and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning 
of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all 
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to 
which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the 
Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or 
regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, 
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) 
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged 
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the 
registration statement for the registration of the Securities 
as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the 
Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final 
Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, 
or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged 
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated 
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not 
misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified 
party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably 
incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending 
any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, 
however, that (i) the Company will not be liable in any such 
case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or 
liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue 
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged 
omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with 
written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of 
any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for 
use in connection with the preparation thereof, and (ii) such 
indemnity with respect to the Basic Prospectus or any 
Preliminary Final Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of 
any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) 
from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or 
liability purchased the Securities which are the subject 
thereof if such person did not receive a copy of the Final 
Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as supplemented) excluding 
documents incorporated therein by reference at or prior to the 
confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person in 
any case where such delivery is required by the Act and the 
untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in 
the Basic Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus was 
corrected in the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as 
supplemented). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to 
any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify 
and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of 
its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each 
person who controls the Company within the meaning of either 
the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the 
foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but 
only with reference to written information relating to such 
Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such 
Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in 
the preparation of the documents referred to in the foregoing 
indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any 
liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The 
Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last 
paragraph of the cover page, under the heading "Underwriting" 
or "Plan of Distribution" and, if Schedule I hereto provides 
for sales of Securities pursuant to delayed delivery 
arrangements, in the last sentence under the heading "Delayed 
Delivery Arrangements" in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or 
the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished 
in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for 
inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing 
indemnity, and you, as the Representatives, confirm that such 
statements are correct.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party 
under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any 
action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect 
thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this 
Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the 
commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the 
indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which 
it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this 
Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any 
indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of 
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be 
entitled to appoint counsel satisfactory to such indemnified 
party to represent the indemnified party in such action; 
provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action 
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party 
and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that 
there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other 
indemnified parties which are different from or additional to 
those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified 
party or parties shall have the right to select separate 
counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified 
party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying 
party to such indemnified party of its election so to appoint 
counsel to defend such action and approval by the indemnified 
party of such counsel, the indemnifying party will not be 
liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any 
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such 
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless 
(i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel 
in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence 
(it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party 
shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate 
counsel (plus any local counsel), approved by the 
Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 7, 
representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) 
who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party 
shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified 
party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable 
time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the 
indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for 
the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; 
and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such 
liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to 
in such clause (i) or (iii).

(d) In order to provide for just and equitable 
contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification 
provided for in paragraph (a) of this Section 7 is due in 
accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court 
to be unavailable from the Company on grounds of policy or 
otherwise, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to 
the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities 
(including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in 
connection with investigating or defending same) to which the 
Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in 
such proportion so that the Underwriters are responsible for 
that portion represented by the percentage that the 
underwriting discount bears to the sum of such discount and the 
purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedule I hereto 
and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, 
however, that (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as 
may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to 
the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount 
in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the 
Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no 
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the 
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to 
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such 
fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, 
each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of 
the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such 
Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within 
the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer 
of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement 
and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to 
contribution as the Company, subject in each case to clauses 
(y) and (z) of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to 
contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of 
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such 
party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made 
against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), 
notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be 
sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties 
shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution 
may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have 
hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d).

8. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more 
Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the 
Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or 
Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall 
constitute a default in the performance of its or their 
obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters 
shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the 
respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth 
opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the 
aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of 
all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the 
defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to 
purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the 
aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter 
or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% 
of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II 
hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to 
purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase 
any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters 
do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will 
terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or 
the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as 
set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be 
postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the 
Representatives shall determine in order that the required 
changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus 
or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. 
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any 
defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company 
and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its 
default hereunder.

9. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to 
termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, 
by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment 
for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in the 
Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the 
Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in 
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have 
been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been 
established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall 
have been declared either by Federal or New York, Rhode Island, 
Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire or Massachusetts state 
authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or 
escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of 
a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis the 
effect of which on the financial markets is such as to make it, 
in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or 
inadvisable to market the Securities.

10. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The 
respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities 
and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the 
Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement 
will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any 
investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the 
Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling 
persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive 
delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of 
Sections 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or 
cancelation of this Agreement.

11. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in 
writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the 
Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and 
confirmed to them, at the address specified in Schedule I 
hereto; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered 
or telegraphed and confirmed to it at 50 Kennedy Plaza, 
Providence, Rhode Island 02903, attention of the Senior Vice 
President and General Counsel.

12. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the 
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their 
respective successors and the officers and directors and 
controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no 
other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.

13. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed 
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of 
New York.

If the foregoing is in accordance with your under 
standing of our agreement, please sign and return to us the 
enclosed duplicate hereof, whereupon this letter and your 
acceptance shall represent a binding agreement among the 
Company and the several Underwriters.

Very truly yours,

payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly 
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in 
such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note 
(or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close 
of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which 
shall be the February 15 or August 15 (whether or not a 
Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest 
Payment Date; provided, however, that in case of a Note 
originally issued between a Regular Record Date and the 
Interest Payment Date or on an Interest Payment Date relating 
to such Regular Record Date, interest for the period beginning 
on the date of issue and ending on such Interest Payment Date 
shall be paid on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date to 
the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor 
Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular 
Record Date with respect to such succeeding Interest Payment 
Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly 
provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder 
on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the 
Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor 
Notes) is registered at the close of business on a Special 
Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be 
fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders 
of Notes of this series not less than 10 days prior to such 
Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful 
manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities 
exchange on which the Notes of this series may be listed, and 
upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as 
more fully provided in said Indenture. Interest will be 
computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 
30-day months.

Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and any 
such interest on this Note will be made at the offices or 
agencies of the Company maintained for that purpose in the 
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or in The City of 
Providence, in such coin or currency of the United States of 
America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment 
of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the 
option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check 
drawn upon any Paying Agent and mailed on or prior to an 
Interest Payment Date to the address of the Person entitled 
thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities 
of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to 
be issued under an Indenture dated as of October 1, 1992 (the

any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture 
and all Indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby 
made for a statement of the respective rights of the Company, 
the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and the terms

Company designated as its 7 1/4% Notes Due 1999 (herein called 
the "Notes"), limited in aggregate principal amount to

instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, 
duly executed by the registered Holder hereof or his attorney 
duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new 
Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate 
principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee 
or transferees.

coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of 
$1,000. As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain 
limitations set forth therein, this Note is exchangeable for a

authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder 
surrendering the same.

sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge 
payable in connection therewith.

this Note, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the

Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by 
notice to the contrary.

the Indenture.

66 2/3% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of 
each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains 
provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in 
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any 
series, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such 
series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain 
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the 
Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver 
by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon 
such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any 
Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in 
exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of 
such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the 
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional,

Indenture.

Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture

to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
