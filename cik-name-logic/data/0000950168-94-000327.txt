SECURITY CAPITAL BANCORP ACQUIRES
FIRST FEDERAL OF CHARLOTTE IN $41 MILLION DEAL:

Merger of Charlotte bank with Security Bank and Trust Company will form 
Security Capital Bank--a $680 million commercial bank--and boost Security 
Capital assets to more than $1.2 billion.

SALISBURY, N.C.--Security Capital Bancorp (NASDAQ/NMS-SCBC), a bank holding 
company based in Salisbury, N.C., announced today that it has acquired First 
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Charlotte for approximately $41 million 
from Fairfield Communities, Inc. (NASDAQ-FFCI). Concurrent with the purchase, 
First Federal will be merged into Security Bank and Trust Company, a bank 
subsidiary of Security Capital Bancorp, under the new name "Security Capital 
Bank." The purchase raises the bank holding company's assets to $1.2 billion, 
ranking it 10th among North Carolina bank holding companies. The new 
commercial bank subsidiary will control $680 million of those assets. 

"The First Federal purchase is significantly expanding our banking presence 
in Charlotte," said David B. Jordan, vice chairman and chief executive officer 
of Security Capital Bancorp. "We are purchasing seven Charlotte branches. First 
Federal's three other branches in Rockingham, Troy and Biscoe are extending our 
comprehensive coverage in the south-central Piedmont region of North 
Carolina. We believe that the acquisition will expand our market, maintain 
the quality of our loan portfolio, increase operating efficiencies and boost 
earnings for the shareholders of Security Capital Bancorp."

Security Capital has already won recognition for its banking prowess. In late 
1993, FINANCIAL WORLD magazine ranked Security Capital Bancorp as third in 
financial strength and efficiency among publicly owned U.S. banks with assets 
over $750 million. The acquisition of First Federal will extend the banking 
company's geographical franchise to include 46 branch offices serving 30 
communities in 13 counties.

Soon, the Salisbury bank holding company will consolidate some of its new 
Charlotte branches and, in early 1995, merge its remaining three savings banks 
(OMNIBANK, Salisbury; Citizens Savings, Concord; and Home Savings Bank, Kings 
Mountain) into Security Capital Bank. Their merger with Security Capital Bank 
and conversion to a commercial bank involves a one-time charge of approximately 
$5.6 million to record deferred tax liabilities. As a result of this charge, 
other expenses associated with the acquisition and restructuring charges, 
Security Capital anticipates a net loss for the bank holding company 
during the third quarter of 1994.

Security Capital is purchasing the outstanding stock of First Federal from 
Fairfield Communities, Inc. The purchase price of $41 million in cash was for 
all authorized and outstanding stock of the Charlotte-based financial 
institution. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, Fairfield 
Communities repurchased certain assets from First Federal totaling 
approximately $58 million.

"At the end of the day, the remaining assets of First Federal match the 
quality of assets Security Capital has always maintained," said Jordan. 
"The advantage to our shareholders is that more of our assets are now 
employed in commercial banking, which offers a larger and more diverse market 
along with better profitability for the bank. When our savings banks are 
converted, Security Capital Bank will be a commercial banking institution 
with over $1.2 billion in assets." 

Security Capital Bancorp was formed in June 1992 by the merger of two 
Salisbury institutions, First Security Financial Corporation and Omni 
Capital Group, Inc. Omni Capital Group, Inc. was formed in 1988 from the 
merger of the Home Federal Savings Bank, Salisbury, and Citizens Savings, 
FSB, Concord. Security Bank was originally chartered in 1915 as the Morris 
Plan Company.
