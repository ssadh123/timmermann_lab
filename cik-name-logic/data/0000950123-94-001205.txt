Item 5. Other Events.

On July 22, 1994, the Registrant reported third quarter net income of
$66 million, or 58 cents per share, compared to $71 million, or 62 cents per
share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding various nonoperating items, the
company earned a record $83 million, or 72 cents per share, compared to $66
million, or 58 cents per share, last year, an earnings per share increase of 24
percent. Sales in the current quarter rose 5 percent to $868 million versus
last year.
Nonoperating items in the current quarter included after-tax losses of
13 cents per share from previously announced derivative contract settlements
and 6 cents per share for costs associated with outsourcing the merchant gas
distribution function in the United Kingdom. The quarter also included a gain
of 5 cents per share from changes in certain state income tax regulations.
The industrial gas business set new records as sales for the quarter
increased 8 percent and operating income rose 13 percent, excluding the
one-time nonoperating charge related to the merchant gas distribution function
in the United Kingdom. European profits increased significantly due to higher
merchant volumes and strong onsite operations. In the United States, merchant
volumes were up and the onsite gas business had a particularly strong quarter.
Merchant gas prices were lower in the United States and Europe when compared to
last year's third quarter.
The chemicals business also had record sales and operating income in 
the third quarter. Sales were up 10 percent while operating income increased 
39 percent compared to last year. The company's core chemicals businesses
generated approximately half of the profit gain. The balance of the gain was

<PAGE> 3
due to higher ammonia and methanol prices. Margins in polyvinyl alcohol were
significantly below year-ago levels, but were comparable to the second quarter.
Profits in the environmental and energy systems business increased
over the year-ago quarter, reflecting strong operating performance at
cogeneration and waste-to-energy facilities and a performance bonus payment
associated with the newest cogeneration facility.
The Equipment and Technology segment reported significantly lower
sales and an operating loss due to decreased levels of business activity and
higher costs to complete certain projects.
For the first nine months of fiscal 1994, Air Products reported income
before cumulative effect of required accounting changes of $154 million, or
$1.36 per share, compared with $215 million, or $1.89 per share last year.
Excluding various nonoperating items in both periods, earnings per share
increased 12 percent based on this fiscal year's nine-month income of $229
million, or $2.01 per share, versus $204 million, or $1.80 per share, in the
same period last year. Nine-month sales of $2.6 billion were up 3 percent from
last year.

During 1994 the company terminated three highly leveraged interest rate swap
contracts and closed two other such agreements; terminated two foreign currency
swap contracts; and terminated a number of smaller interest rate hedge
agreements. The company recognized a loss of $25.2 million ($15.5 million
after tax) on these derivative contracts in the third quarter of fiscal 1994.
This loss is reflected in the statement of operating results as follows: $11.3
million loss on leveraged interest rate swaps; $12.2 million foreign exchange
loss included in corporate and other; and $1.7 million interest expense. For
the nine months ended 30 June 1994, the loss associated with these contracts
totaled $121.6 million ($75.1 million after tax). This loss is included in the
statement of operating results as follows: $107.7

<PAGE> 7
million loss on leveraged interest rate swaps; $12.2 million foreign exchange
loss included in corporate and other; and $1.7 million interest expense.

For the three and nine months ended 30 June 1994, industrial gases results are
reduced by a charge of $10.7 million ($7.1 million after tax) for the
outsourcing of the distribution function in the United Kingdom. For these same
periods, income taxes includes a benefit of $5.4 million resulting from changes
in certain state income tax regulations.

For the nine months ended 30 June 1994, corporate and other includes an expense
of $2.3 million for the charitable contribution of the remaining shares of a
stock investment in an insurance company. The tax benefit associated with this
contribution, based on fair value of the investment, was $4.6 million.

Effective 1 October 1993, the company adopted and recognized the cumulative
effect of the following accounting standards: SFAS 106-Postretirement
Benefits ($31.3 million charge); SFAS 109-Income Taxes ($55.9 million gain);
and SFAS 112-Postemployment Benefits ($10.3 million charge). The impact of
these accounting changes on income for the three and nine months ended 30 June
1994, exclusive of the cumulative effect and changes in certain state income
tax regulations, is not material.

Fiscal 1993 operating income of the industrial gases segment and corporate and
other have been restated to reflect the current year presentation of Brazilian
conversion gains related to U.S. dollar denominated investments. For the three
months ended 30 June 1993, operating income of the industrial gases segment was
reduced by $3.3 million with a corresponding increase in corporate and other.
For the nine months ended 30 June 1993, this reclassification totaled $7.9
million.

For the third quarter of fiscal 1993, chemicals' operating income includes a
gain of $3.6 million ($2.2 million after tax) from an insurance settlement
related to the Pasadena, Texas facility. In addition, corporate and other
includes a gain of $4.1 million ($2.6 million after tax) from the partial sale
of a stock investment in an insurance company.

For the nine months ended 30 June 1993, chemicals' operating income includes a
gain of $3.6 million ($2.2 million after tax) from an insurance settlement and
equipment and technology's operating income includes a gain of $3.9 million
($2.4 million after tax) from the sale of a business venture. In addition,
corporate and other includes a gain of $9.6 million ($6.1 million after tax)
from the sale of stock options and partial sale of a stock investment in an
insurance company.
