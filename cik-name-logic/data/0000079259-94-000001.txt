<DESCRIPTION>EXHIBIT 20 - PRESS RELEASE
<TEXT>
ELKINS PARK, PA - January 5, 1994 . . . Mortgage and Realty
Trust (NYSE:MRT) announced today that, as previously forecast and
announced by the Trust, and consistent with the Trust's ongoing
restructuring negotiations with the principal holders of its $290
million Secured Uncertificated Notes due 1995, the Trust did not
pay the interest on the Secured Notes that was due on December 31,
1993. The Trust has continued discussions with the principal
holders of the Secured Notes and their advisors in an effort to
reach an agreement on the terms of the restructuring. Because of
a lack of of sufficient support for the previously announced
restructuring terms and significant changes in ownership of the
Senior Notes since the negotiation of such terms, the terms and
timing of the ultimate restructuring are uncertain at this time.

MRT is a self-administered real estate investment trust with
offices in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania and Burbank, California.
