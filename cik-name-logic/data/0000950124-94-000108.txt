Item 5. Other Events.

Vesta Energy Corporation ("Vesta") has filed a complaint in the Federal

District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma against

seven defendants, including Southwestern Energy Company ("Southwestern") and

the NOARK Pipeline System ("NOARK"), an Arkansas Limited Partnership.

Southeastern Michigan Gas Enterprises, Inc.'s ("Enterprises") subsidiary, SEMCO

Arkansas Pipeline Company holds a 31.67% general partnership interest 

in NOARK and has guaranteed 40% of NOARK's debt service on its approximately

$88 million of debt. Southwestern holds a 47.33% general partnership interest

in NOARK and has guaranteed 60% of NOARK's debt service. Neither Enterprises

nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to the suit.

Vesta seeks actual damages on several theories in an aggregate amount 

exceeding $1 million, seeks punitive damages in excess of $1 million and seeks

to rescind its contracts with certain of the defendants,

including its contract to transport gas on the NOARK system ("the NOARK

Contract"). Under the terms of the NOARK Contract, Vesta is obligated to

transport up to 50,000 Mcf of firm gas per day on the NOARK system at the full

firm rate. This obligation requires Vesta to pay NOARK a demand fee equal to

approximately 19.3 cents per Mcf on the 50,000 Mcf/day and approximately 9.2

cents per Mcf for volumes actually transported on the NOARK system.

On January 1, 1994, Vesta discontinued shipments of firm gas pursuant

to the NOARK Contract and ceased payment of the demand fee. Vesta had been

shipping approximately 32,000 Mcf per day, generating revenues of approximately

$380,000 per month to NOARK. Prior to Vesta's ceasing to ship firm gas on the 

NOARK system, NOARK was transporting approximately 90,000 Mcf per day at firm 

and interruptible rates. NOARK has an operating capacity of 141,000 Mcf per 

day. Southwestern, which was providing approximately 25,000 Mcf per day of the 

gas transported by Vesta over the NOARK system, has indicated

<PAGE> 3
its current intent to continue to ship those volumes over the NOARK system,

initially at the full firm rate, generating NOARK revenues of approximately

$210,000 per month. As these circumstances continue, the loss of revenues

to NOARK of apprioximately $170,000 per month reduces Enterprises' net income 

by approximately $35,000 per month.

It is impossible to predict the outcome of this litigation. 

Southwestern has indicated, after initial review of the complaint and relevant

facts, that it believes there is no merit to the lawsuit and that it intends to

counterclaim asking for specific performance of the NOARK Contract to 

transport gas and/or damages.

Item 7.(c) Exhibits.
