BANKAMERICA FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS

SAN FRANCISCO, April 20, 1994 -- BankAmerica Corporation
today reported first-quarter 1994 earnings per share of $1.27
based on earnings of $513 million. Earnings per share for the
first quarter of 1993 were $1.19, based on earnings of
$484 million. 

"First-quarter results are encouraging in a number of areas,"
Richard M. Rosenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said.
"Earnings per share were up. Average loan outstandings, adjusted
for certain reclassifications, have increased in each of the past
two quarters. And, credit quality indicators continued to
improve, enabling the corporation to lower its loan loss
provision. In addition, noninterest expenses declined, and we
achieved -- ahead of schedule -- the quarterly savings rate
required for us to meet our $1.2 billion goal for annual expense
reductions from the Security Pacific merger."

Rosenberg cited Large Corporate and Foreign Banking, California 
Consumer Banking, and Seafirst Corporation as being the strongest
business-sector contributors to the corporation's first-quarter
earnings. "Despite these encouraging results," Rosenberg added, 
"we continue to focus on our earnings per share and the need to 
bring expenses into better alignment with revenues in our various
businesses.

"As we celebrate our 90th anniversary later this year, we
will continue to seek ways to enhance our products and customer
service, with the objective of improving and strengthening both
our financial performance and shareholder value," Rosenberg
concluded. 

Results of Operations

Net interest income for the first quarter of 1994 was down
$49 million, or 3 percent, from the amount reported for the first
quarter of 1993. The corporation's net interest margin for the
first quarter of 1994 was 27 basis points lower than the first
quarter of 1993.

<PAGE>

The provision for credit losses was $125 million in the first
quarter of 1994, down $123 million from the amount reported in
the first quarter of 1993. This decrease primarily reflected
improved credit quality in various portfolio sectors. 

Noninterest income for the first quarter of 1994 decreased
$86 million from the amount reported in the same period last
year. In the first quarter of 1993, noninterest income included
$38 million of nonrecurring income representing previously
unrecognized post-merger 1992 earnings of Bank of America (Asia)
Limited, formerly Security Pacific Asia Bank, Ltd. Excluding this
nonrecurring income, the decline in total noninterest income was
due to a $90 million decrease in trading income, resulting from
less favorable market conditions. However, total fees and
commissions for the first quarter of 1994 were approximately the
same as in the comparable period last year. 

Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 1994 decreased
$51 million from the amount reported in the comparable period of
1993 to its lowest level since the merger with Security Pacific
Corporation. This achievement demonstrates management's continued
efforts to focus on controlling the corporation's operating
costs. 

Balance Sheet Analysis

Average total assets for the first quarter of 1994 were 
$8.2 billion higher than in the previous quarter. Of this
increase, $7.0 billion was due to the first-quarter adoption of
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39,
"Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts." 

Average total loans for the first quarter of 1994 were 
$2.6 billion lower than in the previous quarter due to
reclassifications made primarily in connection with the adoption
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities." Excluding these reclassifications, average total
loans grew $0.2 billion. 

Credit quality continued to improve during the first quarter
of 1994. Total nonaccrual assets decreased $388 million, or 
13 percent, from their December 31, 1993 level. This decline,
which was primarily in nonaccrual construction and development
and commercial and industrial loans, was largely the result of
paydowns and loans restored to accrual status. In addition, net
credit losses for the first quarter of 1994 totaled $174 million,
down $142 million from the amount reported in the same period
last year.

In connection with the pending acquisition of Continental Bank
Corporation, BankAmerica Corporation implemented its previously
announced plan to repurchase approximately $500 million of its 
common stock. As of March 31, 1994, BankAmerica Corporation had 
completed approximately 70 percent of its goal by repurchasing 
8.2 million shares of its common stock on the open market. These 
shares were repurchased for $345 million, thereby reducing total 
stockholders' equity by that amount.

Financial Highlights

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities," was adopted by the corporation effective
January 1, 1994. SFAS No. 115 requires that debt and equity
securities for which the corporation does not have the
positive intent or ability to hold to maturity and that are
not considered to be part of trading-related activities be
classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at
their fair values, with unrealized gains and losses reported
on a net-of-tax basis as a separate component of
stockholders' equity. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 115,
$5.6 billion of held-to-maturity securities were transferred
to available-for-sale securities. In addition, certain debt-
restructuring par bonds and other instruments issued by
foreign governments of $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion were
reclassified from loans to available-for-sale securities and
held-to-maturity securities, respectively. 

Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39
(FIN 39), "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
Contracts," was also adopted by the corporation effective
January 1, 1994. FIN 39 requires that unrealized gains on
forward, swap, option, and other conditional or exchange
contracts be recorded as assets and unrealized losses on
these contracts be recorded as liabilities. However,
unrealized gains and losses may be netted if right of set-
off criteria are met or contracts are executed under legally
enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties.
In the first quarter of 1994, the corporation netted
unrealized gains and losses wherever allowed by FIN 39.

Prior period amounts have not been restated since SFAS No.
115 does not allow retroactive application and the
corporation has elected not to restate prior periods under
FIN 39.

"Accounting for Income Taxes", core deposit intangibles
(CDI) and other identifiable intangibles that are normally
deducted from Tier 1 capital under the current guidelines of
the federal banking regulators were estimated to be $500
million higher at March 31, 1994 and were $510 million
higher at December 31, 1993 and $554 million higher at
March 31, 1993, with corresponding increases in deferred
taxes. The federal banking regulators have not issued final
capital regulations on the adoption of SFAS No. 109 and are
currently considering whether such increased intangibles
should be deducted from capital. Management believes that
the increased amounts of CDI and other identifiable
intangibles resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 109 do
not pose a risk to the corporation's capital and should not
be deducted from capital in determining capital ratios.
Pending final resolution of this issue by the banking
regulators, such amounts have not been deducted from capital
in determining the capital ratios shown above.
