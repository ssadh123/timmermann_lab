RPM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
AND
STONHARD, INC.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of August
31, 1993, gives effect to the merger and reorganization of RPM, Inc. and
Subsidiaries and Stonhard, Inc., using the pooling of interests method of
accounting as if the merger occurred on August 31, 1993. The following
unaudited pro forma condensed statements of income combine the condensed
statements of RPM, Inc. and Subsidiaries and Stonhard, Inc. for the year ended
May 31, 1993, and the three months ended August 31, 1993, assuming the merger
and reorganization had been consummated as of the beginning of those periods.
The pro forma information is based on the historical financial statements of
RPM, Inc. and Subsidiaries and Stonhard, Inc. giving effect to the transaction
under the pooling of interests method of accounting and the assumptions and
adjustments in the accompanying notes to the pro forma financial statements.

The objective of this pro forma financial information is to show what the
significant effects on the historical financial information might have been had
the transactions occurred at an earlier date. However, the pro forma condensed
combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of
operations or related effects on financial position that would have been
attained had the above-mentioned transaction actually occurred earlier. The
pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and notes of Stonhard, Inc. contained elsewhere herein.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors
Stonhard, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Maple Shade, New Jersey

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
STONHARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31, 1992 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
deficit and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of STONHARD, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES as of
December 31, 1992 and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1992

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Foreign Currency Translation

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
Operating results are translated at weighted-average exchange rates in
effect during the period. Net unrealized translation adjustments are
recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and
losses from foreign currency transactions when significant are shown on
the statements of operations.

Statements of Cash Flows

The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased
with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Future Accounting Changes -

Postretirement Benefits

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 which is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1994 for certain small, non-public
employers. SFAS No. 106 requires that the expense of postretirement
benefits will be accrued until the employee becomes eligible to receive
benefits. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 106 in 1994. The Company
expects that implementation of SFAS No. 106 will not have a material
effect on financial condition or results of operations.

Income Tax Accounting

SFAS No. 109 was issued in 1992 to be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1992. This standard requires that deferred
tax assets and liabilities be recognized for any difference between the
tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts measured by using presently enacted current and/or future tax
laws and rates. The Company expects that adoption of SFAS No. 109 will
not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or
results of operations.

NOTE 2 - RESTRUCTURING

In 1992, management instituted a restructuring program designed to
reduce costs, improve operating efficiencies and increase shareholder
value. The program included the closing of a division and the
downsizing of certain operations. Restructuring costs of $1,746,425
include severance and other expenses of the program (See Note 7 -
Discontinued Operations).

NOTE 6 - DEBT (CONTINUED)

Long-Term Debt (continued)

On March 25, 1992 the Company entered into a Credit and Security
Agreement (the "Agreement") with Heller Financial, Inc. ("Heller") to
refinance its then existing revolving credit, term and mortgage notes
with a $28,700,000 Credit Facility. The Credit Facility consists of (i)
a $20,000,000 revolving credit note, (ii) a $6,700,000 term note, and
(iii) a $2,000,000 term note. All notes are secured by the stock of all
the Company's subsidiaries and the assets and properties of the Company
and its subsidiaries. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by all
subsidiaries of the Company. The Agreement has customary
representations and warranties, negative covenants (including, among
other things, limitations on mergers, investments, indebtedness,
dividends and other distributions), affirmative covenants (including
financial covenants), and events of default. At December 31, 1992 the
Company was not in compliance with certain covenants contained in the
Agreement. The Company has, however, obtained a waiver of these
covenants from Heller.

As part of the Agreement the Company issued warrants for 221 shares
of its common stock to Heller. The warrants contain a put option. The
put option requires the Company to purchase the warrants from March 25,
2002. The price will be determined by the then current appraised value
of the Company as mutually agreed upon by the majority stockholders and
Heller.

In concert with the Agreement, Stonhard paid $600,000 to purchase
the outstanding warrants held by CoreStates Enterprise Fund. Stonhard
also paid fees in the amount of $630,753 to Heller at closing. The fees
associated with the refinancing have been included in deferred debt
costs.

The aggregate principal maturities of long-term debt are as
follows:

arrangements. This write-off is shown as an extraordinary charge of

The subordinated debtors have agreed to forego principal payments
until January 15, 1996 at which time the entire principal shall be due.
Interest will be paid quarterly at prime rate plus 1% from March 25,
1992 through January 14, 1993 and at prime rate plus 3% from January 15,

NOTE 9 - DEFERRED COMPENSATION

A Phantom Stock Incentive Compensation Plan was adopted in 1990.
Under the plan, key management employees are awarded additional
compensation based upon performance. The additional compensation
transferrable into Phantom Equity Units. Changes in the value of the
Phantom Equity Units parallel the changes in the market value of the
Company's common stock. The Company will grant Phantom Equity Units
equated to 6% of the Company stock over the next five years. The units
will vest at the end of five years. However, participants are eligible
to receive at a minimum the amount of additional compensation deferred
through the plan.

The Company initiated a Deferred Compensation Plan in 1991. The
plan permits certain key employees to defer portions of their
compensation. To fund the plan, the Company purchased whole-life
insurance contracts on the related employees. The Company, which is the
owner and beneficiary of the insurance policies, paid whole-life
insurance premiums of $367,403 for 1992. Costs charged to operations

Letters of Credit

The Company has outstanding letters of credit in the amount of
$279,250 which guarantee the Company's performance under certain surety
agreements which expire in May 1993. Cash deposits of $157,900 are
being held as collateral in conjunction with these letters of credit.

Guarantees

The Canadian Subsidiary has guaranteed the debt of an
unconsolidated subsidiary in the amount of $173,038.

Litigation

In connection with the sale of a related entity ("Entity"), the
Company had indemnified the buyer for certain environmental claims. In
June 1992, the Entity received a general notice from the United States
Environmental Protection Agency ("US EPA") that it was one of
approximately 1,300 potentially responsible parties in connection with
the clean up of the Solvent Recovery Services of New England superfund
site. The Entity is alleged to be responsible for less than 1% of the
potential clean-up expense. The actual cost of remedial action has not
been determined and the method of allocation of liability among parties
who may ultimately be found liable remains uncertain. However, the
Company's share of the less than 1% portion of the clean up expense is
limited to the Entity's involvement with the site during the Company's
related ownership period. The Company believes that its share of the
expense is minimal.

The Company is involved in other litigation and administrative
proceedings primarily arising in the normal course of its business. In
the opinion of management, the Company's recovery, if any, or the
Company's liability, if any, under any pending litigation or
administrative proceedings including that described in the preceding
paragraph would not materially effect its financial condition or
operations.
