ITEM 2: ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On June 7, 1994, Western Investment Real Estate Trust ("the Trust") completed
the acquisition of three properties totaling 283,550 square feet of retail space
for $34.3 million in cash. The Trust funded the purchase using $20.2 million
remaining from its recent senior debt offering, $7.1 million of proceeds from
the sale of properties and $7 million from its bank line of credit. The
centers, located in Elk Grove, Fair Oaks and Manteca, serve the Sacramento and
Central Valley areas of California. The Trust purchased the properties from
Riley/Pearlman/Mitchell Company affiliated partnerships. Each property was
acquired from an unrelated seller for consideration agreed upon through arm's
length bargaining.

The Elk Grove property consists of an 89,600-square-foot portion of the Laguna
99 Plaza in Elk Grove, a bedroom community fifteen miles south of Sacramento.
This property is located at the intersection of Highway 99 and Elk Grove
Boulevard. Anchor retailers of the 200,000-square-foot center include Wal-Mart.
Major tenants of the Trust's portion of the property, which is 96% leased,
include Pak 'N Save Supermarket and Lyon's Restaurant. Elk Grove's population
has more than doubled in the last five years to a population of 58,000 in 1993.

The Fair Oaks property consists of the 97,300-square-foot Northridge Plaza in
Fair Oaks, a residential community ten miles northwest of Sacramento. Anchor
retailers of this center, which is 95% leased, include Raley's supermarket and
Bank of America. Fair Oaks, which is part of the greater Sacramento metropolitan
area, is a mature middle and upper-middle class residential community with a
population of 27,000.

The third property, located in Manteca, lies fifteen miles south of Stockton in
the Central Valley area of California. The Trust acquired a 96,650-square-foot
