STANLEY REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

New Britain, Connecticut . . . Richard H. Ayers, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of The Stanley Works announced today, "We are
pleased with our solid performance for the quarter and for the first
six months of 1994. Sales in the second quarter of $629 million were
11% higher than the prior year and were a record for any quarter. Net
earnings of $33.7 million, or $.75 per share, represented a 25%
increase over 1993 and were records for second quarter results."

Mr. Ayers noted, "Significant internal growth from all our business
units was the primary contributor to the current quarter sales
increase. Our businesses serving the U.S. industrial and
construction markets had the most significant impact on the overall
10% increase in unit volume growth. The net incremental effect of
acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 1%, while the effects
of a 1% price increase were offset by the negative effects of
currency." 

Gross margins of 33.4% were substantially improved over margins of
32.1% reported in the prior year. This improvement was achieved
through a combination of cost and volume efficiencies together with
the absence of expenses related to manufacturing process changes and
some extraordinarily high raw material costs that were incurred in the
second quarter last year. Operating expenses also improved to 22.2% of
sales compared with 22.7% in the prior year. 

Interest-net expenses for the quarter were 1.2% of sales compared with
1.1% in the prior year, reflecting a higher interest rate environment. 
Other-net of $9.0 million, or 1.4% of sales, for the second quarter
compared with $4.0 million, or 0.7% of sales, in the same quarter a
year ago. The increase in Other-net included additional reserves
established in this year for environmental and plant closing expenses
while the prior year benefitted from favorable adjustments to
contingency reserves.

Net sales for the first six months of 1994 were $1.2 billion, up 9%
from 1993 sales of $1.1 billion. Net earnings of $59.3 million, or
$1.32 per share, were 19% higher than prior year earnings of $50.0
million, or $1.11 per share. Net earnings and earnings per share in
1993 exclude the effects of a change in accounting principle.

Net sales in the U.S. for the second quarter increased by 12%,
entirely the result of internal growth. Strong order activity
continued in our industrial and engineered tool categories and was
augmented by strengthening in consumer tools. Price increases of 1%
were offset by the negative effect of the company's divestiture
activity.

Sales in Europe continued to improve with an overall increase of 8%
for the quarter. Unit volume growth of 4% reflected increased sales
activity especially in the industrial tools category. The incremental
effect of a recent acquisition increased sales by 6%. Minor price
increases combined with the negative effects of currency resulting in
a net 2% decrease from the prior year. Operating profits of $8.0
million were similar to the prior year while operating margins,
reflecting more aggressive sales efforts, declined from 10.3% to 9.3%.

Net sales in Other Areas increased by 13% for the quarter. Internal
volume growth of 9% included strengthening in our Canadian businesses. 
The incremental effect of acquisitions increased sales by 5%; however,
the net effect of price increases and negative currency translation
decreased sales by 1%.

Net sales for the Tools segment increased 11%, principally the result
of 10% internal sales growth. Consumer tools' unit volume growth of
6% was an improvement over more modest gains reported in the first
quarter. The industrial and engineered tool categories continued with
strong order activity and experienced double digit internal growth for
the quarter. Price increases of 2% were substantially offset by the
negative effects of currency. The net incremental effect of
acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 1%. Operating
profits of $59.3 million were 19% higher than the comparable quarter
last year. Operating margins of 12.5% compared with 11.7% in the
prior year and reflected increased volume and operating efficiencies.

(page 3)

Net sales in the Hardware segment increased 6% over the prior year
almost entirely due to unit volume increases. Minor price increases
were offset by the negative effects of currency. Operating profits
improved significantly to $10.8 million with operating margins of
13.7% comparing favorably with 10.1% in the prior year. Even when
the effects of property losses related to the California earthquake
are excluded, margins in the second quarter were improved over those
reported in the first quarter. 

Specialty Hardware net sales for the second quarter were 17% higher
than the same quarter last year. As in the other segments, this
increase was driven primarily by unit volume gains. Price increases
of 1% were offset by a minor currency impact and resulted in no net
effect on sales. Operating profits of $4.2 million were substantially
improved from $1.8 million reported last year. The prior year's
operating results were depressed because our Door Systems business
experienced unusually high wood prices and related manufacturing
process problems. 

On June 18, the company completed the divestiture of its Taylor Rental
business with the sale of the remaining company-owned stores and
related assets. 

Mr. Ayers stated, "Our results through the second quarter give us
continued confidence in our expectations for 1994. We are moving
forward with our expansion in Asia and are encouraged by our new
product development activities. We feel confident that these
initiatives position us well for continued long-term growth. Although
there is some reason to be concerned about interest rates and the
uncertainties of steel availability and price, we believe our
prediction in the 1993 annual report for higher sales and
substantially higher profits in 1994 is still on target."
