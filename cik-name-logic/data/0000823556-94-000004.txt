Mr. Elia commented on the results of the Annual Meeting: "We are pleased that
the shareholders of AWT supported this alliance so enthusiastically. The two
companies complement each other in many ways and we believe these transactions
will be in the best interest of shareholders, the company, its clients and
employees". He further added, "We are excited by the synergies we see between
the two companies and the prospects available to us to pool our expertise and
talents. I am looking forward to joining the AWT team and leading them in
successfully tackling the many challenges and opportunities we see in front of 
us as we go forward".

in global utilities, with a current market value of approximately $13 billion
