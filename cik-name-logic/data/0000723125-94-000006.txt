MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC., ANNOUNCES PATENT CROSS-LICENSE
-------------------------------------------------------
AGREEMENT WITH TEXAS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
--------------------------------------

Boise, Idaho, March 9, 1994--Micron Technology, Inc., today 
announced that it has entered into a patent cross-licensing agreement 
with Texas Instruments, Inc., of Dallas, Texas, involving the semiconductor
patents of the two companies and their subsidiaries. As a result of this 
agreement, the various patent lawsuits between Micron Semiconductor, Inc.,
and Texas Instruments (TI) in Idaho, Texas, and Delaware have been
settled.

Similar to a prior cross-license agreement between the parties
which expired in 1992, Micron will pay ongoing royalties to TI based on
sales of DRAMs and other semiconductor devices. The company has accrued
a sufficient amount to pay the royalties related to sales for periods
from expiration of the previous cross-license to the date of settlement.

Micron Technology, Inc., based in Boise, Idaho, is a holding company
whose common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchnage, Inc. (NYSE)
under the symbol MU. The company's primary subsidiary, Micron Semiconductor,
Inc., manufactures and market DRAMs, fast SRAMs, and other semiconductor
products.
