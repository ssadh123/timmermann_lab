BALLY MANUFACTURING CORPORATION ANNOUNCES STRONG RESULTS FROM 1ST 30
DAYS OF NEW TUNICA, MISSISSIPPI CASINO OPERATIONS

Chicago, IL, January 18, 1994 -- Arthur M. Goldberg, Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Bally Manufacturing
Corporation (NYSE:BLY), announced today that the first 30 days of
operations of Bally's Saloon & Gambling Hall in Tunica, Mississippi,
located 35 miles south of Memphis, were "much stronger than our
expectations".
Mr. Goldberg stated, "We are extremely pleased with the
results of our first 30 days of operations as we consistently
achieved or exceeded our aggressive attendance, revenue and margin
goals. We expect to see the property's cash flow continue to
steadily improve as our marketing program reaches a wider audience."
Mr. Goldberg continued, "Our win numbers exceeded our
seasonally adjusted plan by approximately 15 percent. These initial
results combined with the margins we think we can achieve at this
facility, make us very enthusiastic about our prospects. Our
estimates of cash flows from operations indicate that we have
already returned approximately nine percent of our projected
investment in the first 30 days of operations."
Mr. Goldberg added, "Through our recent discussions with the
developers of the Mhoon's Landing site, we have learned that their
plans for adding hotel rooms and additional non-casino entertainment

at the site are now moving ahead. We believe these additions will
add to the excitement at our location at Mhoon's Landing, attracting
even greater numbers of customers to the area."
Bally's Saloon & Gambling Hall is owned by Bally's Casino
Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Bally Manufacturing
Corporation.
Bally's also owns and operates three world-class casino hotel
and resorts in Atlantic City and Las Vegas.
Bally Manufacturing Corporation is one of the world's foremost
operators of casino hotel resorts and fitness centers.
