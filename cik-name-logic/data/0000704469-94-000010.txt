Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

Effective August 31, 1994, FGC Holding Company ("FGC") merged with and into
Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc. ("Trans Financial") and each of the outstanding
shares of common stock of FGC was converted into 419.832 shares of Trans
Financial for an aggregate issuance of 1,050,000 shares of Trans Financial
common stock. The transaction was effected pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization and related Plan of Merger (collectively, the "Merger Agreement")
dated January 28, 1994, among Trans Financial, FGC, and certain shareholders of
FGC, and was approved by the shareholders of FGC on August 31, 1994. FGC was a
one-bank holding company, headquartered in the eastern Kentucky community of
Martin, which owned 100% of the outstanding capital stock of First Guaranty
National Bank. At June 30, 1994, FGC had consolidated assets of approximately
$126 million. The consideration given by Trans Financial for the acquisition of
FGC was determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement.
There are not any material relationships between FGC or its shareholders and
Trans Financial or any of its affiliates, any director or officer of Trans
Financial, or any associate of any such director or officer.
The assets acquired by Trans Financial in the transaction consisted of FGC's
subsidiary bank, First Guaranty National Bank. It is anticipated that the
physical assets of that bank will continue to be used by it for general banking
purposes.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors
FGC Holding Company
Martin, Kentucky

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FGC
Holding Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Guaranty National Bank,
Martin, Kentucky as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the
years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable, but not absolute, assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FGC Holding
Company and Subsidiary at December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the results of their
operations and cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

FGC HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. Basis of Presentation - These financial statements include the
accounts of FGC Holding Company (the Company) and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
First Guaranty National Bank (the Bank). All material intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

B. Investment Securities - Investment securities are carried at cost,
adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount on a constant
yield basis. Gains or losses on dispositions are computed using the specific
identification method.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities". The Statement requires the classification of
investment securities into trading securities, securities available for sale and
securities held to maturity, no later than 1994, with early adoption available
as of December 31, 1993. The Company will adopt the Statement in 1994. The
effect on stockholders' equity for the recording of unrealized gains and losses
for investments available for sale has not been determined by the Company but is
not expected to materially affect the Company's financial position.

C. Loans - Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced
by unearned interest and an allowance for loan losses. Interest income from
certain installment loans is recognized as income using a method which
approximates the interest method. Income from all other loans is recorded on
the accrual basis, except for those loans on a nonaccruing income status.
Accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes, after
considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the
borrowers' financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful.

The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for
loan losses charged to expense. The allowance is an amount that management
believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may
become uncollectible, based on valuations of the collectibility of loans and
prior loan loss experience. The evaluations take into consideration such
factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall
portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, and current economic
conditions that may affect the borrowers' ability to pay. Loans are charged
against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the
collectibility of the principal is unlikely.

D. Bank Premises and Equipment - Bank premises and equipment are stated
at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets using straight-line methods for
buildings and both straight-line and accelerated methods for furniture and
equipment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992
(CONTINUED)

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. Other Real Estate Owned - Real estate acquired through foreclosure
is carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the property or its fair
value. The value of the underlying loan is written down to the fair value of
the real estate to be acquired by a charge to the allowance for loan losses.
Operating expenses of such properties, net of related income, and gains and
losses on their disposition, are included in other expenses.

F. Income Taxes - The Company and the Bank file a consolidated federal
income tax return. Income taxes are allocated on a separate return basis.

Deferred income taxes are provided for using the liability method.
Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are based on the change from
the beginning of the year in the deferred tax liability or asset established for
the expected future consequences of differences in the financial reporting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities. The differences relate principally to
investment securities, the allowance for loan losses and premises and equipment.

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes". The Statement requires the use of the liability method for computing
deferred income taxes no later than 1993, with earlier adoption encouraged.

Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are based on the
change from the beginning of the year in the deferred tax liability or asset
established for the expected future tax consequences of differences in the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company
adopted the Statement in 1993. Adoption of the Statement had no effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

G. Leveraged Leases - The Bank has entered into leveraged leases which
are financing arrangements whereby the major portion of the cost of the
equipment leased is financed with nonrecourse debt from another investor. The
financial statements reflect the Bank's investment, net of unearned income and
nonrecourse debt. The investment is reduced by cash flows arising from the
transaction, after providing necessary amounts for deferred income taxes in the
period in which the benefits arise. Income is recorded under a method which
relates return to investment.

H. Purchase Method of Accounting - The net assets of First Guaranty
National Bank acquired in a purchase transaction are recorded at the fair value
at the date of acquisition. The excess cost over net assets acquired (goodwill)
is being amortized by the straight-line method over 25 years.

I. Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications have been made in the
1992 financial statements to conform to the classifications used in 1993.

immediate families and companies in which they are principal owners, are loan
customers of the Bank. Total loans to these persons at December 31, 1993 and
1992 approximated $377,000 and $378,000, respectively. Such loans were made in
the ordinary course of business at the Bank's normal credit terms and interest
rates.

December 31, 1992. Deferred income tax credits applicable to such leases,
amounting to $38,869 at December 31, 1992 are included in deferred income taxes
on the accompanying balance sheet. Outstanding nonrecourse debt on these leases
amounted to $0 at December 31, 1992. During 1993 and 1992, the Bank recorded
losses of $40,411 and $155,081 to write-down the residual amount of their
investment in leveraged leases down to fair value.

NOTE 5 - BANK PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Bank premises and equipment at December 31, 1993 and 1992 are summarized
as follows:
1993 1992

Land and buildings $ 1,601,962 $ 1,601,962
Furniture and equipment 1,704,245 1,668,799
$ 3,306,207 $ 3,270,761
Less accumulated depreciation (1,491,045) (1,249,050)
$ 1,815,162 $ 2,021,711

Depreciation expense was $241,996 and $187,513 for 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

NOTE 6 - DEBENTURES PAYABLE

Debentures payable at December 31, 1993 and 1992 consists of four
identical debentures dated January 20, 1988 payable to the four individuals who
previously owned the Bank. Principal payments commenced on January 1, 1989 and
are due annually on January 1 of each year through 2000. The debentures bear
interest for the first five years at a rate of 9%, payable quarterly. After the
first five years, the interest rate is equal to the prime rate as quoted in the
"Wall Street Journal." The debentures are collateralized by 100% of the issued
and outstanding common stock of First Guaranty National Bank.

The debentures require the maintenance of certain capital and
operational ratios for the Bank, all of which have been complied with at
December 31, 1993, however, the Company has failed to fully comply with certain
affirmative and negative covenants contained in the debentures. Management
believes that any adverse impact resulting from these failures will not have a
material effect on the Company's financial condition.

The Company may, at its option, repay the debentures, with certain
restrictions, in whole or in part at any time. Principal payments due on the
debentures during the five years subsequent to December 31, 1993 are as follows:
1994 - $0; 1995 - $500,000; 1996 - $700,000; 1997 - $750,000; and 1998 -
$800,000.

NOTE 7 - NOTES PAYABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS

Notes payable at December 31, 1993 and 1992 consists of two identical
unsecured notes dated January 20, 1988, payable to two of the stockholders of
the Company. Principal is due on demand. The notes bear interest for the first
five years at a rate of 9%, payable quarterly. After the first five years, the
interest rate is equal to the prime rate as quoted in the "Wall Street Journal."

NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 1993 and
1992 is summarized as follows:

1993 1992

Currently payable $ 729,424 $ 740,482
Deferred (121,073) (190,655)
$ 608,351 $ 549,827

The income tax provision is less than that obtained by using the
statutory Federal corporate income tax rate, principally due to tax-exempt
interest income of approximately $892,000 and $926,000 for 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

The Company's deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at
December 31, 1993 are as follows. No valuation allowance for the realization of
deferred tax assets is considered necessary.

Deferred tax assets $ 393,093
Deferred tax liability (192,245)
Net deferred tax asset $ 200,848

NOTE 9 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

The Bank is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk
in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.
These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of
unused lines of credit. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making
commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet
instruments.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Bank had commitments to extend credit
of approximately $2,743,000 and $657,000, respectively, whose contract amounts
represent credit risk.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992
(CONTINUED)

NOTE 9 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK (CONTINUED)

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as
long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. The Bank evaluates each customer's credit-
worthiness on a case-by-case basis. Since many of the commitments are expected
to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. Collateral held varies, but
primarily includes real estate.

NOTE 10 - CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Bank grants residential, commercial and consumer loans to customers
primarily located in Floyd and Knott Counties in Kentucky. Although the Bank
has a diverse loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its debtors' ability to
perform on their contracts is influenced by the coal industry which has a
significant impact on the local economy.

NOTE 11 - DIVIDEND LIMITATION

The Company's principal source of funds is dividends received from the
Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid
without prior approval of the Bank's regulatory agency. Under these
regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is
limited to the current year's net profits, as defined, combined with the
retained net profits of the preceding two years. During 1994, the Bank could,
without prior approval, declare dividends of approximately $3,747,000 plus any
1994 net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration.

NOTE 12 - PREFERRED STOCK

The Company has authorized, issued and outstanding two classes of
preferred stock, Class A and Class B. Both classes of preferred stock and all
dividends to which it is entitled shall have a preference as to all other
shareholders on all of the assets of the corporation. Each share of preferred
stock is subject to redemption and may, at the option of the Company, on any
dividend payment date, at any time after January 20, 1993, be called and retired
at the cash price per share equal to its par value.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, there were no dividends in arrears on the
preferred stock.

NOTE 13 - CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Bank and certain officers and directors are named defendants in
legal actions arising from the purchase of the Bank by the Company. This
litigation has been settled by the parties agreeing to a dismissal of all
claims, subject to court approval, therefore, the ultimate liability, if any,
resulting from these actions is not expected to have a material effect on the
Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

NOTE 14 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On January 28, 1994, the Company entered into a merger agreement with
Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc. of Bowling Green, Kentucky, whereby Trans
Financial will exchange 1,050,000 shares of its common stock for 100% of the
common stock of FGC Holding Company. The merger is contingent upon regulatory
approval.
