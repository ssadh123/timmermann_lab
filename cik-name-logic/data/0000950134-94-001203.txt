ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On June 14, 1994, First United Bancshares, Inc., El Dorado, Arkansas
("First United"), acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of
InvestArk Bankshares, Inc., Stuttgart, Arkansas ("InvestArk"), pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated December 17, 1993 ("Agreement"),
whereby First United acquired 215,960 shares of common stock of InvestArk in
exchange for the issuance of 885,523 shares of First United common stock plus
cash payment for fractional shares. The average price of First United common
stock was defined, pursuant to the Agreement, as the average sales price per
share for all trades occurring during the period of ten (10) trading days on
which one or more trades actually takes place and which ends immediately prior
to the second trading day preceding the closing date. The average price was
$29.90 resulting in an exchange ratio of 4.1007 shares of First United common
stock for every one (1) share of InvestArk common stock. The method of
calculating the above described average sales price and exchange ratio are
fully described in First United's Form S-4 Registration Statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, Registration No. 33-52341 as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on May 4, 1994, and which became effective May
6, 1994 ("Registration Statement"). Furthermore, information regarding the
consummation of the transaction and disclosure of certain historical and pro
forma financial data can be found in the current report on Form 8-K filed by
First United on June 16, 1994 and the amendment thereto filed under cover of
Form 8-K/A on August 12, 1994 and the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by First
United on September 9, 1994.

The transaction was accounted for by using the pooling of interest
method and therefore the below audited financial statements are being filed to
restate the consolidated statements of condition as of December 31, 1993 and 
1992, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in capital
accounts and cash flows for each of the years in a three year period ended
December 31, 1993.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting principles and reporting policies followed by the
Company conform with generally accepted accounting principles and with general
practices within the financial services industry. The following is a
description of the more significant of these policies:

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First
United Bancshares, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, First National Bank
of El Dorado, First National Bank of Magnolia, Merchants and Planters Bank,
N.A. of Camden, City National Bank of Fort Smith, Commercial Bank at Alma,
First Stuttgart Bank and Trust Company and The Bank of North Arkansas
(Melbourne). All significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated.

NOTES TO SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

Disclosure of the fair value for all financial instruments as well as
the methodology and significant assumptions used in estimating fair values have
been incorporated throughout the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are based on estimates using present value techniques. Those techniques are
significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and
estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value
estimates for those assets or liabilities cannot be substantiated by comparison
to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate
settlement of the instrument. All nonfinancial instruments, by definition, have
been excluded from these disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate
fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the
Company and may not be indicative of amounts that might ultimately be realized
upon disposition or settlement of those assets and liabilities.

Pursuant to the Interest Rate Control Amendment to the Constitution of
the State of Arkansas, all "general loans" have a maximum financing limitation
of 5% over the Federal Reserve Discount Rate. As of December 31, 1993, the
maximum financing limitation is 8%. This law limits the Company's flexibility
in pricing loans according to credit and rate risk through the use of a greater
spread in financing rates. Accordingly, the difference between the carrying
amount and estimated fair value of the Company's loans is not as great as would
be the case without such a law.

CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS:

The carrying amounts for cash and due from banks and short-term
investments (federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to
resell and other short-term investments) approximate fair value because of the
short maturity of those financial instruments.

SECURITIES HELD FOR SALE AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES:

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at
the time of purchase. Held for sale securities are held for indefinite periods
of time and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Securities held for
sale include securities that Management intends to use as part of its
asset-liability management strategy and that may be sold in response to changes
in interest rates or other economic factors. The amortized costs of the
specific securities sold are used to compute gains and losses on the sale of
securities. Adjustments to market and realized gains or losses upon sale of the
securities held for sale are classified as securities gains (losses). When
Management has the intent and ability at the time of purchase to hold
securities until maturity, these securities are classified as investment
securities and carried at amortized cost.

Fair values for securities held for sale and investment securities are
based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable
instruments.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115 "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which the Company adopted on
January 1, 1994. This statement addresses the accounting and reporting for
investments in debt and certain equity securities. Debt securities not
classified as trading account securities or investment securities expected to
be held to maturity and all equity securities will be classified as
available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value, with net unrealized
gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Upon adoption of this statement on January 1, 1994, the Company
classified all of its securities held for sale and certain of its investment
securities as available-for-sale. The carrying values and fair values of
securities classified as available-for-sale on January 1, 1994 were
approximately $298,000,000 and $303,000,000, respectively, which resulted in
reflecting an unrecognized gain, net of tax, of approximately $3,200,000 as a
separate component of capital accounts.

LOANS:

Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by
unearned income and an allowance for loan losses. Unearned income on a portion
of installment loans is recognized as income over the terms of the loans by a
method which approximates the interest method. Interest on other loans is
calculated by using the simple interest method on daily balances of the
principal amount outstanding.

The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for
loan losses charged to expense. Loans are charged against the allowance for
loan losses when Management believes that the collectibility of the principal
is unlikely. The allowance is an amount that Management believes will be
adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become
uncollectible, based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans and prior
loan loss experience. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as
changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio
quality, review of specific problem loans and current economic conditions that
may affect the borrower's ability to pay. Accrual of interest is discontinued
on a loan when Management believes, after considering economic and business
conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower's financial condition is
such that collection of principal or interest is doubtful.

The fair value of loans, as disclosed in Note 7, is estimated for
portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. For variable-rate
loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk,
fair values are based on carrying values. The fair values for certain mortgage
loans, such as one-to-four family residential properties, and other types of
loans are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current
rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit
ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Fair values for non-performing
loans are estimated using the current carrying value less any specific reserve
for which the Company has provided.

The FASB has issued SFAS No. 114 "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan" which becomes effective beginning in 1995. This statement
defines the measurement requirements for loans that are impaired or deemed to
be troubled debt restructurings. Management believes that the effect of this
statement upon adoption will not be material.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT:

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed over the estimated useful lives
of assets utilizing several depreciation methods as disclosed in Note 8.
Maintenance, repairs, and minor improvements are charged to operating expenses.
Gains or losses on dispositions are reflected currently in the Statement of
Income.

GOODWILL:

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair
market value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for
under the purchase method. The Company amortizes goodwill over fifteen years
using the straight-line method. Accumulated amortization of goodwill was
$1,808,000 and $1,454,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

OTHER REAL ESTATE:

Other real estate owned represents properties that have been acquired
in satisfaction of debt. Other real estate is valued at the lower of its fair
value or the recorded investment in the related loan upon foreclosure. If at a
later date it is determined that the recorded investment cannot be recovered,
the loss is recognized by a charge to income. When the property is in a
condition for use or sale at the time of the foreclosure, any subsequent
holding costs are included in expense as incurred. Legal fees and other direct
costs incurred by the Company in foreclosure are expensed when they are
incurred. Payments received for the rental or lease of property held in other
real estate are recognized as income in the period in which the payment is
received. The net costs of operating other real estate (including provisions
for real estate losses and gains and losses on sales of real estate) were
approximately $342,000, $1,452,000, and $1,597,000 for the years ended December
31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

DEPOSITS:

The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as
non-interest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits and
savings accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at
the reporting date, commonly referred to as the carrying value. Fair value of
certificates of deposit are based upon the discounted value of contractual cash
flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for
deposits of similar remaining maturities. See Note 9 for a detail of carrying
values and fair values for all deposit liabilities.

SHORT-TERM LIABILITIES:

The carrying amounts for federal funds purchased, securities sold
under agreements to repurchase and other liabilities approximate their fair
values.

INCOME TAXES:

The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated State and Federal
income tax returns. The Company adopted SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income
Taxes" effective January 1, 1993. The adoption of SFAS No. 109 changed the
Company's method of accounting for income taxes to the liability method. The
cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 on the Company's financial
statements was to increase net income in the amount of $2,522,000 or $0.49 per
share.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

The Company has non-contributory pension plans covering all eligible
officers and employees of certain of its subsidiaries. As disclosed in Note
12, the provision charged to operating expenses includes current costs as well
as amortization of past service cost.

The Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan for substantially all
of its employees. Contributions to the Plan during any one year are determined
by the Company and limited to 15 percent of the payroll for the participants.
During 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company's expenses totalled approximately
$362,000, $388,000, and $437,000, respectively.

During 1992, the FASB issued a new standard on accounting for
postemployment benefits. This new standard requires that the expected cost of
these benefits must be charged to expense during the years that the employees
render service. This new accounting standard will not have a material effect on
the Company.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS:

For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers all
currency on hand as well as all due from bank balances to be cash equivalents.

STOCK SPLIT:

On July 27, 1992, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a
2-for-1 stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. The stock
dividend was distributed on September 8, 1992. Unless otherwise indicated, all
per share data, numbers of common shares and the statements of changes in
capital accounts have been adjusted to reflect this stock split.

RECLASSIFICATIONS:

Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1992 and 1991
financial statements to conform to the 1993 method of presentation.

3. ACQUISITIONS

On November 30, 1993, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
stock of Commerce Financial Corporation and its wholly- owned subsidiary,
Commercial Bank at Alma ("Alma"), for $5,467,000. The consolidated assets of
Alma were approximately $45,000,000 at the date of acquisition. The transaction
was accounted for as a purchase, and, accordingly, the excess of the purchase
price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired was allocated to
Goodwill. The results of operations for Alma are included in the consolidated
statements of income from the date of acquisition. Unaudited pro forma results
of operations of the Company assuming that the acquisition of Alma had been
completed at the beginning of 1992 do not differ materially from the Company's
actual results.

On March 27, 1992, Merchants and Planters Bank, N.A., of Camden
acquired substantially all of the deposits of the former Camden, Arkansas
branch of Home Federal Savings of Kansas City from the Resolution Trust
Corporation for approximately $170,000 in cash. Merchants and Planters
received cash and acquired deposits of $20,696,000.

NOTES TO SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In the normal course of business, officers and directors of the Company
and their related interests maintain certain loan relationships with the
Company's subsidiary banks. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, officers, directors,
and related parties had loans of approximately $15,045,000 and $14,909,000,
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 1993, loans made to these
parties totalled $15,905,000 and repayments totalled $10,709,000. Loans to
related parties at December 31, 1992 included loans of $5,060,000 to directors
who retired during 1993.

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet
risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its
customers. These financial instruments include standby letters of credit and
commitments to extend credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees,
elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in
the Statement of Condition.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected
to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each
customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral
obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based
on Management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. The extent of
collateral varies for each commitment but may include accounts receivable,
inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial 
properties.

Standby letters of credit are commitments issued by the Company to
guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are
primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements,
including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Most
guarantees expire in 1994. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of
credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to
customers. The Company holds collateral supporting those commitments for which
collateral is deemed necessary. The extent of collateral held for those
commitments at December 31, 1993, varies from 0 percent to 100 percent; the
average amount collateralized is 50 percent.

Financial instruments whose amounts represent credit risk as of December 31,

The weighted-average discount rate and the rate of increase in future
compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the
projected benefit obligation were 7.0% and 4.5% respectively. The expected
long-term rate of return on assets was 7.0%.

In connection with the Merger, the Stuttgart Plan will terminate during
1994. A loss of $215,000 on the termination of this plan is included in the
accompanying 1993 statement of income.

The Bank of North Arkansas has a defined contribution employee benefit
plan, qualified under IRC Section 401(k) that covers all employees, with the
exception of employees who are highly compensated. Contributions to the plan
are based on the total amount of salary reduction the employee elects to defer,
a discretionary matching contribution equal to a percentage of the amount the
employee elects to defer, which percentage will be determined each year by the
employer, and a discretionary amount determined each year by the employer. To
share in the matching and discretionary contribution, the employee must
complete a year of service and be actively employed on the last day of the plan
year. The amount of pension expense was $13,000 and $16,000 for 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company has been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits which are
currently pending. In the opinion of Management, after consulting with legal
counsel, any liability incurred in connection with the ultimate outcome of
these suits will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company has a facilities management contract with a data processing
firm to provide computer equipment and the needed personnel for systems
support. Payments related to this contract, which expires in 1998, are expensed
when paid. Future annual minimum payments related to this contract are
$1,134,000 in each of the years 1994 through 1997 and $945,000 in 1998.

Certain branch facilities and warehouse space are leased under various
operating lease agreements. These leases require approximate minimum rentals
as follows: 1994-$124,000; 1995-$108,000; 1996-$107,000; 1997-$96,000;
1998-$106,000; and thereafter- $151,000.

14. RESTRICTIONS

Each of the Company's subsidiary banks is subject to either national or
state banking regulations which restrict the level of dividends that may be
paid in a given year. Such restrictions are based on a percentage of the
subsidiary bank's net income. During 1994, the Company's subsidiary banks will
have available for payment of dividends, without regulatory approval,
approximately $15,995,000 of undistributed earnings plus a percentage of the
net income earned in 1994.

At December 31, 1993, the Company was required to maintain reserve
balances in cash and due from accounts of approximately $9,199,000.

premiums were included in other operating expenses on the Company`s
Consolidated Statements of Income.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders of First United Bancshares, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying supplemental consolidated statements of
condition of First United Bancshares, Inc. (an Arkansas corporation) and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related supplemental
consolidated statements of income, changes in capital accounts and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993. The
supplemental consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the
merger with InvestArk Bankshares, Inc. ("InvestArk") on June 14, 1994 which has
been accounted for as a pooling of interests as described in Note 1. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We did not audit the financial statements of InvestArk included in the
supplemental consolidated financial statements of the Company, which statements
reflect total assets constituting 16 percent and 18 percent, respectively, as
of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and net interest income constituting 17 percent,
18 percent and 18 percent, respectively, for the years ended December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991 of the related supplemental consolidated totals. These
statements were audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been
furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the
amounts included for InvestArk, is based solely on the report of the other
auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of First United Bancshares,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As explained in Note 2 to the supplemental consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 1993, First United Bancshares, Inc. changed
its method of accounting for income taxes.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The management of First United Bancshares, Inc. (First United) is
responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and
other financial information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K. The
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. Financial information throughout this Current Report on
Form 8-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.

First United maintains a system of internal accounting controls which is
believed to provide, in all material respects, reasonable assurance that assets
are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition; transactions
are properly authorized and recorded; and the financial records are reliable
for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets.
All systems of internal accounting controls are based on management's judgment
that the cost of controls should not exceed the benefits to be achieved.
Management believes First United's system provides the appropriate balance
between costs of controls and the related benefits.

In order to monitor compliance with this system of controls, First United
maintains an internal audit program. Internal audit reports are issued to
appropriate officers, and significant audit exceptions, if any, are reviewed
with management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

The financial statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K have been
audited by First United's independent public accountants, Arthur Andersen LLP,
for the purpose of determining that the financial statements are presented
fairly. Their audit included a study of the evaluation of First United's
system of internal controls for the purpose of setting the scope of their
auditing procedures.
