INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

Board of Directors and Stockholders
BMC Bankcorp, Inc.
Benton, Kentucky

We have audited the accompanying consoldiated balance sheets of
BMC Bankcorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes
in stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 1993. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of BMC Bankcorp, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31,
1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1993, in comformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. As discussed in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method
of accounting for income taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

BMC Bankcorp, Inc. (Corporation) and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Bank of Marshall County, Inc. (Bank), Graves County
Bank (GCB), and United Commonwealth Bank, Federal Savings Bank
(UCB), provide banking services to the Western Kentucky market.
The subsidiaries are the operating members of the group. A
fourth wholly-owned subsidiary, BMC Bankcorp Realty & Investment,
Inc., is a primarily inactive company whose only asset is cash.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
parent company and its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in the subsidiaries are carried at the parent
company's equity in the underlying net assets (Note 21).

Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents
include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, short-term deposits
with Federal Home Loan Bank, and federal funds sold. Generally,
federal funds are purchased and sold for one-day periods.

Investment Securities

Investment securities (i.e., securities which the Corporation has
the ability and intent to hold until maturity) are stated at cost
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.
The decision to sell such securities is based on management's
assessment of changes in economic or financial market conditions,
interest rate risk, and the Corporation's financial position and
liquidity. The adjusted cost of the specific certificate sold is
used to compute gain or loss on the sale of investment
securities. No trading securities are held at December 31, 1993.

Loans and Interest Recognition

Loans are stated at the principal balance outstanding, net of
unearned income. Interest on commercial and real estate mortgage
loans is accrued and credited to operations based upon the
principal amount outstanding. Interest on consumer loans is
credited to operations based upon the sum-of-the-months-digits
method applied on the accrual basis, which method does not differ
materially from the interest method.

The accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when a
loan becomes ninety days past due as to principal or interest.
When interest accruals are discontinued, interest credited to
income in the current year is reversed, and interest accrued in
the prior year is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
Management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the
estimated net realizable value of collateral is sufficient to
cover the principal balance and accrued interest. Generally, any
payment received on non-accruing loans is applied first to
outstanding loan amounts and next to the recovery of charged-off
loan amounts. Any excess is treated as recovery of lost
interest.

Sale of Mortgage Loans

Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary
market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value
in the aggregate. Net unrealized losses are recognized in a
valuation allowance by charges to income. Mortgage loans are
sold for cash proceeds equal to the principal amount of loans
sold but with yield rates which reflect the current market rate.
Gain or loss is at the time of sale in an amount reflecting the
difference between the contractual interest rates of the loans
sold and current market rate. These loans are sold without
recourse, with servicing rights retained.

Loan Origination Fees/Costs

The Corporation defers net loan origination fees/costs and
amortizes such net fees/costs over the expected life of the loan
using the interest method. The Corporation has net deferred loan
origination costs which are included in loans on the balance
sheets. The amortization of these net deferred costs is included
in interest and fee income on loans on the statements of income.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses has been established to provide for
estimated loan losses. Such losses arise primarily from the loan
portfolio but may also be derived from other sources, including
commitments to extend credit, guarantees, and standby letters of
credit.

The level of the allowance is determined using procedures which
include an evaluation of individual classified credits, as well
as all other significant credits, to determine estimates of loss
probability; the estimation of loss on various categories of the
remaining loans in the portfolio on the basis of historical loss
experience of the category; and the consideration of various
other factors, such as credit concentrations, off-balance-sheet
risk, and an assessment of the current and future economic
environment. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a
level that in management's judgment is adequate to provide for
possible future losses on these relationships based on available
information.

The allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions for loan
losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off net of
recoveries on loans previously charged off. The provision for
loan losses charged to operating expense is based on management's
determination of the amount of the allowance necessary to provide
for estimated loan losses based on this evaluation of the loan
portfolio. The level of allowance and the amount of the
provision involve uncertainties and matters of judgment and
therefore cannot be determined with precision.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. The provision for depreciation
and amortization is computed by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets.

Other Real Estate

Other real estate is comprised of properties acquired through a
foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed in lieu of
foreclosure. These properties are carried at the lower of cost
or fair market value based on appraised value minus the estimated
cost to sell. Loan losses arising from the acquisition of such
property are charged against the allowance for loan losses.
Subsequent write downs are charged to other operating expense.

Start-up and Organizational Costs

Start-up and organizational costs were incurred in 1992 during
the creation of UCB which opened in September, 1992. These costs
are amortizing over a straight-line twenty year period and
reported net of amortization in other assets.

Income Taxes

In February, 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability
method of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

Effective January 1, 1992, the Corporation adopted SFAS 109 and
has reported the cumulative effect of that change in the method
of accounting for income taxes in the 1992 consolidated statement
of income.

The Corporation joins with its four subsidiaries in filing a
consolidated federal income tax return.

Income Per Common Share

Income per common share is calculated on the basis of the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding, net of
shares in treasury. Weighted common shares outstanding for 1993,
1992, and 1991, were 598,587, 598,990, and 599,210, respectively.
All per common share data has been restated to reflect the March,
1993, five-for-one stock split.

Trust Department

Revenues from trust and agency services are reported on a cash
basis, which does not differ materially from the accrual basis.
Securities and other properties, except cash deposits held by the
Bank's Trust Division in a fiduciary capacity, are reported
separately from the Bank's financial statements since such items
are not assets of the Bank.

Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for purposes of
comparability.

2. Cumulative Effect of Changing to a New Method of Accounting
for Income Taxes

The early adoption of SFAS 109 created a net deferred tax
asset of $181,883 as of January 1, 1992. Such an asset was not
allowed under the prior method of accounting for income taxes
under SFAS 96. The cumulative effect of this change in
accounting for income taxes on the year ending December 31, 1992,
was to increase net income by $181,883 ($.30 per common share).
The pro-forma data (if the prior years had been restated) for the
effect of this change on the consolidated statements of income

No investment securities were sold in 1993 or 1992; however, the
Corporation realized a $1,000 gain on an early call of one
security in 1992. Proceeds from sales of investment securities
during 1991 were $2,778,318. Gross gains of $15,127 and gross
losses of $260,106 were realized on those sales.

Investment securities with carrying amounts of $10,369,000 and
$8,777,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, were
pledged to secure public deposits and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase and for other purposes required or
permitted by law.

5. Loans

$146,460,259 $121,513,157
</TABLE>

Loans serviced for the benefit of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation at December 31, 1993 and 1992, were $5,955,000 and
$479,000, respectively. Service fees collected on these loans
during 1993 and 1992 were $2,230 and $0, respectively and are
included in interest and fees on loans. Loans committed to, but
not funded, in the secondary market were $289,000 and $0 at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued
amounted to $91,000 and $130,500 at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. If interest on those loans had been accrued, such
income from date of non-accrual, net of collections recognized as
income would have approximated $3,000, $20,500, and $32,000 for
1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. There were no material
commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose loans
were classified as nonaccrual at December 31, 1993. Loans
contractually past due 90 days or more amounted to $63,000 and
$352,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The Corporation's primary market is Western Kentucky. The
Corporation grants commercial and consumer loans to its
customers, most of whom are located within the Corporation's
primary market. Although the Corporation has a diversified loan
portfolio, a substantial portion of its debtor's ability to honor
their contracts is dependent upon the Corporation's primary
market's economic conditions.

Loans are either secured or unsecured based on the type of loan
and the financial condition of the borrower. The loans are
generally expected to be repaid from cash flow or proceeds from
the sale of selected assets of the borrower; however, the
Corporation is exposed to risk of loss on any or all loans due to
the borrower's difficulties, which can arise from any number of
factors including problems within the respective industry or
economic conditions within the Corporation's primary market.

Loans to directors and executive officers (including only those
loans which in the aggregate exceeded $60,000 per individual at
December 31), and to their affiliated (ten per cent or greater
interest) companies, amounted to $2,124,885 and $1,237,298 at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. These loans were
individually made in the ordinary course of business at
prevailing interest rates and under similar terms extended to
other bank customers.

Activity with respect to these loans are as follows (other
adjustments are new loans greater than $60,000 netted against
loans less than $60,000):

15. Financial Instruments with Off Balance Sheet Risk

In the normal course of business, there are outstanding various
commitments and contingent liabilities, such as guarantees,
commitments to extend credit, etc., which are not reflected in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Management
does not anticipate losses as a result of these transactions.

Outstanding standby letters of credit at December 31, 1993 and
1992, totaled $619,000 and $526,000, respectively. There were no
standby letters of credit to executive officers and directors in
1993 and 1992.

Undisbursed commitments to extend credit to customers totaled
$9,301,000 and $7,201,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
including $181,000 and $246,000 in such commitments to executive
officers and directors. The Corporation's exposure to credit
loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer related to
commitments to extend credit and standby letter of credit
outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 1992, is represented by the
contractual amount of those agreements.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a
customer as long as there is no violation of any condition
established in the contract. These commitments generally have
fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since many
of the commitments are expected to expire without being fully
drawn, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent
future cash requirements. The Corporation evaluates each
customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount
of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on
management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held
varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property,
plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.

16. Lease Commitments

Future minimum lease payments, and leased property receipts on
operating leases at December 31, 1993, are as follows:
<TABLE>
<S> <C> <C>
Operating Leased
Lease Property
Payments Receipts
1994 $ 471 $ 4,667
Thereafter - - 
</TABLE>

In addition to the amounts set forth above, certain of the
operating leases require payments by the Corporation for taxes,
insurance, and maintenance. Rental expense for all operating
leases (including equipment rentals based on usage) amounted to
$47,737 in 1993, $54,053 in 1992, and $50,353 in 1991. Rental
income for all operating leases amounted to $9,878 in 1993,
$11,900 in 1992, and $12,700 in 1991.

17. Employees' Profit Sharing Plan

The subsidiary banks all have profit sharing retirement plans
covering substantially all their employees. The plans provide
for an annual contribution to a trust fund, established on behalf
of the employees, of an amount determined by management based on
current operating results. The banks may contribute any amount
at their discretion but, in any event, the total annual
contribution to the plans shall not exceed the maximum amount
allowable as a deduction under the Internal Revenue Code. Profit
sharing expense totaled $182,089 in 1993, $162,696 in 1992, and
$140,611 in 1991.

18. Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends, Loans, or Advances

Banking regulations place certain restrictions on the transfer of
funds (loans and advances) and payment of dividends by the
subsidiary banks to the Corporation. At December 31, 1993, the
restricted net assets of the banks, included in the consolidated
balance sheet, approximated $18,814,000.

Substantially all of the Corporation's undivided profits
available for payment of dividends to its stockholders result
from net earnings of the subsidiary banks. The subsidiary banks
are restricted in the amount of dividends they may pay the
Corporation, without regulatory approval, to the total of net
earnings for the current year combined with retained net earnings
of the preceding two years. At December 31, 1993, approximately
$3,463,000 of the subsidiary banks' undivided profits were not
subject to this restriction. Under such restrictions, the
subsidiary banks will have available, without seeking regulatory
approval for payments of dividends during 1994, retained net
profits of approximately $2,091,000 plus net profits for 1994.

19. Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial
instruments is made in accordance with the requirements of SFAS
No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments."
The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the
Corporation using available market information and appropriate
valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is
necessarily required to interpret market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the
Corporation could realize in a current market exchange. The use
of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies
may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate that value:

Cash and Short-Term Investments

For cash and short-term investments, the carrying amount is
a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Investment Securities

For marketable securities held for investment purposes, fair
values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. If a
quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated
using quoted market prices for similar securities.

Loan Receivables

For various homogeneous categories of loans, such as
residential mortgages - fixed and variable, commercial loans,
floor plans, and installment loans, the fair value is estimated
by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at
which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar
credit ratings and for the same approximate remaining maturities.
The current rates used for the discounting were those charged as
of December 31, 1993, for the various local market area of the
Corporation's banking subsidiaries.

Deposit Liabilities

The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and
certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at
the reporting date. The fair value of fixed maturity
certificates of deposits is estimated using the rates offered at
December 31, 1993, for deposits of similar remaining maturities
in the various local markets of the banking subsidiaries.

Commitments to Extend Credit and Letters of Credit

A fair value amount was not computed on commitments to
extend credit or for standby letters of credit. Standby letters
of credit are for a period not to exceed one year and the fee is
recorded as income as of the beginning of the commitment period.
Offered credit under these agreements are generally for a period
of one year or less based on terms and other conditions similar
to current creditors. Therefore, there is no premium or discount
value associated with such credit arrangements.

It was not cost effective to attempt to determine the fair
value of commitments to extend credit under lines of credit
arrangements. Fees charged, if any, are generally collected at
the time the credit is offered and thus carry no premium value.
The fair value of future executed lines of credit commitments is
expected to approximate that of outstanding loans of commercial
and certain residential mortgage loans, which carry a premium at
December 31, 1993. However, cost to quantify such a premium is
not justified; therefore, no fair value for commitments to extend
credit is disclosed.

The estimated fair values of the Corporation's financial
instruments at December 31, 1993, are as follows:

The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent
information available to management as of December 31, 1993.
Although management is not aware of any factors that would
significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such
amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of
these financial statements since that date and, therefore,
current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the
amounts presented herein.

20. Subsequent Event

On January 10, 1994, the Corporation entered into a definitive
agreement with CBT Corporation of Paducah, Kentucky (CBT), that
if consummated, would merge the Corporation into CBT. The
agreement is subject to the approval of the Corporation's and
CBT's shareholders and various state and federal regulatory
authorities. Corporation shareholders would receive two shares
of CBT stock for each share of the Corporation's stock. All of
the Corporation's senior management is expected to remain in
place and three directors will be immediately placed on the board
of CBT. The merger would be effected under the "pooling of
interest" method for accounting purposes.
