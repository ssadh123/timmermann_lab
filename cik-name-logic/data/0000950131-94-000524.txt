public offering price of Notes referred to in the immediately preceding

2. Certain Terms Defined. The first and second sentences of the 
third paragraph of the Distribution Agreement shall be amended and restated in 
their entirety to read as follows:

The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement,
including a prospectus, and may in the future file one 
or more additional registration statements, in each case 
including a prospectus, relating to the Notes. The term
"Registration Statement," as used herein, means, at any
time, such of the foregoing registration statements, 
including the exhibits thereto, as are being used to offer 
Notes at such time.

3. Counsel for the Company. All references in the Distribution 
Agreement to the term "Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Robertson & Falk" shall
be changed to "Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Robertson, Falk & Rabkin".
