FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

MERISEL ANNOUNCES REDUCED SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS

El Segundo, Calif. (June 7, 1994)--Merisel, Inc.'s Co-Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, Michael D. Pickett, announced today that the Company expects
its earnings for the quarter ending June 30, 1994 to be significantly below
analysts' expectations. Mr. Pickett said that preliminary data for the early
portion of the current quarter indicates that the Company has generated lower
gross profits than previously expected in its wholesale distribution businesses
in the U.S. and U.K. Mr. Pickett indicated that Merisel's U.S. sales growth has
been slower than previously expected, partially as a result of higher than
normal sales returns. In addition, Mr. Pickett noted that pricing decisions
made by the Company for its U.S. distribution business in the first quarter
increased its sales growth rates, but decreased gross margin percentages more
than anticipated. "We took actions in late April to improve our gross margin
percentages," Mr. Pickett said, "and as a result, our estimated gross margins
have increased since that time. However, we do not expect second quarter
results to reflect the full effect of these improvements." Based on such
information, the Company currently believes that earnings will be in the range
of $0.09 to $0.12 per share for the second quarter.

Merisel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MSEL) is the world's largest publicly held wholesale
distributor of computer hardware and software products. The Company sells a
full-line of 25,000 products from more than 900 manufacturers to 65,000
resellers worldwide, including over 750 ComputerLand franchisees and Datago
affiliates. Merisel operates 10 international subsidiaries, 33 sales offices
and 20 distribution centers serving the United States, Canada, Europe, Latin
America and the Pacific Rim.
