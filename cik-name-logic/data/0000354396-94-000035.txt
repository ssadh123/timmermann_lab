its call for redemption on September 28, 1994, of 950,000

EXHIBIT I

August 29, 1994
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT: Kerrie Burch-DeLuca
(410) 547-3573

USF&G CORPORATION CALLS 25 PERCENT OF
$5.00 SERIES C CUMULATIVE
CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

USF&G Corporation today announced its call for redemption

on September 28, 1994, of 950,000 shares or 25 percent of its

outstanding $5.00 Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock

("Series C", ticker:FGpC) at a redemption price of $53.50 per share

plus accrued dividends of $0.81. A notice of redemption will be

mailed to all holders of those Series C shares called for

redemption. First Chicago Trust Company of New York, transfer

agent, has determined the shares to be called randomly by lot.

USF&G has 3.8 million shares of the Series C outstanding.

USF&G Corporation issued the Series C in June 1991 at the

outset of significant financial and operational restructuring of the

company. Given the improvement in the company's overall financial

position and its return to profitability, USF&G has chosen to begin

retiring a portion of this high-coupon (10 percent) preferred stock.

This transaction is expected to produce savings of approximately

$4 million annually.

At the holder's option, Series C shares called for

redemption are convertible into 4.158 shares of USF&G common stock

until the redemption date, at which time this option will expire.

As long as the common stock price is greater than $13.06, holders of

the Series C who convert will receive USF&G common stock (plus cash

for fractional shares) with market value greater than the amount of

cash the holders would otherwise be entitled to receive upon

redemption. USF&G's common stock closed at $13.75 per share on

the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, August 26.

Those Series C shares not called for redemption are also

convertible into common stock at any time at the holder's option.

USF&G has entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated

financial institution to place common stock to fund cash redemptions

if necessary. At June 30, 1994, there were approximately 85.4

million shares of USF&G common stock outstanding. USF&G will issue

approximately 4 million additional common shares either through

conversions or pursuant to these arrangements.

Baltimore-based USF&G Corporation, with assets of $14.0

billion, is composed of property/casualty and life insurance

subsidiaries. The corporation's principal subsidiary is the United

States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, one of the nation's largest

property/casualty insurers, founded in 1896.
