Item 5. Other Events
- ---------------------

Chemical Banking Corporation (the "Corporation") announced on 
December 1, 1994 a two-year program designed to produce earnings 
per share growth of more than 15 percent in 1995 and 1996, and 
a core efficiency ratio of 57 percent and a return on common 
shareholders' equity of 16 percent in 1996.

Under the program, the Corporation will reduce its existing 
cost base by $440 million ($230 million in 1995) from a number 
of actions, including the elimination of 3,700 positions, and
at the same time focus $180 million of new investment spending 
in a number of its high growth businesses. The net result, 
the Corporation announced, should be flat expenses in 1995 and 
1996 and annual revenue growth targeted at 4 to 6 percent.

To cover the costs associated with severance and the disposition 
of certain facilities, the Corporation announced it will take a 
pre-tax restructuring charge of $260 million in the 1994 fourth 
quarter.

The Corporation also announced its intention to sell approximately
60 percent of Chemical Bank New Jersey and to integrate the remaining 
branches in the northeast quadrant of New Jersey into its consumer 
and middle market franchise serving Metropolitan New York. The 
Corporation also announced that it is exploring options to sell or 
substantially reduce its 40 percent investment in The CIT Group.

In addition, the Corporation announced it plans to repurchase up to 6 
million shares of its common stock over the next 12 months. This 
follows a 10 million share buyback program completed in September. 
The Corporation announced that it would consider expanding the new stock
buyback program upon completion of the contemplated divestitures.

The Corporation also announced that it will be designating
approximately $950 million of real estate loans and foreclosed
property as "held for sale." The Corporation announced that most 
of these assets are nonperforming and that it would take a charge 
against the reserve for loan losses of approximately $150 million 
in the 1994 fourth quarter to facilitate rapid disposition.

The Corporation's Press Release announcing this program is incorporated 
herein and attached hereto.
