Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On June 1, 1994, Doskocil Companies Incorporated (the
"Company") consummated the acquisition (the "Acquisition") of the
Frozen Specialty Foods Division ("Frozen Specialty Foods") of
International Multifoods Corporation. The Acquisition was
financed with borrowings under a $186 million senior secured
credit facility provided pursuant to the Credit Agreement, dated
as of May 25, 1994, among the Company, the lenders named therein,
and Chemical Bank (the "Credit Agreement"). Following the
Acquisition, Frozen Specialty Foods was renamed "Doskocil
Specialty Brands Company" ("Specialty Brands"). The Company
plans to continue to operate Specialty Brands as a manufacturer
of frozen specialty foods. The Credit Agreement is attached
hereto as Exhibit 1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5. Other Events.

(a) On May 3, 1994, the Company entered into an
agreement with Robert S. Wright, President of the Prepared Foods
Division of IMC (the "Wright Agreement"), with respect to Mr.
Wright's employment with the Company with responsibility for
managing Specialty Brands. Pursuant to the Wright Agreement, Mr.
Wright was appointed Senior Vice President of the Company and
President of Specialty Brands for an initial term of three years.
The effectiveness of the Wright Agreement was conditioned upon
the consummation of the Acquisition.

(b) On June 2, 1994, the Company issued a press
release with respect to the Acquisition, a copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and is incorporated herein by
reference. The terms of the transaction described in such press
release are qualified in their entirety by reference to (a) the
Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 17, 1994, between
International Multifoods Corporation and the Company, which is
described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for
the fiscal year ended January 1, 1994 and is attached thereto as
Exhibit 10.36 and is incorporated herein by reference, and (b)
the Credit Agreement.

(c) Financial Statements of Business Acquired.
The balance sheet of Frozen Specialty Foods as of
February 28, 1994 and November 27, 1993 and the related
statements of operations and cash flows for the three months
ended February 28, 1994 and February 27, 1993 are attached hereto
as Exhibit 3 and are incorporated herein by reference.

(c) Pro Forma Financial Information.
The following pro forma condensed consolidated
balance sheet has been prepared assuming the Acquisition had been
consummated on April 2, 1994. The pro forma condensed
consolidated balance sheet includes the historical consolidated
accounts of the Company as of April 2, 1994 and Frozen Specialty
Foods as of February 28, 1994. The purchase price consisted of
$70,500,000 plus the net book value, at date of closing, of the
net assets acquired. Accordingly, pro forma adjustments were
recorded to reduce the historical amounts of assets and
liabilities as of February 28, 1994 to the net book value of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at date of closing and to
eliminate from the historical amounts assets not acquired and
liabilities not assumed. Additional pro forma adjustments were
made to adjust the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to
their estimated fair values based on preliminary valuations.

The following pro forma condensed consolidated
statement of operations for the three months ended April 2, 1994
has been prepared assuming the Acquisition had been consummated
on January 2, 1994. The pro forma condensed consolidated
statement of operations for the three months ended April 2, 1994
includes the historical consolidated results of operations of the
Company for the three months ended April 2, 1994 and the
historical results of Frozen Specialty Foods for the three months
ended February 28, 1994.

The pro forma combined results of operations are not
necessarily indicative of results of operations that would have
resulted had the Acquisition actually occurred on January 2, 1994
nor are they necessarily indicative of future results of
operations.

These statements should be read in conjunction with the
April 2, 1994 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company
and the financial statements of Frozen Specialty Foods attached
hereto as Exhibit 3.

DOSKOCIL COMPANIES INCORPORATED
NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The pro forma condensed consolidated statement of
operations for the three months ended April 2, 1994 has been
prepared assuming the Acquisition had been consummated on January
2, 1994 and includes the historical consolidated results of
operations of the Company for the three months ended April 2,
1994 and the historical results of Frozen Specialty Foods for the
three months ended February 28, 1994. The pro forma combined
results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results
of operations that would have resulted had the Acquisition
actually occurred on January 2, 1994 nor are they necessarily
indicative of future results of operations.

The pro forma combined statement of operations does not give
effect to the loss on early extinguishment of debt resulting from
the consummation of a new bank term loan and revolving line of
credit and early extinguishment of the existing revolving line of
credit. The estimated loss of $2.7 million, before income taxes
of $1.1 million (assuming a statutory (federal and state) tax
rate of 40%), resulting from the early extinguishment of this
debt, will be recorded as an extraordinary item during the period
the debt is extinguished (second quarter of fiscal 1994).

Note 2. Pro Forma Adjustments

(a) To record the net change in depreciation expense based on
the fair value of depreciable assets, versus their
historical cost, using the straight line method over their
estimated useful lives.

(b) To record amortization of trademarks over 25 years and
goodwill over a period of 40 years, and eliminate
amortization of the historical goodwill of Frozen Specialty
Foods.

(c) To record additional interest attributable to the increase
in bank debt to finance the Acquisition, record amortization
of debt issue costs over the term of the new bank debt and
eliminate amortization of debt issue costs attributable to
debt which will be extinguished.

(d) To record the tax benefit attributable to the net pro forma
adjustments based on the statutory (federal and state) tax
rate of 40%. The effective tax rate in future years is
expected to be in excess of the statutory rate due to non-
deductible amortization of previously recorded intangible
assets.

(e) The weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares used in the pro forma earnings per share computation
were 7,921,000 (historical).

DOSKOCIL COMPANIES INCORPORATED, a Delaware
corporation (the Borrower ), the financial
institutions party hereto (the Lenders ), CHEMICAL
BANK, a New York banking corporation, as agent for the
Lenders (in such capacity, the Agent ) and as
fronting bank (in such capacity, the Fronting Bank ).

The Borrower has entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as
of March 17, 1994 (the Stock Purchase Agreement ), with International
Multifoods Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Seller ), to
purchase all the outstanding equity securities of International
Multifoods Foodservice Corp., a Delaware corporation ( Foodservice

purchase price equal to the sum of (a) $70,500,000 and (b) the lesser of
(i) the amount of Closing Net Assets (as defined in, and determined in
accordance with the terms and provisions of, the Stock Purchase
Agreement) and (ii) $72,000,000. The purchase pursuant to the Stock
Purchase Agreement is referred to herein as the Acquisition .

The Borrower has requested (a) the Lenders to extend credit in
order to enable the Borrower, on the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, to borrow (i) on a term basis on the Closing Date,
Term Loans (such term and each other capitalized term used but not
defined in this introductory statement having the meaning given to such
terms in Article I) in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
$146,000,000 and (ii) on a revolving basis, at any time and from time to
time prior to the Maturity Date, an aggregate principal amount at any
time outstanding not in excess of the excess of (A) the lesser of
(I) $40,000,000 and (II) the Borrowing Base at such time over (B) the LC
Exposure at such time and (b) the Fronting Bank to issue, on the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Letters of Credit in an
aggregate face amount at any time outstanding not in excess of
$5,000,000.

The proceeds of the Term Loans will be used by the Borrower solely
(a) to finance the purchase price for Foodservice Corp. to be paid
pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, (b) to pay fees and expenses
in connection with the Acquisition, (c) to pay amounts outstanding under
the Existing Credit Agreement and (d) to repay all the Borrower's
obligations under the Interest Rate Swap Agreement dated October 31,
1991 (the "Swap Agreement"), between the Borrower and Chemical Bank.

The proceeds of the Revolving Loans made on the Closing Date will
be used to pay amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement. 
The proceeds of the Revolving Loans made after the Closing Date will be
used (a) for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of the
Borrower's business, including funding the working capital requirements
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and (b) in an amount not to exceed
$15,000,000 from and including the Closing Date, to finance all or part
of the purchase price to be paid in connection with any Permitted
Acquisition. Any standby letter of credit (each, a Standby Letter of
Credit ) issued hereunder will be used to support the obligations of the
Borrower or the Subsidiaries, contingent or otherwise, in respect of
insurance, worker's compensation and similar obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of the business of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries, as
applicable. Any commercial letter of credit (each, a Commercial Letter
of Credit ) issued hereunder will be used to provide the primary means
of payment for the purchase of goods or services by the Borrower in the
ordinary course of its business.

Accordingly, the Borrower, the Lenders, the Agent and the Fronting
Bank agree as follows:

Term Loans to the Borrower on the Closing Date in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed the Term Loan Commitment set forth opposite such

Borrower, at any time and from time to time (subject to Section 2.13(f))
on or after the Closing Date and prior to the earlier of the Maturity
Date and the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment of such
Lender in accordance with the terms hereof, in an aggregate principal
amount at any time outstanding not to exceed an amount equal to the

the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth

SECTION 2.02. Loans. (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a
Borrowing consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance
with their respective Term Loan Commitments or Revolving Credit
Commitments, as the case may be; provided, however, that the failure of
any Lender to make any Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender
of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that
no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to
make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender). The Loans
comprising each Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount that
is (i) in the case of ABR Borrowings, an integral multiple of $500,000
and not less than $1,000,000 and (ii) in the case of Eurodollar

$7,000,000 (or if less in the case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing, an

(b) Each Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or
Eurodollar Loans, as the Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03;
provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Loans having an
Interest Period the duration of which is six months may be requested

that the syndication of the Facilities has been completed. Each Lender
may at its option fulfill its Commitment with respect to any Eurodollar
Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan, provided that any exercise of such option
shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one
Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing that, if made,
would result in an aggregate of more than five separate Eurodollar
Loans of any Lender being outstanding hereunder at any one time. For
purposes of the foregoing, Loans having different Interest Periods,
regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be
considered separate Loans.

(c) Subject to paragraph (e) below, each Lender shall make a Loan
in the amount of its pro rata portion, as determined under Section 2.17,
of each Borrowing hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Agent in New York, New
York, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, and the Agent shall
by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, credit the amounts so received to the
general deposit account of the Borrower with the Agent or, if a
Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent
herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so received
to the respective Lenders. Unless the Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing,
the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to
the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with this
paragraph (c) and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to
the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available
to the Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to
the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the
Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable
at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case
of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender shall
repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall
constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of
this Agreement. 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Revolving Credit Borrowing
if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after
the Maturity Date.

(e) The Borrower may refinance all or any part of any Revolving
Credit Borrowing with a Revolving Credit Borrowing of the same or a
different Type, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in
this Agreement. Any Revolving Credit Borrowing or part thereof so
refinanced shall be deemed to be repaid or prepaid in accordance with
Section 2.04 or 2.12, as applicable, with the proceeds of a new
Revolving Credit Borrowing, and the proceeds of the new Revolving Credit
Borrowing, to the extent they do not exceed the principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Borrowing being refinanced, shall not be paid by the
Lenders to the Agent or by the Agent to the Borrower pursuant to
paragraph (c) above.

(f) If the Agent has not received evidence of the payment required
by Section 3.04(a) by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date on
which the Fronting Bank has notified the Borrower that payment of a
draft presented under any Letter of Credit will be made (or such later
time as is not later than one hour after the Borrower shall have
received such notice or, if the Borrower shall have received such notice
later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Business Day, not
later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following
Business Day), as provided in Section 3.04(a), the Agent will notify not
later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, the Fronting Bank and each
Participating Lender of the LC Disbursement and, in the case of each
Participating Lender, its Applicable Percentage of such LC Disbursement.
Each Participating Lender will pay to the Agent not later than
4:00 p.m., New York City time, on such date an amount equal to such
Participating Lender's Applicable Percentage of such LC Disbursement (it
being understood that such amount shall constitute an ABR Revolving Loan
of such Lender and shall be deemed to have reduced the LC Exposure at
such time), and the Agent will promptly pay such amount to the Fronting
Bank. The Agent will promptly remit to each Participating Lender its
Applicable Percentage of any amounts subsequently received by the Agent
from the Borrower in respect of such LC Disbursement. If any Lender
shall not have made its Applicable Percentage of such LC Disbursement
available to the Fronting Bank as provided above, such Lender agrees to
pay interest on such amount, for each day from and including the date
such amount is required to be paid in accordance with this paragraph (f)
to but excluding the date an amount equal to such amount is paid to the
Agent for prompt payment to the Fronting Bank at, for the first such
day, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and thereafter, the Alternate
Base Rate.

SECTION 2.03. Notice of Borrowings. The Borrower shall give the
Agent written or telex notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in

Day) and the amount thereof; and (c) if such Borrowing is to be a
Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no
election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified in any such notice,
then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest
Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing is specified in any such
notice, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest
Period of one month's duration. If the Borrower shall not have given
notice in accordance with this Section 2.03 of its election to refinance
a Revolving Credit Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period in
effect for such Borrowing, then the Borrower shall (unless such
Borrowing is repaid at the end of such Interest Period) be deemed to
have given notice of an election to refinance such Borrowing with an ABR
Borrowing. The Agent shall promptly advise the Lenders of any notice
given pursuant to this Section 2.03 and of each Lender's portion of the
requested Borrowing.

SECTION 2.04. Repayment of Loans. The outstanding principal
balance of each Loan shall be payable (a) in the case of a Revolving

evidencing the date and amount of each Loan from such Lender, each
payment and prepayment of principal of any such Loan, each payment of
interest on any such Loan and the other information provided for on such
schedule; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make such
a notation or any error therein shall not affect the obligation of the
Borrower to repay the Loans made by such Lender in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 2.05. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender,
through the Agent, the following fees (each, a Commitment Fee ): on the

date on which any of such Commitments of such Lender shall expire or be
terminated). The Commitment Fee due to each Lender in respect of its
Term Loan Commitment and Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence shall accrue from and including the date
upon which such Commitments of such Lender were accepted. For purposes
of calculating Commitment Fees in respect of Revolving Credit
Commitments, any portion of such Revolving Credit Commitments
unavailable due to outstanding Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be
used amounts. All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

(b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for its own account,
administrative fees (the Administrative Fees ) at the time and in the
amounts agreed upon in the fee letter agreement dated March 11, 1994,
between the Borrower and the Agent.

(c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent on the Closing Date
the other fees specified in the fee letter agreement referred to in
paragraph (b) above.

(d) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Fronting Bank, for its own
account, the fees specified in Section 3.08.

(e) All Fees (other than the fees payable to the Fronting Bank
under Section 3.08) shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
available funds, to the Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate,
among the Lenders. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under
any circumstances (other than corrections of error in payment).

SECTION 2.06. Interest on Loans. (a) Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.07, the Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, when the Alternate
Base Rate is determined by reference to the Prime Rate and over a year
of 360 days at all other times) at a rate per annum equal to the
Alternate Base Rate plus the ABR Spread.

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07, the Loans
comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days)
at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest
Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the LIBOR Spread.

(c) So long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, the ABR Spread shall decrease to 1-1/4% per annum and
the LIBOR Spread shall decrease to 2-1/4% per annum on each occasion
that, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, (i) the Interest Expense
Ratio shall equal or exceed 2.25 to 1.00 and (ii) the Total Debt Ratio
for such fiscal quarter shall be less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00,
with such decrease in the ABR Spread to be effective with respect to
ABR Loans outstanding on, or made on or after, the date of the delivery
to the Agent of the certificate described in Section 6.04(c) relating to
such fiscal quarter and with such decrease in the LIBOR Spread to be
effective with respect to Eurodollar Loans made on or after the date of
the delivery of such certificate relating to such fiscal quarter. In the
event that either of the conditions that gave rise to any decrease in
the ABR Spread and the LIBOR Spread pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence is no longer satisfied as of the end of any
subsequent fiscal quarter, (i) the decreases in the ABR Spread and the
LIBOR Spread provided for in the preceding sentence shall cease to be
effective for all purposes on and after the date of delivery to the
Agent of the certificate described in Section 6.04(c) relating to such
subsequent fiscal quarter and (ii) the ABR Spread to be effective from
and including such date shall be 1-1/2% per annum and the LIBOR Spread
to be effective from and including such date shall be 2-1/2% per annum.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time during which the Borrower has
failed to deliver the certificate described in Section 6.04(c) in
accordance with the provisions thereof, the ABR Spread shall be deemed
to be 1-1/2% per annum and the LIBOR Spread shall be deemed to be 2-1/2%
per annum from and including the date on which the Borrower was required
to deliver such certificate pursuant to Section 6.04(c) to but excluding
the date on which the Borrower shall deliver such certificate in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.04(c).

(d) Interest on each Loan shall be payable on the Interest Payment
Dates applicable to such Loan except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement. The applicable ABR Spread or LIBOR Spread for each Interest
Period or day within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be
determined by the Agent, and such determination shall be presumptively
correct absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.07. Default Interest. If the Borrower shall default in
the payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other
amount becoming due hereunder or under any Security Document, by
acceleration or otherwise, the Borrower shall on demand from time to
time pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such defaulted
amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as
well as before judgment) at a rate per annum (the Default Rate )
(computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year
of 360 days) equal to (a) in the case of any Loan, the rate applicable
to such Loan under Section 2.06 plus 2% per annum and (b) in the case of
any other amount, the rate that would be applicable to an ABR Loan under
Section 2.06 plus 2% per annum. 

SECTION 2.08. Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on
each occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing the Agent
shall have determined that dollar deposits in the principal amounts of
the Loans comprising such Borrowing are not generally available in the
London interbank market, or that the rates at which such dollar deposits
are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any
Lender of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loan during such Interest
Period, or that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the
Adjusted LIBO Rate, the Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter,
give written or telex notice of such determination to the Borrower and
the Lenders. In the event of any such determination, any request by the
Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.10
shall, until the Agent shall have advised the Borrower and the Lenders
that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, be
deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing. Each determination by the
Agent hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.09. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) The
Term Loan Commitments shall be automatically terminated at 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the Closing Date. The Revolving Credit
Commitments and the LC Commitment shall be automatically terminated at
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Maturity Date and the LC Maturity
Date, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all the Commitments
and the LC Commitment shall be automatically terminated at 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on August 31, 1994, if the initial borrowing under
the Facilities has not occurred by such time.

(b) Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable written
or telex notice to the Agent, the Borrower may at any time in whole
permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce,
the Revolving Credit Commitments; provided, however, that (i) each
partial reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be in an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 and in a minimum principal amount of
$3,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not be permitted to terminate or
reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments if, as the result of such
termination or reduction, (A) the LC Commitment would exceed the
aggregate remaining amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments or
(B) the Revolving Credit Utilization would exceed the aggregate
remaining Revolving Credit Commitments. The LC Commitment may be
voluntarily terminated or reduced by the Borrower as provided in
Section 3.07.

(c) Each reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitments and the LC
Commitment hereunder shall be made ratably among the applicable Lenders
in accordance with their respective applicable Commitments. The Borrower
shall pay to the Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders, on the
date of each termination or reduction, the Commitment Fees on the amount
of the Commitments so terminated or reduced accrued to but excluding the
date of such termination or reduction.

SECTION 2.10. Conversion and Continuation of Term Borrowings. The
Borrower shall have the right at any time (subject to Section 2.08) upon
prior irrevocable notice to the Agent (i) not later than 12:00 noon, New
York City time, on the Business Day of such conversion, to convert any
Eurodollar Term Borrowing into an ABR Term Borrowing, (ii) not later
than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days prior to
conversion or continuation, to convert any ABR Term Borrowing into a
Eurodollar Term Borrowing or to continue any Eurodollar Term Borrowing
as a Eurodollar Term Borrowing for an additional Interest Period and
(iii) not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days
prior to conversion, to convert the Interest Period with respect to any
Eurodollar Term Borrowing to another permissible Interest Period,
subject in each case to the following:

(a) each conversion or continuation shall be made pro rata
among the Lenders in accordance with the respective principal
amounts of the Loans comprising the converted or continued Term
Borrowing;

(b) if less than all the outstanding principal amount of any
Term Borrowing shall be converted or continued, the aggregate
principal amount of such Term Borrowing converted or continued
shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than
$3,000,000;

(c) each conversion shall be effected by each Lender by
applying the proceeds of the new Term Loan of such Lender
resulting from such conversion to the Term Loan (or portion
thereof) of such Lender being converted, and accrued interest on a
Term Loan (or portion thereof) being converted shall be paid by
the Borrower at the time of conversion;

(d) if any Eurodollar Term Borrowing is converted at a time
other than the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the
Borrower shall pay, upon demand, any amounts due to the Lenders
pursuant to Section 2.16;

(e) any portion of a Term Borrowing maturing or required to
be repaid in less than one month may not be converted into or
continued as a Eurodollar Term Borrowing;

(f) any portion of a Eurodollar Term Borrowing that cannot
be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Term Borrowing by
reason of subparagraph (e) above shall be automatically converted
at the end of the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
into an ABR Term Borrowing; and

(g) no Interest Period may be selected for any Eurodollar
Term Borrowing that would end later than a Term Loan Repayment
Date occurring on or after the first day of such Interest Period
if, after giving effect to such selection, the aggregate
outstanding amount of (i) the Eurodollar Term Borrowings with
Interest Periods ending on or prior to such Term Loan Repayment
Date and (ii) the ABR Term Borrowings would not be at least equal
to the principal amount of Term Borrowings to be paid on such Term
Loan Repayment Date.

Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be irrevocable and
shall refer to this Agreement and specify (i) the identity and amount of
the Term Borrowing that the Borrower requests be converted or continued,
(ii) whether such Term Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a
Eurodollar Term Borrowing or an ABR Term Borrowing, (iii) if such notice
requests a conversion, the date of such conversion (which shall be a
Business Day) and (iv) if such Term Borrowing is to be converted to or
continued as a Eurodollar Term Borrowing, the Interest Period with
respect thereto. If no Interest Period is specified in any such notice
with respect to any conversion to or continuation as a Eurodollar Term
Borrowing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest
Period of one month's duration. The Agent shall advise the other Lenders
of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.10 and of each Lender's
portion of any converted or continued Term Borrowing. If the Borrower
shall not have given notice in accordance with this Section 2.10 to
continue any Term Borrowing into a subsequent Interest Period (and shall
not otherwise have given notice in accordance with this Section 2.10 to
convert such Term Borrowing), such Term Borrowing shall, at the end of
the Interest Period applicable thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the
terms hereof), automatically be continued into a new Interest Period as
an ABR Term Borrowing.

SECTION 2.11. Repayment of Term Borrowings. (a) The Borrower shall
pay to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, on each date set
forth below (each such date being a Term Loan Repayment Date ) a
principal amount of the Term Loans (such amount, as adjusted from time
to time pursuant to Sections 2.12(b) and 2.13(e), being called the Term
Loan Repayment Amount ) equal to the amount set forth below for such
date, together in each case with accrued and unpaid interest on the
principal amount to be paid to but excluding the date of such payment:

Date: Amount:

December 31, 1994 $ 8,000,000
June 30, 1995 9,000,000
December 31, 1995 10,000,000
June 30, 1996 11,000,000
December 31, 1996 12,000,000
June 30, 1997 14,500,000
December 31, 1997 15,500,000
June 30, 1998 15,500,000
December 31, 1998 15,500,000
June 30, 1999 17,500,000
December 31, 1999 17,500,000

On each Term Loan Repayment Date, the Agent shall apply the Term Loan
Repayment Amount paid to the Agent to pay the Term Loans.

(b) To the extent not previously paid, all Term Borrowings shall
be due and payable on the Maturity Date, together with accrued and
unpaid interest on the principal amount to be paid to but excluding the
date of payment.

(c) All repayments pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be subject
to Section 2.16, but shall otherwise be without premium or penalty.

SECTION 2.12. Optional Prepayment. (a) The Borrower shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay (i) Revolving Credit
Borrowings and (ii) Term Borrowings, in each case in whole or in part,
upon (A) in the case of prepayments of ABR Revolving Loans, at least
same-day prior written or telex notice (or telephone notice promptly
confirmed by written or telex notice) to the Agent and (B) in the case
of all other loans, at least three Business Days' prior written or
telex notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written or telex
notice) to the Agent; provided, however, that each partial prepayment
shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not
less than $1,000,000. 

(b) Each prepayment of principal of the Term Borrowings pursuant
to paragraph (a) above shall be applied pro rata to reduce the scheduled
payments of principal due under Section 2.11(a) after the date of such
prepayment, provided that prepayments of principal of the Term
Borrowings pursuant to paragraph (a) above with the proceeds of the
issuance of equity securities by the Borrower after the Closing Date
will be applied to reduce the scheduled payments of principal due under
Section 2.11(a) after the date of such prepayment in the order of
maturity. 

(c) Each notice of prepayment shall specify (i) the amount to be
prepaid, (ii) the prepayment date, (iii) whether the prepayment relates
to Revolving Credit Borrowings or to Term Borrowings and (iv) the
principal amount to be prepaid of (A) Revolving Credit Borrowings (or
portion thereof) or (B) Term Borrowings (or portion thereof). Each such
notice shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such
obligations by the amount specified therein on the date specified
therein. All prepayments of Borrowings under this Section 2.12 shall be
subject to Section 2.16 but otherwise without premium or penalty. All
prepayments under this Section 2.12 shall be accompanied by accrued
interest on the principal amount being prepaid to but excluding the date
of payment.

(d) No optional prepayment of Term Borrowings made by the Borrower
pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall reduce the Borrower's obligation to
make mandatory prepayments pursuant to Section 2.13(c) or
Section 2.13(d).

SECTION 2.13. Mandatory Prepayments. (a) On the date of any
termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to
Section 2.09, the Borrower shall pay or prepay so much of the Revolving
Credit Borrowings as shall be necessary in order that (i) the aggregate
principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding at such time will
not exceed (ii) the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments (after giving
effect to such termination or reduction) less the aggregate LC Exposure
at such time.

(b) In the event and on each occasion that the Revolving Credit
Utilization exceeds the then-current Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall
forthwith pay or prepay Revolving Credit Borrowings in a principal
amount at least equal to such excess; provided, however, that if the
aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Borrowings then
outstanding is less than the amount of such excess (because of any
LC Exposure), the Borrower shall, to the extent of any remaining excess
(after the prepayment of Revolving Credit Borrowings), replace
outstanding Letters of Credit and/or deposit an amount in cash in a cash
collateral account established with the Agent for the benefit of the
Secured Parties.

(c) In the event and on each occasion that a Prepayment Event
occurs, the Borrower shall apply (i) in the case of any Prepayment Event
other than a Prepayment Event arising solely from the issuance or
incurrence by the Borrower of any Specified Permitted Debt, an amount
equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds therefrom or (ii) in the case of
a Prepayment Event arising solely from the issuance or incurrence by the
Borrower of any Specified Permitted Debt, (A) 100% of the Net Cash
Proceeds from the first $75,000,000 of Specified Permitted Debt issued
after the Closing Date, (B) 75% of the Net Cash Proceeds from the next
$25,000,000 of Specified Permitted Debt issued after the Closing Date
and (C) 50% of the Net Cash Proceeds from any other Specified Permitted
Debt, in each case to prepay obligations outstanding under this
Agreement in accordance with this paragraph (c). Substantially
simultaneously with (and in any event not later than the Business Day
next following) the occurrence of a Prepayment Event, the Borrower
shall pay to the Agent (for application to the prepayment of obligations
outstanding under this Agreement in accordance with paragraph (e) below)
an amount equal to the percentage of the Net Cash Proceeds from such
Prepayment Event specified in the preceding sentence.

(d) No later than the earlier of (i) 105 days after the end of
each fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year ending on December 31,
1994, and (ii) the date on which the financial statements with respect
to such period are delivered pursuant to 6.04(a), the Borrower shall
prepay obligations outstanding under this Agreement in accordance with
paragraph (e) below in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Excess
Cash Flow Percentage (as defined below) of Excess Cash Flow for such
period. The Excess Cash Flow Percentage shall equal (i) 75% for any
fiscal year if at the end of such fiscal year the outstanding principal
amount of the Term Loans exceeds $87,600,000 and (ii) 50% for any other
fiscal year.

(e) Mandatory prepayments of outstanding obligations under this
Agreement made by the Borrower pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) above
and paragraph (g) below shall be applied first, to prepay scheduled
payments of principal due on the Term Borrowings under Section 2.11(a)
after the date of such prepayment in the manner described in the
immediately following sentence and second, to prepay Revolving Credit
Borrowings. Each such mandatory prepayment of principal of the Term
Borrowings shall be applied pro rata to reduce the scheduled payments
of principal due under Section 2.11(a) after the date of such
prepayment.

(f) In addition to, and not in limitation of, the obligations of
the Borrower under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this
Section 2.13, the Borrower shall pay or prepay so much of the Revolving
Credit Borrowings as shall be necessary in order that the aggregate
principal amount of Revolving Loans outstanding does not exceed
$20,000,000 for a period of at least 30 consecutive days during the
period from and including January 1 of each calendar year to but
excluding April 1 of each calendar year, commencing with the calendar
year 1995.

(g) The Borrower shall deliver to the Agent, (i) at the time of
each prepayment required under paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of this
Section 2.13, a certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the
Borrower setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the
amount of such prepayment and (ii) at least three Business Days prior to
the time of each prepayment required under this Section 2.13 (if known
at such time), a notice of such prepayment. Each required notice of
prepayment shall specify the prepayment date, the Type of each Borrowing
being prepaid and the principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion
thereof) to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the
Borrower to prepay such obligations by the amount stated therein on the
date stated therein. All prepayments of Borrowings under this
Section 2.13 shall be subject to Section 2.16, but shall otherwise be
without premium or penalty. All prepayments of Borrowings under this
Section 2.13 (other than prepayments pursuant to paragraph (d) above)
shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount being
prepaid to but excluding the date of payment. All prepayments of
Borrowings pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section 2.13 shall be
applied first to the payment of accrued interest and then to the payment
of principal.

(h) Net Cash Proceeds and such other amounts to be applied
pursuant to this Section 2.13 to the prepayment of Term Borrowings and
Revolving Credit Borrowings shall be applied, as applicable, first to
reduce outstanding ABR Term Borrowings and ABR Revolving Credit
Borrowings. Any amounts remaining after each such application shall, at
the option of the Borrower, be applied to prepay Eurodollar Term
Borrowings or Eurodollar Revolving Credit Borrowings, as the case may
be, immediately or shall be deposited in the Prepayment Account (as
defined below). The Agent shall apply any cash deposited in the
Prepayment Account (i) allocable to Term Borrowings to prepay Eurodollar
Term Borrowings and (ii) allocable to Revolving Credit Borrowings to
prepay Eurodollar Revolving Credit Borrowings, in each case on the last
day of their respective Interest Periods (or, at the direction of the
Borrower, on any earlier date) until all outstanding Term Borrowings or
Revolving Credit Borrowings, as the case may be, have been prepaid or
until all the allocable cash on deposit with respect to such Borrowings
has been exhausted. For purposes of this Agreement,the term Prepayment
Account shall mean an account established by the Borrower with the
Agent and over which the Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal for application in
accordance with this paragraph (h). The Agent will, at the request of
the Borrower, invest amounts on deposit in the Prepayment Account in
Permitted Investments maturing prior to the last day of the applicable
Interest Periods of the Eurodollar Term Borrowings or Eurodollar
Revolving Credit Borrowings to be prepaid, as the case may be; provided,
however, that (i) the Agent shall not be required to make any investment
that, in its sole judgment, would require or cause the Agent to be in,
or would result in any, violation of any law, statute, rule or
regulation and (ii) the Agent shall have no obligation to invest amounts
on deposit in the Prepayment Account if a Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing. The Borrower shall indemnify the
Agent for any losses relating to the investments so that the amount
available to prepay Eurodollar Borrowings on the last day of the
applicable Interest Periods is not less than the amount that would have
been available had no investments been made pursuant thereto. Other than
any interest earned on such investments, the Prepayment Account shall
not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments
shall be deposited in the Prepayment Account and reinvested as specified
above. If the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated pursuant to
Article VIII, the Agent may, in its sole discretion, apply all amounts
on deposit in the Prepayment Account to satisfy any of the Obligations.
The Borrower hereby grants to the Agent, for its benefit and the benefit
of the Fronting Bank and the Lenders, a security interest in the
Prepayment Account to secure the Obligations.

SECTION 2.14. Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances. (a)
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of this
Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or
not having the force of law) shall change the basis of taxation of
payments to any Lender or the Fronting Bank of the principal of or
interest on any Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender or any Letter of
Credit reimbursement obligations, Fees or other amounts payable
hereunder (other than changes in respect of income and franchise taxes
imposed on such Lender or the Fronting Bank by the jurisdiction in which
such Lender or the Fronting Bank is organized or has its principal
office or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein), or shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
or for the account of or credit extended by such Lender or the Fronting
Bank (except any such reserve requirement that is reflected in the
Adjusted LIBO Rate or in the Alternate Base Rate) or shall impose on
such Lender or the Fronting Bank or the London interbank market any
other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by
such Lender or any Letter of Credit issued hereunder, and the result of
any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of
making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or increase the cost of
issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Fronting Bank
hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) by an amount
deemed by such Lender or the Fronting Bank to be material, then the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Fronting Bank following receipt
of a certificate of such Lender or the Fronting Bank to such effect in
accordance with Section 2.14(c) such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate such Lender or the Fronting Bank on an after-tax basis
for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b) If any Lender or the Fronting Bank shall have determined that
the adoption after the date hereof of any law, rule, regulation,
agreement or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any
of the foregoing or in the interpretation or administration of any of
the foregoing by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Lender (or any lending office of such Lender) or the
Fronting Bank or any Lender's or the Fronting Bank's holding company
with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy issued under
any law, rule, regulation or guideline (whether or not having the force
of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or
the Fronting Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the
Fronting Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this
Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender or the Letters of Credit
issued by the Fronting Bank pursuant hereto to a level below that which
such Lender or the Fronting Bank or such Lender's or the Fronting Bank's
holding company could have achieved but for such applicability,
adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's
or the Fronting Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the
Fronting Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an
amount deemed by such Lender or the Fronting Bank to be material, then
from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or the Fronting
Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or
the Fronting Bank or such Lender's or the Fronting Bank's holding
company on an after-tax basis for any such reduction suffered. 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this paragraph (b), no Lender or
the Fronting Bank shall be entitled to demand compensation pursuant to
this paragraph (b) if it shall not be the general practice of such
Lender or the Fronting Bank, as applicable, to demand such compensation
in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other comparable
credit agreements.

(c) A certificate of each Lender or the Fronting Bank setting
forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such
Lender or the Fronting Bank or its holding company as specified in
paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, and setting forth in
reasonable detail an explanation of the basis of requesting such
compensation in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) above, including
calculations in reasonable detail, shall be delivered to the Borrower
and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
each Lender or the Fronting Bank the amount shown as due on any such
certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the
same.

(d) Failure on the part of any Lender or the Fronting Bank to
demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts
received or receivable or reduction in return on capital with respect to
any period shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the
Fronting Bank's right to demand compensation with respect to such period
or any other period, except that no Lender or the Fronting Bank shall be
entitled to compensation under this Section 2.14 for any costs incurred
or reduction suffered with respect to any date unless such Lender or the
Fronting Bank, as applicable, shall have notified the Borrower that it
will demand compensation for such costs or reductions under paragraph
(c) above, not more than six months after the later of (i) such date and
(ii) the date on which such Lender or the Fronting Bank, as applicable,
shall have become aware of such costs or reductions. The protection of
this Section 2.14 shall be available to each Lender or the Fronting Bank
regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or
inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other change
or condition that shall have occurred or been imposed.

(e) Each Lender and the Fronting Bank will, at the request of the
Borrower, designate a different lending office if such designation
(i) will avoid the need for, or minimize the amount of, any compensation
to which such Lender or the Fronting Bank is entitled pursuant to this
Section 2.14 and (ii) will not, in the sole judgment of such Lender or
the Fronting Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender or the
Fronting Bank, as the case may be.

SECTION 2.15. Change in Legality. (a) Notwithstanding any other
provision herein, if any change in any law or regulation or in the
interpretation thereof by any governmental authority charged with the
administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful for any
Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its
obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan,
then, by written notice to the Borrower and to the Agent, such Lender
may:

(i) declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be
made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request by the
Borrower for a Eurodollar Borrowing shall, as to such Lender only,
be deemed a request for an ABR Loan unless such declaration shall
be subsequently withdrawn; and

(ii) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by
it be converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar
Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the
effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii)
above, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise
have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been
made by such Lender or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender
shall instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in
lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.

(b) For purposes of this Section 2.15, a notice to the Borrower by
any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan, if lawful, on
the last day of the Interest Period currently applicable to such
Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on
the date of receipt by the Borrower.

SECTION 2.16. Indemnity. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender
against any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) any failure by the Borrower to fulfill on the date of
any borrowing hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in
Article V, (b) any failure by the Borrower to borrow or to refinance,
convert or continue any Loan hereunder after irrevocable notice of such
borrowing, refinancing, conversion or continuation has been given
pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.10, (c) any payment, prepayment or
conversion of a Eurodollar Loan required by any other provision of this
Agreement or otherwise made or deemed made on a date other than the last
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) any default in
payment or prepayment of the principal amount of any Loan or any part
thereof or interest accrued thereon, as and when due and payable (at the
due date thereof, whether by scheduled maturity, acceleration,
irrevocable notice of prepayment or otherwise) or (e) the occurrence of
any Event of Default, including, in each such case, any loss or
reasonable expense sustained or incurred or to be sustained or incurred
in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties acquired to
effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof as a Eurodollar Loan.
Such loss or reasonable expense shall include an amount equal to the
excess, if any, as reasonably determined by such Lender of (a) its cost
of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, converted or
not borrowed, converted or continued (assumed to be the Adjusted LIBO
Rate applicable thereto) for the period from and including the date of
such payment, prepayment, conversion or failure to borrow, convert or
continue to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period for such
Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the
Interest Period for such Loan that would have commenced on the date of
such failure) over (b) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined
by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the
funds so paid, prepaid, converted or not borrowed, converted or
continued for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be. A
certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such
Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall be
delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.17. Pro Rata Treatment. Except as required under Section
2.15, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any
Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of the
Commitment Fees, each payment of the LC Fees, each reduction of the Term
Loan Commitments or the Revolving Credit Commitments and each
refinancing of any Borrowing with, conversion of any Borrowing to or
continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type shall be
allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
applicable Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or
been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of
their applicable outstanding Loans). Each Lender agrees that in
computing such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder,
the Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender's percentage of such
Borrowing, computed in accordance with Section 2.01, to the next higher
or lower whole dollar amount.

SECTION 2.18. Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender agrees that if it
shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or
counterclaim against the Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under
Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or
interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by
such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
law or otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or
involuntary) in respect of any Loan or Loans or LC Exposure as a result
of which the unpaid principal portion of its Loans or its LC Exposure
shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the
Loans of any other Lender or any other Lender's LC Exposure, such Lender
shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender
at face value, and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase
price for, a participation in the Loans of such other Lender or the
LC Exposure of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of the Loans, LC Exposures and participation in Loans and LC
Exposures held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and LC Exposures then
outstanding as the principal amount of such Lender's Loans and LC
Exposures prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or
counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all Loans and
LC Exposures outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff
or counterclaim or other event; provided, however, that, if any such
purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this
Section 2.18 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be
recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded
to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or
adjustment restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to
the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a
participation in a Loan or LC Exposure deemed to have been so purchased
may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim
with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender
by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to
the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.19. Payments. (a) Except as provided in Section 2.05(d),
the Agent shall have received evidence that the Borrower has made each
payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees
or other amounts) hereunder and under any other Loan Document not later
than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due in dollars to
the Agent (for the account of the Agent, the Fronting Bank or the
Lenders, as the case may be), at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, in immediately available funds. The Agent shall promptly
remit in dollars to the Agent, the Fronting Bank or the Lenders, as the
case may be, its share of such payments received by the Agent.

(b) Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on
any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other
Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that
is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included
in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.

SECTION 2.20. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower
hereunder shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.19, free and clear
of and without deduction for any and all current or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, excluding taxes imposed on the net
income of the Agent, the Fronting Bank or any Lender (or any transferee
or assignee thereof, including a participation holder (any such entity
being called a Transferee )) and franchise taxes imposed on the Agent,
the Fronting Bank or any Lender (or Transferee), in each case by the
United States or any jurisdiction under the laws of which the Agent, the
Fronting Bank or any such Lender (or Transferee) is organized or has its
principal office or lending office or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being
hereinafter referred to as Taxes ). If any Taxes are required to be
deducted from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender
(or any Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank, (i) the sum payable
shall be increased by the amount necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section 2.20) such Lender (or Transferee), the Agent
or the Fronting Bank (as the case may be) shall receive an amount equal
to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or
other Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law;
provided, however, that no Transferee of any Lender shall be entitled to
receive any greater payment under this paragraph (a) than such Lender
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights assigned,
participated or otherwise transferred unless (x) such assignment,
participation or transfer shall have been made at a time when the
circumstances (including a Change of Law as defined in Section 2.20(f))
giving rise to such greater payment did not exist or had not yet
occurred or (y) such assignment, participation or transfer shall have
been at the request of the Borrower.

(b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any current or future
stamp, intangible or documentary taxes or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies (including, without limitation,
mortgage recording taxes and similar fees) that arise from any payment
made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or
otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document
(hereinafter referred to as Other Taxes ).

(c) The Borrower will indemnify each Lender (or Transferee), the
Agent and the Fronting Bank for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes
(including any Taxes or Other Taxes on amounts payable under this
Section 2.20) paid by such Lender (or Transferee), the Agent or the
Fronting Bank, as the case may be, and any liability (including
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally asserted by the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental
Authority; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not indemnify any
Lender (or Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank for Taxes,
penalties, additions to tax, interest and expenses arising as a result
of its own wilful misconduct or gross negligence. Such indemnification
shall be made within 30 days after the date any Lender (or Transferee),
the Agent or the Fronting Bank, as the case may be, makes written demand
therefor and provides the Borrower with either a copy of any assessment
thereof from the relevant taxing authority (deleting any confidential
information contained therein) or proof of payment of a tax for which
the Borrower is liable hereunder. If a Lender (or Transferee), the
Agent or the Fronting Bank shall become aware that it is entitled to
receive a refund (including interest and penalties, if any) in respect
of Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.20, it shall promptly notify the
Borrower of the availability of such refund (including interest and
penalties, if any) and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request
by the Borrower, apply for such refund at the Borrower's expense. If a
Lender (or Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank shall become
aware that it is entitled to receive a refund (including interest and
penalties, if any) in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it
has been indemnified by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.20, it
shall promptly notify the Borrower of the availability of such refund
(including interest and penalties, if any) and shall, within 30 days
after receipt of a request by the Borrower, apply for such refund at
the Borrower's expense. If any Lender (or Transferee), the Agent or the
Fronting Bank receives a refund (including interest and penalties, if
any) in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.20, it shall
promptly notify the Borrower of such refund and shall, within 15 days of
receipt, repay such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of
amounts that have been paid by the Borrower under this Section 2.20 with
respect to such refund and not reimbursed), net of all out-of-pocket
expenses of such Lender, the Agent or the Fronting Bank and without any
interest (other than the interest, if any, included in such refund);
provided, however, that the Borrower, upon the request of such Lender
(or Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank, agrees to return such
refund (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender (or
Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank in the event such Lender (or
Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank is required to repay such
refund. The Borrower shall return such refund within 30 days after such
Lender (or Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank provides the
Borrower with a copy of any notice or assessment from the relevant
taxing authority (deleting any confidential information contained
therein) requiring repayment of such refund. Nothing contained in this
paragraph (c) shall require any Lender (or Transferee), the Agent or the
Fronting Bank to make available any of its tax returns (or any other
information relating to its taxes that it deems to be confidential).

(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes or Other
Taxes withheld by the Borrower in respect of any payment to any Lender
(or Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank, the Borrower will
furnish to the Agent, such Lender (or Transferee) or the Fronting Bank,
at its respective address referred to in Section 10.01, the original or
a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to such Lender (or
Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank, as the case may be.

(e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
contained herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this
Section 2.20 shall survive the payment in full of the principal of and
interest on all Loans made hereunder until the expiration of the
relevant statute of limitations.

(f) Each of the Agent, the Fronting Bank and any Lender (or
Transferee) that is not incorporated or otherwise formed under the laws
of the United States of America or a state thereof (a Non-U.S. Person )
agrees that, within one month after the Closing Date or, if later, the
date it becomes a Lender (or Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank
hereunder, it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent one
duly completed copy of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001
or 4224, or, in the case of any Lender (or Transferee) exempt from
United States Federal withholding tax pursuant to Sections 871(h) or
881(c) of the Code, Form W-8, or any successor applicable form (a Form
1001, 4224 or W-8 ), as the case may be, certifying in each case that
such Lender (or Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank is entitled
to receive payments hereunder payable to it without deduction or
withholding of any United States Federal income taxes, or subject to a
reduced rate thereof. Each of the Agent, the Fronting Bank or any
Lender (or Transferee) that delivers to the Borrower and the Agent a
Form 1001, 4224 or W-8 pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
further undertakes to deliver to the Borrower and the Agent further
copies of such Form 1001, 4224 or W-8, as the case may be, or other
manner of certification reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower on or
before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes
obsolete or of the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the
most recent form or certification previously delivered by it to the
Borrower or the Agent, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may
reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Agent, certifying that
such Agent, Fronting Bank or Lender (or Transferee), as the case may be,
is entitled to receive payments hereunder without deduction or
withholding of any United States Federal income taxes, or subject to a
reduced rate thereof. If at any time there has occurred, on or prior to
the date on which any delivery of such Form 1001, 4224 or W-8, as the
case may be, would otherwise be required, any change in law, rule,
regulation, treaty, convention or directive, or any change in the
interpretation or application of any thereof ( Change of Law ), that
renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Agent,
Fronting Bank or Lender (or Transferee), as the case may be, from duly
completing and delivering any such form or certification with respect to
it, such Agent, Fronting Bank or Lender (or Transferee), as the case may
be, shall advise the Borrower that it shall be subject to withholding of
United States Federal income tax at the full statutory rate. A Non-U.S.
Person shall be required to furnish a Form 1001, 4224 or W-8 only if it
is entitled to claim an exemption from or reduced rate of withholding. 
Each of the Agent, the Fronting Bank and any Lender that is a Non-U.S.
Person and that is a party hereto as of the Closing Date hereby
represents and warrants that, as of the Closing Date, payments made to
it hereunder are exempt from the withholding of United States Federal
income taxes (i) because such payments are effectively connected with a
United States trade or business conducted by such Non-U.S Person;
(ii) pursuant to the terms of an income tax treaty between the United
States and such Non-U.S. Person's country of residence; or (iii) because
such payments are portfolio interest exempt pursuant to Sections 871(h)
or 881(c) of the Code. Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (a)
above to the contrary, the Borrower shall not have any obligation to pay
any Taxes or Other Taxes or to indemnify any Lender (or Transferee), the
Agent or the Fronting Bank for such Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to
this Section 2.20 to the extent that such Taxes or Other Taxes result
from (i) the failure of any Lender (or Transferee), the Agent, or the
Fronting Bank to comply with its obligations pursuant to this paragraph
(f) or (ii) any representation made on Form 1001, 4224 or W-8 or
successor applicable form or certification by any Lender (or
Transferee), the Agent or the Fronting Bank incurring such Taxes or
Other Taxes proving to have been incorrect, false or misleading in any
material respect when so made or deemed to be made.

(g) Any of the Agent, the Fronting Bank or any Lender (or
Transferee) claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 2.20 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and
regulatory restrictions) (including reasonable efforts to change the
jurisdiction of its applicable lending office) to avoid the need for or
reduce the amount of any such additional amounts that may thereafter
accrue, provided that such efforts would not, in the sole determination
of such Lender (or Transferee), Agent or Fronting Bank, as the case may
be, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee), the
Agent or the Fronting Bank.

(h) In the event any Lender (or Transferee) changes its applicable
lending office as provided in Section 2.14(e), such Lender (or
Transferee) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
this Section 2.20 than such Lender (or Transferee) would have been
entitled to receive had such change not occurred, unless (i) such
greater payment rises as a result of a Change in Law occurring after the
date of such change in applicable lending office or (ii) such change in
applicable lending office shall have been made at the request of the
Borrower.

SECTION 2.21. Assignment of Commitments under Certain
Circumstances. In the event that (a) any Lender (i) shall have
delivered a notice or certificate pursuant to Section 2.14, (ii) shall
become subject to the provisions of Section 2.15 or (iii) shall fail or
refuse to fund its portion of any Loan for any reason other than the
failure of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to the
making of such Loan hereunder, (b) the Borrower shall be required to
make additional payments to any Lender under Section 2.20 or (c) any
Lender shall fail or refuse, for any reason, to approve any amendment,
waiver or consent hereunder that has been approved by Lenders holding
more than 85% of the aggregate principal amount of (i) the Loans at such
time, (ii) the LC Exposure at such time and (iii) the aggregate unused
Commitments at such time, the Borrower shall have the right, but not the
obligation, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the
Agent, to replace such Lender with an assignee (in accordance with and
subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04(b)), and such
Lender hereby agrees to transfer and assign to such assignee without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in Section 10.04(b)) all its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement; provided, however, that (A) no such assignment shall
conflict with any law or any rule, regulation or order of any
Governmental Authority, (B) such assignee shall pay to the affected
Lender in immediately available funds on the date of such assignment the
principal of the Loans made by such Lender hereunder, (C) in the case of
an assignment pursuant to clause (c) above, the Borrower must exercise
its right to replace such Lender within 90 days of such Lender's failure
to approve the applicable amendment, waiver or consent, as applicable,
and (D) the Borrower shall pay to the affected Lender in immediately
available funds on the date of such assignment the interest accrued to
the date of payment on the Loans made by such Lender hereunder and all
other amounts accrued for such Lender's account or owed to it hereunder.

ARTICLE III

Letters of Credit
SECTION 3.01. Issuance of Letters of Credit. (a) The Fronting Bank
agrees, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set
forth, to issue Letters of Credit, in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Agent and the Fronting Bank, appropriately completed, for the
account of the Borrower, at any time and from time to time on and after
the Closing Date until the earlier of the LC Maturity Date and the
termination of the LC Commitment in accordance with the terms hereof;
provided, however, that any Letter of Credit shall be issued by the
Fronting Bank only if, and each request by the Borrower for the issuance
of any Letter of Credit shall be deemed a representation and warranty of
the Borrower that, immediately following the issuance of any such Letter
of Credit, (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the LC Commitment in
effect at such time and (ii) the Revolving Credit Utilization at such
time shall not exceed the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments at such
time.

(b) Each Letter of Credit shall expire at the close of business on
the LC Maturity Date, unless such Letter of Credit expires by its terms
on an earlier date. Each Letter of Credit shall provide for payments of
drawings in dollars. 

(c) Each issuance of any Letter of Credit shall be made on at
least two Business Days' prior written or facsimile notice from the
Borrower to the Fronting Bank and the Agent (which shall give prompt
notice thereof to each Participating Lender) specifying the date of
issuance, the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which
shall not be later than the earlier of (i) the LC Maturity Date and
(ii) subject to extension, 360 days, in the case of Standby Letters of
Credit, and 180 days, in the case of Commercial Letters of Credit, after
the date of any such Letter of Credit), the amount of such Letter of
Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit
and such other information as may be necessary or desirable to complete
such Letter of Credit. The Fronting Bank will give the Agent and the
Agent will give to each Participating Lender reasonably prompt notice of
the issuance and amount of each Letter of Credit and the expiration of
each Letter of Credit.

SECTION 3.02. Participation; Unconditional Obligations. (a) By the
issuance of a Letter of Credit and without any further action on the
part of the Fronting Bank or the Participating Lenders in respect
thereof, the Fronting Bank hereby grants to each Participating Lender,
and each Participating Lender hereby agrees to acquire from the Fronting
Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such
Participating Lender's Applicable Percentage of the face amount of such
Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit.
In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Participating
Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent,
on behalf of the Fronting Bank, in accordance with Section 2.02(f), such
Participating Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement
made by the Fronting Bank; provided, however, that the Participating
Lenders shall not be obligated to make any such payment to the Fronting
Bank with respect to any wrongful payment or disbursement made under any
Outstanding Letter of Credit as a result of the gross negligence or
wilful misconduct of the Fronting Bank.

(b) Each Participating Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to acquire participations pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
Section 3.02 in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default or
Default hereunder, and that each such payment shall be made without any
offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

SECTION 3.03. LC Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for
the account of the Participating Lenders for each calendar quarter (or
shorter period commencing with the date hereof or ending with the first
date on which the LC Commitment shall have expired or been terminated
and there shall be no Outstanding Letters of Credit) fees (the LC
Fees ) equal to 2 1/2% per annum on the average daily aggregate face
amount of the Outstanding Letters of Credit. The LC Fees shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year
of 360 days. The LC Fees shall be paid in arrears on the last day of
January, April, July and October of each year and on the LC Maturity
Date (or, if earlier, the first date on which the LC Commitment shall
have expired or been terminated and there shall be no Outstanding
Letters of Credit), commencing on the first such date following the
Closing Date. Once paid, the LC Fees shall not be refundable in any
circumstances (other than corrections of error in payment).

SECTION 3.04. Agreement To Repay LC Disbursements. (a) If the
Fronting Bank shall pay any draft presented under a Letter of Credit,
the Borrower shall pay to the Agent, on behalf of the Fronting Bank, an
amount equal to the amount of such draft before 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, on the Business Day on which the Fronting Bank shall have
notified the Borrower that payment of such draft will be made (or such
later time as is not later than one hour after the Borrower shall have
received such notice or, if the Borrower shall have received such notice
later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on any Business Day, not later
than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following
Business Day). The Agent will promptly pay any such amounts received by
it to the Fronting Bank. In the event that, after the payment of any
such amount to the Fronting Bank, the Fronting Bank shall not pay such
amount in respect of such draft, the Fronting Bank shall return to the
Agent, for the account of the Borrower, any such unpaid amount, together
with interest thereon accrued at the Federal Funds Effective Rate then
in effect from and including the date such amount was paid by the
Borrower to the Agent to but excluding the date such amount was repaid
by the Fronting Bank to the Agent.

(b) The Borrower's obligation to repay the Fronting Bank for LC
Disbursements made by the Fronting Bank under the Outstanding Letters of
Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable under any and
all circumstances and irrespective of, without limitation, the
following:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit;

(ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other
right that the Borrower or any other Person may at any time have
against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the Fronting
Bank, the Agent or any other Lender or any other Person (other
than the defense of payment in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or a defense based on the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the Fronting Bank) in connection with this
Agreement or any other agreement or transaction;

(iii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter
of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue
or inaccurate in any respect, provided that payment by the
Fronting Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of
such draft or document shall not have constituted gross negligence
or wilful misconduct of the Fronting Bank;

(iv) payment by the Fronting Bank under a Letter of Credit
against presentation of a draft or other document that does not
comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, provided that such
payment shall not have constituted gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the Fronting Bank; and

(v) any other circumstance or event whatsoever, whether or
not similar to any of the foregoing, provided that such
circumstance shall not have been the result of the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Fronting Bank.

It is understood that in making any payment under a Letter of
Credit (A) the Fronting Bank's exclusive reliance on the documents
presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters
set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft
presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to
the beneficiary equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any
document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be
insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be
in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document
presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or
invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in
any respect whatsoever, and (B) any noncompliance in any immaterial
respect of the documents presented under a Letter of Credit with the
terms thereof shall, in each case, not be deemed wilful misconduct or
gross negligence of the Fronting Bank.

SECTION 3.05. Letter of Credit Operations. The Fronting Bank
shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents
purporting to represent a demand for payment under an Outstanding Letter
of Credit to ascertain that the same appear on their face to be in
conformity with the terms and conditions of such Outstanding Letter of
Credit. The Fronting Bank shall as promptly as possible, but in no event
later than two hours after such demand for payment, give oral
notification, confirmed by facsimile notice, to the Agent and the
Borrower of such demand for payment and shall as promptly as possible,
but in no event later than two hours prior to any payment in respect of
such demand, give oral notification, confirmed by facsimile notice, to
the Agent and the Borrower of the determination by the Fronting Bank as
to whether such demand for payment was in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such Outstanding Letter of Credit and whether the Fronting
Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder, provided that
the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse the Fronting Bank with respect to any such LC
Disbursement, and the Agent shall promptly give each Participating
Lender notice thereof.

SECTION 3.06. Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default
shall occur and be continuing, the Borrower shall on the Business Day it
receives notice from the Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the
maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Participating Lenders
holding participation in Outstanding Letters of Credit representing at
least 51% of the aggregate undrawn amount of all Outstanding Letters of
Credit) therefor, deposit in an account with the Collateral Agent, for
the benefit of the Participating Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the
LC Exposure as of such date. Such deposit shall be held by the
Collateral Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the
Obligations. The Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.
Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits in
Permitted Investments, which investments shall be made at the option and
sole discretion of the Collateral Agent, such deposits shall not bear
interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall
accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall
(a) automatically be applied by the Agent to reimburse the Fronting Bank
for LC Disbursements, (b) be held for the satisfaction of the
reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the then-outstanding
LC Exposure and (c) if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated
(but subject to the consent of Participating Lenders holding
participation in Outstanding Letters of Credit representing at least 51%
of the aggregate undrawn amount of all Outstanding Letters of Credit),
such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be applied to
satisfy the Obligations. Any cash collateral provided by the Borrower
hereunder (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to
the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have
been cured or waived.

SECTION 3.07. Termination of LC Commitment. The Borrower may
permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce,
the LC Commitment, in each case upon at least three Business Days' prior
written or facsimile notice to the Agent and the Fronting Bank, provided
that (a) after giving effect to such termination or reduction, the LC
Commitment shall not be less than the LC Exposure at such time or
greater than the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments at such time and
(b) no reduction of the LC Commitment shall have the effect of reducing
the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Lender. 

SECTION 3.08. Fronting Bank Fees. (a) The Borrower shall pay to
the Fronting Bank, for its own account, such commissions, issuance fees,
transfer fees and other fees and charges in connection with the issuance
or administration of each Letter of Credit as the Borrower and the
Fronting Bank shall agree.

(b) The Borrower shall pay to the Fronting Bank, for its own
account, a fronting fee on the average daily aggregate maximum amount
available to be drawn (assuming compliance with all conditions to
drawing) under all Outstanding Letters of Credit at the rate of 1/4 of
1% per annum, payable in arrears on the last day of January, April, July
and October of each year, commencing July 31, 1994, and on the LC
Maturity Date.

SECTION 3.09. Resignation or Removal of Fronting Bank. (a) The
Fronting Bank may, subject to the appointment of a successor Fronting
Bank hereunder, resign at any time by giving at least 180 days' prior
written notice to the Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower, and may be
removed at any time by the Borrower by notice to the Fronting Bank, the
Agent and the Lenders. The Borrower shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to appoint a successor Fronting Bank within 180 days after
receipt from the Fronting Bank of a notice of resignation contemplated
by the preceding sentence. Upon any such removal, the Borrower shall
(within 180 days after such notice of removal) either appoint a Lender
(with the consent of such Lender) as successor, or (subject to the
proviso contained in Section 3.07) terminate the unutilized
LC Commitment; provided, however, that, if the Borrower elects to
terminate the unutilized LC Commitment, the Borrower may at any time
thereafter that the Revolving Credit Commitments are in effect reinstate
by notice to the Agent and the Lenders the LC Commitment in connection
with the appointment of a successor Fronting Bank. Subject to
paragraph (b) below, upon the acceptance of any appointment as Fronting
Bank hereunder by a successor Fronting Bank, such successor shall
succeed to and become vested with all the interests, rights and
obligations of the retiring Fronting Bank and the retiring Fronting Bank
shall be discharged from its obligations to issue additional Letters of
Credit hereunder. At the time such removal or resignation shall become
effective, the Borrower shall pay all accrued and unpaid fees pursuant
to Section 2.05(d). The acceptance of any appointment as Fronting Bank
hereunder by a successor issuing bank shall be evidenced by an agreement
entered into by such successor, in a form satisfactory to the Borrower
and the Agent, and, from and after the effective date of such agreement,
(i) such successor shall be a party hereto and have all the rights and
obligations of the Fronting Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to
the Fronting Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any
previous Fronting Bank, or to such successor and all previous Fronting
Banks, as the context shall require.

(b) After the resignation or removal of the Fronting Bank
hereunder, the retiring Fronting Bank shall remain a party hereto and
shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of the Fronting
Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to
Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or removal, but
shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

SECTION 3.10. Existing Letters of Credit. On the Closing Date,
each letter of credit issued pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement
and then remaining outstanding shall be deemed to have been issued
hereunder and to constitute a Letter of Credit for all purposes hereof
and, in furtherance of the foregoing, the Fronting Bank hereby grants to
each Participating Lender, and each Participating Lender hereby agrees
to acquire from the Fronting Bank, a participation in each such letter
of credit equal to such Participating Lender's Applicable Percentage of
the face amount of such letter of credit, effective on the Closing Date. 
The Fronting Bank will give the Agent and the Agent shall give each
Participating Lender the notice contemplated by the last sentence of
Section 3.01(c) with respect to such letters of credit promptly
following the Closing Date. By executing this Agreement, the Fronting
Bank agrees that on the Closing Date the lenders under the Existing
Credit Agreement that acquired participations in such letters of credit
issued pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement that are deemed to
constitute Letters of Credit hereunder shall be released from all
further obligations and liabilities with respect thereto, other than
liabilities that accrued prior to the Closing Date.

of the date such projections and pro forma financial information were

prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
financial statements referred to in Section 4.05(b).

particular capital requirements of the businesses conducted by such
entities and the projected capital requirements and capital availability
of such businesses), and (c) none of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries

all tenants and subtenants obtain and comply with and maintain, any and
all licenses, approvals, registrations or permits required by

approvals, registrations and permits does not have, and could not
reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Conduct and complete all investigations, studies, sampling and
testing, and all remedial, removal and other actions, required under
Environmental and Safety Laws and promptly comply with all lawful orders
and directives of all Governmental Authorities respecting Environmental

have a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Promptly notify the Agent of any of the following that is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect:

fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses (including
reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements) of whatever kind or
nature arising out of, or in any way relating to, the violation of,
noncompliance with or liability under any Environmental and Safety Laws
applicable to the operations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary on the

Governmental Authorities related thereto, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney's and consultant's fees, reasonable investigation
and laboratory fees, response costs, court costs and litigation
expenses, except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a
final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to

Indemnitee seeking indemnification therefor. This indemnity shall
continue in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

The Agent

In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Chemical Bank is hereby appointed to act as Agent (which term
for purposes of this Article shall be deemed to refer to the Agent and
the Collateral Agent) on behalf of the Fronting Bank and the Lenders.
Each of the Lenders, and each subsequent holder of any Loan by its
acceptance thereof and the Fronting Bank hereby irrevocably authorize
the Agent to take such actions on their behalf and to exercise such
powers as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms and
provisions hereof and of the other Loan Documents, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent is
hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders and the Fronting Bank,
without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf
of the Lenders and the Fronting Bank all payments of principal of and
interest on the Loans and LC Disbursements and all other amounts due to
the Lenders and the Fronting Bank hereunder, and promptly to distribute
to each Lender and the Fronting Bank its proper share of each payment so
received; (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders and the
Fronting Bank to the Borrower of any Event of Default specified in this
Agreement of which the Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection
with its agency hereunder; and (c) to promptly distribute to each Lender
and the Fronting Bank copies of all notices, financial statements and
other materials delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement as
received by the Agent (including notices of an occurrence of any Event
of Default). Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to
relieve the Borrower of its obligation to furnish any notice, financial
statement or other materials directly to the Lenders as required
hereunder.

Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or
agents shall be liable as such for any action taken or omitted by any of
them except for its, his or her own gross negligence or wilful
misconduct, or be responsible for any statement, warranty or
representation herein or the contents of any document delivered in
connection herewith, or be required to ascertain or to make any inquiry
concerning the performance or observance by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary Guarantor of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or
agreements contained in any Loan Document. The Agent shall not be
responsible to the Lenders or the holders of the Loans or the Fronting
Bank for the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or
effectiveness of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or other
instruments or agreements. The Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in accordance with
written instructions signed by the Required Lenders and, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, such instructions and any action
or inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Lenders and
each subsequent holder of any Loan and the Fronting Bank. The Agent
shall, in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely
on any instrument or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or
Persons. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees
or agents shall have any responsibility to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary on account of the failure of or delay in performance or
breach by any Lender or the Fronting Bank of any of its obligations
hereunder or to any Lender or to the Fronting Bank on account of the
failure of or delay in performance or breach by any other Lender or the
Fronting Bank or the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor of any of
their respective obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document
or in connection herewith or therewith. The Agent may execute any and
all duties hereunder by or through agents or employees and shall be
entitled to rely upon the advice of legal counsel selected by it with
respect to all matters arising hereunder and shall not be liable for any
action taken or suffered in good faith by it in accordance with the
advice of such counsel.

The Lenders and the Fronting Bank hereby acknowledge that the
Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted
to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement unless it
shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders.

Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as
provided below, the Agent may resign at any time by notifying the
Lenders, the Fronting Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation,
the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor. If no
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall
have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf
of the Lenders and the Fronting Bank, appoint a successor Agent, which
shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or an Affiliate of any such
bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a
successor bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent and
the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. After the Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of
this Article and Sections 6.11(d) and 10.05 shall continue in effect for
its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was acting as Agent.

With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder, the Agent, in its
individual capacity and not as Agent, shall have the same rights and
powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were
not the Agent, and the Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits
from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with
the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof as if the Agent
were not the Agent.

Each Lender and the Fronting Bank recognizes that applicable laws,
rules, regulations or guidelines of Governmental Authorities may require
the Agent to determine whether the transactions contemplated hereby
should be classified as highly leveraged or assigned any similar or
successor classification and that such determination may be binding upon
the other Lenders and the Fronting Bank. Each Lender and the Fronting
Bank understands that any such determination shall be made solely by the
Agent based upon such factors (which may include, without limitation,
the Agent's internal policies and prevailing market practices) as the
Agent shall deem relevant and agrees that the Agent shall have no
liability for the consequences of any such determination.

Each Lender and the Fronting Bank agree (a) to reimburse the
Agent, on demand, in the amount of its pro rata share (based on its
Commitment hereunder) of any expenses incurred for the benefit of the
Lenders and the Fronting Bank by the Agent, including counsel fees and
compensation of agents and employees paid for services rendered on
behalf of the Lenders and the Fronting Bank, that shall not have been
reimbursed by the Borrower and (b) to indemnify and hold harmless the
Agent and any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, on
demand, in the amount of such pro rata share, from and against any and
all liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind
or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against it in its capacity as the Agent or any of them in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or any action taken or omitted by it or any of them under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, to the extent the same shall not have been
reimbursed by the Borrower; provided that no Lender shall be liable to
the Agent for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct
of the Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents.

Each Lender and the Fronting Bank acknowledge that they have,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Lender and
the Fronting Bank and based on such documents and information as they
have deemed appropriate, made their own credit analysis and decision to
enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the Fronting Bank also
acknowledge that they will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as
they shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make their
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

of any Lender shall be deemed to be acceptable to the Borrower for
purposes of this clause) if such assignment was required by any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the assigning Lender,
each of the Borrower (the consent of which shall not be unreasonably
withheld), the Agent and, if any such assignment includes all or a
portion of any Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment, the Fronting Bank,
must give its prior written consent to such assignment, (ii) the amount
of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Agent) shall not be less
than $10,000,000 (or, if the amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment
is less than $10,000,000, an amount equal to the amount of such
Commitment), (iii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute
and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which shall be paid by the
Borrower in the case of any assignment pursuant to Section 2.21) and
(iv) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Upon acceptance and recording
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 10.04, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, which
effective date shall be (unless this clause is waived by the Agent) at
least five Business Days after the execution thereof, (i) the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and (ii) the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all
or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but
shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.16,
2.20, 6.11(d) and 10.05, as well as to any Fees accrued for its account
and not yet paid).

(c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed
to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as
follows: (i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and
beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear
of any adverse claim and that its Commitments and LC Commitment, and the
outstanding balances of its Term Loans and Revolving Loans, in each case
without giving effect to assignments thereof that have not become
effective, are as set forth in such Assignment and Acceptance;
(ii) except as set forth in clause (i) above, such assigning Lender
makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
connection with this Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto, or the financial condition of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or the performance or observance by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary Guarantor of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee represents and warrants that it is
legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance;
(iv) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this
Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 6.04 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis
and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (v) such
assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such
assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make
its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under
this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and
(vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their
terms all the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Lender.

(d) The Agent, acting for this purpose as agent of the Borrower,
shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a copy of
each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitments and LC Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans
owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
(the Register ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error and the Borrower, the Agent, the Fronting Bank
and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower, the Fronting Bank and any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(e) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, an Administrative
Questionnaire completed in respect of the assignee (unless the assignee
shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee
referred to in paragraph (b) above and the written consent of the Agent
to such assignment, the Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders and the
Fronting Bank. 

(f) Each Lender may without the consent of the Borrower, the Agent
or the Fronting Bank sell participation to one or more banks or other
entities in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans
owing to it and the Loans held by it); provided, however, that (i) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the participating
banks or other entities shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost
protection provisions contained in Sections 2.14, 2.16 and 2.20 to the
same extent as if they were Lenders, provided that the Borrower shall
not be required to reimburse the participating lenders or other entities
pursuant to Section 2.14, 2.16 or 2.20 in an amount which exceeds the
amount that would have been payable thereunder to such Lender had such
Lender not sold such participation and (iv) the Borrower, the Agent, the
Fronting Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, and such Lender shall retain the sole
right to enforce the obligations of the Borrower relating to the Loans
or LC Disbursements and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement (provided that the participating bank
or other entity may be provided with the right to approve amendments,
modifications or waivers affecting it with respect to (A) any decrease
in the Fees payable hereunder with respect to Loans in which the
participating bank or other entity has purchased a participation,
(B) any change in the amount of principal of, or decrease in the rate at
which interest is payable, on the Loans in which the participating bank
or other entity has purchased a participation, (C) any extension of the
dates fixed for scheduled payments of principal of or interest on the
Loans in which the participating bank or other entity has purchased a
participation or (D) any release of all or substantially all the
Collateral).

(g) Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation
pursuant to this Section 10.04, disclose to the assignee or participant
or proposed assignee or participant any information relating to the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries furnished to such Lender by or on behalf
of the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure of
information designated by the Borrower as confidential, each such
assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall
execute an agreement whereby such assignee or participant shall agree
(subject to customary exceptions) to preserve the confidentiality of
such confidential information.

(h) In the event that Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's
Investors Service, Inc., and Thompson's BankWatch (or InsuranceWatch
Ratings Service, in the case of Lenders that are insurance companies (or
Best's Insurance Reports, if such insurance company is not rated by
InsuranceWatch Ratings Service)) shall, after the date that any Lender
becomes a Lender, downgrade the long-term certificate of deposit ratings
of such Lender, and the resulting ratings shall be below BBB-, Baa3 and
C (or BB, in the case of a Lender that is an insurance company (or B, in
the case of an insurance company not rated by InsuranceWatch Ratings
Service)), then the Fronting Bank shall have the right, but not the
obligation, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the
Agent, to replace (or to request the Borrower to use its reasonable
efforts to replace) such Lender with an assignee (in accordance with and
subject to the restrictions contained in paragraph (b) above), and such
Lender hereby agrees to transfer and assign without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in paragraph
(b) above) all its interests, rights and obligations in respect of its
Revolving Credit Commitment to such assignee; provided, however, that
(i) no such assignment shall conflict with any law, rule and regulation
or order of any Governmental Authority and (ii) the Fronting Bank or
such assignee, as the case may be, shall pay to such Lender in
immediately available funds on the date of such assignment the principal
of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by such
Lender hereunder and all other amounts accrued for such Lender's account
or owed to it hereunder.

(i) Any Lender may at any time assign all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank provided that no
such assignment shall release a Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder. In order to facilitate such an assignment to a Federal
Reserve Bank, the Borrower shall, at the request of the assigning
Lender, promptly execute and deliver to the assigning Lender a note, in
a form reasonably acceptable to such Lender, the Agent and the Borrower,
evidencing the Loans made to the Borrower by the assigning Lender
hereunder.

(j) The Borrower shall not assign or delegate any of its rights or
duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Agent, the
Fronting Bank and each Lender. Except as provided in Section 3.09, the
Fronting Bank may not assign or delegate any of its respective rights
and duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Borrower
and the Agent.

SECTION 10.05. Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay
all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent, the Fronting Bank and
the Collateral Agent in connection with the preparation of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with any
amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof
(whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated shall be
consummated) or incurred by the Agent, the Fronting Bank, the Collateral
Agent or any Lender in connection with the enforcement or protection of
their rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents or in connection with the Loans made or the Letters of Credit
issued hereunder, including the reasonable fees, other charges and
disbursements of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, counsel for the Agent, the
Collateral Agent and the Fronting Bank and of local counsel, and, in
connection with any such enforcement or protection, the reasonable fees,
other charges and disbursements of any other counsel for the Agent, the
Fronting Bank, the Collateral Agent or any Lender. The Borrower further
agrees that it shall indemnify (i) the Agent, the Fronting Bank, the
Collateral Agent and the Lenders from and hold them harmless against any
documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any Governmental
Authority by reason of the execution and delivery and/or recordation of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and (ii) to reimburse
the Agent for any out-of-pocket expenses and charges incurred by it in
connection with its initial and on-going examinations of the Collateral.

(b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent, the Fronting Bank,
the Collateral Agent and each Lender and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and Affiliates (each such Person
being called an Indemnitee ) against, and to hold each Indemnitee
harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, charges and
disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising
out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the execution
or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance
by the parties hereby or thereto of their respective obligations
hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions and the
other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) the use of the
Letters of Credit or the proceeds of the Loans or (iii) any claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the
foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the
extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related
expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or
wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

(c) The provisions of this Section 10.05 shall remain operative
and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of
this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or
unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent,
the Fronting Bank, the Collateral Agent, the Fronting Bank or any
Lender. All amounts due under this Section 10.05 shall be payable on
written demand therefor.

SECTION 10.06. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time
and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time
or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness
at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of
the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now
or hereafter existing under this Agreement and other Loan Documents held
by such Lender, irrespective of whether such Lender shall have made any
demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and although
such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this
Section 10.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including
other rights of setoff) that such Lender may have.

SECTION 10.07. APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE MORTGAGES AND THE
TRADEMARK SECURITY AGREEMENT) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

SECTION 10.08. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay on the
part of the Agent, the Fronting Bank, the Collateral Agent or any Lender
in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or
power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a
right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Agent, the Fronting Bank, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to
any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on the Borrower in
any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or
demand in similar or other circumstances. 

(b) Neither this Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement or any of the
Security Documents nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived,
amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to
an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and
the Required Lenders, or, in the case of the Guarantee Agreement or any
of the Security Documents, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the
Collateral Agent and consented to by the Required Lenders; provided,
however, that no such agreement shall (i) reduce the principal amount
of, or extend the scheduled maturity of, any principal of or interest
on, any Loan, or forgive any such payment or any part thereof, or reduce
the rate of interest on any Loan, without the prior written consent of
each holder of a Loan affected thereby, (ii) increase the Commitment of
any Lender as specified on Schedule 2.01 or reduce the Commitment Fees
of any Lender without the prior written consent of such Lender,
(iii) amend or modify the provisions of Section 2.17, the provisions of
this Section 10.08(b) or the definition of the term Required Lenders 
without the prior written consent of each Lender or (iv) release all or
substantially all of the Collateral under any Security Document other
than as expressly permitted hereunder or under such Security Document
without the prior written consent of each Lender; provided further that
no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or
duties of the Agent or the Fronting Bank hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Agent or the Fronting Bank, as the case may be. 

SECTION 10.09. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the applicable interest rate,
together with all fees and charges that are treated as interest under
applicable law (collectively, the Charges ), as provided for herein or
in any other document executed in connection herewith, or otherwise
contracted for, charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender,
shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate ) that may be
contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by such Lender in
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable under the
Loans held by such Lender, together with all Charges payable to such
Lender, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.

SECTION 10.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and the fee letter referred to in Section 2.05(c) constitute
the entire contract between the parties relative to the subject matter
hereof. Any previous agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof is superseded by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Nothing in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than
the parties hereto and thereto any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents.

SECTION 10.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 10.11.

SECTION 10.12. Severability. In the event any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document
should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations
to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid
provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to
that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

SECTION 10.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all
of which when taken together shall constitute but one contract, and
shall become effective as provided in Section 10.03.

SECTION 10.14. Headings. Article and Section headings and the
Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are
not part of this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or
to be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

SECTION 10.15. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a)
The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State
court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and
each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by
law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

(b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement or the
other Loan Documents in any New York State or Federal court. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

(c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.01. Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

SECTION 10.16. Mortgaged Property Casualty and Condemnation.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the
Security Documents, the Collateral Agent is authorized, at its option
(for the benefit of the Secured Parties), to collect and receive, to the
extent payable to the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor, all
insurance proceeds, damages, claims and rights of action and the right
thereto under any insurance policies with respect to any casualty or
other insured damage ( Casualty ) to any portion of any Mortgaged
Property (collectively, Insurance Proceeds ), unless an Event of
Default shall not have occurred and be continuing. The Borrower agrees
to notify, and to cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to notify, the
Collateral Agent and the Agent, in writing, promptly after the Borrower
or any Subsidiary Guarantor obtains notice or knowledge of any Casualty
to a Mortgaged Property, which notice shall set forth a description of
such Casualty and the Borrower's or such Subsidiary Guarantor's good
faith estimate of the amount of related damages. If the Borrower or any
Subsidiary Guarantor shall receive any Insurance Proceeds, the Borrower
agrees, subject to the foregoing limitations, to endorse and transfer,
and to cause any Subsidiary Guarantor to endorse and transfer, any
Insurance Proceeds it receives to the Collateral Agent.

(b) The Borrower will notify, and cause each Subsidiary Guarantor
to notify, the Collateral Agent and the Agent immediately upon obtaining
knowledge of the institution of any action or proceeding for the taking
of any Mortgaged Property, or any part thereof or interest therein, for
public or quasi-public use under the power of eminent domain, by reason
of any public improvement or condemnation proceeding, or in any other
manner (a Condemnation ). No settlement or compromise of any claim in
connection with any such action or proceeding shall be made without the
consent of the Collateral Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Collateral Agent is authorized, at its option (for the
benefit of the Secured Parties), to collect and receive all proceeds of
any such Condemnation (in each case, the Condemnation Proceeds ). The
Borrower agrees to execute, and to cause any Subsidiary Guarantor to
execute, such further assignments of any Condemnation Proceeds as the
Collateral Agent may reasonably require.

(c) In the event of a Condemnation of all or substantially all 
of any Mortgaged Property (which determination shall be made by the
Collateral Agent in its reasonable discretion), unless the Borrower
shall have notified the Collateral Agent in writing promptly after such
Condemnation that it or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor intends to
replace the related Mortgaged Property (and no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such
election), the Collateral Agent may deem such event to be a Prepayment
Event, and shall apply the Condemnation Proceeds received as a result of
such Condemnation (less the reasonable costs, if any, incurred by the
Collateral Agent or the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor in the
recovery of such Condemnation Proceeds, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, other charges and disbursements (the Collateral Agent having
agreed to reimburse the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor from such
Condemnation Proceeds for such costs incurred by the Borrower or such
Subsidiary Guarantor)) to prepay obligations outstanding under this
Agreement to the extent required under Section 2.13(c), with any
remaining Condemnation Proceeds being returned to the Borrower or such
Subsidiary Guarantor. If the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary
Guarantor shall elect to replace a Mortgaged Property as contemplated
above, (i) the replacement property shall be of utility comparable to
that of the replaced Mortgaged Property and (ii) the insufficiency of
any Condemnation Proceeds to defray the entire expense of the related
location, acquisition and replacement of such replacement property shall
in no way relieve the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor of its
obligation to complete the construction of any replacement property if
the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall have made such election
and shall have acquired the related real property.

(d) In the event of any Condemnation of the Mortgaged Property, or
any part thereof (other than a Condemnation described in paragraph (c)
above (unless such Condemnation shall not be deemed to be a Prepayment
Event or the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor shall be
permitted and shall have elected to replace the related Mortgaged
Property, in each case, as provided in paragraph (c) above) and subject
to the provisions of paragraph (f) below, the Collateral Agent shall
apply the Condemnation Proceeds, first, in the case of a partial
Condemnation, to the repair or restoration of any integrated structure
subject to such Condemnation or, in the case of a total or
substantially all Condemnation, to the location of a replacement
property, acquisition of such replacement property and construction of
the replacement structures, in each case, under the conditions specified
in paragraph (f) below, and, second, shall apply the remainder of such
Condemnation Proceeds (less the reasonable costs, if any, incurred by
the Collateral Agent or the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary
Guarantor in the recovery of such Condemnation Proceeds, including
reasonable attorneys' fees (the Collateral Agent having agreed to
reimburse the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor from such
Condemnation Proceeds for such costs incurred by the Borrower or such
Subsidiary Guarantor)) to prepay obligations outstanding under this
Agreement to the extent required under Section 2.13(c), with any
remaining Condemnation Proceeds being returned to the Borrower or such
Subsidiary Guarantor.

(e) In the event of any Casualty of less than 50% of the useable
square footage of the improvements of any Mortgaged Property, the
Borrower shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary Guarantor to, subject to
the conditions contained in clause (f), restore the Mortgaged Property
to substantially its same condition immediately prior to such Casualty.
In the event of any Casualty of greater than 50% of the useable square
footage of the improvements of any Mortgaged Property and so long as no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower
shall have the option to either:

(i) restore (or cause the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor to
restore) the Mortgaged Property to a condition substantially
similar to its condition immediately prior to such Casualty and to
invest the balance, if any, of any Insurance Proceeds, in
equipment, vehicles or other assets used in the Borrower's or such
Subsidiary Guarantor's principal lines of business within 180 days
after the receipt thereof, provided that the Borrower or such
Subsidiary Guarantor, pending such reinvestment, promptly deposits
such excess Insurance Proceeds in a cash collateral account
established with the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Secured Parties; 

(ii) replace (or cause the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor
to replace) the Mortgaged Property with property of utility
comparable to that of the replaced Mortgage Property and to invest
the balance, if any, of any Insurance Proceeds, in equipment,
vehicles or other assets used in the Borrower's or such Subsidiary
Guarantor's principal lines of business within 180 days after the
receipt thereof, provided that the Borrower or such Subsidiary
Guarantor, pending such reinvestment, promptly deposits such
excess Insurance Proceeds in a cash collateral account established
with the collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties;
or

(iii) direct (or cause the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor
to direct) the Collateral Agent to apply the related Insurance
Proceeds to prepay obligations outstanding under this Agreement to
the extent required under Section 2.13(c), with any remaining
Insurance Proceeds being returned to the Borrower or such
Subsidiary Guarantor.

It is understood that any excess Insurance Proceeds that are not
reinvested in the Borrower's or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor's
principal lines of business as contemplated above will be applied to
prepay obligations outstanding under this Agreement to the extent
required under Section 2.13(c).

If required to do so, the Borrower shall make, or cause the
applicable Subsidiary Guarantor to make, the election contemplated by
the immediately preceding paragraph by notifying the Collateral Agent
and the Agent promptly after the later to occur of (A) five days after
the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor and their respective insurance
carriers reach a final determination of the amount of any Insurance
Proceeds and (B) 30 days after the occurrence of the Casualty. If the
Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be required or shall elect
to restore or replace the Mortgaged Property, the insufficiency of any
Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to defray the entire expense
of such restoration or replacement shall in no way relieve the Borrower
or such Subsidiary Guarantor of such obligation to so restore or so
replace if it is so required or once such election has been made. In the
event the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be required to
restore or replace or shall notify the Collateral Agent and the Agent of
its election to restore or replace, the Borrower shall diligently and
continuously prosecute, or cause such Subsidiary Guarantor to so
prosecute, the restoration or replacement of the Mortgaged Property to
completion. In the circumstance where the Borrower or such Subsidiary
Guarantor shall be required to restore or replace or shall so elect to
restore or replace and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not be
required to comply with the requirements of paragraph (f) below in
connection with such restoration or replacement (except as required by
clause (f)(ii)(A) and (B)), so long as the cost of such restoration or
replacement shall be less than $200,000. In the event of a Casualty
where the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor is required to make the
election set forth above and the Borrower either shall fail to notify or
to cause such Subsidiary Guarantor to notify the Collateral Agent and
the Agent of its election within the period set forth above or the
Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall elect not to restore or
replace the Mortgaged Property, the Collateral Agent shall (after being
reimbursed for all reasonable costs of recovery of such Insurance

SECTION 10.18. Confidentiality. Except as otherwise provided in

Lenders agrees to keep confidential (and (i) to cause its respective
officers, directors and employees to keep confidential and (ii) to use
its best efforts to cause its respective agents and representatives to
keep confidential) the Information (as defined below) and all copies
thereof, extracts therefrom and analyses or other materials based
thereon, except that the Agent, the Fronting Bank or any Lender shall be
permitted to disclose Information (a) to such of its respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives as need to
know such Information, (b) to the extent requested by any bank
regulatory authority, (c) (i) to the extent otherwise required by
applicable laws and regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal
process or (ii) in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, (d) to the extent such Information (i) becomes
publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement
or (ii) becomes available to the Agent, the Fronting Bank or any Lender
on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or
(e) to the extent the Borrower shall have consented to such disclosure
in writing. For the purposes of this Section, Information shall mean
all information that is received from the Borrower and relates to the
Borrower or the Subsidiaries, other than any such information available
to the Agent, the Fronting Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
prior to its disclosure thereto by the Borrower, and which is clearly
identified at the time of delivery as confidential. The provisions of
this Section 10.18 shall remain operative and in full force and effect
regardless of the expiration of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties hereto agree that the filing of any of the Loan
Documents (to the extent necessary in the judgment of the Collateral
Agent) to properly assure the validity or priority of the Collateral
Agent's Lien under any Security Document or to the extent required by
local counsel in order to render an opinion in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent in connection with such
Lien will not result in a violation of the foregoing confidentiality
provisions.

SECTION 10.19 Sharing of Proceeds of Certain Collateral. (a) If
the Collateral Agent receives any amounts in respect of any Mortgaged
Property and the related Mortgage omits as a secured obligation the
Revolving Loans (including the Letters of Credit) (each such Mortgage
being a Partial Mortgage ), and the application by the Collateral Agent
of such amounts in accordance with the terms of such Partial Mortgage
would result in the unpaid principal portion of any Lender's Loans being
proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of any other
Lender's Loans, then the Collateral Agent shall be permitted to
reallocate such amounts so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
the Loans and LC Exposures and participations in Loans and LC Exposures
held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of all Loans and LC Exposures then outstanding
as the principal amount of such Lender's Loans and LC Exposures prior to
the initial application of the amounts by the Collateral Agent was to
the principal amount of all Loans and LC Exposures prior to the initial
application of such amounts. The Borrower expressly consents to the
foregoing arrangements.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Borrower, the Agent, the Fronting Bank and
the Lenders have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their
respective authorized officers as of the day and year first above
written.
