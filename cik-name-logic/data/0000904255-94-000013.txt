PACTEL CORP. FACTS & FINANCIALS

January 20, 1994

Pacific Telesis Group, the parent of PacTel Corporation, today released 1993
financial results on a consolidated basis which included information for
PacTel Corporation. We felt that this information would be of interest to you,
as a member of the financial community who follows PacTel Corporation.
However, please note that the "net income from spin-off operations" reported
by Pacific Telesis Group on its attached income statement is presented solely
for the purposes of its financial results. Upon receipt of final results from
its domestic and international partnerships and joint ventures, PacTel
Corporation will release consolidated 1993 financial results which could
differ materially from that reported by Pacific Telesis Group today. PacTel
Corporation plans to release its 1993 consolidated financial statements in
March 1994.

PacTel Corporation reported having 1,046,000 proportionate customers on
domestic cellular systems for which it has or shares operational control, an
increase of 302,000 from a year ago. That represents a 40.6 percent increase
over the 744,000 reported in the fourth quarter of 1992.

Each of the company's domestic cellular markets added a record number of
customers for the quarter.

"We enjoyed explosive customer growth as customers continued to see the value
of our cellular service," said C. Lee Cox, president and chief operating
officer of PacTel Corporation. "Our plans to install digital technology in our
California and Atlanta networks will help ensure that customers receive
quality service and have access to important new wireless products."

PacTel Corporation's fourth quarter operating income from domestic cellular
totaled $51.3 million, a 37.5 percent increase over the $37.3 million of a
year ago. Revenues totaled $248.0 million, up 30 percent over the $191.3
million of a year ago. Cash flow margins were nearly 39 percent, with operat-
ing cash flows of $96 million, despite costs associated with customer growth.
Cash flow margins for the year 1993 were nearly 43%.

PacTel Paging also turned in an impressive fourth quarter, culminating its
strongest growth year ever. The number of units in service increased to 1.2
million, up 42 percent from the 821,000 of a year ago. This increase includes
22,000 units that were purchased through a fourth quarter acquisition.

Domestic paging operating cash flow for the year totaled $50.3 million,
increasing 18.4 percent over the previous year's 42.5 million despite costs
incurred for entering new markets.

Internationally, PacTel Corporation's German cellular joint venture, in which
the company is the second largest shareowner, neared 500,000 customers at
year-end, far above original expectations. The Mannesmann Mobilfunk cellular
network covers more than 90 percent of the population in Germany.

In Portugal, the company holds a 23 percent interest in the Telecel cellular
system, which reported nearly 40,000 customers at year end, up from only about
5,000 customers a year ago.

<PAGE>

In Belgium, PacTel Corporation successfully helped the state-owned telephone
company launch a new digital cellular network on Jan. 1. That system had 2,500
customers within the first few days of operation.

PacTel Corporation completed an initial public offering of 68.5 million shares
in 1993. Pacific Telesis Group has stated that subject to approval by the
Board of Directors, it plans to spin-off PacTel Corporation in the first half
of 1994.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Page 4 of 4

Planned Spin-off

In December 1992, the Corporation announced that its Board of Directors (the
"Board") had approved a plan, subject to certain conditions, to spin off the
domestic and international wireless operations of PacTel Corporation
("PacTel"). These operations principally include the Corporation's cellular,
paging and radiolocation services. The Corporation will continue to own its
telephone subsidiaries, Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell, along with several
smaller units. The Corporation's financial statements have been reclassified
to reflect the operating results and net assets of PacTel as "spin-off
operations" separately from the Corporation's "continuing operations." The
spin-off, which is subject to final Board approval, is currently expected to
occur within the first half of 1994.

Financial information presented for PacTel Corporation in the Pacific Telesis
Group consolidated financial statements has been prepared solely for the
purpose of reporting Pacific Telesis Group results and should not be viewed as
a report on the results of PacTel Corporation itself. PacTel Corporation
expects to release its 1993 consolidated results in March 1994 following the
receipt of final results from its domestic and international joint ventures
and partnerships. These 1993 PacTel Corporation consolidated results may
differ materially from those reported in Pacific Telesis Group consolidated
results.

Accounting Changes

Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted new accounting rules for
postretirement benefits other than pensions and for postemployment benefits
and recorded first quarter after-tax charges applicable to continuing
operations of $1.573 billion and $151 million, respectively. These charges
represent the cumulative effects of applying the new rules to prior years and
reduced earnings for 1993 by $3.80 per share and $.36 per share, respectively.
The new rules require a change from the cash method to the accrual method of
accounting for these costs.

Restructuring Charges

During first quarter 1993, the Corporation completed a reevaluation of
investment alternatives relating to its 1990 decision to dispose of the real
estate portfolio of its real estate subsidiary. Based on its decision to
dispose of these assets over the next three to five years, the Corporation
recorded an additional pre-tax restructuring reserve of $347 million to cover
potential future losses on sales and estimated operating losses. An additional
$66 million first quarter pre-tax charge was recorded relating to the
withdrawal from, or restructuring of, the Corporation's cable and customer
premises equipment businesses as well as some anticipated costs related to the
planned spin-off of PacTel. Overall, these charges reduced earnings for first
quarter 1993 by $258 million, or $.63 per share.

During fourth quarter 1993, the Corporation recorded pre-tax restructuring
charges totaling $1.018 billion. These charges include a $977 million charge
by Pacific Bell to recognize the cost of force reductions associated with
reengineering its internal business processes through 1997. This charge will 

(Continued next page)

(APPENDIX, Page 4 continued)

cover the incremental costs associated with separation and relocation of
employees. It will also cover the incremental costs of consolidating and
streamlining operations and facilities to support these downsizing
initiatives. The remaining $41 million fourth quarter charge is primarily for
additional anticipated costs related to the planned spin-off of PacTel.
Overall, these charges reduced earnings for fourth quarter 1993 by $603
million, or $1.43 per share.
