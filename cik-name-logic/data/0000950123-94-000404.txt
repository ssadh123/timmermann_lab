ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE 1993 EARNINGS

Filed herewith are the preliminary and unaudited Consolidated Statements
of Operations of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("the Company"), for the quarter
and year ended December 31, 1993, which Consolidated Statements of Operations
will be superseded by information contained in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. All adjustments which are, in
the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented have been
included. Certain amounts for fourth quarter and year-to-date 1992 reflect
reclassifications to conform to the current periods' presentation. In
addition, filed herewith are unaudited pro forma Consolidated Statements of
Operations for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, which
reflect, among other things, the elimination of revenues and expenses of
certain of the Company's retail and asset management businesses, as well as
certain other assets related to such businesses (the "SLBD Results of
Operations"), the loss on the sale of such businesses and the sale of a
non-core business. The presentation herein of historical information for 1993
(the "Current Presentation") differs from the presentations set forth in the
Reports on Form 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of 1993, which
presentations reflect SLBD Results of Operations, the loss on the sale of such
businesses and reserves for certain non-core businesses in one line item called
"Retail/Asset Management." In the Current Presentation, SLBD Results of
Operations are included in all applicable line items through July 31, 1993 (the
date of the closing of the sale of the Company's retail and asset management
businesses).

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. TO BECOME INDEPENDENT CORPORATION

On January 24, 1994, American Express Company ("American Express")
announced plans to issue a special dividend to its common shareholders. Such
special dividend will consist of the common shares of the Company which
American Express owns immediately preceding such dividend, including common
stock which it receives in exchange for the Company's $250 million Money Market
Cumulative Preferred(sm) Stock. Prior to the issuance of such dividend, the
Company's equity capital will increase by $1.25 billion, bringing its equity
capital to approximately $3.3 billion. The additional equity will be the
result of the purchase of i) $160 million of newly-issued Company common stock
by the Company's employees, approximately $60 million of which would come from
an employee ownership plan that was established in 1993; and ii) $200 million
of newly-issued Company preferred stock and $890 million of newly-issued
Company common stock, each by American Express.

In addition, American Express' plan to spin-off the Company provides
that American Express would receive 50% of any of the Company's net income in
excess of $400 million per year, with a cap of $50 million per year, for each
of the next eight years. Such plan also provides for American Express to
receive certain contingent revenue and earnings related

<PAGE> 3
participations due to the Company from Travelers Corporation for a period of
three and five years, respectively, in connection with the sale last year of
the Company's retail and asset management businesses.

Final terms of the proposed transaction, which is subject to certain
conditions, have not yet been determined. The completion of the proposed
transaction, which is expected to occur during the second quarter of 1994,
would result in the Company emerging as an independent publicly owned
corporation.

Filed herewith is certain unaudited pro forma financial information
which reflects, as stated above, the effects of the sales of certain businesses
on such financial information, and is also presented in order to reflect the
estimated effects of the proposed transaction.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND
EXHIBITS

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information:

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The unaudited pro forma financial information set forth in Exhibits
99.3, 99.4 and 99.5 is presented in order to illustrate the estimated
effects of the proposed capital infusion by American Express and related
actions (the "Current Transaction"), as well as the elimination of the
SLBD Results of Operations, the loss on the sale of certain of the
Company's retail and asset management businesses and the sale of a
non-core business.

The pro forma financial statements for the Company assume for statement
of operations purposes that the Primerica Transaction (as hereinafter
defined), the sale of Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage Corporation (the
"SLHMC Transaction") and the Current Transaction were consummated as of
the first day of the period reported and assume for balance sheet
purposes that such Transactions were consummated on the last day of the
period reported.

The pro forma financial information is presented for comparative
purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the Company's results
of operations or financial position in the future or of what the
Company's results of operations or financial position would have been
had the Primerica Transaction, the SLHMC Transaction and the Current
Transaction been consummated on or as of the dates referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph. The pro forma financial information
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
of the Company and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1992.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS ADJUSTMENTS

For the Year Ended December 31, 1993

Since The Boston Company, Inc. ("Boston") is reported as a
discontinued operation in the Company's financial statements, its results are
not reflected in the Company's 1993 results from continuing operations. The
historical loss of $291 million from continuing operations before cumulative
effect of changes in accounting principles represents: (i) income from the
continuing core businesses of the Company of $376 million; (ii) the net income
of SLBD of $63 million; (iii) the net loss on the sale of SLBD of $630 million;
and (iv) the net reserve for non- core businesses of $100 million of which $21
million of such reserve is related to certain non-core partnership syndication
activities in which the Company is no longer actively engaged. The pro forma
adjustments to the statement of operations give effect to the items described
below:

a) Adjustment reflects the elimination of revenues and expenses of
certain of the Company's retail and asset management businesses,
as well as certain other assets related to such businesses
("SLBD") and the loss on the sale of such assets (the "Primerica
Transaction"). Also eliminated is the income tax expense of
$149 million related to these items.

b) Adjustment reflects the elimination of revenues and expenses of
SLHMC.

c) Adjustment to reserves for non-core businesses reflects the
elimination of the reserves related to the sale of SLHMC. Also
eliminated is the income tax benefit of $41 million related to
these items. Adjustments have not been made for reserves taken in
the first quarter of 1993 related to certain non-core partnership
syndication activities in which the Company is no longer actively
engaged.

d) Adjustment reflects reduced interest expense of approximately $52
million resulting from the utilization of cash proceeds (from the
sales of Boston, SLBD and SLHMC) to reduce the Company's
short-term debt and term notes, offset by interest expense of $72
million allocated to SLBD and SLHMC for the carrying costs of
buildings, improvements and equipment and certain acquisition
related debt, which is not directly eliminated by the Primerica
Transaction or the sale of SLHMC other than through the
utilization of available sales proceeds.

e) Adjustment reflects reduced interest expense of approximately $42
million resulting from the utilization of the cash received of
$1,090 million as capital infusion from American Express and the
$100 million raised through the proposed sale of Common Stock to
the Company's employees.

f) Adjustments (d) and (e) are tax effected at a rate of 40%.
<PAGE> 3
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS ADJUSTMENTS

In recognition of its capital infusion, American Express will receive
50% of any of the Company's net income in excess of $400 million per year, with
a cap of $50 million per year for each of the next eight years. This threshold
would not have been achieved in 1993. In addition, American Express will
receive certain contingent revenue and earnings related participations due to
the Company from Travelers Corporation (previously Primerica Corporation) for a
period of three and five years, respectively, in connection with the sale of
SLBD.

On the effective date of the Current Transaction the Company will no
longer be included in the consolidated U.S. income tax return of American
Express. The Company does not anticipate any significant adverse tax
consequences as a result of a completion of the Current Transaction.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS ADJUSTMENTS

For the Year Ended December 31, 1992

Since Boston is reported as a discontinued operation in the Company's financial
statements, its results are not reflected in the Company's 1992 results from
continuing operations. The pro forma adjustments to the statement of
operations give effect to the items described below:

a) Adjustment reflects the elimination of revenues and expenses
of SLBD.

b) Adjustment reflects the elimination of revenues and expenses
of SLHMC.

c) Adjustment reflects reduced interest expense of approximately
$112 million resulting from the utilization of cash proceeds
to reduce the Company's short-term debt and term notes, offset
by interest expense of $102 million allocated to SLBD and
SLHMC for the carrying costs of buildings, improvements and
equipment and certain acquisition related debt, which is not
directly eliminated by the Primerica Transaction or the SLHMC
Transaction other than through the utilization of available
sales proceeds.

d) Adjustment reflects reduced interest expense of approximately
$42 million resulting from the utilization of the cash
received of $1,090 million as capital infusion from American
Express and the $100 million raised through the proposed sale
of Common Stock to the Company's employees.

e) Adjustments (c) and (d) are tax effected at a rate of 40%.
