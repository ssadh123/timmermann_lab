JAMES RIVER AND JAMONT HOLDINGS
AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
(UNAUDITED)
1. BASIS OF REPORTING
The accompanying pro forma consolidated capitalization and condensed balance
sheet as of March 27, 1994, and the pro forma consolidated statements of
operations for the three months ended March 27, 1994, and the year ended
December 26, 1993, give effect to the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest
in Jamont Holdings using the purchase method of accounting. The aggregate
purchase price to be paid for the additional interest in Jamont Holdings is
approximately $575 million, excluding estimated acquisition and financing costs
of $11.4 million. The accompanying pro forma consolidated financial statements
give effect to the expected issuances of approximately $250 million of the
Depositary Shares and the incurrence of funded indebtedness of approximately
$336 million, the proceeds of which will be used to finance the acquisition of
Jamont Holdings.
The values assigned to the net assets acquired will be based upon a
determination, after the completion of the transaction, of the fair values of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Jamont Holdings was originally
formed in 1990, at which time its assets and liabilities were adjusted to then
fair values. In 1991, Jamont Holdings commenced a $600 million capital expansion
program which was completed in 1993. Accordingly, based on the relatively recent
valuations of Jamont Holdings' assets and liabilities, for the purpose of these
pro forma consolidated financial statements, the excess of the purchase price
over such estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, approximating $122.5
million, has been allocated to goodwill.
Historical financial information on Jamont Holdings contained in the pro forma
consolidated financial statements has been derived from the audited financial
statements of Jamont Holdings as of December 31, 1993, and for the year then
ended and the unaudited financial statements as of March 31, 1994, and for the
three months then ended, each prepared in accordance with accounting standards
generally accepted in The Netherlands and measured in European Currency Units.
Such financial information has been adjusted to conform to U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles and translated into U.S. dollars.
2. PRO FORMA BALANCE SHEET AND CAPITALIZATION ADJUSTMENTS
The pro forma consolidated capitalization and condensed balance sheet give
effect to the adjustments described below.
(a) To eliminate James River's existing investment in Jamont Holdings as of
March 27, 1994, previously accounted for using the equity method.
(b) To record estimated goodwill, representing the excess of James River's
purchase price over the estimated fair value of Jamont Holdings' net
equity.
(c) To record $11.4 million of estimated acquisition and financing costs,
assumed to be funded through borrowings under the Company's revolving
credit facility, detailed as follows:
(i) $0.4 million related to the acquisition of Jamont Holdings,
excluding financing-related costs;
(ii) $3.0 million related to the incurrence of $325 million of funded
indebtedness; and
(iii) $8.0 million related to the issuance of $250 million of the
Depositary Shares.
(d) To record the assumed incurrence and issuance of the following:
(i) $325 million of funded indebtedness incurred in connection with
the acquisition of Jamont Holdings; and
(ii) $250 million of the Depositary Shares issued in connection with
the acquisition of Jamont Holdings.
(e) To eliminate the Jamont Holdings historical shareholders' equity
balances.

(UNAUDITED)
3. PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS ADJUSTMENTS
The pro forma consolidated statement of operations gives effect to the
adjustments described below.
(a) To record amortization of the incremental goodwill, using the
straight-line method over an assumed life of 40 years.
(b) To record interest expense on the $336 million of incremental funded
indebtedness, at an assumed interest rate of 8.0%.
(c) To reverse James River's share of the earnings of Jamont Holdings
associated with its existing 50% ownership interest, previously
accounted for using the equity method.
(d) To record income tax benefits related to the incremental interest
expense.
(e) To reflect increased preferred dividend requirements related to the
issuance of $250 million of the Depositary Shares, at an estimated
dividend yield of 8.5%.
4. LENDER CONSENTS
For purposes of these pro forma consolidated financial statements, it has been
assumed that any necessary consents or waivers which may be required for the
completion of the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Jamont Holdings
have been obtained by James River and that no material incremental costs will be
incurred in obtaining such consents or waivers.
5. PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED SEGMENT INFORMATION
Following the completion of the acquisition of the remaining interest in Jamont
Holdings, James River intends to continue to report its operations in its
existing three business segments. These segments are: Consumer Products, which
includes the manufacture and marketing of towel and tissue and disposable
foodservice products; Food and Consumer Packaging, which includes the
manufacture of folding cartons, flexible packaging, and packaging papers used in
packaging food and other retail consumer goods; and Communications Papers, which
includes the manufacture and marketing of a variety of uncoated business and
printing papers, coated groundwood printing papers, and premium printing papers.
Upon its consolidation, James River intends to report the results of Jamont
Holdings as part of its Consumer Products segment.
6. PRO FORMA RATIOS
On a pro forma basis after reflecting the assumed acquisition and financing of
Jamont Holdings, James River's earnings were inadequate to cover both fixed
charges and combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends for the year
ended December 26, 1993, and for the three months ended March 27, 1994. For the
year ended December 26, 1993, the amount of the deficiency of pro forma earnings
compared to pro forma fixed charges was $25.7 million, and the amount of the
deficiency of pro forma earnings compared to pro forma combined fixed charges
and preferred stock dividends was $114.2 million. For the three months ended
March 27, 1994, the amount of the deficiency of pro forma earnings compared to
pro forma fixed charges was $14.9 million and the amount of the deficiency of
pro forma earnings compared to pro forma combined fixed charges of preferred
stock dividends was $37.0 million. See "Selected Financial Information" herein.
