Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On April 7, 1994, Armco Steel Company, L.P. ("ASC"), a fifty percent owned 
joint venture limited partnership between subsidiaries of Armco Inc. 
("Armco") and Kawasaki Steel Corporation, completed an initial public 
offering and recapitalization. As part of this transaction, the business 
and assets of ASC were transferred to AK Steel Holding Corporation ("AK 
Steel"), a newly formed, publicly traded company. In exchange for its 
interest in ASC, Armco received 1,023,987 shares of stock in AK Steel with a 
market value, based on the initial public offering price, of approximately 
$24 million. The stock represents about four percent of the outstanding 
shares immediately after the initial public offering. In addition, Armco 
was released from certain obligations to make future cash payments to the 
former joint venture. The exchange rate and other terms were determined by 
arm's-length negotiations as part of the restructuring and recapitalization 
of the former ASC joint venture.

As a result of the transaction, Armco expects to recognize nonrecurring 
gains in the second quarter of 1994 totaling approximately $67 million, or 
$.64 per share, primarily as a result of reversing the obligations discussed 
above, recognizing deferred pension curtailment gains established at ASC's 
formation and recording a tax benefit related to the effect of this 
transaction on its deferred tax asset position.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

b. Pro forma financial information

The transaction involves the disposition of Armco's interest in ASC, a joint 
venture accounted for as an equity investment. Because of the limited 
number of pro forma adjustments, a narrative description of the pro forma 
effects of the transaction is furnished in lieu of full pro forma financial 
statements.

In 1993, cumulative losses reported by ASC resulted in a reduction of 
Armco's investment in the joint venture to zero, after which Armco stopped 
recording its equity in ASC's results. Had the transaction occurred as of 
January 1, 1993, Armco's 1993 pro forma results of operations would have 
benefited by $27.9 million, the share of the losses of ASC recorded by Armco 
during 1993. Excluding these losses, Armco's 1993 net loss would have been 
$613.9 million.

In addition, the pro forma balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 would have 
reflected an increase of approximately $91 million in Armco's shareholders' 
equity. $67 million of this increase would be in retained earnings 
following the release from certain liabilities, the immediate recognition of 
deferred pension gains established at ASC's formation and $30 million of tax 
benefit related to the effect of this transaction on Armco's deferred tax 
asset position. These adjustments would decrease noncurrent liabilities and 
increase the noncurrent deferred tax asset. Shareholders' equity would also 
increase approximately $24 million for unrealized gains on the 1,023,987 
shares AK Steel stock received in the transaction. The $24 million 
investment in this stock (based on the initial offering price of $23.50 per 
share) would be recorded as a current asset available for sale.

appropriate form pursuant to Rule 415 (or any similar provision that may be 
adopted by the Commission) under the Securities Act (the "Shelf

of (i) the sixth anniversary of the IPO Date and (ii) the first date there 
shall be no remaining Registrable Securities (including by reason of the 
fact that all Registrable Securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144(k) 
under the Securities Act). The Company will pay all Registration Expenses in 
connection with the Shelf Registration, whether or not it becomes effective. 
The Company will make generally available to its security holders, as soon

statement on Form S-4 or S-8, or any substitute form

the Registrable Securities requested to be included in the registration 
statement for such offering to be included on the same terms and conditions 
as any similar securities of the Company or of other security holders to be 
included therein. If, notwithstanding the reasonable efforts of the Company, 
the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of such offering deliver a written 
opinion to Holders' Representative that, due to the size of the offering 
which the Holders, the Company and such other persons intend to make, the 
success of the offering would be materially and adversely affected by 
inclusion of the Registrable Securities requested to be included, then the 
amount of securities to be offered for the accounts of Holders shall be 
reduced pro rata (according to the Registrable Securities proposed for 
registration) to the extent necessary to reduce the total Amount of 
securities to be included in such offering to the amount recommended by such 
managing Underwriters; provided that if 
-------- 
securities are 
being offered for the account of other security holders, then the proportion 
by which the amount of such class of securities intended to be offered by 
the Holders is reduced shall not exceed the proportion by which the amount 
of the securities intended to be offered by such other security holders is 
reduced.

4. Hold-Back Agreements
--------------------

(a) Restrictions on Public Sale by Holder of Regis- 
-----------------------------------------------
trable Securities. Each Holder, if requested by the manag-
- -----------------
ing Underwriters in an underwritten offering of Common Stock of the Company 
(whether or not any Registrable Securities of any such Holder are included 
in such offering), agrees not to effect any public sale or distribution of 
the Registrable Securities, including a sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the 
Securities Act (except as part of such underwritten offering), during the 
10-day period prior to, and during a period of up to 90 days beginning on

the extent timely requested in writing by the managing Underwriters (except 
as part of such underwritten registration or pursuant to registrations on 
Forms S-4 or S-8 or any successor form to such Forms), and

(2) if reasonably requested by Holders' Representative or the 
managing Underwriters in connection with an underwritten offering of Common 
Stock of the Company, to use reasonable efforts to cause each holder of 
privately placed equity securities issued by the Company at any time on or 
after the date of this Agreement (other than the Trustee of the AK Steel 
Corporation Master Pension Trust) to agree not to effect any public sale or 
distribution of any such securities during such period, including a sale 
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (except as part of such 
underwritten registration, if permitted).

its officers will, upon the reasonable request of the Holders' 
representative, participate directly in the marketing and sale of the

reimburse the Company for their portion (based on the proportion that their 
shares to be sold bears to the total number of shares to be sold in the

incurred by the Company relating to the participation of it and its officers 
in such marketing and sales efforts requested by Holders' Representative.

The Company may require each Selling Holder to furnish to the Company 
such information regarding the distribution of such securities as the 
Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing.

Each Selling Holder agrees by acquisition of the Registrable 
Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the 
happening of any event of the kind described in Section 5(c) hereof (other 
than 5(c)(1) hereof), such Selling Holder will forthwith discontinue 
disposition of Registrable Securities until such Selling Holder's receipt of 
the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 
5(j) hereof, or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use 
of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional 
or supplemental filings which are incorporated by reference in the 
Prospectus, and, if so directed by the Company, Holders' Representative and 
each such Selling Holder will deliver to the Company (at the Company's 
expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in Holders' 
Representative's or such Selling Holder's possession, of the Prospectus 
covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such 
notice. If the Company shall give any such notice, the time period mentioned 
in Section 2(a)(ii) hereof shall be extended by the number of days during 
the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and 
including the date when Holders' Representative and each Selling Holder 
either receives the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus 
contemplated by Section 5(j) hereof or is advised in writing by the Company 
that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed.

Each Selling Holder agrees by acquisition of the Registrable

hereunder in which such registrable Securities are included or expected to 
be included.

(and its counsel) that is required to be retained in accordance with the 
rules and regulations of the NASD (all such expenses being herein called 
"Registration Expenses").

- 11 -
<PAGE>
The Company will not have any obligation to pay any underwriting fees, 
discounts or commissions attributable to the sale of Registrable Securities.

The Company will, in any event, pay its internal expenses (including, 
without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees 
performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit, the 
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the securities 
to be registered on each securities exchange on which similar securities 
issued by the Company are then listed, and the fees and expenses of any 
Person, including special experts, retained by the Company, provided, that 
--------
the foregoing is not intended to prejudice the Company's right to obtain 
reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses pursuant to the proviso set 
forth in Section 5 hereof.

(b) In connection with each Registration Statement required 
hereunder, the Company will reimburse the Selling Holders for the reasonable 
fees and disbursements of not more than one law firm chosen by the Holders' 
Representative.

7. Indemnification
---------------

(a) Indemnification by Company. The Company shall indemnify 
--------------------------
and hold harmless each Holder, its officers, directors, employees and Agents 
and each Person who controls such Holder within the meaning of either 
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (each 
such person being sometimes hereinafter referred to as an "Indemnified 
Holder") from and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and 
expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and legal expenses) 
arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue 
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or 
Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary 
prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission 
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary 
to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such 
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of or are based 
upon any such untrue statement or omission or allegation thereof based upon 
information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for 
use therein; provided, that the Company
--------
shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, 
claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue 
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made 
in any preliminary prospectus if (i) such Holder failed to send or deliver a 
copy of the Prospectus with or prior to

- 12 -
<PAGE>
the delivery of written confirmation of the sale of Registrable Securities 
and (ii) the Prospectus would have completely corrected such untrue 
statement or omission; and provided, further, that the 
--------
Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such 
loss, claim damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based upon an 
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission 
in the Prospectus, if such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, 
omission or alleged omission is completely corrected in an amendment or 
supplement to the Prospectus and if, having previously been furnished by or 
on behalf of the Company with copies of the Prospectus as so amended or 
supplemented, such Holder thereafter fails to deliver such Prospectus as so 
amended or supplemented, prior to or concurrently with the sale of a 
Registrable Security to the person asserting such loss, claim, damage, 
liability or expense who purchased such Registrable Security which is the 
subject thereof from such Holder. This indemnity will be in addition to any 
liability which the Company may otherwise have. The Company will also 
indemnify Underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar 
securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their 
officers and directors and each Person who controls such Persons (within the 
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange 
Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the 
indemnification of the Indemnified Holders; provided, however, if such 
-------- -------
Underwriters,
selling brokers, dealer managers or similar securities industry 
professionals require or agree to indemnification provisions different from 
those set forth herein, but standard in the industry, the Company agrees to 
provide them such indemnification rather than the indemnification provided 
for herein.

If any action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation 
or inquiry) shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Holder in 
respect of which indemnity may be sought from the Company, such Indemnified 
Holder shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall 
assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel satisfactory 
to such Indemnified Holder and the payment of all expenses. Such 
Indemnified Holder shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any 
such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and 
expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnified Holder 
unless (a) the Company has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (b) the 
Company shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or proceeding 
and has failed to employ counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Holder in 
any such action or proceeding or (c) the named parties to any such action or 
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified 
Holder and the Company, and such Indemnified Holder shall have been advised 
by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the

- 13 -
<PAGE>
Company that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such 
Indemnified Holder which are different from or additional to those available 
to the Company (in which case, if such Indemnified Holder notifies the 
Company in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense 
of the Company, the Company shall not have the right to assume the defense 
of such action or proceeding on behalf of such Indemnified Holder, it being 
understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one 
such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related 
actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same 
general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and 
expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for such 
Indemnified Holder and any other Indemnified Holders, which firm shall be 
designated in writing by such Indemnified Holders). The Company shall not be 
liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without 
its written consent, but if settled with its written consent, or if there be 
a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action or proceeding, the 
Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified Holders from 
and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

(b) Indemnification by Holder of Registrable Securities. 
---------------------------------------------------
Each Holder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors 
and officers and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the 
meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the 
Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company 
to such holder, but only with respect to information relating to such Holder 
furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration 
Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any 
preliminary prospectus. In case any action or proceeding shall be brought 
against the Company or its directors or officers or any such controlling 
person, in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a Holder, such 
Holder shall have the rights and duties given the Company and the Company or 
its directors or officers or such controlling person shall have the rights 
and duties given to each Holder by the preceding paragraph. In no event 
shall the liability of any Selling Holder hereunder be greater in amount 
than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such Selling Holder upon 
the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification 
obligation.

The Company shall be entitled to receive indemnities from 
Underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities 
industry professionals participating in the distribution, to the same extent 
as provided above with

- 14 -
<PAGE>
respect to information so furnished in writing by such Persons specifically 
for inclusion in any Prospectus or Registration Statement or any amendment 
or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus.

(c) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in 
------------
this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 
Section 7(b) hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in those 
Sections) in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses 
referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of 
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or 
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, dam- 
ages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to 
reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the 
Indemnified Holder on the other in connection with the statements or 
omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or 
expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The 
relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Indemnified Holder 
on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, 
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the 
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information 
supplied by the Company or by the Indemnified Holder and the parties' 
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct 
or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party 
as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses 
referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set 
forth in the second paragraph of Section 7(a), any legal or other fees or 
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating 
or defending any action or claim.

The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and 
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(c) were determined by 
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take 
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately 
preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(c), an 
Indemnified Holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess 
of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities sold by such 
Indemnified Holder or its affiliated Indemnified Holders and distributed to 
the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages 
which such Indemnified Holder, or its affiliated Indemnified Holder, has 
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue 
statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent 
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section ll(f) of the Act) shall be 
entitled to

- 15 -
<PAGE>
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent 
misrepresentation.

8. Rule 144
--------

The Company covenants that it will file the reports required to be 
filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and 
regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder, and it will take such 
further action as any Holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably 
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder 
to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act 
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 under the 
Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or (b) any 
similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission. Upon the 
request of any Holder, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written 
statement as to whether it has complied with such information and 
requirements.

9. Participation in Underwritten Registrations
-------------------------------------------

No Person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder 
unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Person's securities on the basis 
provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled 
hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all 
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and 
other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

10. Miscellaneous
-------------

(a) Remedies. Each Holder in addition to being entitled to 
--------
exercise all rights provided herein, and granted by law, including recovery 
of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under 
this Agreement. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be 
adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of 
the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agrees to waive the defense in 
any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.

(b) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company will not on or 
--------------------------
after the date of this Agreement and for so long as it has an obligation to 
maintain a Shelf Registration pursuant to Section 2(a), enter into any 
agreement with respect to its securities which is inconsistent with the 
rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with 
the provisions hereof. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not 
in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to 
the Holders of the Company's securities under any such

- 16 -
<PAGE>
agreements. Other than as disclosed on Schedule 10(b), the Company has not 
granted registration rights with respect to Common Stock to any person other 
than a Holder.

(c) Actions Affecting Registrable Securities. The Company 
----------------------------------------
agrees to use its best efforts to cause all Registrable Securities to be 
listed on the Nasdaq National Market System or any other exchange on which 
shares of the same security are then traded.

(d) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this 
----------------------
Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, 
modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the 
provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company has obtained the
