ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On September 1, 1994, Union Planters Corporation (the Corporation)
completed the acquisition of BNF BANCORP, Inc. in a transaction accounted for
as a pooling of interests. Reference is made to the Corporation's Current
Reports on Form 8-K dated February 8, 1994, April 14, 1994, May 18, 1994,
August 18, 1994, August 19, 1994, and September 1, 1994, for additional
information regarding this acquisition. Reference should also be made to the
Corporation's Current Reports on Form 8-K dated July 1, 1994, July 26, 1994,
August 18, 1994, and August 19, 1994, and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
dated June 30, 1994 which discuss the Corporation's pending acquisition of
Grenada Sunburst System Corporation (GSSC) and certain charges in the third
quarter of 1994 and the possibility of significant charges in the fourth
quarter of 1994 and future cost savings related to GSSC, other pending
acquisitions and possible internal and acquisition-related reorganizations of
the Corporation.
The acquisition of BNF is considered significant to the Corporation's
financial statements. Accordingly, the Corporation's 1993 audited consolidated
financial statements and June 30, 1994 unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements are being restated for this acquisition. The Corporation's
supplementary consolidated financial statements for 1993 (the supplementary

in October, 1994) and unaudited supplementary interim consolidated financial
statements for June 30, 1994 are attached as Exhibits 99(a) and (b),

UNION PLANTERS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO SUPPLEMENTARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of Union Planters Corporation
(the Corporation) and its subsidiaries conform with generally accepted
accounting principles and general practices within the financial services
industry. The following is a summary of the more significant accounting
policies of the Corporation.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Corporation and its subsidiaries after elimination of
significant intercompany accounts and transactions. The Corporation's
principal subsidiary is Union Planters National Bank (UPNB).

BASIS OF PRESENTATION. Prior period financial statements are restated to
include the accounts of material acquisitions accounted for using the pooling
of interests method of accounting. Business combinations accounted for as
purchases are included in the consolidated financial statements from the
respective dates of acquisition. Assets and liabilities of banks accounted for
as purchases are adjusted to their fair market values at the dates of
acquisition. Certain 1991 and 1992 amounts have been reclassified to conform
with 1993 financial reporting presentation.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from
banks and federal funds sold. Federal funds sold in the amounts of
$53,109,000, $92,354,000, and $59,570,000 at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively, are included in cash and cash equivalents.

TRADING ACCOUNT SECURITIES. Trading account securities are stated at market and
consist primarily of securities backed by the government- guaranteed portion of
Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. Gains and losses on sales and
market value adjustments related to these securities are included in profits
and commissions from trading activities.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

HELD FOR SALE. Investment securities held for sale consist of both debt and
equity securities that may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of,
changes in interest rates, prepayment risk, liquidity considerations, and other
factors. These securities are carried at the lower of aggregate cost, adjusted
for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, or market value
(LOCOM). Unrealized net valuation adjustments, if any, are included in
investment securities gains and losses.

5
<PAGE> 7
HELD FOR INVESTMENT. Investment securities carried at amortized cost consist of
securities which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity.
These securities are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and
accretion of discount, which are recognized as adjustments to interest income.
Gains and losses on securities are recorded when realized on a specific
identity basis or when, in the opinion of management, an unrealized loss is
other than temporary in nature.
All investment securities transactions are recorded using a method
which approximates trade-date accounting. Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
(CMO) and Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) represent a significant portion of
the investment securities portfolio. Premiums and discounts on CMO and MBS are
analyzed in relation to the corresponding prepayments rate, both historical and
estimated, using a method which approximates the effective yield method.
Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". This statement requires that
securities be classified as either held to maturity securities, which are
reported at amortized cost; trading securities, which are reported at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings; or available for
sale securities, which are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
shareholders' equity.
In connection with the adoption of this statement, the Corporation
transferred all of the securities currently in the held for investment
category, except for obligations of states and political subdivisions, to the
available for sale category. Had SFAS No. 115 been adopted at December 31,
1993, shareholders' equity would have increased by approximately $11.7 million.
There was no impact on earnings upon the adoption of this statement.

LOANS. Loans are stated at the principal amount outstanding except for loans
held for resale which are stated at the lower of cost or market. Interest
income on loans is accrued using constant yield methods, except for unearned
income which is recorded as income using a method which approximates the
interest method. Loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are
deferred and recognized over the life of the related loans as adjustments to
interest income.

NONPERFORMING LOANS. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and
renegotiated loans which have been restructured in accordance with the criteria
set forth in SFAS No. 15 "Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt
Restructurings". Loans, other than installment and mortgage loans, are
generally placed on nonaccrual status and interest is not recorded if, in
management's opinion, payment in full of principal or interest is not expected
or when payment of principal or interest is more than 90 days past due, unless
it is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Upon adverse change
in the account status (e.g., loan is past due, filing of bankruptcy or wage
earner, repossession of collateral, foreclosure, or death of the borrower),
installment and

6
<PAGE> 8
mortgage loans (including accrued interest) are written down to the net
realizable value of the underlying collateral. Such loans are reviewed
periodically for further write-downs until fully liquidated. Income recognized
on revolving credit loans is discontinued upon adverse change, and the loans
are fully charged off if no payment is received in 180 days.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON LOANS. The allowance for losses on loans represents
management's estimate of potential losses inherent in the existing loan
portfolio. The allowance for losses on loans is increased by the provision for
losses on loans charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off, net of
recoveries. The provision for losses on loans is determined based on
management's assessment of several factors: current and anticipated economic
conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups,
historical loan loss experience, the level of classified and nonperforming
loans, reviews and evaluations of specific loans, changes in the nature and
volume of the loan portfolio, and the results of regulatory examinations.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT. Premises and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation provisions are
computed using the straight-line method and are charged to operating expense
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the initial term
of the respective lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement.
Costs of major additions and improvements are capitalized. Interest
expense incurred on funds expended on major construction projects is
capitalized as a cost of such projects during the construction period.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. The unamortized costs in excess of the fair
market value of acquired net tangible assets are included in goodwill and other
intangibles. Identifiable intangibles, including premiums on purchased
deposits and assets, are amortized over the estimated periods benefited. The
remaining costs (goodwill) are generally amortized on a straight-line basis
over 15 years. For acquisitions where the fair market value of net assets
acquired exceeds the purchase price, the resulting negative goodwill is
allocated proportionally to noncurrent, nonmonetary assets.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS. Mortgage servicing rights represent the cost of
mortgage servicing purchased from others. These costs are amortized in
proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income based on
the historical and projected prepayments of the underlying loans. At December
31, 1993 and 1992, mortgage servicing rights were $3,584,000 and $4,917,000,
respectively.

7
<PAGE> 9
OTHER REAL ESTATE. Property acquired through foreclosure is stated at the lower
of the recorded amount of the loan or the estimated net realizable value,
reduced by estimated selling costs. When a reduction of the recorded amount to
the net realizable value is required at the time of foreclosure, the difference
is charged to the allowance for losses on loans. Any subsequent reduction is
charged to other real estate expense, and a valuation reserve is established
for the potential declines in appraised values. Other real estate is recorded
net of the valuation reserve. Revenues and expenses associated with operating
or disposing of other real estate are recorded in the period in which they are
incurred. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, other real estate totaled $4,362,000
and $6,642,000, respectively.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. The Corporation sponsors two qualified employee
benefit plans for substantially all employees of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries. One is a 401K plan with matching employer contributions based on
length of service. Employer contributions, provided through a Flexible
Benefits Plan, may also be directed to the 401K plan at the election of the
employee. The second is a noncontributory employee stock ownership plan, which
is funded by discretionary employer contributions approved by the Board of
Directors. All costs of the plans are expensed as incurred.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions" and SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits". These standards require that the expected costs of postretirement
and postemployment benefits be charged to expense during the years that the
employee renders service which is a change from the previous policy of
recognizing these costs on a cash basis. The Corporation elected to recognize
the accumulated postretirement and postemployment benefit obligation upon
adoption which approximated $8.3 million ($5.1 million after tax) and $1.3
million ($807,000 after tax), respectively.

INCOME TAXES. The Corporation files a consolidated federal income tax return
with its subsidiaries, with the exception of credit life insurance subsidiaries
which file separate returns. State income taxes are computed on either a
separate company basis or consolidated basis depending upon state laws. The
Corporation and its subsidiaries file a consolidated state return for all
business in the state of Tennessee.
Income tax expense is based on income reported for financial
accounting purposes, and includes deferred taxes resulting from the recognition
of certain transactions in different periods for tax reporting purposes in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 109 and recorded the cumulative effect of the accounting change of
$10.9 million.

<PAGE> 10
INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS. Interest rate swap agreements are used as part
of the Corporation's interest rate risk management strategy by hedging
on-balance-sheet financial instruments. The Corporation activities are
exclusively end-user related. To qualify as a hedge the following criteria
must be met: (i) the asset or liability to be hedged exposes the institution,
as a whole, to interest rate risk; (ii) the interest rate swap acts to reduce
the interest rate risk by moving the institution closer to being insensitive to
interest rate changes; and (iii) the interest rate swap is designated and
effective as a hedge. Fees related to swap agreements are amortized on the
interest method over the life of the swap. If the instrument being hedged is
disposed of, the swap agreement is marked to market with any resulting gain or
loss included in the determination of the gain or loss from the disposition.
If the interest rate swap agreement is terminated, the gain or loss is deferred
and amortized over the remaining life of the specific hedged asset or
liability.

EARNINGS PER SHARE. Primary earnings per common share are adjusted for all
preferred stock dividends. Primary earnings per common share is computed based
on the weighted average common shares outstanding and common stock equivalents
arising from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, unless their
effect would be antidilutive. Fully diluted earnings per common share is
computed using the weighted average common shares and equivalents. Common
stock equivalents are increased by the assumed conversion of convertible
preferred stock into common stock as if converted at the beginning of the
period, unless the effect would be antidilutive. Earnings for fully diluted
earnings per common share are adjusted for preferred stock dividends on
nonconvertible preferred stock.

The consolidated financial statements for 1993 include the results of
operations of the above entities. Prior year amounts have not been restated
due to immateriality. Eliminations have been made for material intercompany
transactions with the pooled companies. During 1993, the above pooled
institutions contributed approximately $10.1 million, $1.5 million, and $2.1
million to net interest income, noninterest income and net earnings,
respectively, of the Corporation through their respective dates of acquisition.

ACQUISITION OF BNF BANCORP, INC. (BNF)

On September 1, 1994, the Corporation completed the acquisition of
BNF, the parent company for BANKFIRST, a federal savings bank located in
Decatur, Alabama. The Corporation issued 2,000,329 shares of its Common Stock
in the acquisition, and the total assets of BNF at the date of acquisition were
$278 million. These consolidated supplementary financial statements have been
restated for this acquisition.
The following table summarizes the impact of the BNF acquisition on
the Corporation's previously reported net interest income, noninterest income
and earnings before extraordinary item and accounting changes.

(a) The Corporation, through UPNB, assumed approximately $585 million in
insured deposit liabilities (including accrued interest payable) of
the former Metropolitan Federal Savings and Loan Association. The
purchase and assumption transaction was facilitated through the
Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) which declared UPNB the successful
bidder. UPNB also acquired approximately $82 million in assets and
received cash from the RTC totaling approximately $487 million.
(b) SBI is the parent company of DeKalb County Bank and Trust Company
(DeKalb).
(c) The Corporation previously held 17.93% of the common stock of BOET
($3.4 million). On January 1, 1993, the Corporation purchased an
additional 43.93% of the common stock of BOET in exchange for the
Corporation's Series E Preferred Stock ($11.1 million). Effective May
3, 1993, the Corporation acquired the remaining outstanding common
stock of BOET in exchange for the Corporation's Series E Preferred
Stock ($10.8 million).
(d) Maryville was a mutual savings bank which, pursuant to a
conversion/acquisition, converted to a federal stock charter. All of
the stock of Maryville was acquired by the Corporation in exchange for
a capital contribution equalling approximately $14.1 million derived
in part from the proceeds of a public offering of the Corporation's
Common Stock made in connection with the conversion/acquisition.
(e) FSB is the parent company of First State Bank of Fayette County
(Somerville).
(f) Merged into UPNB.

NM -- Not meaningful.

Intangibles are being amortized primarily using the straight line
method over periods ranging from 10 to 15 years. The amortization for the
Metropolitan intangibles was accelerated in both 1992 and 1993 due to
unexpected deposit run-off. The fair market value of the net assets of
Fidelity at the date of acquisition exceeded the purchase price resulting in
negative goodwill of approximately $16 million which was deducted from the
noncurrent, nonmonetary assets (primarily premises and equipment) of Fidelity.
The recording of the acquisition of Maryville

11
<PAGE> 13
resulted in negative goodwill of approximately $9.4 million, $8.1 million of
which was deducted from noncurrent, nonmonetary assets (premises and equipment,
fair value adjustment of loans, prepaid software, and mortgage servicing
rights). The remaining negative goodwill of $1.3 million was recorded in other
liabilities and is being accreted over seven years.

The following unaudited pro forma information summarizes the effect of
the above described acquisitions assuming consummation of each transaction on
January 1, 1992. The unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily
representative of the actual results that would have occurred or which may
occur in the future had the transactions been effected on January 1, 1992. The
pro forma information does not include the historical results of Metropolitan
since it was a failed financial institution.

</TABLE>

(a) Two subsidiaries of the Corporation assumed approximately $14 million of
deposits (including accrued interest) and acquired assets (primarily loans)
from the Resolution Trust Corporation and simultaneously sold certain loans
to a third party.

SALES OF BRANCHES

In the third quarter of 1993, the Corporation sold four of the
Kentucky branches (three in Paducah and one in Clinton) of its subsidiary,
Security Trust. The Corporation has also entered into a definitive agreement
to sell the two remaining Kentucky branches of Security Trust. The sales
involved approximately $105 million of deposits, approximately $3 million of
loans, and approximately $1 million of premises and equipment. The
transactions are not considered significant to the Corporation's balance sheet
or operating results and are expected to result in a reduction of Security
Trust's goodwill and purchased mortgage servicing rights.

SUBSEQUENT SALE

Effective September 1, 1994, the Corporation sold all the deposits and
certain loans of Steiner Bank, an approximately $24 million bank subsidiary
located in Birmingham, Alabama. The gain resulting from the sale is not
significant to the Corporation's results of operations. Subsequent to the
sale, the remaining

13
<PAGE> 15
assets and liabilities of Steiner Bank were transferred to the Corporation, and
Steiner Bank ceased its operations.

SUBSEQUENT REORGANIZATION OF UNION PLANTERS NATIONAL BANK (UPNB)

Incidental to a corporate reorganization of UPNB, as of July 1, 1994,
the Corporation formed four new bank subsidiaries, Union Planters Bank of East
Tennessee, National Association; Union Planters Bank of Middle Tennessee,
National Association; Union Planters Bank of Chattanooga, National Association;
and Union Planters Bank of Jackson, National Association (collectively the
Regional Banks). The Corporation injected equity of $101.7 million in the
Regional Banks with a majority of the funds ($98 million) having been provided
by a dividend from UPNB (Note 12). Each of the Regional Banks acquired from
UPNB, at book value, substantially all of the assets and assumed all of the
liabilities of the UPNB branches located in its region. The establishment of
these branches into separate banks will permit a local management team and
board of directors to focus on the needs and opportunities within the local
market and is consistent with the Corporation's community bank philosophy.
UPNB will continue to operate branches in the Memphis, Tennessee area. The
separation of the branches held by UPNB had no material impact on the
consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation.

PENDING ACQUISITIONS

</TABLE>

For the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Corporation had
gross realized gains of $5,205,000 and $13,788,000, respectively, and gross
realized losses of $473,000 and $425,000, respectively.

15
<PAGE> 17
Investment securities having a carrying value of approximately $598
million and $512 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, were
pledged to secure public and trust funds on deposit and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase.

During 1993, the Corporation transferred $315 million of securities
held for investment to the held for sale portfolio. The transfers were made
because of regulatory concerns regarding certain securities, the restructure of
the portfolios of certain financial institutions acquired, and in anticipation
of the adoption of SFAS No. 115.

PORTFOLIO RESTRUCTURING SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 31, 1994

During the third quarter of 1994, the Corporation restructured a
portion of its available for sale investment securities portfolio which is
expected to result in the sale of securities of approximately $440 million. The
sales are expected to result in net investment securities losses of
approximately $7.2 million (approximately $4.5 million after tax). The losses
expected to be incurred have already been recognized on the Corporation's
balance sheet as a reduction of shareholders' equity under SFAS No. 115,
adopted January 1, 1994. The restructuring was done to increase the book
yields in the investment portfolio, and the increased future earnings are
expected to offset the losses over a shorter time period than the original
maturity of the securities being sold.

The weighted average yields are calculated by dividing the sum of the
individual security yield weights (effective yield times book value) by the
total book value of the securities. The taxable-equivalent yield gives effect
to the disallowance of interest expense, for federal income tax purposes,
related to certain tax-free securities. The maturities of mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations have not been adjusted for
prepayments, and generally represent obligations which are expected to have
principal weighted averages of five years or less or are variable rate
instruments.

In the fourth quarter of 1992, UPNB consummated the restructuring of a
troubled loan to another financial institution. UPNB had previously received
certain notes, equity securities, and other rights from the borrower in
exchange for a nonaccrual and partially charged-off loan. Subsequently, UPNB
liquidated the notes and equity securities and exercised contractual rights
which resulted in a recovery of $7 million in principal previously charged-off
and realized pretax gains of approximately $901,000 and $3.5 million in 1993
and 1992, respectively.

Total interest earned on nonaccrual and restructured loans in 1993 and
1992 was $1,238,000 and $2,233,000, respectively. Interest income that would
have been earned under the original terms of these loans in 1993 and 1992 was
$1,947,000 and $2,695,000, respectively. There were no significant outstanding
commitments related to the above restructured loans at December 31, 1993.

Certain of the Corporation's bank subsidiaries, principally UPNB, have
granted loans to the Corporation's directors, executive officers, and their
affiliates. These loans were made on substantially the same terms, including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with unrelated persons and do not involve more than normal risks
of collectibility. The aggregate dollar amount of these loans was $33,065,000
and $35,145,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. During 1993,
$141,144,000 of new loans and advances under credit lines were made to
directors, executive officers, and their affiliates; repayments totaled
approximately $143,224,000.

NOTE 9. FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES AND LONG-TERM DEBT

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK (FHLB) ADVANCES

The Corporation's banking and thrift subsidiaries obtained in 1993
various advances from the FHLB totaling $180.0 million at December 31, 1993,
under Blanket Agreements for Advances and Security Agreements (the Agreements).
Advances from the FHLB totaled $15.0 million at December 31, 1992. The
Agreements entitle the Corporation's subsidiaries to borrow funds from the FHLB
to fund mortgage loan programs and satisfy other funding needs. Of the amounts
borrowed at December 31, 1993, $136 million were at variable rates and $44
million were at fixed rates with interest rates ranging from 3.2% to 8.0% and
maturities ranging from 1997 to 2017. At December 31, 1993, FHLB advances that
mature within one year, one to five years, and after five years were $14.1
million, $33.0 million, and $132.9 million, respectively. The value of
collateral (primarily mortgage loans) under the Agreements must be 150% of the
$180.0 million outstanding at December 31, 1993.

In October 1993, the Corporation filed a shelf registration statement
for $150 million of the Corporation's subordinated debt securities. On
November 2, 1993, the Corporation issued $75 million of 6.25% Subordinated
Capital Notes due 2003 (6.25% Notes) at 99.305%. Interest on the 6.25% Notes
is payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1. The 6.25% Notes are not
redeemable prior to maturity and will mature on November 1, 2003. The 6.25%
Notes are

20
<PAGE> 22
subordinated to all present and future senior indebtedness of the Corporation
and payment may be accelerated only in the case of the bankruptcy of the
Corporation. Debt issuance costs of $838,000 are included in other assets and
are being amortized over a ten year life. The 6.25% Notes qualify for Tier 2
capital under regulatory risk-based capital guidelines. The Corporation also
entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $50
million to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt to a floating LIBOR rate
for two and one-half years.

In October 1992, the Corporation completed a public offering of $40.25
million of 8 1/2% Subordinated Notes (8 1/2% Notes). The 8 1/2% Notes mature
on October 1, 2002, and interest is payable quarterly. Debt issuance costs of
$1.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 1993 and 1992 are
included in other assets and are being amortized over a seven-year life. The 8
1/2% Notes are unsecured debt obligations of the Corporation and are
subordinated in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of the Corporation.
The Corporation, at its option, may redeem the 8 1/2% Notes on or after October
1, 1997, at par value plus accrued interest, upon 30 days notice. The
Corporation is obligated to repay 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
interest, up to an aggregate amount of $1 million, of 8 1/2% Notes tendered for
prepayment by the personal representatives of deceased holders in any one year.

The 10 1/8% Subordinated Capital Debentures (10 1/8% Debentures) were
issued in a public offering in 1989. In November 1993, the Corporation used
approximately $39 million of the net proceeds of the 6.25% Notes to
in-substance defease the 10 1/8% Debentures. Direct obligations of the U.S.
Government were purchased and placed in an irrevocable trust which provides
cash flows matching the principal and interest debt service required to retire
the 10 1/8% Debentures. At December 31, 1993, the outstanding balance of the
10 1/8% Debentures totaled $34 million which is not reflected in the
accompanying financial statements. This transaction resulted in an
extraordinary loss in the fourth quarter of 1993 of $5.2 million ($3.2 million
net of taxes).

Annual principal repayment requirements for long-term debt for the
years 1994 through 1998 are $628,000, $466,000, $305,000, $273,000, and
$296,000, respectively.

LINE OF CREDIT

In June 1993, the Corporation entered into an unsecured $25 million
credit agreement which expires May 31, 1996. No borrowings were outstanding at
December 31, 1993. The line of credit is for working capital purposes and as a
commercial paper backup. The credit agreement contains performance
measurements and restrictive covenants relating to dividends, acquisitions,
sale of assets, and indebtedness which the Corporation must meet. The
Corporation's dividends are restricted to no more than 60% of consolidated net
earnings for the preceding fiscal year.

SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK (SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS PLAN). In 1989, the
Board of Directors of the Corporation adopted a Share Purchase Rights Plan and
distributed a dividend of one Preferred Share Purchase Right (Right) for each
outstanding share of the Corporation's $5 par value Common Stock and for each
share issued thereafter. The Rights are generally designed to deter coercive
takeover tactics and to encourage all persons interested in acquiring control
of the Corporation to deal with each shareholder on a fair and equal basis.
Each Right trades in tandem with its respective share of common stock until the
occurrence of certain events, in which case it would separate from the common
stock and entitle the registered holder, subject to the terms of the Rights
Agreement, to purchase certain equity securities at a price below their market
value. The Corporation has authorized 250,000 shares of Series A Preferred
Stock for issuance under the Share Purchase Rights Plan, none of which have
been issued.

SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK. The Corporation issued 44,000 shares of
$8.00 Nonredeemable, Cumulative, Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B (Series
B Preferred Stock), $100 per share liquidation value, in a private transaction
in connection with the acquisition of Steiner Bank in 1989. Such shares bear a
dividend rate of $8.00 per share per annum; dividends are cumulative and are
payable quarterly. The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock have the
right, at their option, after November 30, 1994, (and in limited circumstances
prior thereto) to convert each share into 7.722 shares (339,768 shares in
total) of the Corporation's Common Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is not
subject to any sinking fund provisions and has no preemptive rights. Holders
of Series B Preferred Stock have no voting rights except as may be required by
law and in certain other limited circumstances.

22
<PAGE> 24
SERIES D PREFERRED STOCK. In July 1992, in connection with the
acquisition of SBI (see Note 2), the Corporation issued 253,655 shares of 9.5%
Redeemable, Cumulative, Convertible Preferred Stock, Series D (Series D
Preferred Stock) in a private offering. Such shares have no par value but have
a stated value of $20.50 per share on which dividends accrue at 9.5% per annum.
Dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly. Such shares have a liquidation
preference of $20.50 per share plus unpaid dividends accrued thereon and, at
the Corporation's option, with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, are
subject to redemption by the Corporation at any time and from time to time on
or after July 1, 1995. At any time prior to redemption, each share of Series D
Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of
the Corporation's Common Stock. Holders of the Series D Preferred Stock have
no voting rights except as may be required by law and in certain other limited
circumstances.

SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK. In February 1992, the Corporation completed
a public offering of 2,200,000 shares of 8% Cumulative, Convertible Preferred
Stock, Series E (Series E Preferred Stock). Such shares have a stated value of
$25 per share, on which dividends accrue at a rate of 8% per annum; dividends
are cumulative and are payable quarterly. The Series E Preferred Stock is not
subject to any sinking fund provisions and has no preemptive rights. Such
shares have a liquidation preference of $25 per share plus unpaid dividends
accrued thereon, and with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, may be
redeemed by the Corporation in whole or in part at any time after March 31,
1997 at $25.00 per share. At any time prior to redemption, each share of
Series E Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1.25
shares of the Corporation's Common Stock. Holders of Series E Preferred Stock
have no voting rights except for those provided by law and in certain other
limited circumstances.

On January 1, 1993, the Corporation acquired an additional 43.93% of
Bank of East Tennessee (BOET) in exchange for 331,741 shares of the
Corporation's Series E Preferred Stock. The Corporation acquired the remaining
outstanding stock of BOET on May 3, 1993 in exchange for an additional 317,045
shares of Series E Preferred Stock. The Corporation also acquired Erin Bank &
Trust Company in exchange for 259,736 shares of Series E Preferred Stock on
June 1, 1993. See Note 2 for additional information regarding these
acquisitions.

SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK. In August 1991, the Corporation completed a
public offering of 690,000 shares of 10 3/8% Increasing Rate, Redeemable,
Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C (Series C Preferred Stock). The Series C
Preferred Stock has a stated value of $25 per share. Dividends are cumulative
and payable quarterly at a rate of $.648 per quarter increasing to $.680
beginning November 1, 1994, to $.711 beginning November 1, 1995, and to $.742
beginning November 1, 1996. The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible,
is not subject to any sinking fund provisions, and has no preemptive rights.
On or after October 31, 1994, the Corporation may, with the prior approval of
the Federal Reserve, redeem any or all outstanding Series C Preferred Stock at
$25 per

23
<PAGE> 25
share plus all dividends accrued and unpaid to the date fixed for redemption.
Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock have no voting rights except as may be
required by law and except in certain other limited circumstances.

The Corporation plans to redeem all of the outstanding Series C
Preferred Stock on October 31, 1994. Approval from the Federal Reserve has
been received to redeem the stock.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

The Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the Plan)
authorizes the issuance of 500,000 shares of authorized but previously unissued
common stock to shareholders who choose to invest all or a portion of their
cash dividends or make optional cash purchases. On certain investment dates,
shares may be purchased with reinvested dividends and optional cash payments at
a price of 95% and 100%, respectively, of their fair market value, without
brokerage commissions. Shares issued under this Plan totaled 68,188, 93,407,
and 95,029 shares in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT

In 1987, the Corporation entered into an agreement with Santa Cruz
Resources, Inc. (SCR) under which SCR would acquire up to 21% of the
Corporation's Common Shares. SCR ultimately acquired 2,963,000 of the
Corporation's common shares. The agreement imposed several restrictions on

shares and released SCR from the agreement.

NOTE 12. RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS AND LOANS FROM SUBSIDIARIES

The amount of dividends which the Corporation's subsidiaries may pay
is limited by applicable laws and regulations. For the subsidiary national
banks, regulatory approval is required if dividends declared in any year exceed
net earnings of the current year (as defined under the National Bank Act) plus
retained net profits for the preceding two years. The payment of dividends by
state bank subsidiaries is regulated by applicable laws in Alabama, Arkansas,
Mississippi, Kentucky, and Tennessee and the regulations of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The payment of dividends by savings and loan
subsidiaries (see Note 2) is subject to the regulations of the Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS).

The Corporation has adopted for its state-chartered bank subsidiaries
internal dividend policies that have received approval from the various state
banking commissioners, subject to restrictions. The current policy for
Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi subsidiary banks requires a minimum ratio of
7% tangible equity capital (equity less goodwill and other intangibles) to
tangible assets and paying dividends only equal to the excess without prior
approval. The internal policy adopted for Tennessee banks requires a 6%
tangible equity capital to tangible assets ratio and a 7% tangible primary
capital (tangible equity plus the allowance for losses on loans) to tangible
assets ratio be

26
<PAGE> 28
maintained by the subsidiaries. The policy approved for the Corporation's
Kentucky operations is the same as Tennessee, except Kentucky requires the use
of Tier 1 capital instead of tangible equity and average quarterly assets
instead of period end assets.

At January 1, 1994, the banking subsidiaries could have paid dividends
to the Corporation aggregating $86.2 million, excluding the MSB acquisition
consummated January 1, 1994, without prior regulatory approval. The actual
amount of dividends paid will be limited to a lesser amount by management in
order to maintain compliance with capital guidelines and to maintain strong
capital positions in each of the banking subsidiaries. Future dividends will
be dependent on the level of earnings of the subsidiary financial institutions.

Subsequent to December 31, 1993 and in connection with the
"Reorganization of UPNB" (Note 2), UPNB requested permission and received
approval to pay a special dividend incidental to the formation of four new
banks. The special dividend of $98 million was paid on July 1, 1994. This
dividend substantially reduced the amounts available to the Corporation as
dividends from the Corporation's subsidiaries.

The Corporation's banking subsidiaries are limited by Federal law in
the amount of credit which they may extend to their affiliates, including the
Corporation. Loans to a single affiliate may not exceed 10%, and loans to all
affiliates may not exceed 20% of an individual bank's net assets plus its
allowance for losses on loans. Such loans must be collateralized by assets
having market values of 100% to 130% of the loan amount depending on the nature
of the collateral.

NOTE 13. SIGNIFICANT OPERATING BUSINESS LINES

The Corporation is primarily engaged in the commercial and retail
banking business. Broker/dealer operations formerly constituted a significant
portion of the Corporation's business.

In the fourth quarter of 1990, the broker/dealer operations, formerly
conducted by Union Planters Investment Bankers Corporation and its subsidiaries
(UPIBC), were restructured, and on January 2, 1991, the Corporation became a
limited partner in Vining-Sparks IBG, Limited Partnership (VSIBG) with
Vining-Sparks Securities, Inc. (VSS). VSIBG engages in securities
broker/dealer activities of the types formerly carried on by VSS and UPIBC.
The Corporation transferred the Capital Markets and SBA Loan Trading Operations
of UPIBC to UPNB, and they now function as part of UPNB's banking operations.
The broker/dealer operations are now limited to the Corporation's passive
investment in VSIBG which is included in other assets at $5.5 million and $5.2
million, respectively, at December 31, 1993 and 1992. The Corporation's
proportionate share of earnings (29%) from VSIBG is included in other
noninterest income.

In 1992 and 1991, UPIBC incurred litigation expenses and provided for
litigation settlements totaling $8.6 million and

27
<PAGE> 29
$11.3 million, respectively, arising from its restructured operations. A
significant portion of that litigation has now been settled.

Revenues from the broker/dealer operations were $3.6 million, $3.9
million, and $2.0 million, respectively, in 1993, 1992, and 1991. In 1993, the
broker/dealer operations had pretax earnings of $3.4 million compared to pretax
losses of $4.7 million and $9.3 million, respectively, in 1992 and 1991.

Subsequent to December 31, 1993, following a continued decline in
revenues in 1994 in the Capital Markets Operations, management decided to
discontinue these operations at the beginning of the second quarter of 1994.
The discontinuance is not expected to have a significant impact on future
operating results of the Corporation.

purchased mortgage servicing rights due to accelerated prepayments
of the underlying mortgage loans.
(c) One-time expenses related to acquisitions (primarily termination
of an acquired pension plan).

NOTE 15. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

401K RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN. The Corporation's 401K Retirement Savings Plan
(401K Plan) is available to employees having one or more years of service who
work in excess of 1,000 hours a year. Employees may voluntarily contribute 1
to 16 percent of their gross compensation on a pretax basis up to a maximum of
$8,994 in 1993, subject to certain Internal Revenue Service restrictions
(amount may change from year to year based on cost of living index), and the
Corporation makes a matching contribution of 50 to 100 percent of the amounts
contributed by the employee depending upon his or her eligible years of
service. The Corporation's matching contribution is limited to employee
contributions of up to 6% of their compensation. The Corporation's Flexible
Benefit Program allows employees to allocate a portion of their available
benefit dollars to the 401K Plan as additional employer contributions. The
Corporation's contributions to the 401K Plan for 1993, 1992, and 1991 were $1.8
million, $1.6 million, and $1.5 million, respectively.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN AND TRUST. The Employee Stock Ownership Plan and
Trust (ESOP) is noncontributory and covers employees having one or more years
of service who work in excess of 1,000 hours a year. The amounts of
contributions to the ESOP are determined annually by the Board of Directors,
and were $2 million, $1.6 million, and $1.6 million for 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively. At December 31, 1993, the ESOP held 1,068,469 shares of the
Corporation's Common Stock, all of which was allocated to participants.

STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS. Certain employees and directors of the Corporation and
its subsidiaries are eligible to receive options or restricted stock grants
under the 1992 Stock Incentive Plan (1992 Plan). A maximum of 1,600,000 shares
of the Corporation's Common Stock may be issued through the exercise of
nonstatutory or incentive stock options and as restricted stock awards. The
option price is the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant.
Options granted generally become exercisable in installments of 20% each year
beginning one year from date of grant. The 1992 Plan replaced the 1983 Stock
Incentive Plan which had essentially the same provisions as the 1992 Plan. The
1983 Plan expired March 9, 1993; however, options issued through that date
continue to be outstanding and exercisable under the terms of the grants.
Additional information, with respect to stock options issued under the 1983 and
1992 Plans, is as follows:

Exercise prices ranged from $6.88 to $28.00 in 1993 and from $6.88 to
$24.00 in 1992.

Prior to pooling, BNF BANCORP, Inc. had outstanding options of 121,487
and 127,237 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The options for
employees were granted in 1986 and 1992 under two separate plans, and options
for directors were granted under a single plan in 1992. Options exercisable
were 117,688 and 102,863 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Exercise
prices ranged from $6.35 to $11.79 during 1993 and 1992. During 1994, 71,737
options were exercised prior to the consummation of the merger. The remaining
49,750 options of BNF were converted to 53,630 equivalent options of the
Corporation as part of the acquisition.

RETIREE HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE. The Corporation provides certain
health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees who have completed
twenty years of unbroken full-time service immediately prior to retirement and
who have attained age 60 or more. Health care benefits are provided partially
through an insurance company (for retirees age 65 or more) and partially
through direct payment of claims. Prior to January 1, 1993, health care
premiums and claims and life insurance benefits ($2,500 per claim) were
recognized as expense when paid. In 1992 and 1991, retiree health care and
life insurance costs were $390,000 and $336,000, respectively.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 106 which
requires that retiree health care and life insurance benefits be charged to
expense during the years in which the employee renders service. The
Corporation elected to recognize the accumulated benefit obligation in the
first quarter of 1993 which approximated $8.3 million ($5.1 million after tax).
The current expense for 1993 was $632,000.

Postretirement benefit cost (in thousands) for 1993 was determined
assuming a discount rate of 8% and an expected return on plan assets of 5%:

<PAGE> 32
The assumed discount rate used to measure the APBO was 7% at December
31, 1993 and 8% at January 1, 1993. The weighted average health care cost
trend rate in 1993 is 13%, gradually declining to an ultimate rate in 2001 of
5%. A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend
rates for each future year would have increased the aggregate of the service
and interest cost components of the 1993 net periodic postretirement benefit
cost by $109,000 and would have increased the APBO as of December 31, 1993 by
$858,000.

The Corporation established a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary
Association (VEBA) and through December 31, 1993, has made contributions into
such VEBA of $5.7 million, the maximum amount deductible for federal income tax
purposes. The VEBA is expected to earn 5% on trust assets consisting of U.S.
Government obligations, bank obligations, commercial instruments, and
repurchase agreements secured by U.S. Treasury obligations. Additional
contributions will be made to the VEBA annually which will be the source of
funding for future postretirement benefits.

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. The Corporation also adopted SFAS No. 112 as of
January 1, 1993, which requires that such costs be charged to expense over the
relevant service period. The Corporation's analysis determined this liability
to be $1.3 million ($807,000 net of tax benefit thereon) at January 1, 1993,
consisting primarily of postemployment medical claims and related
administrative expenses in excess of expected premiums to be paid by employees.
The liability amount was adjusted to $600,000 at December 31, 1993, due to a
significant decrease in 1993 claims. The liability amount will be reviewed
annually and adjusted as management may deem necessary based on actual
experience. Annual expenses for these benefits are not expected to vary
significantly from the amounts which have previously been expensed as incurred.

ACQUIRED INSTITUTIONS. Certain of the financial institutions acquired sponsor
various employee benefit and retirement plans. Such plans have been or are in
the process of being terminated and the employees now participate in the
aforementioned Corporation plans. At December 31, 1993, certain institutions
acquired in 1993 still have outstanding plans, including defined benefit
pension plans, 401K plans and ESOPs. The liabilities, if any, for such
terminations have been recorded as of December 31, 1993.

The change in the deferred tax asset during the year is a result of
the changes in methods of accounting discussed in Note 1, the addition of
deferred tax assets of acquired companies, and current period deferred tax
expense of $816,000, which includes $805,000 deferred tax benefit attributable
to the increase in the federal income tax rate and $1,520,000 deferred tax
benefit from legislated changes in the treatment of intangible assets. The
realization of a portion of the deferred tax asset is based upon management's
conclusion that future operating profits will generate sufficient taxable
income to offset the related deductions and loss carryforwards.

Income tax expense as a percent of earnings before income taxes is

Income tax expense applicable to securities transactions was $1.8
million for 1993, $5.2 million for 1992, and $1.9 million for 1991.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 109. The
impact of the cumulative tax effect of this change in accounting method was
$10.9 million. Reference is made to Note 1 for further discussion of
accounting changes.

NOTE 17. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Corporation is a party to
various types of financial instruments in order to meet the financing needs of
its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest
rate risk and are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. For certain instruments, the exposure to credit loss is limited to
the contractual amount of the instrument. The following table presents the
contractual amounts of this type of instrument.

<TABLE>

Standby, commercial, and similar letters of credit . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26 37
</TABLE>

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to
customers for specific purposes, at specific rates, with fixed expiration and
review dates if the conditions in the agreement are met. Since many of the
commitments normally expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment
amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Corporation
subjects such activity to the same credit quality and monitoring controls as
its lending activities. Collateral held, if any, varies but may include
accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, income producing
properties, or securities.

33
<PAGE> 35
Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the
Corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The
credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as
that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Corporation in
some cases holds various types of collateral to support those commitments for
which collateral is deemed necessary.

Other off-balance-sheet instruments entered into are forward and
futures contracts, interest rate swap agreements, and commitments to purchase
or sell when-issued securities. The following table presents the notional
amounts of these types of instruments.

OF ACTUAL CREDIT RISK
Forward and futures contracts $ 38 $20
Interest rate swap agreements 300 --
When-issued securities
Commitments to sell 56 44
Commitments to purchase 87 73
</TABLE>

Forward contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or
money market instruments in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a
specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield.
Risks arise from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms
of their contracts and from movements in securities values and interest rates.
The Corporation utilizes short-term forward commitments to deliver mortgages to
protect the Corporation against rate changes which could impact the value of
mortgage originations to be securitized or otherwise sold to investors. Such
commitments to deliver mortgages generally have maturities of 90 days or less.

An interest rate swap generally involves the exchange of fixed for
floating rate interest payment streams on a specified notional principal amount
of assets or liabilities for an agreed upon period of time without the exchange
of the underlying principal amounts. Notional principal amounts often are used
to express the volume of these transactions, but the amounts potentially
subject to credit risk are much smaller. During the fourth quarter of 1993,
the Corporation entered into the following interest rate swap agreements which
are used to manage its interest-rate risk. The Corporation receives fixed rate
payments and pays variable rate payments.

The Corporation has a policy for its derivative products, including
interest rate swaps, which has been approved and is monitored by the Funds
Management Committee and the Board of Directors. The policy establishes
individual positions for derivative products not to exceed $100 million
notional amount and that open positions in the aggregate will not exceed 10% of
consolidated total assets. Any exceptions to the policy must be approved by
the Board of Directors. The open positions are reviewed

34
<PAGE> 36
monthly by the Funds Management Committee to determine compliance with
established policies. As of September 1, 1994, there are no positions which
would be regarded as an exception under the Corporation's policy.

The Corporation entered into the interest-rate swaps to convert
specific assets (loans and investment securities) from floating-rate to
fixed-rate instruments and to convert a liability from a fixed rate to a
floating rate. The Corporation is the end-user on all interest-rate swaps and
does not act as a dealer in these instruments. A summary of the Corporation's
interest-rate swaps follows:

</TABLE>

(a) The variable rates paid are tied to the three-month LIBOR rate for the
loans and six month LIBOR rate for the investment securities and long-term
debt swaps. The variable rates are based on specific indices specified by
the applicable contracts. The next repricing dates for the variable rates
paid for the loans, investment securities and long-term debt are July 1994,
December 1994, and November 1994, respectively.

(b) If the LIBOR rate at January 5, 1996 should be equal to or less than
5.3125%, these swaps will mature on January 5, 1996.

When-issued securities are commitments to either purchase or sell
securities that have not yet been issued. The trades are contingent upon the
actual issuance of the security. These transactions represent conditional
commitments made by the Corporation, and risk arises from the possible
inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from
movements in securities values and interest rates.

As part of its mortgage banking operations, the Corporation services
residential real estate loans. In its capacity as servicer of these loans, the
Corporation is responsible for foreclosure and the related costs of
foreclosure. These costs are expensed as incurred and are shown as servicing
foreclosure expense in other noninterest expense.

In the normal course of business, the Corporation sells mortgage loans
and makes certain limited representations and warranties to the purchaser.
Management does not expect any significant losses to arise from these
representations and warranties.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. Through its subsidiary banks in
Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama, the Corporation grants
commercial, agricultural, residential, and consumer loans to customers
throughout those states. The amount and percentage of total loans outstanding
by the state in which the subsidiaries were headquartered at December 31, 1993
were as follows: Tennessee $2.4 billion (77%), Arkansas $281 million (9%),
Mississippi $254 million (8%), and Alabama $170 million (6%). Although the
Corporation has

35
<PAGE> 37
a diversified loan portfolio, the ability of its debtors to honor their
contracts is to some extent dependent upon economic conditions found throughout
the above states and the surrounding areas.

NOTE 18. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

instruments are summarized as follows:

</TABLE>

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Corporation in
estimating the fair value for financial instruments:

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. The carrying amount for cash and cash
equivalents approximates the fair value of the assets.

INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND INVESTMENT
SECURITIES. Fair values of these instruments are based on quoted market
prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair
values are based on the quoted values of similar instruments.

TRADING ACCOUNT SECURITIES. These instruments are carried in the
consolidated balance sheet at values which approximate their fair value based
on quoted market prices of similar instruments.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE. These instruments are carried in the
consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or market. The fair value of
these instruments is based on subsequent liquidation values of the instruments
which did not result in any significant gains or losses.

LOANS. The fair values of loans are estimated using discounted cash
flow analyses, and using interest rates currently

36
<PAGE> 38
being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit
quality and risk.

DEMAND DEPOSITS. The fair values of these instruments (i.e., checking
accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, and NOW accounts)
are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date
(i.e., their carrying amount).

TIME DEPOSITS. The fair values of time deposits (i.e., certificates
of deposit, IRAs, investment savings, etc.) are estimated using a discounted
cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on
these instruments to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on
time deposits.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. The carrying amount of short-term borrowings
(i.e., federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase,
commercial paper, and other short-term borrowings) approximates their fair
values.

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES. The fair value of these advances is
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, and using the FHLB quoted rates
of borrowing for advances with similar terms.

LONG-TERM DEBT. The fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted
market prices for the Corporation's publicly traded debt.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCING INSTRUMENTS. Fair values of
off-balance-sheet instruments are based on current settlement values (forward
contracts); quoted market prices (interest rate swaps); and current market
values for when-issued securities. The fair value of interest rate swaps
represents the gross unrealized gain in these contracts. The fair value of
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit (see Note 17) are not
presented, since management believes the fair value to be insignificant as the
instruments are expected to expire unused and the fees charged on such
instruments are not significant.

NOTE 19. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Corporation and/or various subsidiaries are parties to various
pending civil actions, all of which are being defended vigorously, and which
are described below. Additionally, the Corporation and/or its subsidiaries are
parties to various legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of
business. Management is of the opinion, based upon present information,
including evaluations of outside counsel, that neither the Corporation's
financial position, results of operations, nor liquidity will be materially
affected by the ultimate resolution of any of the pending or threatened legal
proceedings.

In 1988, the Corporation rescinded and terminated a purported
agreement for the acquisition of a Louisiana bank holding company, Great
American Corporation (GAC). The Corporation and a subsidiary were made parties
to several civil actions relating to the failed

37
<PAGE> 39
acquisition. In the second quarter of 1993 consummation of the settlement of
all pending civil actions involving the Corporation and a subsidiary arising
from the attempted acquisition of GAC was effected. The costs of such
settlement did not exceed amounts previously reserved for such purpose.

UPNB, a member of the MasterCard and VISA organizations, was a
co-defendant or cross-claim defendant in two related civil actions arising out
of its previous utilization of a third party, Electronic Transaction Network,
Inc.(E-Net), to solicit and assist in the administration of credit card
transaction processing arrangements with several thousand consumer merchants
located throughout the United States. During the third quarter of 1993, a
definitive agreement was entered into for the settlement of all pending
litigation against UPNB in connection with its former relationship with E-Net,
without the payment of any sum by UPNB.

The Corporation's former broker/dealer subsidiaries are among the more
than 80 defendants in various lawsuits consolidated in a Louisiana Federal
District Court alleging violations of Federal and other securities laws in
connection with the 1986 underwriting and subsequent sale of $400 million of
housing revenue bonds issued by the Health, Educational, and Housing Facility
Board of the City of Memphis, Tennessee, as well as the underwriting and sale
of seven other taxable municipal bond issues. Substantially all of the
proceeds of the sale of these bonds were placed in guaranteed investment
contracts with Executive Life Insurance Company. The bonds were rated AAA by
Standard & Poors at the time of issuance, and maintained such rating until
January, 1990, when the bonds were downgraded. The market price of the bonds
has since declined significantly. One of such subsidiaries participated in the
underwriting of the Memphis issue and is a defendant in purported class claims
based on that issue. Several individual actions against these subsidiaries
alleging violations in secondary market sales of such issues have been
consolidated in the litigation. During the third quarter of 1994, most of the
representatives of the plaintiffs in the various class actions agreed in
principle to settle all claims against the underwriting participants. Such
settlement has been given tentative approval by the Court, and is subject to a
number of preconditions, including final approval by the Court. Notice of the
settlement will be distributed to all members of the putative plaintiff classes
and such class members have been given the right to opt out of the settlement
agreement and continue to pursue claims against the underwriters. A small
number of class members have already indicated their intent to do so. However,
should such opt-out claims reach a certain threshold, the underwriting
defendants may withdraw their settlement offer. All of the individual
secondary market suits against the Corporation's subsidiaries that were
consolidated in the litigation have been resolved or are subject to agreements
to settle. The remaining claim asserted against such subsidiaries is in
arbitration and involves a $100,000 par value sale.

Certain subsidiaries of the Corporation were threatened in 1989 with a
civil action by the FDIC for the estate of a closed savings association. If
filed, the action would reportedly seek

38
<PAGE> 40
compensatory damages of at least $37 million, and other relief including an
injunction against transferring or encumbering any assets until any judgments
have been paid, based upon allegations of wrongdoing in the sale of covered
call options to the closed savings association. An agreement between all
parties to the threatened action providing for the forebearance of the filing
of such action and the tolling of applicable statutes of limitation, entered
into in 1989, continues in effect. The Corporation has furnished the FDIC with
information assertedly demonstrating the lack of merit in the threatened action
and believes that such action, if nevertheless filed, can be resolved without
material loss.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Union Planters Corporation

In our opinion, based on our audits, the accompanying supplementary
consolidated balance sheet and the related supplementary consolidated
statements of earnings, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Union Planters
Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Corporation's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note 1 to the supplementary consolidated financial
statements, in 1993 the Corporation adopted three new accounting standards that
changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits, postemployment
benefits and income taxes.

As described in Note 2 to the supplementary consolidated financial
statements, Union Planters Corporation merged with BNF BANCORP, Inc. on
September 1, 1994, in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests.
The accompanying supplementary consolidated financial statements give
retroactive effect to the acquisition of BNF BANCORP, Inc. by Union Planters
Corporation.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. The foregoing financial
statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, all
adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements have been included. June
30, 1993 interim financial statements and financial information have been
restated for 1993 acquisitions subsequent to June 30 accounted for as poolings
of interests. Additionally, 1994 first quarter financial statements and
financial information have been restated for second quarter 1994 acquisitions
accounted for as poolings of interests.

As discussed in the Corporation's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders,
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," was adopted effective January 1,
1994.

The accounting policies followed by Union Planters Corporation and its
subsidiaries (the Corporation) for interim financial reporting are consistent
with the accounting policies followed for annual financial reporting except as
noted below. The notes included herein should be read in conjunction with the
notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's
1993 Annual Report to Shareholders. Certain 1993 amounts have been
reclassified to be consistent with the 1994 financial reporting presentation.

NOTE 2. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

POOLINGS OF INTERESTS

During the first six months of 1994, the Corporation completed three
acquisitions and in 1993 completed four acquisitions which were accounted for
using the pooling of interests method of accounting. The table below summarizes

The consolidated financial statements for 1993 and 1994 include the
results of the institutions acquired in 1993. The results of institutions
acquired in 1994 are included in the consolidated financial statements for
1994; however, prior year amounts have not been restated due to immateriality.
Eliminations have been made for material intercompany transactions with the
pooled companies. The 1994 acquisitions contributed approximately $1,550,000,
$232,000, and $402,000 to 1994 net interest income, noninterest income, and net
earnings, respectively, of the Corporation through their respective dates of
acquisition.

PURCHASE ACQUISITIONS

The Corporation acquired eight institutions in 1993 and two in the first
six months of 1994 which were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. The table below summarizes these acquisitions:

(a) The Corporation previously held 17.93% of the common stock of BOET ($3.4
million). On January 1, 1993, the Corporation purchased an additional
43.93% of the common stock of BOET in exchange for the Corporation's
Series E Preferred Stock ($11.1 million). Effective May 3, 1993, the
Corporation acquired the remaining common stock of BOET in exchange for
the Corporation's Series E Preferred Stock ($10.8 million).

(b) Maryville was a mutual savings bank which, pursuant to a conversion
acquisition, converted to a federal stock charter. All of the stock of
Maryville was acquired by the Corporation in exchange for a capital
contribution equalling approximately $14.1 million derived in part from
the proceeds of a public offering of the Corporation's Common Stock made
in connection with the conversion/acquisition.

(c) FSB is the parent company of First State Bank of Fayette County
(Somerville).

(d) Assets and liabilities at date of acquisition were transferred to UPNB.

(e) Subject to adjustment.

(f) Two subsidiaries of the Corporation assumed approximately $14 million of
deposits (including accrued interest) and acquired assets (primarily
loans) from the Resolution Trust Corporation and simultaneously sold
certain loans to a third party.

(g) TBI is the parent company of Tennessee National Bank in Columbia,
Tennessee.

NM -- Not meaningful.

Intangibles are being amortized primarily using the straight line method
over periods ranging from 10 to 15 years. The recording of the acquisition of
Maryville resulted in negative goodwill of approximately $9.4 million, $8.1
million of which was deducted from noncurrent, nonmonetary assets (premises and
equipment, fair value adjustment of loans, prepaid software, and mortgage
servicing rights). The remaining negative goodwill of $1.3 million was recorded
in other liabilities and is being accreted over seven years.

The following unaudited pro forma information summarizes the pro forma
impact of the purchase acquisitions completed during the first six months of
1994 and the pro forma impact of the purchase acquisitions completed in 1993
assuming consummation of all such transactions on January 1, 1993. The
unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily representative of the actual
results that would have occurred or which may occur in the future.

ACQUISITIONS SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 30, 1994

The Corporation has completed three acquisitions subsequent to June 30,
1994: Liberty Bancshares, Inc. (LBI), the parent company of Liberty Federal
Savings Bank located in Paris, Tennessee; Earle Bankshares, Inc. (EBI), the
parent company of First Southern Bank located in Earle, Arkansas; and BNF
BANCORP, Inc. (BNF), the parent company of BANKFIRST, a federal savings bank
located in Decatur, Alabama.

These supplementary financial statements have been restated for 1994 for
all three of these acquisitions. In addition, because BNF is considered a
significant acquisition, the 1993 financial statements have been restated for
BNF's results.

For the six-month periods ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, the Corporation
had gross realized gains on investment securities available for sale of
$581,000 and $2,311,000, respectively, and gross realized losses of $432,000
and $16,000, respectively. For investment securities held to maturity, gross
realized gains for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 were $63,000 and
$1,220,000, respectively, and gross realized losses of $2,000 and $77,000,
respectively. In the first six months of 1994, the gross realized gains and
losses for held to maturity securities resulted from "calls" of securities
prior to scheduled maturity.

Investment securities having a carrying value of approximately $885
million and $598 million at June 30, 1994 and December 31, 1993, respectively,
were pledged to secure public and trust funds on deposit and securities sold
under agreements to repurchase.

As of January 1, 1994 and in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 115,
$1.7 billion of held to maturity securities were transferred to the available
for sale category of securities.

NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES

Applicable income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 1994, were $16.8
million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.7%. Applicable income taxes
for the same period in 1993 were $14.7 million, resulting in an effective tax
rate of 32.7%. The tax expense applicable to investment securities gains for
the six months ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 was $82,000 and $1,305,000,
respectively.

At June 30, 1994, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset of $50.8
million recorded in other assets compared to $35.6 million at June 30, 1993,
and $39.6 million at December 31, 1993.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 115
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." Reference
is made to Note 1 of the Corporation's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders for
further discussion. The impact of SFAS No. 115 at June 30, 1994 was to increase
the cumulative net deferred tax asset by $8.7 million.

NOTE 8. FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK (FHLB) ADVANCES

The Corporation's subsidiaries have obtained various advances from the
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) totaling $193.4 million at June 30, 1994, under
Blanket Agreements for Advances and Security Agreements (the Agreements). The
Agreements entitle the Corporation's subsidiaries to borrow funds from the FHLB
to fund mortgage loan programs and satisfy other funding needs. Interest rates
on the advances vary from fixed rate advances to variable rate advances. The
majority of the advances at June 30, 1994, had variable rates tied to the
three-month LIBOR rate. Maturity dates for the advances range from 1994 to
2014. Collateral (mortgage loans) under the Agreements must be 150% of the
advances outstanding, $193.4 million at June 30, 1994.

NOTE 10. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Management is of the opinion that neither the Corporation's financial
position, results of operations, nor liquidity will be materially affected by
the ultimate resolution of pending or threatened legal proceedings. There were
no developments during the second quarter of 1994 in any pending or threatened
legal proceedings which would alter such opinion.

The Corporation and/or various subsidiaries are parties to certain pending
or threatened civil actions which are described in Item 3, Part I of the
Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
1993(10-K), in Note 19 to the Corporation's consolidated financial statements
on page 33 of the 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders, in Note 19 to the
Corporation's 1993 supplementary financial statements filed as Exhibit 99(a) to
the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 19, 1994, and in
Note 10 to the Corporation's quarterly report on Form 10-Q dated March 31,
1994(10-Q). The fifth paragraph of Item 3, Part I of the 10-K describes
certain pending litigation against more than 80 defendants, including the
Corporation's former broker/dealer subsidiaries (now inactive), alleging
violations of Federal and other securities laws in connection with the
underwriting and sale of certain bond issues, substantially all of the proceeds
of which were placed in guaranteed investment contracts issued by Executive
Life Insurance Company. One of such subsidiaries participated in the
underwriting of one of the issues and is a defendant in purported class claims
based on that issue. Several individual actions against these subsidiaries
alleging violations in secondary market sales have been consolidated in the
litigation. During the third quarter of 1994, most of the representatives of
the plaintiffs in the various class actions agreed in principle to settle all
claims against the underwriting participants. Such settlement has been given
tentative approval by the court, and is subject to a number of preconditions,
including final approval by the court. Notice of the settlement will be
distributed to all members of the putative plaintiff classes and such class
members have been given the right to opt out of the settlement agreement and
continue to pursue claims against the underwriters. A small number of class
members have already indicated their intent to do so. However, should such
opt-out claims reach a certain threshold, the underwriting defendants may
withdraw their settlement offer. All of the individual secondary market suits
against the Corporation's subsidiaries that were consolidated in the litigation
have been resolved or are subject to agreements to settle. The remaining claim
asserted against such subsidiaries is in arbitration and involves a $100,000
par value sale. Note 10 to the 10-Q describes certain pending litigation in the
U. S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee against UPNB and
eight other banks alleging violations of the Sherman Act. During the second
quarter of 1994 the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the court's
granting of the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the Sherman Act
claim was denied, and plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals
for the 6th Circuit.
