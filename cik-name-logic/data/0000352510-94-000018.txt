Item 5. Other Events

On March 16, 1994 the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of New York entered a Final Order and
Judgement approving the January 5, 1993 agreement between the
Registrant and plaintiff and a class of all persons and entities
that purchased the common stock of the Registrant during the period
from March 29, 1990 through and including January 24, 1992. The
agreement resulted in the full settlement of the class action
shareholder suit which contained claims regarding the Registrant's
disclosure of its provision and allowance for loan losses. The
agreement called for the creation of a settlement fund of $1.3
million, the majority of which is covered by insurance.

The Board of Directors and management of the
Registrant believed that the claims were without merit, but, felt
it was in the best interest of the Registrant to settle the case as
soon as practicable to avoid a protracted period of costly
litigation and management distraction.
