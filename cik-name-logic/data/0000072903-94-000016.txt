Item 5. Other Information.

On Friday, May 6, 1994, the Minnesota Legislature passed a bill that would
authorize Northern States Power Company (NSP) to install 17 dry casks at its 
Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant if the Company satisfies certain 
responsibilities. The first increment of five casks would be available 
after NSP executes an agreement with the Governor concerning the renewable 
energy and alternative siting commitments contained in the new law. The second
increment of four casks would be available if the Minnesota Environmental 
Quality Board finds that NSP has applied for an alternative site license, used 
good faith in locating an alternative site and has committed to build or 
purchase 100 megawatts (MW) of wind generation. The final increment of eight 
casks would be available unless prior to June 1, 1999, the Legislature 
specifically rejects this authorization for the final eight casks, which 
can only happen if NSP fails to meet the renewable commitments of 225 MW of 
wind generation and 50 MW of biomass generation by December 31, 1998. 
The Governor is expected to sign the bill shortly.
