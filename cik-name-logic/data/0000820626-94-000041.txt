Item 5. Other Events 

The following is the text of a press release relating to a dam
breach at the Florida joint venture.

NORTHBROOK, IL., November 19, 1994 -- IMC Global Inc. (NYSE
symbol: IGL) reported today that the failure of a spillway structure
resulted in the breach of an earthen dam containing surface water and
natural clay. The incident occurred at an IMC-Agrico Company
phosphate mining facility in Hillsborough County east of Tampa,
Florida.

The breach, discovered by plant personnel at approximately 11
p.m. Friday (Nov. 18) at the Company's Hopewell Mine, was repaired
shortly after 5 a.m. today. The Company estimates that up to
1400-acre feet of surface water could have been released. 

"We do not yet know what caused the failure," said IMC-Agrico's
John A. Brafford, vice president for phosphate operations. "Our
immediate concern is to see to the needs of our neighbors who were
inconvenienced." 

Brafford said that the dam had been inspected during the evening
prior to the incident without any sign of a problem.

The released water contains only natural clay separated from
phosphate ore. Company officials said while they expect most of the
clay to be contained on company land, some will reach the North Prong
of the Alafia River which flows into Tampa Bay. IMC-Agrico personnel
are monitoring water flow and conditions on the river.

The Company immediately notified the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection, which had a representative on site
throughout the night. All other appropriate agencies also were
notified. 

IMC-Agrico personnel were dispatched to affected rural
neighborhoods to assess any damage and offer assistance. A portion
of a county road was closed due to the incident but has been
reopened. There were no reports of injuries or major property
damage.

IMC-Agrico Company is a joint venture between IMC and
Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners (NYSE: FRP) a 51% owned affiliate
of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FTX). IMC manages the joint venture.

SIGNATURE 

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be
signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereto duly
authorized.
