Florida Progress Corporation reports second-quarter earnings of $52.9 million

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (July 21, 1994) - Florida Progress Corporation
parent of St. Petersburg-based Florida Power Corporation, today reported
second-quarter earnings of $52.9 million, compared with $43 million earned
during the same period a year ago. 

Revenues for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $681.5 million, compared with
$553.3 million for the second quarter of 1993. Earnings per share in the
second quarter of 1994 were 58 cents, compared with 49 cents a share a year
ago.

Florida Power, the largest subsidiary of Florida Progress, earned $47.6 million
or 52 cents per share, on revenues of $517 million in this year's second
quarter, compared with earnings of $39.1 million, or 44 cents a share, on
revenues of $461.9 million for the same period a year ago. 

Utility revenues continued to rise in 1994 primarily because of increased
retail kilowatt-hour sales and customer growth. Hot weather across Florida
Power's 32-county service area was the primary reason for the higher customer
usage from April to June. 

The average residential customer used 14.4 percent more electricity during this
year's second quarter than during the same three-month period a year ago.
Customer growth of 2.2 percent also contributed to the increase in energy sales
in the second quarter.

Earnings from Florida Progress' diversified operations grew in the second
quarter, largely because of higher revenues and increased earnings from
Electric Fuels Corporation, the company's coal mining and transportation
subsidiary. 

Diversified earnings in the quarter ended June 30 were $5.3 million, or 6 cents
per share, compared with the $3.9 million, or 5 cents a share, earned in the
second quarter of 1993. An acquisition last year by Electric Fuels has
continued to boost the company's 1994 operating results. 

Florida Progress (NYSE: FPC) is a diversified utility holding company with
assets of $5.7 billion. Its principal subsidiary is Florida Power, the state's
second-largest electric utility with more than 1.2 million customers. 
Diversified operations include coal mining and transportation, life insurance,
real estate and lending and leasing.

Florida Progress Corporation releases second-quarter earnings of $52.9 million

Florida Progress Corporation, parent of St. Petersburg-based Florida Power
Corporation, today reported second-quarter earnings of $52.9 million, compared
with $43 million earned during the same period a year ago. 

Revenues for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $681.5 million, compared with
$553.3 million for the second quarter of 1993. Earnings per share in the
second quarter of 1994 were 58 cents, compared with 49 cents a share a year
ago.

Florida Power, the largest subsidiary of Florida Progress, earned $47.6
million, or 52 cents per share, on revenues of $517 million in this year's
second quarter, compared with earnings of $39.1 million, or 44 cents a share,
on revenues of $461.9 million for the same period a year ago. 

Utility revenues continued to rise in 1994 primarily because of increased
retail kilowatt-hour sales and customer growth. Hot weather across Florida
Power's 32-county service area was the primary reason for the higher customer
usage from April to June.

As a measure of hot weather, cooling-degree days indicate variances from year
to year. In this year's second quarter, the cooling-degree days in Florida
Power's service territory were about 95 percent higher than the same period a
year ago, and about 7 percent above the 10-year average.

The average residential customer used 14.4 percent more electricity during this
year's second quarter than during the same three-month period a year ago. 
Customer growth of 2.2 percent also contributed to the increase in energy sales
in the second quarter.

Earnings from Florida Progress' diversified operations also grew in the second
quarter, largely because of higher revenues and increased earnings from
Electric Fuels Corporation, the company's coal mining and transportation
subsidiary. 

Diversified earnings in the quarter ended June 30 were $5.3 million, or 6 cents
per share, compared with $3.9 million, or 5 cents a share, earned in the second
quarter of 1993. An acquisition last year by Electric Fuels has continued to
boost the company's 1994 operating results. The assets of Steel Processing
Services, a rail car services and parts reconditioning firm based in
Albertville, Ala., were purchased in June 1993.

Higher diversified results during the second quarter of this year were slightly
offset by lower results from Florida Progress' life insurance unit. Higher
death claims and increased reserves resulted in reduced earnings for
Mid-Continent Life Insurance Company in the quarter. Other diversified
operations posted relatively little change over results from the same period a
year ago.

SIX-MONTH SUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS

For the six months ended June 30, Florida Progress' earnings were $88.7
million, or 98 cents a share, on revenues of $1.311 billion, compared with
earnings of $77.4 million, or 88 cents a share, on revenues of $1.047 billion
from a year ago. Higher revenues and increased operating results from Florida
Power continued to improve the company's earnings in 1994. Diversified results
also have improved this year, primarily because of significant earnings growth
from Electric Fuels.

Florida Power's earnings for the first six months of this year were $79.4
million, or 88 cents per share, on revenues of $1 billion. During the same
six-month period in 1993, utility earnings were $70.6 million, or 80 cents a
share, on revenues of $868.9 million.

Higher energy sales and higher earnings from Florida Power this year offset the
increased costs for an early retirement package. In 1994, the utility
recognized after-tax expenses of $9.5 million, or 11 cents a share, related to
this package.

Year-to-date earnings from Florida Progress' diversified operations were $9.3
million, or 10 cents per share, compared with $6 million, or 7 cents a share,
for the first six months of 1993.

Florida Progress (NYSE: FPC) is a diversified utility holding company with
assets of $5.7 billion. Its principal subsidiary is Florida Power, the state's
second-largest electric utility with more than 1.2 million customers. 
Diversified operations include coal mining and transportation, life insurance,
real estate and lending and leasing.
