Dear Sirs:

CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION, a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company"),
confirms its agreement with each of you with respect to the issue and sale from
time to time by the Company of up to $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
its medium-term notes due more than nine months from date of issue (the
"Notes"). The Notes will be issued under an Indenture dated as of January 15,
1994 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The First National Bank of
Chicago, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), and will have the maturities, interest
rates, redemption provisions, if any, and other terms as set forth in
supplements to the Basic Prospectus referred to below.

The Company hereby appoints each of you as its agent (an "Agent") for the
purpose of soliciting and receiving offers to purchase Notes from the Company
by others (herein referred to as "Agency Transactions") and, on the basis of
the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to terms and
conditions herein set forth, each of you agrees to use reasonable efforts to
solicit and receive offers to purchase Notes upon terms acceptable to the
Company at such times and in such amounts as the Company shall from time to
time specify. In addition, each of you may also purchase Notes as principal,
subject to Section 2(a) hereof, and, if requested by any of you, the Company
will enter into a Terms Agreement relating to such sale (a "Terms Agreement")
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2(b) hereof (herein referred to as
"Principal Transactions"). In acting under this Agreement and in connection
with the sale of any Notes by the Company (other than Notes sold to any of you
as principal), each of you is acting solely as agent of the Company and does
not assume any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with any
purchaser of Notes.
<PAGE> 2
The Company reserves the right to sell Notes on its own behalf directly or
through affiliates. The Company also reserves the right to appoint one or more
additional persons to perform Agency Transactions or Principal Transactions on
terms the same as those contained in this Agreement. The Company will promptly
notify each Agent of any such appointment, and any such person that performs
Agency Transactions shall receive the commissions set forth in Section 2(a)
hereof.

The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") a registration statement, including a prospectus, relating to the
Notes. Such registration statement, including the exhibits thereto, as amended
at the Commencement Date (as hereinafter defined), is hereinafter referred to
as the "Registration Statement". The Company proposes to file with the
Commission from time to time, pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), supplements to the prospectus included
in the Registration Statement that will describe certain terms of the Notes.
The prospectus in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is
hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus". The term "Prospectus" means
the Basic Prospectus together with the prospectus supplement or supplements
(each a "Prospectus Supplement") specifically relating to Notes, as filed with,
or transmitted for filing, to the Commission pursuant to Rule 424. As used
herein, the terms "Basic Prospectus" and "Prospectus" shall include in each
case the documents, if any, incorporated by reference therein. The terms
"supplement" and "amendment" or "amend" as used in this Agreement shall include
all documents that are deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus
that are filed subsequent to the date of the Basic Prospectus by the Company
with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act").

1. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and
warrants to and agrees with each of you as of the Commencement Date, as of each
date on which the Company accepts an offer to purchase Notes (including any
purchase by any of you as principal, pursuant to a Terms Agreement or
otherwise), as of each date the Company issues and sells Notes and as of each
date the Registration Statement or the Basic Prospectus is amended or
supplemented, as follows (it being understood that such representations,
warranties and agreements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration
Statement, the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus, each as amended or
supplemented to each such date):

(a) The Registration Statement has become effective; no stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in effect,
and no proceedings for such purpose are pending before or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened by the Commission.

(b) (i) Each document incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus complied or will comply when filed with the Commission in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder, (ii) each part of the Registration Statement, when such
part became effective, did not contain and each such part, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or

-2-

misleading, (iii) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus comply and, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, will comply in all material respects
with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder and (iv) the Prospectus does not contain and, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that the representations and warranties set forth in this
Section 1(b) do not apply (i) to statements or omissions in the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus based upon information relating to any of you
furnished to the Company in writing by any of you expressly for use therein or
(ii) to that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement
of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended

of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own its property
and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and is duly
qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property
requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so
qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(d) Each of the subsidiaries whose assets are 5 percent or
more of the consolidated assets of the Company (each, a "Material Subsidiary"),
if any, has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the
corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business
as described in the Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business
or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to
the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not
have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

(e) Each of this Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement
has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid
and binding agreement of the Company, in each case enforceable in accordance
with its terms except as (i) rights to indemnity and contribution hereunder or
thereunder may be limited under applicable law, (ii) the enforceability hereof
and thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and (iii) the availability of equitable remedies
may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability.

accordance with its terms except as (i) the enforceability thereof may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and (ii) rights of acceleration and the availability of equitable
remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability.

the Notes have been established and the Notes have been executed by the Company
and completed and authenticated by the Trustee, all in accordance with the
Indenture, and when the Notes have been delivered to and duly paid for by the
purchasers thereof, the Notes will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture
and will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms except as (i) the enforceability thereof
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and (ii) rights of acceleration and the availability of
equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general
applicability.

(h) The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the
performance by the Company of its obligations under, this Agreement, the Notes,
the Indenture and any applicable Terms Agreement will not contravene any
provision of applicable law or the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
the Company or any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or
any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body,
agency or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any Material
Subsidiary, and no consent, approval, authorization or order of or
qualification with any governmental body or agency is required for the
performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes,
the Indenture and any applicable Terms Agreement, except as provided in 49
C.F.R. Part 1175.2 pursuant to which the Company is exempt from the provisions

Prospectus and are not so described or any statutes, regulations, contracts or
other documents that are required to be described in the Registration Statement

that are not described or filed as required.

(k) Each of the Company and its Material Subsidiaries, if any,

federal, state, local and other governmental authorities, all self-regulatory
organizations and all courts and other tribunals, to own, lease, license and

2. Solicitations as Agents; Purchases as Principal.

(a) Solicitations as Agents. In connection with your actions
as Agents hereunder, each of you agrees to use reasonable efforts to solicit
offers to purchase Notes upon the terms and conditions set forth in the
Prospectus as then amended or supplemented.

The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
instruct any of you (a "Suspended Agent") to suspend at any time, for any
period of time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes.
Upon receipt of at least one business day's prior notice from the Company, a
Suspended Agent will forthwith suspend solicitations of offers to purchase
Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised the Suspended
Agent that such solicitation may be resumed. While such solicitation is
suspended, the Company shall not be required to deliver any certificates,
opinions or letters to the Suspended Agent in accordance with Sections 5(a),
5(b) and 5(c) hereof; provided, however, that if the Registration Statement or
Prospectus is amended or supplemented during the period of suspension (other
than by a pricing supplement or an amendment or supplement providing solely for
a change in the interest rates, redemption provisions, amortization schedules
or maturities offered on the Notes or for a change the Suspended Agent deems to
be immaterial), the Suspended Agent shall not be required to resume soliciting
offers to purchase Notes until the Company has delivered such certificates,
opinions and letters in accordance with Sections 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) hereof as
the Suspended Agent may request.

The Company agrees to pay to each Agent, as consideration for the
sale of each Note resulting from a solicitation made or an offer to purchase
received by such Agent, a commission in the form of a discount from the
purchase price of such Note equal to the following percentage of the purchase
price of such Note:

</TABLE>

-5-
<PAGE> 6
Each of you is authorized to solicit offers to purchase Notes only
in the principal amount of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof that is an
integral multiple of $1,000. Each Agent shall communicate to the Company,
orally or in writing, each offer to purchase Notes received by such Agent that
in such Agent's judgment should be considered by the Company. The Company
shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase Notes and may reject any
offer in whole or in part, including any Agent's offers to purchase Notes as
principal pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof. Each Agent shall have the right to
reject any offer to purchase Notes that such Agent considers to be
unacceptable, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of such
Agent's agreements contained herein.

(b) Purchases as Principal. Each sale of Notes to an Agent as
principal shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, if
requested by such Agent, the Company will, subject to Section 2(a), enter into
a Terms Agreement that will provide for the sale of such Notes to and the
purchase thereof by such Agent. Each Terms Agreement will be substantially in
the form of Exhibit A hereto, but may take the form of an exchange of any form
of written or oral telecommunication between such Agent and the Company and, if
oral, shall be confirmed in writing by such Agent to the Company.

The commitment of an Agent to purchase Notes as principal, whether
pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise, shall be deemed to have been made
on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company herein
contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth.
Each agreement by an Agent to purchase Notes as principal (whether or not set
forth in a Terms Agreement) shall specify the principal amount of Notes to be
purchased by such Agent pursuant thereto, the maturity date of such Notes, the
price to be paid to the Company for such Notes, the interest rate and interest
rate formula, if any, applicable to such Notes and any other terms of such
Notes. Each such agreement shall also specify any requirements for officers'
certificates, opinions of counsel and letters from the independent public
accountants of the Company pursuant to Section 4 hereof. A Terms Agreement may
also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Notes by
such Agent.

Each Terms Agreement shall specify the time and place of delivery
of and payment for such Notes. With respect to each sale of Notes to an Agent
as principal that is not made pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the procedural
details relating to the issue and delivery of such Notes and the payment
therefor shall be as set forth in the Administrative Procedures (as hereinafter
defined). Each date of delivery of and payment for Notes to be purchased by an
Agent as principal, whether pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise, is
referred to herein as a "Settlement Date".

An Agent may sell Notes it has purchased as principal to other
dealers for resale to investors and other purchasers, and may allow any portion
of the discount received in connection with such purchase from the Company to
such dealers.

(c) Administrative Procedures. Each Agent and the Company
agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to
be performed in the Medium-Term Notes Administrative Procedures (attached
hereto as Exhibit B) (the

-6-
<PAGE> 7
"Administrative Procedures"), as amended from time to time. The Administrative
Procedures may be amended only by written agreement of the Company and each
Agent.

(d) Delivery. The documents required to be delivered by
Section 4 of this Agreement as a condition precedent to your respective
obligations to begin soliciting offers to purchase Notes as Agents of the
Company shall be delivered at the office of Shearman & Sterling, your counsel,
not later than 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the date hereof, or at such other
time and/or place as Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley") and
the Company may agree upon in writing, but in no event later than the day prior
to (i) the date on which any Agent first begins soliciting offers to purchase
Notes or (ii) the first date on which the Company accepts any offer by any
Agent to purchase Notes as principal (the "Commencement Date").

3. Agreements. The Company agrees with each of you that:

(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes
pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, the Company will not file
any Prospectus Supplement relating to the Notes or any amendment to the
Registration Statement unless the Company has previously furnished to each of
you a copy thereof for your respective review and will not file any such
proposed supplement or amendment to which any of you reasonably object;
provided, however, that the foregoing requirement shall not apply to any of the
Company's periodic filings with the Commission required to be filed pursuant to
Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, copies of which filings
the Company will cause to be delivered to each of you promptly after being
filed with the Commission. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will
promptly cause each Prospectus Supplement to be filed with or transmitted for
filing to the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b). The Company will
promptly advise each of you (i) of the filing of any amendment or supplement to
the Basic Prospectus, (ii) of the filing and effectiveness of any amendment to
the Registration Statement, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any
amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the
Basic Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the
Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose
and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or
the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company
will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or
notice of suspension of qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as
possible the withdrawal thereof. If the Basic Prospectus is amended or
supplemented as a result of the filing under the Exchange Act of any document
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, no Agent shall be obligated to
solicit offers to purchase Notes so long as such Agent is not reasonably
satisfied with such document.

(b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Notes is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event occurs or
condition exists as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or
supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the

-7-
<PAGE> 8
circumstances when the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, is
delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of any Agent or
in the opinion of the Company, it is necessary at any time to amend or
supplement the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, to comply with
applicable law, the Company will immediately notify each of you by telephone
(with confirmation in writing) to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase
Notes and, if so notified by the Company, each of you shall forthwith suspend
such solicitation and cease using the Prospectus as then amended or
supplemented. If the Company shall decide to amend or supplement the
Registration Statement or Prospectus as then amended or supplemented, it shall
so advise each of you promptly by telephone (with confirmation in writing) and,
at its expense, shall prepare and cause to be filed promptly with the
Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or
Prospectus as then amended or supplemented that will correct such statement or
omission or effect such compliance and will supply such amended or supplemented
Prospectus to each of you in such quantities as each of you may reasonably
request. If such amendment or supplement and any documents, certificates,
opinions and letters furnished to each of you pursuant to paragraph (e) below
and Sections 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) hereof in connection with the preparation and
filing of such amendment or supplement are satisfactory in all respects to each
of you, upon the filing of such amendment or supplement with the Commission or
upon the effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration Statement, each of
you will resume the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes hereunder.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3(b), until the
distribution of any Notes any Agent may own as principal has been completed, if
any event described above in this paragraph (b) occurs, the Company will, at
its own expense, forthwith prepare and cause to be filed promptly with the
Commission an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or
Prospectus as then amended or supplemented, satisfactory in all respects to any
such Agent, and will supply such amended or supplemented Prospectus to such
Agent in such quantities as such Agent may reasonably request. If such
amendment or supplement and any documents, certificates, opinions and letters
furnished to any such Agent pursuant to paragraph (e) below and Sections 5(a),
5(b) and 5(c) hereof in connection with the preparation and filing of such
amendment or supplement are satisfactory in all respects to such Agent, upon
the filing of such amendment or supplement with the Commission or upon the
effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration Statement, such Agent may
resume its resale of Notes as principal.

(c) The Company will make generally available to its security
holders and to each of you as soon as practicable earning statements that
satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder, covering twelve-month periods
beginning, in each case, not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal
quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in Rule 158 under the
Securities Act) of the Registration Statement with respect to each sale of
Notes. If such fiscal quarter is the last fiscal quarter of the Company's
fiscal year, such earning statement shall be made available not later than 90
days after the close of the period covered thereby and in all other cases shall
be made available not later than 45 days after the close of the period covered
thereby.

(d) The Company will furnish to each Agent, without charge,
one copy of the Registration Statement, including exhibits and all amendments
thereto (unless previously furnished), and during the period mentioned in
Section 3(b) above, as many copies of the

-8-
<PAGE> 9
Prospectus, any documents incorporated by reference therein and any supplements
and amendments thereto as such Agent may reasonably request.

(e) During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall
furnish to each Agent such relevant documents and certificates of officers of
the Company relating to the business, operations and affairs of the Company,
the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any amendments or supplements
thereto, the Indenture, the Notes, this Agreement, the Administrative
Procedures, any Terms Agreement and the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder as such Agent may from time to time
reasonably request and shall notify each Agent promptly in writing of any
downgrading, or of its receipt of any notice of any intended or potential
downgrading or of a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the
possible change, in the rating accorded any of the Company's securities by any
"nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is
defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act.

(f) The Company will, whether or not any sale of Notes is
consummated, pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement and any Terms Agreement, including: (i) the preparation
and filing of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and all amendments
and supplements thereto, (ii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the
Notes, (iii) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel and
accountants and of the Trustee and its counsel, (iv) the printing and delivery
to each of you in quantities as hereinabove stated of copies of the
Registration Statement and all amendments thereto and of the Basic Prospectus
and any amendments or supplements thereto, (v) the printing and delivery to
each of you of copies of the Indenture, (vi) any fees charged by rating
agencies for the rating of the Notes, (vii) the fees and expenses, if any,
incurred with respect to any filing with the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., (viii) the fees and disbursements of special counsel to all
Agents incurred in connection with the offering and sale of the Notes,
including any opinions to be rendered by such counsel thereunder, and (ix) any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any of you, including any advertising
expenses incurred by any of you with the approval of the Company.

(g) Subject to the prior agreement by the Company and any
Agent at the time of the purchase of Notes by such Agent as principal, between
the date of any such agreement to purchase Notes as principal and the
Settlement Date with respect to such agreement, the Company will not, without
such Agent's prior consent, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose
of any debt securities of the Company substantially similar to the Notes (other
than (i) the Notes that are to be sold pursuant to such agreement and (ii)

offers to purchase Notes as agents of the Company, your respective obligations
to purchase Notes as principal pursuant to any Terms Agreement or otherwise and
the obligation of any other purchaser to purchase Notes will be subject to the
accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company
herein, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company's officers made in
each certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof and to the
performance and observance by the Company of all covenants and agreements
herein contained on its part to be performed and observed (in the case of your
respective obligations to solicit offers to purchase Notes, at the time of such
solicitation, and, in the case of your respective obligations or any other
purchaser's obligations, to purchase Notes, at the time the Company accepts the
offer to purchase such Notes and at the time of purchase) and (in each case) to
the following additional conditions precedent when and as specified:

(a) At the time of such solicitation or the time of such
purchase, as the case may be:

(i) There shall not have occurred any change, or any
development involving a prospective change, in the condition, financial or
otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations, of the Company and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Registration
Statement, as then amended or supplemented, that, in your judgment, is
material and adverse and that makes it, in your judgment, impracticable to
market the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the
Prospectus except, in the case of any purchase of Notes, as disclosed to
you in writing by the Company before it accepted the offer to purchase such
Notes.

(ii) There shall not have occurred any (A) suspension or

or in the over-the-counter market, (C) declaration of a general moratorium
on commercial banking activities in New York by either Federal or New York
State authorities or (D) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any
change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your
judgment, is material and adverse and, in the case of any of the events
described in clauses (ii)(A) through (D), such event, singly or together
with any other such event, makes it, in your judgment, impracticable to
market the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, except, in the case of any purchase
of Notes, for any such event occurring before the Company accepted the
offer to purchase such Notes.

(iii) There shall not have been any downgrading, nor any
notice given of any intended or potential downgrading or of a possible
change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the
rating accorded any of the Company's securities by any "nationally
recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act, except, in the case of
any purchase of Notes, as disclosed to you in writing by the Company before
it accepted the offer to purchase

such Notes.

(b) On the Commencement Date and, if called for by any
agreement by you to purchase Notes as principal, on the corresponding

any of its subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, any judgment,
order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction
over the Company or any Material Subsidiary, and no consent, approval,
authorization or order of or qualification with any governmental body or agency

Agreement, the Notes, the Indenture and any applicable Terms Agreement, except
as provided in 49 C.F.R. Part 1175.2 pursuant to which the Company is exempt
from the provisions of 49 U.S.C. Section 11301 and with which the Company has
complied;

(H) the statements in the Basic Prospectus, as amended or
supplemented, under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Plan of
Distribution" in such Prospectus, and the statements in the Prospectus
Supplement under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Plan of Distribution"
in such Prospectus Supplement, and in "Item 3 - Legal Proceedings" of the
Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference in
the Prospectus, and Item I of Part II of the Company's quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, if any, filed since the most recent annual report on Form 10-K
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, in each case and insofar as such
statements constitute a summary of the legal matters, documents or proceedings
referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to
such legal matters, documents and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters
referred to therein;

(I) after due inquiry, such counsel does not know of any
legal or governmental proceeding pending or threatened to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that is required to be described
in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented,
and is not so described or of any statute, regulation, contract or other
document that is required to be described in the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, as amended or

-12-
<PAGE> 13
supplemented, or to be filed as an exhibit to such Registration Statement that
is not described or filed as required;

(J) such counsel is of the opinion ascribed to it in the
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, under the caption "Limitations on
Issuance of Bearer Debt Securities" and in the Prospectus Supplement under the
caption "United States Federal Taxation"; and

(K) such counsel (1) is of the opinion that each document
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented (except
for financial statements and other financial or statistical information
included therein as to which such counsel need not express any opinion),
complied as to form when filed with the Commission in all material respects
with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder, (2) believes that (except for financial statements and other
financial or statistical information as to which such counsel need not express
any belief and except for that part of the Registration Statement that
constitutes the Form T-l heretofore referred to) each part of the Registration
Statement, as amended, if applicable, when such part became effective, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, (3) is of the opinion that the Registration Statement and
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, if applicable (except for financial
statements and other financial or statistical information included therein as
to which such counsel need not express any opinion), comply as to form in all
material respects with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder and (4) believes that (except for financial statements
and other financial or statistical information as to which such counsel need
not express any belief) the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, as of the date such opinion is delivered, does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

(ii) The opinion, dated as of such date, of Shearman &
Sterling, your special counsel, covering the matters in subparagraphs (D)
through (F), (H) (with respect to statements in the Prospectus, as amended or
supplemented, under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Plan of
Distribution," and in the Prospectus Supplement under the captions "Description
of Notes" and "Plan of Distribution"), (J) and (K) in paragraph (b)(i) above.

With respect to subparagraph (K) of paragraph (b)(i) above,
Shearman & Sterling may state that its opinion and belief are based upon their
participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement and Prospectus
and any amendments or supplements thereto (but not including documents
incorporated herein by reference), but are without independent check or
verification except as specified.

(c) On the Commencement Date and, if called for by any
agreement by you to

-13-
<PAGE> 14
purchase Notes as principal, on the corresponding Settlement Date, you shall
have received a certificate, dated such Commencement Date or Settlement Date,
as the case may be, signed by an executive officer of the Company to the effect
that (i) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement in the form in which it was declared effective by the Commission on
August 10, 1993 is in effect and no proceedings for that purpose are pending
or, to the knowledge of such officer or the Company's knowledge, are
threatened; (ii) there shall not have been any downgrading, nor has the Company
received any notice of any intended or potential downgrading or any notice that
does not indicate the direction of a possible change, in the rating accorded
any of the Company's securities by any "nationally recognized statistical
rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2)
under the Securities Act, except in the case of any purchase of Notes, as
disclosed to you in writing by the Company before it accepted the offer to
Purchase such Notes; (iii) the representations and warranties of the Company
contained herein are true and correct; (iv) there shall not have occurred any
change, or any development involving a prospective change, in the condition,
financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the
Registration Statement, as amended or supplemented, that in your judgment is
material and adverse, except in the case of any purchase of Notes, as disclosed
to you in writing by the Company before it accepted the offer to purchase such
Notes; and (v) the Company has performed or complied with all of the agreements
and satisfied all of the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied on
or before the date of such certificate. The officer signing and delivering
such certificate may rely upon the best of his knowledge as to any proceedings
threatened.

(d) On the Commencement Date and, if called for by any
agreement by you to purchase Notes as principal, on the corresponding
Settlement Date, the Company's independent public accountants shall have
furnished to you a letter or letters, dated as of the Commencement Date or such
Settlement Date, as the case may be, in form and substance satisfactory to you
containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in
accountant's "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial
statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as amended or
supplemented.

(e) On the Commencement Date and on each Settlement Date, the
Company shall have furnished to you such appropriate further information,
certificates and documents as you may reasonably request.

5. Additional Agreements of the Company. (a) Each time the
Registration Statement or Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by
a pricing supplement or an amendment or supplement providing solely for a
change in the interest rates, redemption provisions, amortization schedules or
maturities offered on the Notes or for a change each of you deem to be
immaterial), the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered forthwith to
each of you a certificate signed by an executive officer of the Company, dated
the date of such amendment or supplement, as the case may be, in form
reasonably satisfactory to each of you, of the same tenor as the certificate
referred to in Section 4(c) hereof relating to the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of delivery of such

-14-
<PAGE> 15
certificate.

(b) Each time the Company furnishes a certificate pursuant to
Section 5(a), the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished forthwith to
each of you a written opinion of the Vice President and General Counsel of the
Company and independent counsel for the Company, unless you shall inform the
Company that such opinions need not be furnished. Any such opinion shall be
dated the date of such amendment or supplement, as the case may be, shall be in
a form satisfactory to each of you and shall be of the same tenor as the
opinion of such counsel referred to in Section 4(b)(i) hereof, but modified to
relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and
supplemented to the time of delivery of such opinion. In lieu of such opinion,
counsel last furnishing such an opinion to each of you may furnish to each of
you a letter to the effect that each of you may rely on such last opinion to
the same extent as though it were dated the date of such letter (except that
statements in such last opinion will be deemed to relate to the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of
delivery of such letter).

(c) Each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is
amended or supplemented to set forth amended or supplemental financial
information or such amended or supplemental information is incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, the Company shall
cause its independent public accountants forthwith to furnish each of you with
a letter, dated the date of such amendment or supplement, as the case may be,
in form satisfactory to each of you, of the same tenor as the letter referred
to in Section 4(d) hereof, with regard to the amended or supplemental financial
information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement
or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to the date of such letter.

6. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each of you and each person, if any, who controls
any of you within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages or liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or in any
amendment thereof or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company
shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or any preliminary
prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, except (i) insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Agent
furnished to the Company in writing by such Agent expressly for use therein and
(ii) such indemnity with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure
to the benefit of any Agent (or any person controlling any Agent) if the person
asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability did not receive a copy of
the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented) at or prior to
the confirmation of the sale of the Notes to such person in any case where such
delivery is required by the Securities Act and the untrue statement or omission
of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus was corrected in
the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented).

-15-
<PAGE> 16
(b) Each of you agrees, severally and not jointly, to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign
the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company
within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company
to each Agent, but only with reference to information relating to such Agent
furnished to the Company in writing by such Agent expressly for use in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements
thereto or any preliminary prospectus.

(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental
investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which
indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such
person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom
such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing, and the
indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified
party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding
and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such
proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right
to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and
the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such
counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any
impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It
is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any
proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the
fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local
counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses
shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. The firm referred to in the second
preceding sentence shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley (or, if
Morgan Stanley is not a party, and could not be made a party, to such
proceeding, any other Agent) in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to
paragraph (a) above and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified
pursuant to paragraph (b) above. The indemnifying party shall not be liable
for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but
if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff,
the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify any indemnified party from and
against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No
indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of an indemnified
party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect
of which such indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity
could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or
(b) of this Section 6 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in
respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein in
connection with any offering of Notes, then each indemnifying party under such
paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses,

-16-
<PAGE> 17
claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each
of your participation as Agent in the offering of the Notes that gave rise to
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (a "Participating Agent") on the
other from the offering of such Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by
clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i)
above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each
Participating Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the
Company on the one hand and each Participating Agent on the other in connection
with the offering of such Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective
proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before
deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and
commissions received by such Participating Agent in respect thereof. The
relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Participating Agent on
the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by
the Company or by such Participating Agent and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.

If more than one of you is a Participating Agent in respect of a
proceeding, each Participating Agent's obligation to contribute pursuant to
this Section 6 shall be several and not joint, and shall be in the proportion
that the principal amount of the Notes that are the subject of such proceeding
and that were offered and sold through such Participating Agent bears to the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes that are the subject of such
proceeding.

(e) The Company and each of you agree that it would not be just
or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount
paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims,
damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 6, none of you individually shall be required to
contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which
the Notes referred to in paragraph (d) above that were offered and sold through
you individually exceeds the amount of any damages that you individually have
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or allegedly untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section ll(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are
not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be
available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

7. Position of the Agents. In soliciting offers to purchase the
Notes, each of you is

-17-
<PAGE> 18
acting solely as agent for the Company, and not as principal, and does not
assume any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with any
purchaser of Notes. Each of you shall make reasonable efforts to assist the
Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase
Notes has been solicited by you and accepted by the Company, but none of you
shall have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not
consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default in its obligations to
deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall
hold the Agent who solicited the purchase of such Notes harmless against any
loss, claim, damage or liability arising from or as a result of such default
and shall, in particular, pay to such Agent the commission such Agent would
have received had such sale been consummated.

8. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time either
by the Company or by any of you upon the giving of written notice of such
termination to the other party hereto; provided, however, that such termination
shall be effective only with respect to an Agent who has given or received such
written notice. Any Terms Agreement between the Company and any Agent shall be
subject to termination in such Agent's absolute discretion on the terms set
forth or incorporated by reference therein. The termination of this Agreement
shall not require termination of any agreement by any of you to purchase Notes
as principal, and the termination of any such agreement shall not require
termination of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated, the provisions
of the third paragraph of Section 2(a) hereof, the last two sentences of
Section 3(b) hereof and all of Sections 3(c), 3(f), 6, 7, 9 and 13 hereof shall
survive; provided that, if at the time of termination an offer to purchase
Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the
purchaser or its agent of such Notes has not occurred, the provisions of
Sections 2(c), 3(a), 3(b), 3(e), 3(g) and 4 hereof shall also survive. If any
Terms Agreement is terminated, the provisions of Sections 2(c), 3, 4, 6, 9 and
13 hereof (which shall have been incorporated by reference in such Terms
Agreement) shall survive.

9. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective
indemnity and contribution agreements, representations, warranties and other
statements of the Company, its officers and any of you set forth in or made
pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement by any of you to purchase Notes as
principal will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination
of this Agreement or any such agreement, any investigation made by or on behalf
of any of you or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling
persons referred to in Section 6 hereof and delivery of and payment for the
Notes.

CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

Explained below are the administrative procedures and specific terms
of the offering of Medium-Term Notes (the "Notes") to be issued on a continuous
basis by Consolidated Rail Corporation (the "Company") pursuant to the U.S.
Distribution Agreement, dated as of January 28, 1994 (the "Distribution
Agreement") among the Company and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Salomon
Brothers Inc and Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated (the "Agents"). In the Distribution Agreement, each Agent has
agreed to use its reasonable efforts to solicit purchases of the Notes. Each
Agent, as principal, may purchase Notes for its own account and, if requested
by an Agent, the Company and such Agent will enter into a terms agreement, as
contemplated by the Distribution Agreement.

The Notes will be issued pursuant to the provisions of an Indenture
dated as of January 15, 1994 (as it may be supplemented or amended from time to
time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The First National Bank of
Chicago, as trustee ("FNBC"). FNBC will be the Registrar, the Calculation
Agent, the Exchange Rate Agent, Authentication Agent and Paying Agent for the
Notes and will perform the duties specified herein. Notes will bear interest
at a fixed rate established by the Company at the date of issue of such Notes
(the "Fixed Rate Notes"), which may be zero in the case of certain original
issue discount notes (the "OID Notes"), or at a floating rate as set forth
therein and specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement (the "Floating Rate
Notes"). Fixed Rate Notes may pay a level amount in respect of both interest
and principal amortized over the life of the Notes (the "Amortizing Notes").
The Notes will be issued in U.S. dollars. Each Note will be represented by
either a Global Security (as defined below) delivered to FNBC, as agent for The
Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), and recorded in the book-entry system
maintained by DTC (a "Book-Entry Note") or a certificate delivered to the
holder thereof or a person designated by such holder (a "Certificated Note").
Except in limited circumstances, an owner of a Book-Entry Note will not be
entitled to receive a Certificated Note.
<PAGE> 24
Book-Entry Notes, which may only be denominated and payable in U.S.
dollars, will be issued in accordance with the administrative procedures set
forth in Part I hereof as they may subsequently be amended as the result of
changes in DTC's operating procedures, and Certificated Notes will be issued in
accordance with the administrative procedures set forth in Part II hereof.
Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Indenture or the Notes
shall be used herein as therein defined .

PART I: ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR BOOK-ENTRY NOTES

In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry Notes for
eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, FNBC will perform the
custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in
accordance with its respective obligations under a Letter of Representations
from the Company and FNBC to DTC, dated as of the date hereof (the "Letter of
Representations"), and a Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between FNBC
and DTC, dated as of May 26, 1989, and its obligations as a participant in DTC,
including DTC's Same Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS").

Issuance: On any date of settlement (as defined under
"Settlement" below) for one or more Book-Entry Notes,
the Company will issue a single global security in
fully registered form without coupons (a "Global
Security") representing up to $150,000,000 principal
amount of all such Notes that have the same Maturity
Date, redemption provisions, Interest Payment Dates,
Interest Period, Original Issue Date, original issue
discount provisions (if any) and, in the case of
Fixed Rate Notes, Interest Rate and amortization
schedule (if any) or, in the case of Floating Rate
Notes, Initial Interest Rate, Base Rate, Index
Maturity, Interest Reset Period, Interest Reset
Dates, Spread or Spread Multiplier (if any), Minimum
Interest Rate (if any) and Maximum Interest Rate (if
any) and, in each case, any other relevant terms
(collectively, "Terms"). Each Global Security will
be dated and issued as of the date of its
authentication by FNBC. Each Global Security will
bear an "Interest Accrual Date," which will be (i)
with respect to an original Global

-2-
<PAGE> 25
Security (or any portion thereof), its original
issuance date and (ii) with respect to any Global
Security (or any portion thereof) issued subsequently
upon exchange of a Global Security, or in lieu of a
destroyed, lost or stolen Global Security, the most
recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for on the predecessor
Global Security or Securities (or, if no such payment
or provision has been made, the original issuance
date of the predecessor Global Security), regardless
of the date of authentication of such subsequently
issued Global Security. Book-Entry Notes may only be
denominated and payable in U.S. dollars. No Global
Security will represent any Certificated Note.

Identification The Company has arranged with the CUSIP Service
Numbers: Bureau of Standard & Poor's Corporation (the "CUSIP
Service Bureau") for the reservation of a series of
CUSIP numbers (including tranche numbers) for each of
the Notes, which series consists of approximately 900
CUSIP numbers and relates to Global Securities
representing the Book-Entry Notes. The Company has
obtained from the CUSIP Service Bureau a written list
of the series of reserved CUSIP numbers and has
delivered to FNBC and DTC the written list of 900
CUSIP numbers of each such series. FNBC will assign
CUSIP numbers to Global Securities as described below
under Settlement Procedure "B". DTC will notify the
CUSIP Service Bureau periodically of the CUSIP
numbers that FNBC has assigned to Global Securities.
At any time when fewer than 100 of the reserved CUSIP
numbers remain unassigned to Global Securities, FNBC
shall so advise the Company and, if it deems
necessary, the Company will reserve additional CUSIP
numbers for assignment to Global Securities
representing Book-Entry Notes. Upon obtaining such
additional CUSIP numbers, the Company shall deliver a
list of such additional CUSIP numbers to FNBC and
DTC.

-3-
<PAGE> 26
Registration: Each Global Security will be registered in the name
of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, on the Security
register maintained under the Indenture. The
beneficial owner of a Book-Entry Note (or one or more
indirect participants in DTC designated by such
owner) will designate one or more participants in DTC
(with respect to such Note, the "Participants") to
act as agent or agents for such owner in connection
with the book-entry system maintained by DTC and DTC
will record in book-entry form, in accordance with
instructions provided by such Participants, a credit
balance with respect to such beneficial owner in such
Note in the account of such Participants. The
ownership interest of such beneficial owner in such
Note will be recorded through the records of such
Participants or through the separate records of such
Participants and one or more indirect participants in
DTC.

Transfers: Transfers of a Book-Entry Note will be accompanied by
book entries made by DTC and, in turn, by
Participants (and, in certain cases, one or more
indirect participants in DTC) acting on behalf of
beneficial transferors and transferees of such Note.

Exchanges: FNBC may deliver to DTC and the CUSIP Service Bureau
at any time a written notice of consolidation
specifying (i) the CUSIP numbers of two or more
Outstanding Global Securities that represent
Book-Entry Notes having the same Terms and for which
interest has been paid to the same date, (ii) a date,
occurring at least thirty days before the next
Interest Payment Date for such Book-Entry Notes, on
which such Global Securities shall be exchanged for a
single replacement Global Security and (iii) a new
CUSIP number to be assigned to such replacement
Global Security. Upon receipt of such a notice, DTC
will send to its Participants (including FNBC) a
written reorganization notice to the effect that such
exchange will occur on such date. Prior to the

-4-
<PAGE> 27
specified exchange date, FNBC will deliver to the
CUSIP Service Bureau a written notice setting forth
such exchange date and the new CUSIP number and
stating that, as of such exchange date, the CUSIP
numbers of the Global Securities to be exchanged will
no longer be valid. On the specified exchange date,
FNBC will exchange such Global Securities for a
single Global Security bearing the new CUSIP number
and a new Interest Accrual Date, and the CUSIP
numbers of the exchanged Global Securities will, in
accordance with CUSIP Service Bureau procedures, be
canceled and not immediately reassigned.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Global
Securities to be exchanged exceed $150,000,000 in
aggregate principal amount, one Global Security will
be authenticated and issued to represent each
$150,000,000 principal amount of the exchanged Global
Security and an additional Global Security will be
authenticated and issued to represent any remaining
principal amount of such Global Securities (see
"Denominations" below).

Maturities: Each Book-Entry Note will mature on a date more than
nine months after the settlement date for such Note.

Notice of FNBC will give notice to DTC prior to each Redemption
Redemption Dates: Date (as specified in the Note), if any, at the time
and in the manner set forth in the Letter of
Representations.

Denominations: Book-Entry Notes will be issued in principal amounts
of $1000 or any amount in excess thereof that is an
integral multiple of $1,000. Global Securities will
be denominated in principal amounts not in excess of
$150,000,000. If one or more Book-Entry Notes having
an aggregate principal amount in excess of
$150,000,000 would, but for the preceding sentence,
be represented by a single Global Security, then one
Global Security will be issued to represent each
$150,000,000 principal amount of such Book-Entry Note
or Notes and an additional Global Security will be
issued to represent any remaining

-5-
<PAGE> 28
principal amount of such Book-Entry Note or Notes.
In such a case, each of the Global Securities
representing such Book-Entry Note or Notes shall be
assigned the same CUSIP number.

from the Interest Accrual Date of the Global Security
representing such Note. Each payment of interest on
a Book-Entry Note will include interest accrued to

but excluding, the maturity date or date of
redemption, as the case may be. Interest payable at
the maturity or upon redemption of a Book-Entry Note
will be payable to the person to whom the principal
of such Note is payable. Standard & Poor's
Corporation will use the information received in the
pending deposit message described under Settlement
Procedure "C" below in order to include the amount of
any interest payable and certain other information
regarding the related Global Security in the
appropriate weekly bond report published by Standard
& Poor's Corporation.

15, 1994 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and The First
National Bank of Chicago, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term
includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all
indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the
respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities of the Issuer,
the Trustee and holders of the Notes and the terms upon which the Notes are,

not inconsistent herewith, the terms of the Indenture are hereby incorporated
by reference herein.

be redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. If so indicated on the face of this
Note, this Note may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer, at the option of
the holder or both on or after a specified date or dates prior to the Maturity

from the Original Issue Date to the Initial Interest Reset Date specified on
the face hereof will be the Initial Interest Rate, (ii) the interest rate in
effect hereon for the 10 days immediately prior to the Maturity Date hereof
(or, with respect to any principal amount to be redeemed, any redemption date)
shall be that in effect on the 10th day preceding the Maturity Date hereof or
such date of redemption, as the case may be and (iii) if any Note is issued
between a Record Date and the related Interest Payment Date, and such Note has
daily or weekly Interest Reset Dates, then notwithstanding the fact that an
Interest Reset Date may occur prior to such Interest Payment Date, the Initial
Interest Rate set forth on the face hereof shall remain in effect through the
first Interest Reset Date occurring on or subsequent to such Interest Payment

a result of a legal holiday an auction is held on the Friday of the week
preceding such Interest Reset Date, the related Interest Determination Date
shall be such preceding Friday; and provided, further, that if an auction shall
fall on any Interest Reset Date, then the Interest Reset Date shall instead be
the first Business Day following the date of such auction.

Date or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day,
or, the Business Day immediately preceeding the applicable Interest Payment
Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.

hereof is the CD Rate, the CD Rate with respect to this Note shall be
determined on each Interest Determination Date and shall be the rate on such

Reserve System in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates," or
any successor publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System ("H 15(519)"), under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)," or, if not so
published by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining
to such Interest Determination Date, the CD Rate will be the rate on such
Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit of the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof as published by the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York in its daily statistical release "Composite 3:30 P.M. Quotations
for U.S. Government Securities" ("Composite Quotations") under the heading
"Certificates of Deposit." If neither of such rates is published by 3:00 P.M.,
New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the CD Rate on such Interest
Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent referred to on
the face hereof and will be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered
rates as of 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Interest Determination
Date, for certificates of deposit in the denomination of U.S. $5,000,000 with a
remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof
of three leading nonbank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of
deposit in The City of New York (which may include the Agents) selected by the

Agent for negotiable certificates of deposit of major United States money
center banks of the highest credit standing in the market for negotiable
certificates of deposit; provided, however, that if the dealers selected as
aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this
sentence, the CD Rate in effect for the applicable period will be the same as
the CD Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or, if there
was no such Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest payable hereon shall be
the Initial Interest Rate).

Determination of Commercial Paper Rate. If the Base Rate specified
on the face hereof is the Commercial Paper Rate, the Commercial Paper Rate with
respect to this Note shall be determined on each Interest Determination Date
and shall be the Money Market Yield (as defined herein) of the rate on such
date for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face
hereof, as such rate shall be published in H.15(519) under the heading
"Commercial Paper," or if not so published prior to 9:00 A.M., New York City
time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such Interest Determination Date,
the Commercial Paper Rate shall be the Money Market Yield of the rate on such
Interest Determination Date for commercial paper of the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof as published in Composite Quotations under the
heading "Commercial Paper " If neither of such rates is published by 3:00
P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper
Rate shall be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered
rates as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time on such Interest Determination Date
of three leading dealers in commercial paper in The City of New York (which may
include the Agents) selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper of
the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, placed for an industrial
issuer whose bond rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally
recognized rating agency; provided, however, that if the dealers selected as
aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this
sentence, the Commercial Paper Rate in effect for the applicable period will be
the same as the Commercial Paper Rate for the immediately preceding Interest
Reset Period (or, if there was no such Interest Reset Period, the rate of
interest payable hereon shall be the Initial Interest Rate).

"Money Market Yield" shall be the yield calculated in accordance with
the following formula:

<TABLE>
<S> <C> 
D x 360 x 100
---------------- 
Money Market Yield 360 - (D x M)
</TABLE>

where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper quoted
on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and "M" refers to the
actual number of days in the period for which accrued interest is being
calculated.

Determination of Federal Funds Rate. If the Base Rate specified on the
face hereof is the Federal Funds Rate, the Federal Funds Rate with respect to
this Note shall be determined on each Interest Determination Date and shall be
the rate on such date for federal funds as published by the Board of Governors
in the Federal Reserve System in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal Funds
(Effective)," or, if not so published by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the
Calculation Date pertaining to such Interest Determination Date, the Federal
Funds Rate will be the rate on

-6-
<PAGE> 7
such Interest Determination Date as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York in Composite Quotations under the heading "Federal Funds/Effective
Rate." If neither of such rates is published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time,
on such Calculation Date, the Federal Funds Rate for such interest
Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the
arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight U.S. dollar
federal funds as of 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Interest
Determination Date arranged by three leading brokers in federal funds
transactions in The City of New York (which may include the Agents) selected by
the Calculation Agent; provided, however, that if the brokers selected as
aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this
sentence, the Federal Funds Rate in effect for the applicable period will be
the same as the Federal Funds Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset
Period (or, if there was no such Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest
payable hereon shall be the Initial Interest Rate).

Determination of LIBOR. If the Base Rate specified on the face
hereof is LIBOR, LIBOR with respect to this Note shall be determined on each
Interest Determination Date as follows:

(i) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date,
LIBOR will be, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement,
either: (a) the arithmetic mean of the offered rates for deposits in
U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity designated in the applicable
Pricing Supplement, commencing on the second London Banking Day
immediately following the LIBOR Interest Determination Date, that
appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page as of 11:00 a.m., London time,
on that LIBOR Interest Determination Date, if at least two such
offered rates appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page ("LIBOR
Reuters"), or (b) the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having the
Index Maturity designated in the applicable Pricing Supplement,
commencing on the second London Banking Day immediately following that
LIBOR Interest Determination Date, that appears on the Telerate Page
3750 as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that LIBOR Interest
Determination Date ("LIBOR Telerate"). "Reuters Screen LIBO" Page
means the display designated as page "LIBO" on the Reuters Monitor
Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the LIBO page
on that service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered
rates of major banks). "Telerate Page 3750" means the display
designated as page "3750" on the Telerate Service (or such other page
as may replace the 3750 page on the service or such other service or
services as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for
the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S.
dollar deposits). If neither LIBOR Reuters nor LIBOR Telerate is
specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, LIBOR will be
determined as if LIBOR Telerate had been specified. If fewer than two
offered rates appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page, or if no rate
appears on the Telerate Page 3750, as applicable, LIBOR in respect of
that LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined as if the
parties specified the rate described in (ii) below.

-7-
<PAGE> 8
(ii) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date
on which fewer than two offered rates appear on the Reuters Screen
LIBO Page, as specified in (i)(a) above, or on which no rate appears
on Telerate Page 3750, as specified in (i)(b) above, as applicable,
LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits
in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity designated in the applicable
Pricing Supplement are offered at approximately 11:00 a.m. London
time, on that LIBOR Interest Determination Date by four major banks in
the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent
("Reference Banks") to prime banks in the London interbank market
commencing on the second London Banking Day immediately following that
LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount equal to
an amount of not less than $1,000,000 that is representative for a
single transaction in such market at such time. The Calculation Agent
will request the principal London office of each of the Reference
Banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such
quotations are provided, LIBOR in respect of that LIBOR Interest
Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If
fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR in respect of that LIBOR
Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates
quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on that LIBOR
Interest Determination Date by three major banks in the City of New
York selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in U.S. dollars to
leading European banks having the Index Maturity designated in the
applicable Pricing Supplement commencing on the second London Banking
Day immediately following that LIBOR Interest Determination Date and
in a principal amount equal to an amount of not less than $1,000,000
that is representative for a single transaction in such market at such
time; provided, however, that if the banks selected as aforesaid by
the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence,
LIBOR with respect to such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be
the rate of LIBOR in effect on such date.

Determination of Prime Rate. If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is
the Prime Rate, the Prime Rate with respect to this Note shall be determined on
each Interest Determination Date and shall be the rate set forth in H.15(519)
for such date opposite the caption "Bank Prime Loan." If such rate is not yet
published by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Prime
Rate for such Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the
rates of interest publicly announced by each bank named on the Reuters Screen
NYMF Page as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as in effect for such
Interest Determination Date as quoted on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page on such
Interest Determination Date, or, if fewer than four such rates appear on the
Reuters Screen NYMF Page for such Interest Determination Date, the rate shall
be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates quoted on the basis of the actual
number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on such
Interest Determination Date by at least two of the three major money center
banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent from which
quotations are requested. If fewer than two quotations are provided, the
Prime Rate shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be determined
as the arithmetic mean on the basis of the prime rates in The City of New York
by the appropriate number of substitute banks or trust companies organized and
doing business under the laws of the United States, or any State thereof, in
each case having total equity capital of at least U.S.

-8-
<PAGE> 9
$500 million and being subject to supervision or examination by federal or
state authority, selected by the Calculation Agent to quote such rate or rates.

If in any month or two consecutive months the Prime Rate is not
published in H.15(519) and the banks or trust companies selected as aforesaid
are not quoting as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the "Prime Rate" for
such Interest Reset Period will be the same as the Prime Rate for the
immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or, if there was no such Interest
Reset Period, the rate of interest payable hereon shall be the Initial Interest
Rate). If this failure continues over three or more consecutive months, the
Prime Rate for each succeeding Interest Determination Date until the Maturity
Date or redemption of this Note or, if earlier, until this failure ceases,
shall be LIBOR determined as if the Base Rate specified on the face hereof were
LIBOR, and the Spread, if any, shall be the number of basis points specified on
the face hereof as the "Alternate Rate Event Spread."

Determination of Treasury Rate. If the Base Rate specified on the
face hereof is the Treasury Rate, the Treasury Rate with respect to this Note
shall be determined on each Interest Determination Date and shall be the rate
for the auction held on such date of direct obligations of the United States
("Treasury Bills") having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, as
published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in H.15(519)
under the heading "U.S. Government Securities-- Treasury Bills--auction average
(investment)," or if not so published by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the
Calculation Date pertaining to such Interest Determination Date, the auction
average rate on such Interest Determination Date (expressed as a bond
equivalent, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and
applied on a daily basis) as otherwise announced by the United States
Department of the Treasury In the event that the results of the auction of
Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof are not
published or reported as provided above by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on
such Calculation Date or if no such auction is held on such Interest
Determination Date, then the Treasury Rate shall be calculated by the
Calculation Agent and shall be a yield to maturity (expressed as a bond
equivalent, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and
applied on a daily basis) of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid
rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Interest
Determination Date, of three leading primary United States government
securities dealers (which may include the Agents) selected by the Calculation
Agent for the issue of Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the
Index Maturity specified on the face hereof; provided, however, that if the
dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as
mentioned in this sentence, the Treasury Rate for such Interest Reset Date will
be the same as the Treasury Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset
Period (or, if there was no such Interest Reset Period, the rate of interest
payable hereon shall be the Initial Interest Rate).

Determination of Interest Rate for Inverse Floating Rate Notes. In
the case of a Note denominated an Inverse Floating Rate Note on the face
hereof, the Base Rate shall be a fixed rate as specified on the face hereof
from the date of issuance up to the Interest Reset Date and, for each period
commending on the Interest Reset Date, a fixed rate of interest specified on
the face hereof minus the interest determined by reference to the Base Rate as
adjusted by (i) the Spread, if any, and/or (ii) multiplied by the Spread
Multiplier, if any, as specified on the face hereof;

-9-
<PAGE> 10
provided, however, that (x) the interest rate on such Note shall not be less
than zero, and (y) the interest rate in effect for the ten (10) days
immediately prior to the Maturity Date of such Note shall be that interest rate
in effect on the tenth day preceding such Maturity Date.

Determination of Interest Rate for Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Note. In
the case of a Note denominated a Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Note on the face
hereof, the Base Rate shall be as specified on the face hereof and determined
in accordance with the provisions hereof for determining such Floating Rate
from the date of issuance up to the Interest Reset Date and , for each period
commencing on the Interest Reset Date, the interest rate shall be the Fixed
rate specified on the face hereof.

Determination of Interest Rate for Floating Rate/Fixed Rate Note. In
the case of a Note denominated a Floating Rate/Fixed Rate Note on the face
hereof, the Base Rate shall be the Fixed Rate as specified on the face hereof
from the date of issuance up to the Interest Reset Date, and for each period
commencing on the Interest Reset Date, the Floating Rate shall be as specified
on the face hereof, determined in accordance with the provisions hereof for
determining such Floating Rate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon shall not be greater
than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum Interest Rate,
if any, specified on the face hereof. The Calculation Agent shall calculate
the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each
Calculation Date. The interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher
than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by
United States Federal law of general application.

At the request of the holder hereof, the Calculation Agent will
provide to the holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if
determined, the interest rate that will become effective as of the next
Interest Reset Date.

Interest payments on this Note will include interest accrued to but
excluding the Interest Payment Dates or Maturity Date (or any redemption date),
as the case may be; provided, however, that if the Interest Reset Period with
respect to this Note is daily or weekly, interest payable on any Interest
Payment Date, other than interest payable on any date on which principal hereof
is payable, will include interest accrued through and including the Record Date
next preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date. Accrued interest hereon
shall be an amount calculated by multiplying the face amount hereof by an
accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor shall be computed by
adding the interest factor calculated for each day in the period for which
interest is being paid. The interest factor for each such date shall be
computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360 if the
Base Rate is CD Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, Prime Rate or
LIBOR, as specified on the face hereof, or by the actual number of days in the
year if the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate, as specified on the face hereof.
All percentages resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest or this
Note will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a
percentage point (.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point
rounded upward, and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such
calculation on this Note will be rounded to the nearest

-10-
<PAGE> 11
cent (with one-half cent rounded upward). The interest rate in effect on any
Interest Reset Date will be the applicable rate as reset on such date. The
interest rate applicable to any other day is the interest rate from the
immediately preceding Interest Reset Date (or, if none, the Initial Interest
Rate).

This Note and all the obligations of the Issuer hereunder are direct,
unsecured obligations of the Issuer and rank without preference or priority
among themselves and pari passu with all other existing and future unsecured
and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer, subject to certain statutory
exceptions in the event of liquidation upon insolvency.

This Note, and any Note or Notes issued upon transfer or exchange
hereof, is issuable only in fully registered form, without coupons, in
denominations of $1000 and any integral multiple of U.S. $1,000 in excess
thereof.

The Trustee has been appointed registrar for the Notes, and the
Trustee will maintain at its office in The City of New York a register for the
registration and transfer of Notes. This Note may be transferred at the
aforesaid office of the Trustee by surrendering this Note for cancellation,
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form approved by the Trustee
and duly executed by the registered holder hereof in person or by the holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon the Trustee shall issue in
the name of the transferee or transferees, in exchange herefor, a new Note or
Notes having identical terms and provisions for a like aggregate principal
amount in authorized denominations, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein; provided, however, that the Trustee will not be required to
register the transfer of or exchange any Note that has been called for
redemption in whole or in part except the unredeemed portion of Notes being
redeemed in part, or to register the transfer of or exchange Notes to the
extent and during the period so provided in the Indenture with respect to the
redemption of Notes. Notes are exchangeable at said office for other Notes of
other authorized denominations of equal aggregate principal amount having
identical terms and provisions. All such exchanges and transfers of Notes will
be free of charge, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge in connection therewith. All Notes
surrendered for exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form approved by the Trustee and executed by the registered holder
in person or by the holder's attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of
registration of any Note delivered upon any exchange or transfer of Notes shall
be such that no gain or loss of interest results from such exchange or
transfer.

In case any Note shall at any time become mutilated, defaced or be
destroyed, lost or stolen and such Note or evidence of the loss, theft or
destruction thereof (together with the indemnity hereinafter referred to and
such other documents or proof as may be required in the premises) shall be
delivered to the Trustee, a new Note of like tenor will be issued by the Issuer
in exchange for the Note so mutilated, or in lieu of the Note so destroyed or
lost or stolen, but, in the case of any destroyed or lost or stolen Note, only
upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee and the Issuer that such
Note was destroyed or lost or stolen and, if required, upon receipt also of
indemnity satisfactory to each of them. All expenses and reasonable charges
associated with procuring such indemnity and with the preparation,
authentication and delivery

-11-
<PAGE> 12
of a new Note shall be borne by the owner of the Note mutilated, defaced,
destroyed, lost or stolen.

The Indenture provides that, (a) if an Event of Default (as defined in
such Indenture) due to the default in payment of principal of, premium, if any,
or interest on, any series of debt securities issued under the Indenture,
including the series of Medium-Term Notes of which this Note forms a part, or
due to the default in the performance or breach of any other covenant or
warranty of the Issuer applicable to the debt securities of such series but not
applicable to all outstanding debt securities issued under the Indenture shall
have occurred and be continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less
than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each
outstanding affected series (voting as a single class) may then declare the
principal of all debt securities of all such series and interest accrued
thereon to be due and payable immediately and (b) if an Event of Default due to
a default in the performance of any other of the covenants or agreements in the
Indenture applicable to all outstanding debt securities issued thereunder,
including this Note, or due to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and
reorganization of the Issuer, shall have occurred and be continuing, either the
Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of
all debt securities issued under the Indenture then outstanding (treated as one
class) may declare the principal of all such debt securities and interest
accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, but upon certain conditions
such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived (except a
continuing default in payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest on
such debt securities) by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
debt securities of all affected series then outstanding.

The Indenture permits the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of
the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
debt securities of each series issued under the Indenture then outstanding and
affected, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or
changing in any manner the rights of the holders of each series so affected;
provided that the Issuer and the Trustee may not, without the consent of the
holder of each outstanding debt security affected thereby, (a) extend the final
maturity of any such debt security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce
any amount payable on redemption thereof, or change the currency of payment
thereof, or impair or affect the rights of any holder to institute suit for the
payment thereof; or (b) reduce the aforesaid percentage in principal amount of
debt securities the consent of the holders of which is required for any such
supplemental indenture.

So long as this Note shall be outstanding, the Issuer will cause to be
maintained an office or agency for the payment of the principal of and premium,
if any, and interest on this Note as herein provided in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, and an office or agency in said Borough of
Manhattan for the registration, transfer and exchange as aforesaid of the
Notes. The Issuer may designate other agencies for the payment of said
principal, premium and interest at such place or places (subject to applicable
laws and regulations) as the Issuer may decide. So long as there shall be such
an agency, the Issuer shall keep the Trustee advised of the names and locations
of such agencies, if any are so designated.

With respect to moneys paid by the Issuer and held by the Trustee for
the payment of the principal of or interest or premium, if any, on any Notes
that remain unclaimed at the end of two years after such principal, interest or
premium shall have become due and payable (whether at maturity or upon call for
redemption or otherwise), (i) the Trustee shall notify the holders of such
Notes that such moneys shall be repaid to the Issuer and any person claiming
such moneys shall thereafter look only to the Issuer for payment thereof and
(ii) such moneys shall be so repaid to the Issuer. Upon such repayment all
liability of the Trustee with respect to such moneys shall thereupon cease,
without, however, limiting in any way any obligation that the Issuer may have
to pay the principal of or interest or premium, if any, on this Note as the
same shall become due.

No provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair
the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Note at the time, place,
and rate as herein prescribed unless otherwise agreed between the Issuer and
the registered holder of this Note.

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer,
the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat
the holder in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Issuer, the
Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the
interest on this Note, for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect
hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture
supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or
director, as such, past, present or future, of the Issuer or of any successor
corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor
corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or
by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such
liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for
the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

[FORM OF REVERSE OF SECURITY]

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Medium-Term Notes having
maturities more than nine months from the date of issue (the "Notes") of the
Issuer. The Notes are issuable under an Indenture, dated as of January 15,
1994 (herein called the "Indenture") between the Issuer and The First National
Bank of Chicago, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes
any successor trustee under the Indenture) to which Indenture and all
indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the
respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities of the Issuer,
the Trustee and holders of the authenticated and delivered. The terms of
individual Notes may vary with respect to interest rates, interest rate
formulas, issue dates, maturity dates, or otherwise, all as provided in the
Indenture. To the extent not inconsistent herewith, the terms of the Indenture
are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The Notes will not be subject to any sinking fund and, unless otherwise
provided on the face hereof in accordance with the provisions of the following
paragraph, will not be redeemable prior to maturity.

Unless otherwise indicated on the face of this Note, this Note may not be
redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. If so indicated on the face of this Note,
this Note may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer, at the option of the
holder or both, on or after a specified date or dates prior to the Maturity
Date on the terms set forth on the face hereof together with interest accrued
and unpaid thereon to the date of redemption (except as provided below).
Notice of redemption shall be mailed to the registered holders of the Notes
designated for redemption at their addresses as the same shall appear on the
Note register not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date of
redemption, subject to all the conditions and provisions of the Indenture. In
the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes for the
amount of the unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the
holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

Interest payments on this Note will include interest accrued to but
excluding the Interest Payment Dates or the Maturity Date (or earlier
redemption date), as the case may be. Interest payments for this Note will be
computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

In the case where the Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date (or any
redemption date) does not fall on a Business Day, payment of interest, premium,
if any, or principal otherwise payable on such date need not be made on such
date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force
and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or on the Maturity Date (or
the redemption date) and no interest shall accrue for the period from and after
the Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date (or the redemption date) to such
next succeeding Business Day.

This Note and all the obligations of the Issuer hereunder are direct,
unsecured obligations of the Issuer, and rank without preference or priority
among themselves and pari passu with all other existing and future unsecured
and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer.

This Note, and any Note or Notes issued upon transfer or exchange hereof,
is issuable only in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of
U.S. $1000 and any integral multiple of U.S. $1,000 in excess thereof.

The Trustee has been appointed registrar for the Notes, and the Trustee
will maintain at its office in The City of New York a register for the
registration and transfer of Notes. This Note may be transferred at the
aforesaid office of the Trustee by surrendering this Note for cancellation,
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form approved by the Trustee
and duly executed by the registered holder hereof in person or by the holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon the Trustee will issue in
the name of the transferee or transferees, in exchange herefor, a new Note or
Notes having identical terms and provisions and having a like aggregate
principal amount in authorized denominations, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein; provided, however, that the Trustee will not be
required to register the transfer of or exchange any Note that has been called
for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of Notes
being redeemed in part, or to register the transfer of or exchange Notes to the
extent and during the period so provided in the Indenture with respect to the
redemption of Notes. Notes are exchangeable at said office for other Notes of
other authorized denominations of equal aggregate principal amount having
identical terms and provisions. All such exchanges of Notes will be free of
charge, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax
or other governmental charge in connection therewith. All Notes surrendered
for exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
approved by the Trustee and executed by the registered holder in person or by
the holder's attorney duly authorized in writing. The date of registration of
any Note delivered upon any exchange or transfer of Notes shall be such that no
gain or loss of interest results from such exchange or transfer.

In case any Note shall at any time become mutilated, defaced or be
destroyed, lost or stolen and such Note or evidence of the loss, theft or
destruction thereof (together with the indemnity hereinafter referred to and
such other documents or proof as may be required in the premises) shall be
delivered to the Trustee, a new Note of like tenor will be issued by the Issuer
in exchange for the Note so mutilated, defaced, or in lieu of the Note so
destroyed or lost or stolen, but, in the case of any destroyed or lost or
stolen Note, only upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee and the
Issuer that such Note was destroyed or lost or stolen and, if required, upon
receipt also of indemnity satisfactory to each of them. All expenses and
reasonable charges associated with procuring such indemnity and with the
preparation, authentication and delivery of a new Note shall be borne by the
owner of the Note mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen.

The Indenture provides that, (a) if an Event of Default (as defined in the
Indenture) due to the default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on any series of debt securities issued under the Indenture, including
the series of Medium-Term Notes of which this Note forms a part, or due to the
default in the performance or breach of any other covenant or warranty of the
Issuer applicable to the debt securities of such series but not applicable to
all outstanding debt securities issued under the Indenture shall have occurred
and be continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each

-5-
<PAGE> 6
outstanding affected series (voting as a single class) may then declare the
principal of all debt securities of all such series and interest accrued
thereon to be due and payable immediately and (b) if an Event of Default due to
a default in the performance of any other of the covenants or agreements in the
Indenture applicable to all outstanding debt securities issued thereunder,
including this Note, or due to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and
reorganization of the Issuer, shall have occurred and be continuing, either the
Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of
all debt securities issued under the Indenture then outstanding (treated as one
class) may declare the principal of all such debt securities and interest
accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, but upon certain conditions
such declarations may be annulled and past defaults may be waived (except a
continuing default in payment of principal (or premium, if any) or interest on
such debt securities) by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
debt securities of all affected series then outstanding.

If the face hereof indicates that this Note is subject to "Modified Payment
upon Acceleration," then if the principal hereof is declared to be due and
payable as described in the preceding paragraph, the amount of principal due
and payable with respect to this Note shall be limited to the aggregate
principal amount hereof multiplied by the Issue Price specified on the face
hereof (expressed as a percentage of the aggregate principal amount), plus the
dollar amount of original issue discount amortized from the Original Issue Date
to the date of declaration, which amortization shall be calculated using the
"interest method" (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in effect on the date of declaration).

The Indenture permits the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the
holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt
securities of each series issued under the Indenture then outstanding and
affected, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or
changing in any manner the rights of the holders of each series so affected;
provided that the Issuer and the Trustee may not, without the consent of the
holder of each outstanding debt security affected thereby, (a) extend the final
maturity of any such debt security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce
any amount payable on redemption thereof, or change the currency of payment
thereof, or impair or affect the rights of any holder to institute suit for the
payment thereof; or (b) reduce the aforesaid percentage in principal amount of
debt securities the consent of the holders of which is required for any such
supplemental indenture.

So long as this Note shall be outstanding, the Issuer will cause to be
maintained an office or agency for the payment of the principal of and premium,
if any, and interest on this Note as herein provided in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, and an office or agency of said Borough of
Manhattan for the registration, transfer and exchange as aforesaid of the
Notes. The Issuer may designate other agencies for the payment of said
principal, premium and interest as such place or places (subject to applicable
laws and regulations) as the Issuer may decide. So long as there shall be any
such agency, the Issuer shall keep the Trustee advised of the names and
locations of such agencies, if any are so designated.

With respect to monies paid by the Issuer and held by the Trustee for
payment of the principal of or interest or Premium, if any, on any Notes that
remain unclaimed at the end of two

-6-
<PAGE> 7
years after such principal, interest on premium shall have become due and
payable (whether at maturity or upon call for redemption or otherwise), (i) the
Trustee shall notify the holders of such Notes that such monies shall be repaid
to the Issuer and any person claiming such monies shall thereafter look only to
the Issuer for payment thereof and (ii) such monies shall be so repaid to the
Issuer. Upon such repayment all liability of the Trustee with respect to such
monies shall thereupon cease, without, however, limiting in any way any
obligation that the Issuer may have to pay the principal of or interest or
premium, if any, on this Note as the same shall become due.

No provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the
obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of, premium if any, and interest on this Note at the time, place, and
rate as herein prescribed, unless otherwise agreed between the Issuer and the
registered holder of this Note.

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the
Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the
holder in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Issuer, the
Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the
interest on this Note, for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect
hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture
supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or
director, as such past, present or future, of the Issuer or of any successor
corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor
corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or
by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such
liability being by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for
the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture.
