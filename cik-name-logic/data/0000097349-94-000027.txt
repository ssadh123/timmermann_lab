TEXACO REPORTS RESULTS

FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST HALF 1994
------------------------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: MONDAY, JULY 25, 1994.
- ---------------------------------------------
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., July 25 - Texaco Inc. announced today that 
consolidated worldwide net income from continuing operations (including 
special gains and charges) for the second quarter of 1994 was $115 million, 
or $.35 per share, as compared with $312 million, or $1.11 per share, for the 
second quarter of 1993. Net income from continuing operations (including 
special gains and charges) for the first half of 1994 was $317 million, or 
$1.04 per share, as compared with $593 million, or $2.09 per share, for the 
first half of 1993.

Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 1994 
included special charges of $119 million related to the company's program to 
consolidate some operations and sell marginal activities. The charges included
$88 million for anticipated costs associated with the expected reduction of 
approximately 2,500 employees over the next 12 months, as well as charges 
to adjust to fair market values certain properties which are being offered 
for sale.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 1994 
included $79 million of tax benefits realizable through the sale of an interest
in a subsidiary. Of these benefits, $38 million was realizable due to the 
taxable gain on the sale of discontinued chemical operations.

<PAGE>

Net income for the second quarter of 1994 included a charge of $87 million
for discontinued operations relating to the completion of the first phase of a
transaction to sell substantially all of Texaco's worldwide chemical business.
The previously mentioned $38 million tax benefit, coupled with the $87 million
charge for discontinued operations, impacted 1994 earnings by a net charge of 
$49 million. At the sale closing, the company received $650 million in cash 
and an 11-year subordinated note with a face value of $200 million.
In commenting on 1994s second quarter and six months performance Alfred C.
DeCrane, Jr., Texaco's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer 
stated, "The second quarter 1994 performance reflected upstream benefits from 
the steady strengthening of crude oil prices through the period. However, 
market conditions precluded recovery of these added costs to the refining and 
marketing units. Solid benefits were realized from operating efficiencies and
overhead reductions, but not to sufficient levels to offset this squeeze on 
downstream margins. While crude oil prices rose in the period, they still 
averaged $3.34 per barrel below the 1993 first half level and $2.25 per barrel
below second quarter 1993.
"The weakened U.S. dollar adversely affected reported earnings, including
a comparative $31 million non-cash charge for currency exchange losses due to 
the effect of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Pound Sterling on 
U.K. deferred income taxes.
"The special charges taken in the period result from major shifts in 
operational and organizational functions which are the foundation of the 
company's recently announced action plan for growth and enhanced levels of 
competitiveness and profitability."

Comparative earnings in the second quarter of 1994 were adversely impacted
by lower crude oil prices. Although prices have strengthened since the first 
quarter of 1994, average prices in the second quarter of 1994 were more than 
$2 per barrel below prices for the second quarter of 1993. In addition, 
natural gas prices declined $.24 per MCF for the comparative quarters. These 
lower prices were partly offset by benefits from continuing reductions in
operating expenses.
For the first half of 1994, earnings were negatively impacted by the more 
than $3 per barrel lower average crude oil prices. Partially offsetting the 
lower crude prices were continued reductions in operating expenses and slightly
higher natural gas prices. 
The company's results in 1994 benefited from its exploration and 
development program that has successfully added production.
Special charges for 1994 provide for the estimated cost of employee 
separations.

Second quarter 1994 margins decreased as a result of rising refinery 
feedstock prices that could not be recovered in the marketplace. This 
quarterly decrease in margins more than offset the benefits of higher gasoline
sales following the March 1994 successful introduction of Texaco's CleanSystem3
gasolines, as well as the benefits from improved performance at refineries. 
Results for the first half of 1994 were somewhat improved due to higher first 
quarter margins, mainly on the East and Gulf Coasts, combined with increased 
sales of branded gasolines.
Special charges for 1994 relate to the adjustment to fair market value of 
certain facilities to be offered for sale and the estimated cost of employee 
separations.

The decline in comparative second quarter and first half results were due
to substantially lower crude oil prices as well as higher exploratory expenses.
Partly offsetting these factors were increases in crude oil and natural gas 
liquids production, mainly in the U.K. sector of the North Sea, in Indonesia, 
and in the Partitioned Neutral Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Natural 
gas production also increased as compared to the prior year, due to new North 
Sea U.K. production.
The 1994 second quarter and first half included a charge of $11 million 
compared with benefits of $6 million for the second quarter and first half of 
1993 relating to the currency exchange impacts of the Pound Sterling on 
deferred income taxes.
Special charges for 1994 related to the adjustment to fair market value 
of certain properties being offered for sale and the estimated cost of

Results for 1994 versus 1993 reflected the decline in marketing margins 
that occurred during the second quarter, mainly in Europe. Second quarter 
results in the Caltex operating areas were unfavorably impacted by currency 
exchange effects and refining margins. Partly offsetting these decreases were
higher marketing margins, mainly in Brazil, and increased sales volumes in 
Latin America, for the second quarter and first half of 1994. Earnings for 
the first half of 1994 benefited from the higher refining margins in Europe, 
which occurred in the first quarter of the year.
The 1994 second quarter and first half included a charge of $12 million 
compared with benefits of $2 million for the second quarter and first half of 
1993 relating to the currency exchange impacts of the Pound Sterling on 
deferred income taxes. 
Special charges for 1994 related to the estimated cost of employee 
separations and the adjustment to fair market value of certain properties

______________________________________________________________________________
</TABLE>

Corporate/nonoperating expenses for both the second quarter and first 
half reflected the impact of lower corporate overhead offset by higher after 
tax interest expense. The second quarter 1994 results included a $7 million 
gain from the receipt of a cash option payment relative to the sale of a 
manufacturing facility currently under construction in Texas.
The second quarter and first half of 1994 included $17 million of charges
related to the estimated cost of employee separations. The 1994 results also 
included $79 million of tax benefits realizable through the sale of an interest
in a subsidiary. Of these benefits, $38 million was realizable due to the 
taxable gain on the sale of discontinued chemical operations.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES
Capital and exploratory expenditures for continuing operations, including
equity in such expenditures of affiliates, were $1,231 million for the first 
half of 1994, as compared to $1,155 million for the same period in 1993. 
Expenditures for the second quarter of 1994 amounted to $607 million versus 
$621 million for the same quarter in 1993.
Upstream expenditures in the United States reflected higher drilling 
activities in 1994 with particular emphasis on developmental gas projects 
mainly during the first quarter of this year. Internationally, higher 
exploration and development activities in Australia, China and Indonesia were 
more than offset by lower expenditures in the U.K. North Sea, where successful
project completions have increased production of liquids and natural gas as 
compared to 1993.

<PAGE>

Downstream expenditures in 1994 increased as compared to 1993 mainly due 
to investments in refinery construction and upgrade projects by Texaco's 
affiliate, Caltex, in Thailand and Singapore and higher retail marketing 
expenditures in Australia and Singapore. Additionally, Texaco is continuing 
its refinery upgrade project in Panama which is scheduled for completion in 
1995, and has increased marketing expenditures in the United Kingdom and
selected Latin American countries. In the United States, expenditures 
declined due to the completion of refinery upgrade projects underway in 1993 
by both Texaco and Texaco's affiliate, Star Enterprise.
