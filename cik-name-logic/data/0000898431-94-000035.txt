FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

SOUTHBURY, CONNECTICUT, September 9, 1994 -- Amdura Corporation
(NYSE:ADU) today announced that a settlement in principle has
been reached between Amdura and representatives of the plaintiff
class in the case of Saul Jones v. Amdura Corporation, et al.
(United States District Court for the District of Colorado, Case
No. 90-F-167, consolidated with Case No. 90-F-500). The Jones
case, filed in January 1990, purported to have been brought on
behalf of a class of persons who purchased Amdura's preferred or
common stock during certain periods prior to Amdura's filing of a
voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code, and alleged claims under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 to the effect that Amdura's public business and
financial disclosures were materially false or misleading during
those periods. Pursuant to an order issued by Judge John L.
Kane, Jr. of the United States District Court for the District of
Colorado on August 3, 1994 (the effectiveness of which has been
stayed) in an appeal by the plaintiff class of certain bankruptcy
orders, certain bankruptcy proofs of claim in the Jones case
which had been disallowed by the Bankruptcy Court prior to the
October 1991 effectiveness of the confirmation of Amdura's
bankruptcy Plan of Reorganization were to be reconsidered, and
the Bankruptcy Court's order confirming the Plan was to be
reversed.

Under the settlement in principle, Amdura would pay $500,000 in
cash and issue approximately 615,385 shares of its common stock.

The settlement in principle is subject to a number of substantive
and procedural conditions, including the execution of a
definitive Settlement Stipulation, preliminary approval by the
District Court, mailing of Notices of Settlement to claimants,
and final approval of the settlement by the District Court. 
Amdura anticipates that completion of these procedures will occur
over the next three to six months, with the proceeds of the
settlement being distributed to holders of proved claims
thereafter.

The parties have filed a joint motion with Judge Kane, requesting
that the stay of the implementation of his order reinstating the
class action claims and reversing the confirmation of Amdura's
Plan of Reorganization be extended to October 12, 1994. During
the extension, the parties would conclude a definitive Settlement
Stipulation and implement the formal settlement approval
procedures described above.
