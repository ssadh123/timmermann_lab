As disclosed in Registrant's Quarterly Report on 

Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1994, on 

October 31, 1994, Registrant completed the sale of its 

consumer banking subsidiary, Sacramento Savings Bank 

("Sacramento Savings"), and an ancillary company to First 

Interstate Bank of California for a cash purchase price of 

$331 million. As part of the transaction, Registrant, 

through Alleghany Properties, Inc., a wholly owned 

subsidiary, purchased real estate and real estate-related 

assets of Sacramento Savings for a purchase price of about 

$116 million. In addition to the credit recognized in the 

quarter ended June 30, 1994, Registrant disclosed that it 

expects a further addition to 1994 earnings (net of 

transaction-related expenses and taxes and provisions related 

to the retained assets) of about $50 million. Based on 

Registrant's liquidation plan and anticipated higher carrying 

costs for the real estate and real estate-related assets, 

Registrant expects to realize less than $116 million. 

Accordingly, and in recognition that no general loss reserves 

of Sacramento Savings were transferred, Registrant reduced 

the carrying value of such assets by about $20 million, net 

of related tax benefits. The reduction to estimated net

realizable value has been considered in arriving at the 

estimated $50 million additional 1994 earnings. Registrant's 

intention with respect to such real estate and real estate-

related assets, the bulk of which is raw land, is to dispose 

of them in an orderly fashion, which may take several years.
