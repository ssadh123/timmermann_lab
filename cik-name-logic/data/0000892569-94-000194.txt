ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

On July 8, 1994, Coram Healthcare Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Coram" or the "Registrant"), consummated the
acquisition and merger (the "Merger") of four public companies -- T(2)
Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("T(2)"), Curaflex Health
Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Curaflex"), HealthInfusion,
Inc., a Florida corporation ("HealthInfusion"), and Medisys, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Medisys"), pursuant to and in accordance with
that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February 6,
1994, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Agreement and Plan
of Merger dated May 25, 1994, and as further amended by that certain
Second Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 8, 1994
(the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Registrant, T(2), Curaflex,
HealthInfusion, Medisys, T(2) Acquisition Company, a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant ("T(2)
Acquisition"), C H S Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant ("CHS Acquisition"), H I I
Acquisition Company, a Florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of the Registrant ("HII Acquisition"), and M I Acquisition Company, a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant 
("MI Acquisition"). The Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby was approved by the respective
stockholders of T(2), Curaflex, HealthInfusion and Medisys at
respective special meetings of such stockholders held on July 8, 1994.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) T(2)
Acquisition was merged with and into T(2) Acquisition with T(2) as the
surviving corporation, CHS Acquisition was merged with and into
Curaflex with Curaflex as the surviving corporation, HII Acquisition
was merged with and into HealthInfusion with HealthInfusion as the
surviving corporation and MI Acquisition was merged with and into
Medisys with Medisys as the surviving corporation and (ii) each
outstanding share of T(2) common stock was converted into the right to
receive 0.63 of a share of Coram common stock, each outstanding share
of Curaflex common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.333
of a share of Coram common stock, each outstanding share of
HealthInfusion common stock was converted into the right to receive
0.447 of a share of Coram common stock, each outstanding share of
Medisys common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.243 of
a share of Coram common stock and each outstanding stock option,
warrant and other right to acquire T(2) common stock, Curaflex common
stock, HealthInfusion common stock and Medisys common stock was
converted into the right to acquire shares of Coram common stock on
the same terms and conditions, except that the number and exercise
price was adjusted based on the applicable exchange ratio for the
underlying T(2) common stock, Curaflex common stock, HealthInfusion
common stock or Medisys common stock.

The Merger will be accounted for as a "pooling of
interests" for financial reporting purposes and treated as a tax-free
reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Prior period results
of the previously separate companies will be combined to reflect the
Merger.

Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the shares
of common stock of T(2) were reported on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "TSQ" and the shares of common stock of each of

Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System
-National Market System under the symbols "CFLX," "HINF" and "MEDS,"
respectively. Coram common stock is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol "CRH" and began trading on the New York
Stock Exchange on July 11, 1994, on a "when issued" basis. On July
11, 1994, the Registrant issued a press release announcing the
completion of the Merger. A copy of such press release is attached
hereto as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by reference.

T(2) is a leading provider of alternate-site
treatment services in the United States with sites of service in over
100 cities and 38 states. These services include home infusion

therapy as part of a broader program of clinical care, at 7 disease-
specific outpatient centers focusing on the treatment of complex
long-term diseases and operates a national prescription benefit drug
program.

HealthInfusion is a national provider of home
infusion therapy services and currently operates 35 branch facilities
serving 26 states. HealthInfusion also provides services to the
contract research industry for the research and development of new
products and services and provides case management and acute care
dialysis services.

Medisys provides comprehensive home infusion therapy
services and products, which involve the intravenous or other
administration of physician-prescribed nutrients, antibiotics,
chemotherapeutic agents or other medications to patients in their
homes. Medisys also provides comprehensive pharmacy services to
long-term care and retirement communities. These services include
prescription dispensing, pharmaceutical consulting, IV therapy,
enteral therapy and medical supplies. Medisys maintains operations in

respective operations of T(2), Curaflex, HealthInfusion and Medisys in
substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the Merger.
