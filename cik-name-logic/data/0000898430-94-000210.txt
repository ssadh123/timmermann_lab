ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On March 25, 1994, the Board of Directors of Northrop Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), amended Section 3.04 ELECTION AND TERM OF
OFFICE of the Company's Bylaws to add a third paragraph that requires any
stockholder who proposes to nominate an individual or a slate of individuals for
election at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders to provide notice to
the Secretary of such proposed nomination not less than 60 days, nor more than
90 days, prior to the meeting. In the event that the Annual Meeting is called
on less than 70 days notice, the proposing stockholders must give such notice no
later than the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which
notice of the Annual Meeting is made or publicly disclosed, whichever first
occurs. In the event that less than 70 days shall remain from the date of the
public disclosure of this amendment to the date of any meeting, a proposing
stockholder must give such notice no later than the close of business on the
tenth day following the date on which such public disclosure was made. The Bylaw
provision requires that a proposing stockholder include in the notice the name
and address of such stockholder as well as the name and address of the person
intending to be nominated. The Bylaw provision also requires that the
stockholder provide sufficient information regarding the proposed nominee to
satisfy the proxy requirements under the federal securities laws.

A copy of the amendment to Section 3.04 ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE of
the Company's Bylaws is filed as an Exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

The 1994 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company will be held on

of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days
prior to the meeting; provided, however, that (a) in the event that less than
seventy (70) days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting
is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be
so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the
date on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public
disclosure was made, whichever first occurs; and (b) in the event that less than
seventy (70) days shall remain from the date of public disclosure of the
adoption of this bylaw provision to the date of any meeting, notice by the
stockholder to be timely with respect to such meeting must be so received not
later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which
such public disclosure was made. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the
name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of
the person or persons to be nominated; (b) the name and address as they appear
on the Corporation's books of the stockholder intending to make such nomination;
(c) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are
beneficially owned by such stockholder; (d) a description of all arrangements or
