Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On December 30, 1993, Forest Oil Corporation (Forest)
completed the purchase of a 35.65% working interest in the Loma
Vieja/Martinez Field located in Zapata and Jim Hogg Counties,
Texas, from Wagner & Brown, Ltd. for a total consideration of $60
million. The property had gross daily production of approximately 
61 million cubic feet of natural gas from 11 wells.

Forest completed the purchase on December 10, 1993 of the
interest of Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) in Chandeleur Sound
32 offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and two onshore fields, Barbers
Hill Field and the Katy Field in the Gulf Coast area for $26.5
million. These properties have daily net production of
approximately 6.5 million cubic feet of natural gas and 600
barrels of oil.

On December 14, 1993, Forest also purchased interests in
five offshore fields in the Gulf Coast area from Sandefer
Offshore Company (Sandefer) for $24.7 million. The estimated
recoverable reserves from these properties are approximately 19.3
billion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.5 million barrels of oil
and condensate.

Forest acquired additional working interests in two of the
properties it acquired in late 1993 from ARCO. The interests
acquired were the remaining 30% working interest (and operatorship) 
in Chandeleur Sound 32 from Davis Petroleum Corp. for $3.5 million 
on December 28, 1993 and an additional 1% working interest in the 
Katy Field in Texas from Eland for $860,000 on January 6, 1994.

On December 30, 1993, Forest closed a non-recourse loan
agreement arranged by Enron Finance Corp., an affiliate of Enron
Gas Services, that provides for borrowings of up to $70 million.
Approximately $51.6 million was advanced to Forest in 1993 to
provide financing for a portion of the offshore Louisiana and
South Texas properties acquired from Wagner & Brown, Ltd. and
Sandefer, as described above.

Another $5.8 million of the loan proceeds were advanced in
1993 for development work. Under the terms of the loan agreement, 
additional funds may be advanced to fund a portion of the development 
projects which will be undertaken by Forest on the properties pledged 
as security for the loan.

Forest entered into a $50,000,000 secured master credit
facility with The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. as agent on December
1, 1993. Under the credit facility, Forest may initially borrow
up to $25,000,000 for the acquisition or development of proved
oil and gas reserves, which amount is subject to semi-annual
redetermination, and up to $10,000,000 for working capital and
general corporate purposes. The credit facility is secured by a
mortgage on substantially all of Forest's existing proved oil and
gas properties and related assets, subject to existing liens of
volumetric production payment agreements. The maturity date of
loans under the facility is December 31, 1996.

Business Day, during the period from the date hereof until the Drawdown 
Termination Date, in each case, in such amount as the Borrower may request 
pursuant to a Borrowing Request not to exceed the Maximum Commitment. The 
Borrower may make prepayments as permitted or required in Sections 2.07 and 
2.08 but not reborrowings in respect thereof. The Loan made by the Lender 
to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement shall be evidenced by the Note. 

Section 2.02 Use of Proceeds. The Lender shall be required to 
make the Loan to be used only for the following purposes, and Borrower agrees 
to use the proceeds of the Loan made hereunder only for the following purposes:

(a) Up to $5,800,000 to be used to reimburse Borrower for 80% of 
the costs of the Prior Capital Operations.

(b) Up to $15,000,000 to be used to fund a portion of the purchase 
price of the Sandefer Properties.

(c) Up to $38,000,000 to be used to fund a portion of the purchase 
price of the Wagner & Brown Properties.

Section 2.03 Nonscheduled Capital Operations. (a) Prior to 
conducting any Nonscheduled Capital Operation on the Mortgaged Properties 
Borrower shall submit to Lender an AFE setting forth among other things the 
estimated commencement date, the proposed depth, the objective zone or zones 
to be tested, the surface and bottom hole locations, applicable details 
regarding directional drilling, the equipment to be used and the estimated 
costs of the operation, and such other information as Lender reasonably may 
request. Lender shall have ten (10) Business Days (one (1) Business Day if 
the rig is on location and Borrower notifies Lender of such circumstance at 
the time the AFE is submitted for approval, or sixty (60) Business Days if 
the AFE involves the construction of a platform and/or facilities either as 
a part of the well proposal or as a separate proposal) after receipt of such 
AFE within which to approve the proposed Nonscheduled Capital Operation and 
AFE. Failure of Lender to notify Borrower in writing within such period of 
time of such approval shall be deemed disapproval of the proposed operation 
and AFE. None of the costs of conducting a Nonscheduled Capital Operation 
shall be included in computing any Monthly Payment Amount unless such 
Nonscheduled Capital Operation shall have been approved by Lender pursuant 
to this Section 2.03(a). In the event any Nonscheduled Capital Operation is 
submitted to Lender pursuant to this Section 2.03(a) and Lender does not 
approve such Nonscheduled Capital Operation in accordance with the provisions 
of this Section 2.03(a), then subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(b), 
Lender will release the Liens held by Lender securing the Indebtedness 
insofar and only insofar as such Liens cover the portion of the Collateral 
to be developed by such Nonscheduled Capital Operation, but shall retain 
from such release any portion of the Collateral which in Lender's opinion 
was evaluated as proved, probable or possible in the Initial Reserve Reports. 
In the event the costs of any Approved Nonscheduled Capital Operation exceed 
110% of the Approved AFE for such Approved Nonscheduled Capital Operation, 
such excess costs shall not be included in computing any Monthly Payment 
Amount unless Lender approves a supplemental AFE for such increased costs. 
In connection with any Nonscheduled Capital Operation which Lender desires 
to approve pursuant to this Section 2.03(a), Borrower and Lender shall 
attempt to mutually agree on any appropriate adjustment to the Scheduled 
Principal Amounts relating to such Nonscheduled Capital Operation. In the 
event that Borrower and Lender do not agree on an adjustment to be made to 
the Scheduled Principal Amounts within the period for Lender to approve such 
Nonscheduled Capital Operation, then Lender shall be deemed not to have 
approved such Nonscheduled Capital Operation. If Borrower and Lender agree 
upon a adjustment to the Scheduled Principal Amounts, the parties will 
execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement to reflect such adjustment.

(b) Lender's obligation to execute any release pursuant to Section 
2.03(a) in connection with any Nonscheduled Capital Operation shall

containing a written description of the portion of the Collateral 
to be released in form and substance satisfactory to Lender;

and gas reserves evaluated in the Initial Reserve Reports and none of 
the Collateral to be retained by Lender will be adversely affected 
(through drainage or otherwise) by the proposed Nonscheduled Capital 
Operation;

(iii) No Default shall exist hereunder; and

(iv) Borrower shall have commenced such Nonscheduled Capital 
Operation within ninety (90) days following the date Lender disapproved or 
was deemed to disapprove such Nonscheduled Capital Operation. If such 
Nonscheduled Capital Operation is not commenced within such time period, 
the effect shall be as if the proposal had not been made and such operation 
shall again be subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(a). A Nonscheduled 
Capital Operation shall be deemed to have commenced (A) on the date the 
contract for a new platform, production facility or other similar item is let, 
if the notice indicated the need for such property, or (B) on the date the 
rig charges begin accruing according to the terms of the applicable drilling 
contract. 

Section 2.04 Interest and Additions to Principal. The aggregate 
outstanding principal amount of the Loan shall bear interest from the date 
made until due at the Applicable Interest Rate. Past due interest, principal 
and other amounts hereunder shall bear interest at the Past Due Rate from the 
date due until paid. All payments of interest shall be computed on the per 
annum basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and for the 
actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) 
elapsed. Accrued interest shall be paid monthly on each Payment Date in an 
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the accrued and unpaid interest to such 
Payment Date or (ii) the Monthly Payment Amount computed as of the end of 
the second month preceding the month in which such Payment Date falls. For 
example, with respect to the Payment Date occurring on March 15, 1994, 
accrued interest shall be paid to the extent of the Monthly Payment Amount 
computed as of the end of the month of January 1994. Any interest that has 
accrued as of any Payment Date in excess of the Monthly Payment Amount for 
such Payment Date shall not be considered past due at such time, but shall be 
added to the principal amount of the outstanding Loan on such Payment Date. 

Section 2.05 Notice and Manner of Borrowing. The amount and date 
of the Loan shall be designated by the Borrower's execution of a Borrowing 
Request to be received by the Lender at least one Business Day prior to the

pursuant to this Agreement, the Borrower will issue, execute and deliver the 
Note in the principal amount of $100,000,000 dated as of the date of this 
Agreement. At the time the Loan is made hereunder or payment (including, 
without limitation, prepayments) is made on the Note, Lender is hereby 
irrevocably authorized by the Borrower to make an appropriate notation on 
a ledger forming a part of the Note reflecting the amount loaned or paid and 
the date thereof; provided however, the failure of the Lender to do so shall 
not relieve the Borrower or any other liable party of its liability hereunder 
or under the Note or subject the Borrower or any other liable party to 
additional liability under the Note. Furthermore, the Lender is hereby 
irrevocably authorized by the Borrower to attach to and to make a part of the 
Note a continuation of any such schedule of payments, as and when required, 
reflecting the amount paid and the date of such payment. The aggregate 
unpaid amount of the Loan reflected by the notations by the Lender on its 
records or a ledger sheet or sheets affixed to the Note shall be deemed 
rebuttably presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing on the Note. 
Interest provided for in this Agreement and in the Note shall be calculated 
on the unpaid sums actually loaned and outstanding pursuant to the terms of 
this Agreement (including accrued and unpaid interest added to principal in 
accordance with the terms hereof) and interest shall accrue only for the 
period from the date or dates advanced (or, in the case of accrued and 
unpaid interest added to principal in accordance with the terms hereof, 
from the date such interest was added to principal) until repaid. The 
liability for payment of principal evidenced by the Note shall be limited 
to the principal amounts actually loaned and outstanding or added to 
principal pursuant to this Agreement. All outstanding principal, including 
any amounts which have been added to principal, and accrued interest on the 
Loan shall be due and payable on the Final Maturity Date.

Section 2.07 Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower may at its 
option prepay the principal amount of the Note outstanding hereunder at any 
time, but only on any Payment Date, in whole or from time to time in part 
(but no partial prepayment shall be less than $1,000,000), without premium 
or penalty, upon giving the Lender at least five Business Days' prior notice 
of the aggregate principal amount to be prepaid, and in the event of any such 
notice being given, the amount so notified shall be due and payable on the 
day so notified, together with accrued interest on the outstanding principal 
amount of the Note to the date of prepayment. Voluntary prepayments of 
principal will be applied to installments of principal due hereunder in the 
inverse order of maturity.

Section 2.08 Mandatory Prepayments. The principal balance of the 
Loan made hereunder shall be payable in monthly installments on each Payment 
Date. On each Payment Date Borrower shall prepay the principal amount of the 
Loan outstanding hereunder in an amount equal to the amount by which the 
Monthly Payment Amount computed as of the end of the second month preceding 
the month in which such Payment Date falls exceeds the interest due on the 
Loan on such Payment Date. In addition, on any Payment Date on which the 
outstanding principal amount exceeds, or would pursuant to any of the 
provisions hereof exceed, the Maximum Principal Amount Borrower will prepay 
the outstanding principal amount of the Loan by an amount sufficient to 
reduce the outstanding principal amount on such Payment Date to the Maximum 
Principal Amount. Furthermore, if on any Semiannual Payment Date the 
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loan exceeds, or would 
pursuant to any of the provisions hereof exceed, the Scheduled Principal 
Amount for such date and the Trailing Twelve Month Cash Flow as of the end 
of the second preceding month is less than the Projected Twelve Month Cash 
Flow for the twelve month period ending at the end of such second preceding 
month, the Borrower on such Payment Date shall prepay the principal amount 
of the Loan outstanding hereunder in the amount necessary to reduce the 
outstanding principal balance to the Scheduled Principal Amount for such 
Semiannual Payment Date. Borrower will give Lender at least five Business 
Days prior notice of the aggregate principal amount to be prepaid on each 
Payment Date pursuant to this Section 2.08. Prepayments of principal under 
this Section 2.08 shall be without premium or penalty, and shall be made 
together with the payment of accrued interest on the outstanding principal 
amount of the Note. 

Section 2.09 Payment Procedure. All payments and prepayments 
made by the Borrower under the Note or this Agreement shall be made by wire 
transfer in immediately available funds before 1:00 p.m. Mountain Time on 
the date such payment is required to be made to the Lender's Account . Any 
payment received and accepted by the Lender after such time shall be 
considered for all purposes (including the calculation of interest, to the 
extent permitted by law) as having been made on the Lender's next following 
Business Day. All payments and prepayments received shall be applied first 
to accrued interest and then to the reduction of principal.

Section 2.10 Business Days. If the date for any loan payment or 
prepayment falls on a day which is not a Business Day, then for all purposes 
of the Note and this Agreement the same shall be deemed to have fallen on the 
next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case 
be included in the computation of payments of interest.

Section 2.11 Collateral. To secure full and complete payment and 
performance of the Indebtedness, the Borrower, as applicable, shall execute 
and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered the Security Instruments 
creating first and prior liens and security interests in the Collateral. 
Borrower, as applicable, shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed 
and delivered such further documents and instruments, including, without 
limitation, Uniform Commercial Code financing statements, as Lender, in its 
sole discretion, deems necessary or desirable to evidence and perfect its 
Liens in the Collateral.

Section 2.12 Setoff. Lender shall have the right to set off and 
apply against the Indebtedness in such manner as Lender may determine at any 
time and without notice to Borrower, the Borrower's interest in any and all 
amounts at any time owing from Lender (or any Affiliate of Lender), to 
Borrower in connection with the Mortgaged Properties, including without 
limitation, any production proceeds payable by any Affiliate of Lender to 
Borrower from any Mortgaged Property, upon the occurrence and continuance 
of an Event of Default, whether or not the Indebtedness is then due. In 
addition to Lender's right of setoff and as further security for the 
Indebtedness, Borrower hereby grants to Lender a security interest in all 
amounts at any time credited by or owing from Lender (or any Affiliate of 
Lender) to Borrower in connection with the Mortgaged Properties. The rights 
and remedies of Lender hereunder are in addition to other rights and remedies 
(including, without limitation, other rights of setoff) which Lender may have.

Section 2.13 Production Proceeds. From and after the occurrence 
of a Suspension Event, Borrower at the request of Lender shall direct and 
cause all purchasers of Hydrocarbons produced from the Mortgaged Properties 
to deposit all payments of any nature whatsoever due and owing by such 
Persons to Borrower directly into the Lender's Account. In this connection 
the Lender shall be authorized upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event to 
complete and deliver to such purchasers the Transfer Orders. Funds deposited 
in the Lender's Account in accordance with the terms hereof shall be credited 
when collected to the payment of the Indebtedness in accordance with the 
other provisions of this Agreement.

Section 2.14 Overriding Royalty Instruments; Production Agreements. 
Prior to making the Loan Borrower will execute, acknowledge and deliver to 
Lender the Conveyance of Overriding Royalty (EI Block 326), the Production 
Agreement (EI Block 326), the Conveyance of Overriding Royalty (Wagner & 
Brown) and the Production Agreement (Wagner & Brown). Borrower and Lender 
acknowledge that if Borrower makes any voluntary prepayments on the Loan 
pursuant to Section 2.07 and the Loan is repaid in full earlier than if the 
Loan had only been paid out of the application of the Monthly Payment Amounts 
accordance with Sections 2.04 and 2.08 that the effect would be to increase 
the value of the Eugene Island Block 326 Overriding Royalty since overriding 
royalty payments to Lender thereunder will commence at an earlier date. 
Accordingly, if any such prepayments are made and the Loan is repaid in full 
earlier than if the Loan had only been paid out of the application of Monthly 
Payment Amounts in accordance with Sections 2.04 and 2.08, Borrower and 
Lender will mutually agree upon what the value of the Eugene Island Block 326 
Overriding Royalty would have been if such prepayment had not occurred and 
any increased value of the Eugene Island Block 326 Overriding Royalty 
resulting from such prepayment and amend the Conveyance of Overriding Royalty 
(EI Block 326) to reduce the Overriding Royalty Percentage (as defined 
therein) so that the value of the Eugene Island Block 326 Overriding Royalty, 
as amended, equals the value that the Eugene Island Block 326 Overriding 
Royalty would have had if the prepayments had not been made. In the event 
the Loan is repaid in full on or before December 31, 1995, Borrower shall 
have the right to repurchase the Wagner & Brown Overriding Royalty for a 
purchase price to be mutually agreed upon between Borrower and Lender which 
when paid to Lender will result in an internal rate of return to Lender of 
1.271% per month. Such internal rate of return shall be calculated as 
specified in the definition of Termination Time in the Conveyance of 
Overriding Royalty (Wagner & Brown), but changing the rate 1.5% specified 
therein to 1.271%. In order to exercise this right, Borrower shall notify 
Lender of its election to repurchase on or before the time the Loan is 
finally paid. 

Section 2.15 Wagner & Brown Prospects. (a) Subject to the 
provisions of Section 2.15(b), Lender, at the request of Borrower, agrees 
upon commencement by Borrower of Scheduled Capital Operations on any Wagner 
& Brown Prospect to subordinate the Liens held by Lender securing payment of 
the Indebtedness, insofar as such Liens cover such Wagner & Brown Prospect, 
to the terms of any agreement entered into by Borrower with any third party 
or parties not Affiliated with Borrower providing financing to Borrower for 
such Scheduled Capital Operation or to which Borrower has farmed out an 
interest in (or made other similar arrangements, whether for cash, property 
or services, whereby such non- Affiliated third party pays for and receives 
a portion of) such Wagner & Brown Prospect. Prior to obtaining any 
subordination pursuant to this Section 2.15(a) Borrower shall pay the 
Release Price to Lender. Lender shall hold such funds as cash Collateral in 
accordance with the terms of this Section 2.15(a). No interest shall accrue 
on such cash Collateral, but as long as such cash Collateral is held by Lender 
and not applied on the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.15
(a), interest shall not accrue on a portion of the outstanding principal 
amount of the Loans equal to the amount so held by Lender. When the 
development of such Wagner & Brown Prospect has been completed, Borrower shall 
furnish Lender all information requested by Lender which is available to 
Borrower concerning such Prospect and Lender shall have 30 days after receipt 
of such information within which to notify Borrower whether Lender elects (i) 
to apply said Release Price to the payment of the Indebtedness in such order 
as Lender may direct and release the Liens held by Lender covering such Wagner 
& Brown Prospect, or (ii) return said Release Price to Borrower and retain 
the Liens held by Lender on Borrower's interest in such Wagner & Brown 
Prospect, subject to the subordination previously granted. Any releases or 
subordinations pursuant to this Section 2.15(a) shall be in form and 
substance satisfactory to Lender and shall be prepared at the expense of 
Borrower. 

(b) Lender's obligation to execute any subordination or release 
pursuant to Section 2.15(a) in connection with any Wagner & Brown Prospect 
shall be subject to satisfaction of the following conditions:

(i) Lender shall have received a written request from Borrower for 
the subordination or release;

(ii) No Default shall exist hereunder; 

(iii) Borrower shall have paid to Lender the Release Price; and 

(iv) Borrower shall have commenced such Scheduled Capital Operation 
within ninety (90) days following the date Borrower paid such Release Price. 
If such Scheduled Capital Operation is not commenced within such time period, 
Lender may return to Borrower such Release Price and the effect shall be as 
if Borrower had not exercised its rights under Section 2.15(a). Such 
Scheduled Capital Operation shall again be subject to the provisions of 
Section 2.15(a) in the event Borrower subsequently elects to proceed under 
such Section. Such Scheduled Capital Operation shall be deemed to have 
commenced on the date the rig charges begin accruing according to the terms 
of the applicable drilling contract. 

(c) In the event Lender elects to develop any Wagner & Brown 
Prospect pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.15(a), the Initial 
Scheduled Capital Costs Ceiling and Secondary Scheduled Capital Costs Ceiling 
shall be reduced by 110% of the applicable amounts set forth in Exhibit I 
with respect to such Prospect.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
______________________________

In order to induce the Lender to enter into this Agreement and to 
make the Loan hereunder, the Borrower represents and warrants to the Lender 
on the date hereof and as of the date of the Loan hereunder (which 
representations and warranties will survive the delivery of the Note and the 
making of the Loan thereunder) that:

Section 3.01 Corporate Existence. The Borrower is a corporation 
duly organized, legally existing and in good standing under the laws of the 
State of New York and is duly qualified to do business in Texas and Louisiana 
and in all other jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted 
by it makes such qualification necessary except where the failure to so 
qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.02 Corporate Power and Authorization. The Borrower has 
all requisite corporate power, and has all material governmental licenses, 
authorizations, consents and approvals necessary to own its assets and carry 
on its business as now being conducted or as proposed to be conducted. The 
Borrower has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver 
and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
to which it is a party; and the execution, delivery and performance by the 
Borrower of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. 

Section 3.03 Binding Obligations. This Agreement and the other 
Loan Documents constitute valid and binding obligations of Borrower enforceable 
in accordance with their terms (except that enforcement may be subject to any 
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws generally affecting the 
enforcement of creditors' rights).

Section 3.04 No Legal Bar or Resultant Lien. The execution, 
delivery and performance by Borrower of this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents do not and will not violate any provisions of the certificate of 
incorporation or bylaws of the Borrower or any contract, agreement, instrument 
or Governmental Requirement to which the Borrower is a party or is subject or 
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any Properties of the 
Borrower other than those provided for in this Agreement.

Section 3.05 No Consent. The execution, delivery and performance 
by the Borrower of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is 
a party do not require the consent or approval of any other Person which has 
not been obtained, including without limitation any Governmental Authority.

Section 3.06 Financial Condition. The audited consolidated 
balance sheet of the Borrower as at December 31, 1992 and the related 
consolidated statement of income, changes in shareholder's equity and cash 
flow of the Borrower for the period ended as of said date heretofore furnished 
to Lender and the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the 
Borrower dated as of September 30, 1993 heretofore furnished to Lender have 
been prepared in accordance with GAAP and present fairly the financial 
condition and changes in financial position of the Borrower as at the date 
or dates and for the period or periods stated. Since September 30, 1993 no 
change, either in any case or in the aggregate, has since occurred in the 
condition, financial or otherwise, of the Borrower which would have a Material 
Adverse Effect.

Section 3.07 Liabilities; Litigation. Except for liabilities 
incurred in the normal course of business which do not have a Material Adverse 
Effect, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has any material (individually 
or in the aggregate) liabilities, direct or contingent, except as disclosed 
or referred to in the Financial Statements or as disclosed to the Lender in 
Exhibit D. Except as disclosed to the Lender in Exhibit D, at the date of 
this Agreement there is no litigation, legal, administrative or arbitral 
proceeding, investigation or other action of any nature pending or, to the 
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or 
any Subsidiary which involves the possibility of any judgment or liability 
not fully covered by insurance, and which would have a Material Adverse 
Effect. No burdensome restriction, restraint, or hazard not customary in the 
oil and gas industry exists by contract, law or governmental regulation or 
otherwise that affects the Mortgaged Properties, except as disclosed to the 
Lender in Exhibit D.

Section 3.08 Taxes; Governmental Charges. The Borrower has filed 
all tax returns and reports required to be filed and has paid all taxes, 
assessments, fees and other governmental charges levied upon it or upon any 
of its Properties or income which are due and payable, including interest and 
penalties, or have provided adequate reserves for the payment thereof and in 
each case, if not filed or paid, could result in a Lien on any of the 
Mortgaged Properties.

Section 3.09 Title, etc. The Borrower has good and marketable 
title to the Mortgaged Properties, free and clear of all Liens except Liens 
allowed by Section . After giving full effect to the Excepted Liens, the 
Borrower owns the net interests in production of Hydrocarbons from the 
Mortgaged Properties set forth in the Security Instruments and the ownership 
of such Properties does not obligate Borrower to bear costs and expenses 
relating to the maintenance, development and operations of each such Property 
in an amount in excess of the working interest of each such Property set 
forth in the Security Instruments. Except as set forth on Exhibit D, all 
rentals and royalties due and payable in accordance with the terms of the 
leases and subleases comprising part of the Mortgaged Properties have been 
duly paid and such leases and subleases are in full force and effect. 

Section 3.10 Defaults. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary 
is in default nor has any event or circumstance occurred which, but for the 
passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default 
under any loan or credit agreement, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, 
security agreement, conveyance or production payment, production and delivery 
agreement or other agreement or instrument evidencing or pertaining to any 
Debt of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or under any material agreement or 
other instrument to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party or by 
which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound, except as disclosed to the 
Lender in Exhibit D. No Default hereunder has occurred and is continuing.

Section 3.11 Casualties; Taking of Properties. Since the date of 
the Financial Statements, no fire, explosion, earthquake, flood, drought, 
windstorm, accident, strike or other labor disturbance, embargo, requisition 
or taking of Property or cancellation of contracts, permits or concessions by 
any domestic or foreign government or any agency thereof, riot, activities of 
armed forces or acts of God or of any public enemy adversely affecting the 
Mortgaged Property or the operation thereof or that would adversely affect 
Borrower's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the 
other Loan Documents has occurred.

Section 3.12 Margin Stock. None of the Loan proceeds will be 
used for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" as defined 
in Regulation G of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(12 C.F.R. Part 207), or for the purpose of reducing or retiring any 
indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry a margin 
stock or for any other purpose which might constitute this transaction a 
"purpose credit" within the meaning of such Regulation G. The Borrower 
is not engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the 
business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying 
margin stocks. Neither the Borrower nor any Person acting on behalf of the 
Borrower has taken or will take any action which might cause the Note or any 
of the Security Instruments, including this Agreement, to violate Regulation 
G or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System or to violate Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or 
any rule or regulation thereunder, in each case as now in effect or as the 
same may hereinafter be in effect.

Section 3.13 Compliance with the Law. The Borrower and each 
Subsidiary is not in violation of any Governmental Requirement, which violation 
or failure would have (in the event such violation or failure were asserted by 
any Person through appropriate action) a Material Adverse Effect.

in all material respects with ERISA and, where applicable, the Code 
regarding each Plan.

(b) Each Plan is, and has been, maintained in substantial 
compliance with ERISA and, where applicable, the Code.

(c) No act, omission or transaction has occurred which 
could result in imposition on the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate 
(whether directly or indirectly) of (i) either a civil penalty 
assessed pursuant to Section 502(c) or (i) of ERISA or a tax imposed 
by Section 4975 of the Code or (ii) breach of fiduciary duty liability 
damages under Section 409 of ERISA.

(d) No Plan (other than a defined contribution Plan) or 
any trust created under any such Plan has been terminated since 
September 2, 1974 under circumstances in which the Borrower or any 
ERISA Affiliate has any current liability with respect to such Plan 
or trust. No liability to the PBGC (other than for the payment of 
current premiums which are not past due) by the Borrower or any ERISA 
Affiliate has been or is expected by the Borrower or any ERISA 
Affiliate to be incurred with respect to any Plan. No ERISA Event 
with respect to any Plan has occurred.

(e) Full payment has been made of all amounts which the 
Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate is required under the terms of each 
Plan or applicable law to have paid as contributions to such Plan as 
of the date hereof, and no accumulated funding deficiency (as defined 
in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code) whether or not 
waived, exists with respect to any Plan.

(f) The actuarial present value of the benefit liabilities 
under each Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA does not, as of 
the end of the Borrower's most recently ended fiscal year, exceed the 
current value of the assets (computed on a Plan termination basis in 
accordance with Title IV of ERISA) of such Plan allocable to such 
benefit liabilities. The term "actuarial present value of the benefit 
liabilities" shall have the meaning specified in Section 4041 of ERISA.

(g) Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, 
maintains or contributes to, or has at any time in the six-year period 
preceding the date of this Agreement sponsored, maintained or 
contributed to, any Multiemployer Plan.

(h) Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate is required 
to provide security under Section 401(a)(29) of the Code due to a Plan 
amendment that results in an increase in current liability for the 
Plan.

The Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate shall be deemed to be in 
compliance with the representations and warranties set forth in 
paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) above except where 
noncompliance (individually or in the aggregate) would have a Material 
Adverse Effect.

Section 3.15 Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any 
Subsidiary is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an 
"investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 
1940, as amended.

Section 3.16 Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither the 
Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" 
of a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a 
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company," or a "public utility" within the 
meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

Section 3.17 Subsidiaries. The Borrower has no Subsidiaries, 
except for those listed on Exhibit D, each of which are owned by the Borrower 
in the percentages set forth therein.

Section 3.18 Designated Contracts. (a) The Borrower has entered 
into that certain gas purchase and sale agreement with EGM dated of even date 
herewith pursuant to which gas produced from certain Mortgaged Properties will 
be sold to EGM for the term of such contract. Borrower acknowledges that the 
prices payable under such agreement represent the fair market value of the 
natural gas covered thereby, that the other terms thereof are fair and 
reasonable, that the agreement was the result of arms length negotiations 
between the parties thereto, and except for the natural gas covered by such 
agreement, Borrower is not obligated to sell oil or gas produced from the 
Mortgaged Properties to Lender or any of its Affiliates.

(b) The Borrower has entered into the Swap Agreement pursuant to 
which Borrower and Lender have agreed to a price swap on natural gas prices 
covering the notional quantities of natural gas described therein at the 
prices described therein. The fixed prices in the Swap Agreement represent 
the fair market value of the Swap Agreement at the time it was entered into, 
and the terms thereof are fair and reasonable and are the result of arms 
length negotiations between the parties thereto. The Borrower has entered 
into the Option Agreement with ERMS pursuant to which Borrower has purchased 
from ERMS a put or an option to purchase a put on natural gas prices covering 
certain notional quantities of natural gas described therein at the strike 
prices described therein. The premiums, strike prices and other terms of the 
Option Agreement represent the fair market value of price hedges thereunder 
at the time the Option Agreement were entered into and are the result of arms 
length negotiations between the parties thereto. Although Lender has required 
price protection of the type provided by the Swap Agreement and Option 
Agreement, as a condition to making the Loan hereunder, Borrower acknowledges 
that Lender has not required that such price protection be purchased from 
Lender or its Affiliates, and that Lender would have accepted comparable 
price protection purchased from another creditworthy party. The Swap 
Agreement and Option Agreement provide Borrower a significant benefit in 
reducing the risks of its business. The requirement that Borrower obtain 
price protection with the Loan is customary and reasonable for Loans of the 
type Lender has agreed to make hereunder.

(c) The agreements described in Sections (a) and (b) have not 
been modified, terminated, assigned or pledged by Borrower, are in full force 
and effect and no party is in default in the performance of its obligations 
thereunder.

balancing or similar provisions in accordance with which Hydrocarbons have 
been or may be produced and delivered without Borrower then or thereafter 
receiving full payment therefor and no gas imbalances presently exist. 
Except as set forth in Exhibit D, none of the Mortgaged Properties is subject 
to any contractual or other arrangement whereby payment for production 
therefrom is to be deferred for a substantial period of time after the month 
in which such production is delivered (i.e., in the case of oil, not in excess 
of 60 days, and in the case of gas, not in excess of 90 days). Except as set 
forth on Exhibit D, none of the Mortgaged Properties is subject to a 
contractual or other arrangement for the sale of oil or gas production for a 
fixed price which cannot be cancelled on 90 days (or less) notice or which 
contains terms which are not customary in the industry. None of the Mortgaged 
Properties are subject at present to any regulatory refund obligation and no 
facts exist which might cause the same to be imposed. 

Section 3.21 Rate Filings. The Borrower has not violated any 
provisions of The Natural Gas Act or any other Federal or State law or any of 
the regulations thereunder (including those of the respective conservation 
Commissions and Land Offices of the various jurisdictions having authority 
over Mortgaged Properties) with respect to any Mortgaged Property which would 
have a Material Adverse Effect, and Borrower has made all necessary rate 
filings, certificate applications, well category filings, interim collection 
filings and notices, and any other filings or certifications, and has received 
all necessary regulatory authorizations (including without limitation necessary 
authorizations, if any, with respect to any processing arrangements conducted 
by it or others respecting the Mortgaged Properties or production therefrom) 
required under said laws and regulations with respect to the Mortgaged 
Properties and the production therefrom so as not to have a Material Adverse 
Effect. Said material rate filings, certificate applications, well category 
filings, interim collection filings and notices, and other filings and 
certifications contain no untrue statements of material facts nor do they 
omit any statements of material facts necessary in said filings.

Section 3.22 Environmental Matters. Except for matters that would 
not have a Material Adverse Affect:

(a) Neither the Mortgaged Property nor the operations conducted 
thereon violate any order or requirement of any court or Governmental 
Authority with respect to human health or environmental quality or any 
Environmental Laws, nor are there any conditions existing on any such 
Property or resulting from operations conducted thereon that may give rise 
to any on-site or off-site remedial obligations under any Environmental Laws.

(b) Neither the Mortgaged Property nor the operations currently 
conducted thereon or by any prior owner or operator of such Mortgaged 
Property or operation, are subject to any existing, pending or, to the best 
of Borrower's knowledge, threatened action, suit, investigation, inquiry or 
proceeding by or before any court or Governmental Authority.

(c) All notices, permits, licenses or similar authorizations, if 
any, required to be obtained or filed in connection with the operation or use

solid waste into the environment, have been duly obtained or filed, and 
Borrower is in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such notices, 
permits, licenses and similar authorizations.

having similar requirements, all hazardous substances or solid waste generated 
at any and all of the Mortgaged Property have been transported only by carriers 
maintaining valid permits under RCRA and any other Environmental Law and 
treated and disposed of only at treatment, storage and disposal facilities 
maintaining valid permits under RCRA and any other Environmental Law, which 
carriers and facilities have been and are operating in compliance with such 
permits and are not the subject of any existing, pending or, to the best of 
Borrower's knowledge, threatened action, investigation or inquiry by any 
Governmental Authority in connection with any Environmental Laws.

(e) Borrower has taken all steps necessary to determine and have 
determined that no hazardous substances or solid waste have been disposed of 
or otherwise released and there has been no threatened release of any hazardous 
substances on or to any of the Mortgaged Property except in compliance with 
Environmental Laws.

(f) The Borrower does not have any contingent liability in 
connection with any release or threatened release of any hazardous substance 
or solid waste on or from the Mortgaged Property.

Section 3.23 Qualification to Hold Federal Oil and Gas Leases The 
Borrower is duly qualified to own, hold and operate offshore and onshore 
federal oil and gas leases. 

Section 3.24 Operations of Oil and Gas Properties. The Mortgaged 
Properties have been maintained, operated and developed in a good and 
workmanlike manner and in conformity in all material respects with all 
applicable laws and all rules, regulations and orders of all duly constituted 
authorities having jurisdiction and in conformity in all material respects 
with the provisions of all leases, subleases or other contracts comprising a 
part of such Mortgaged Properties. None of the Mortgaged Property is subject 
to having allowable production reduced below the full and regular allowable 
(including the maximum permissible tolerance) because of an overproduction 
(whether or not the same was permissible at the time) prior to the date 
hereof. None of the wells comprising a part of the Mortgaged Properties are 
deviated from the vertical more than the maximum permitted by applicable laws, 
regulations, rules and orders, and such wells are, in fact, bottomed under 
and are producing from, and the well bores are wholly within the Mortgaged

effect insurance satisfying all of the requirements of Section .

Section 3.26 Payments by Purchasers of Production. All proceeds 
from the sale of the Borrower's interests in Hydrocarbons from the Mortgaged 
Properties are currently being paid in full to Borrower by the purchaser or 
remitter thereof on a timely basis and at prices and terms comparable to 
market prices in terms generally available at the time such prices and terms 
were negotiated for oil and gas production from producing areas situated near 
the Mortgaged Properties, and none of such proceeds are currently being held 
in suspense by such purchaser or any other party. 

Section 3.27 South Africa. The Borrower does not directly or 
indirectly have business operations or assets in South Africa or business

of Section 16640, et seq., of the California Government Code.

Section 3.28 Disclosure. All of the Basic Data are accurate an

To the best of Borrower's knowledge, none of such data contains an untrue 
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact which is 
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each Reserve 
Report submitted by Borrower to Lender hereunder was prepared in accordance 
with customary oil and gas engineering practices and is based on historical 
information which is accurate and complete in all material respects to the 
best of the knowledge of Borrower; however, Borrower makes no representation 
or warranty regarding the accuracy of the forecasts, projections or quantity 
of reserves or producibility thereof reflected in the Reserve Reports.

Section 3.29 Purchase Agreements. All of the representations and 
warranties made by the seller of any portion of the Mortgaged Properties i

performance of any of the covenants or agreements contained in any Security 
Instrument other than this Agreement and such default shall continue 
unremedied for a period of 30 days after the earlier to occur of (i) notice 
thereof to the Borrower by the Lender, or (ii) the Borrower otherwise 
becoming aware of such default; or

(j) Any Loan Document shall cease to be in full force 
and effect or shall be declared null and void or the validity or enforcement 
thereof shall be contested or challenged by Borrower or any of its 
Affiliates, or Borrower shall deny that it has any further liability or 
obligation under any of the Loan Documents; or 

(k) Any violation of any Environmental Law affecting any 
of Borrower's Oil and Gas Properties, whether now owned or hereafter acquired

than one referred to in clause (e), (f) or (g) of Section , the Lender may by 
notice to the Borrower, cancel the Commitment and/or declare the principal

amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder and under the Note to be forthwith 
due and payable, whereupon such amounts shall be immediately due and payable 
without presentment, demand, protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice 
of acceleration or other formalities of any kind, all of which are hereby 
expressly waived by the Borrower.

(b) In the case of the occurrence of an Event of Default referred 
to in clause (e), (f) or (g) of Section , the Commitment shall be automatically 
cancelled and the principal amount then outstanding of, and the accrued 
interest on, the Loan and all other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder 
and under the Notes shall become automatically immediately due and payable 
without presentment, demand, protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice

subject to the limitations contained in Section 6.03, may exercise all rights 
and remedies available to it in law or in equity under the Loan Documents, or 
otherwise.

(d) All proceeds received after maturity of the Note, whether by 
acceleration or otherwise shall be applied to the Indebtedness in such order 
as the Lender in its discretion shall determine. 

Section 6.03 Limited Recourse. Subject to the rest of this

occurs in the timely and proper payment of the Note, any judicial proceedings 
brought by Lender against Borrower shall be limited to the attachment, 
execution, writ of process, preservation, enforcement and foreclosure against 
Borrower's interest in the Collateral, and no attachment, execution of other 
writ or process shall be sought, issued to or levied upon any assets, 
properties or funds of Borrower. If Lender exercises any remedy which it may 
have available against the Borrower's interest in the Collateral, no judgment 
for any deficiency upon the Note shall be sought or obtained by Lender against 
the Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the 
Borrower shall be fully liable to Lender to the same extent that the Borrower 
would be liable absent the foregoing provisions of this Section: (a) for the 
amount of damage, if any, caused by Borrower's fraud or willful misconduct; 
(b) for the amount of any proceeds or other income arising with respect to 
the Collateral collected or received by Borrower, and not turned over to 
Lender after the date on which a Default has occurred; (c) for the reasonable 
attorneys' fees and court costs incurred by Lender in the following 
circumstances: (A) for enforcement of Borrower's liability as set forth 
herein, or (B) if, after default by Borrower and notice of Lender's intent 
to accelerate maturity and foreclose, Borrower (or anyone claiming by, 
through or under Borrower) attempts to contest, interfere with, hinder or 
delay the foreclosure or instigates a bankruptcy proceeding which has the 
effect of staying the foreclosure; (d) for the amount of damage, if any caused 
by a breach of representation, warranty or covenant by Borrower in the Loan 
Documents including, but not limited to, representations and warranty of 
title; and (e) for any amount owed under any indemnity by Borrower in the 
Loan Documents.

Section 6.04 Suspension of Capital Expense Deductions. If a 
Material Adverse Effect occurs or if a Default exists, Lender in addition to 
any other remedy available to Lender may, by notice to Borrower, suspend 
Borrower's right to thereafter deduct any Capital Expenses thereafter 
incurred by Borrower in the calculation of the Monthly Payment Amount, 
except for such Capital Expenses as are approved in writing by Lender after 
the date of such notice.

not satisfied with respect to the portion of the Wagner & Brown Properties 
referred to as the "Guerra tract", the amount to be advanced in connection 
with the initial funding of the Loan will be reduced by $10,152,000 unles
s the provisions of Section 7.02(b) are applicable. In the event said 
$10,152,000 is not funded by Lender in connection with the initial funding of 
the Loan, then subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 7.02, 
Lender will advance such $10,152,000 on the earlier of (i) Lender's receipt 
of title opinions and other title information satisfactory to Lender with 
respect to Borrower's title to the Guerra tract or (ii) Lender's receipt of 
a letter of credit from a bank satisfactory to Lender in an amount and from 
a bank that is satisfactory to Lender and containing such terms as are 
satisfactory to Lender, which letter of credit shall provide security to 
Lender for title defects relating to such the Guerra tract. Lender's 
obligation to fund said $10,152,000 upon the occurrence of one of the two 
events described in the preceding sentence shall be subject to satisfaction 
of closing conditions similar to those set forth in Section 7.01, Lender's 
receipt of a Borrowing Request not less than 5 but not more than 10 Business 
Days before the date such additional loan amount is to be advanced and such 
other information contemplated by the Loan Documents as the Lender may 
reasonably request concerning the amount to be advanced.

(b) If Borrower has not satisfied the condition in Section 7.01(i) 
with respect to the Guerra tract, and all other conditions to funding of the 
Loan have been satisfied, the amount to be advanced in connection with the 
initial funding of the Loan will not be reduced as provided in Section

Mountain Time one Business Day prior to the date of funding specified in the 
initial Borrowing Request Borrower shall have furnished Lender a form of 
letter of credit to be issued to Lender in an amount and from a bank 
satisfactory to Lender, containing terms satisfactory to Lender and providing 
security for title defects with respect to the Guerra tract, and (ii) Borrower 
shall have caused such letter of credit to be issued to Lender by said bank 
on said terms on or before the time of such initial funding of the Loan. 

(c) If Borrower causes a letter of credit to be issued to Lender 
pursuant to Section 7.02(a) or (b) which is acceptable to Lender for the 
purposes of funding the $10,152,000 referred to therein, but upon termination 
of such letter of credit Lender has not been furnished title opinions and 
other title information satisfactory to Lender with regard to Borrower's 
title to the Guerra tract and proceeds of the letter of credit for any 
reason (or other voluntary prepayments of the Loan by Borrower) have not 
been paid to Lender in an amount satisfactory to Lender to compensate for 
any title deficiencies, (or lack of satisfactory title opinions or title 
information), then at the option of Lender an Event of Default shall exist 
and Lender shall be entitled to exercise all of its rights and remedies under 
Article 6 of this Agreement in connection therewith. Borrower at the request 
of Lender will furnish Lender any documents or instruments required to enable 
Lender to demand payment under any such letter of credit. Borrower will not 
consent to any settlement of any title defects in connection with the Guerra 
tract unless Lender shall have consented thereto in writing. Borrower will

connection with the resolution of title defects with regard to the Guerra 
tract and will assert any title defects requested by Lender. If as a result 
of title defects which are asserted with regard to the Guerra tract, the 
seller of the Wagner & Brown Properties exercises any right to rescind the 
sale of the Wagner & Brown Properties, Lender shall have the option to 
declare the Loan and all interest accrued thereon immediately due and 
payable. If the sale of the Wagner & Brown Properties is rescinded by the 
seller and the Loan, all interest accrued thereon, all amounts due in 
connection with termination of the Swap Agreement and any other Price 
Protection Agreements and all fees and expenses incurred in connection 
herewith are paid in full, Lender agrees at the expense of Borrower to 
release the Security Instruments as well as Lender's interests under the 
Conveyance of Overriding Royalty (EI Block 326), Conveyance of Overriding 
Royalty (Wagner & Brown), the Production Agreement (EI Block 326) and the 
Production Agreement (Wagner & Brown).

to the provisions of Section 7.02(a), the amount of the Loan to be advanced 
by Lender in connection with the initial funding will be reduced by 
$1,400,000. Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 7.02(d), 
said amount will be advanced by Lender upon receipt by Lender of title 
opinions and other title information satisfactory to Lender showing that 
Borrower owns oil and gas leases covering the "U Sand Prospect" (as described 
in Exhibit Q) relating to a portion of the Guerra tract and other lands 
providing Borrower with a net revenue interest in said prospect of not less 
than 37.5%. If prior to June 30, 1994, Borrower furnishes Lender title 
opinions and other title information satisfactory to Lender showing that 
Borrower owns oil and gas leases covering the U Sand Prospect providing 
Borrower with a net revenue interest in said prospect of greater than 12% 
but less than 37.5%, then subject to the remaining provisions of this 
Section 7.02(d), Lender will advance to Borrower $54,900 for each 1% net 
revenue interest in the U Sand Prospect owned by Borrower in excess of 12%. 
Lender's obligation to fund said $1,400,000, or any portion thereof, shall 
be subject to satisfaction of closing conditions similar to those set forth 
in Section 7.01, Lender's receipt of a Borrowing Request not less than 5 but 
not more than 10 Business Days before the date such additional loan amount 
is to be advanced, amendments (at the expense of Borrower) to the Security 
Instruments covering the Wagner & Brown Properties, the Conveyance of 
Overriding Royalty (Wagner and Brown) and the Production Agreement 
(Wagner & Brown) in a manner acceptable to Lender to add all of the leases 
acquired by Borrower in connection with the U Sand Prospect to the properties 
covered thereby and such other information contemplated by the Loan Documents

its Affiliates or for which neither Enron Corp. nor its Affiliates serve as 
administrative agent shall be subject to Borrower's prior written consent 
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that the Lender grants 
participations in the Note or other Indebtedness of the Borrower incurred or 
to be incurred pursuant to this Agreement, to other lenders, each of such 
other lenders shall have the rights of set off against such Indebtedness and 
similar rights or Liens to the same extent as may be available to the Lender. 
In the event Lender's interest hereunder is assigned to more than one 
assignee, Borrower shall not be required to pay fees or expenses of more 
than one law firm, accounting firm or consultant to represent the interests 
of all Lenders hereunder with respect to the same issue.

the Indebtedness originally represented by the Note or of any part of such 
other Indebtedness.

Section 8.09 Waivers. No course of dealing on the part of the 
Lender, its officers, employees, consultants or agents, nor any failure or 
delay by the Lender with respect to exercising any right, power or privilege 
of the Lender under the Note, this Agreement or any other Security Instrument 
shall operate as a waiver thereof, except as otherwise provided in Section 
hereof.

Section 8.10 Cumulative Rights. Rights and remedies of the Lender 
under the Note, this Agreement and each other Security Instrument shall be 
cumulative, and the exercise or partial exercise of any such right or remedy 
shall not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy.

Section 8.11 Singular and Plural. Words used herein in the 
singular, where the context so permits, shall be deemed to include the plural 
and vice versa. The definitions of words in the singular herein shall apply 
to such words when used in the plural where the context so permits and vice 
versa.

Section 8.12 Construction. The parties acknowledge and agree that 
Borrower's principal place of business is located in the State of Colorado, 
that significant negotiations in connection herewith took place in the State 
of Colorado and that material obligations, including payment of the Note and 
other obligations hereunder are to be performed in the State of Colorado. 
Accordingly, the parties agree that this Agreement and the loan transactions 
evidenced in part by this Agreement bear a reasonable relationship to the 
State of Colorado and, except to the extent the laws of any other state are 
applicable to any Security Agreement covering Collateral located in or offshore 
of such state, this Agreement, the Note and the rights and obligations of the 
parties in connection with the loan transactions evidenced in part by this 
Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of 
the State of Colorado, without reference to conflicts of laws rules or 
principles of any other state.

Section 8.13 Interest. It is the intention of the parties hereto 
to conform strictly to usury laws applicable to this transaction. Accordingly, 
if the transactions contemplated hereby would be usurious under applicable 
law, then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the 
Note, this Agreement or in any other Security Instrument or agreement entered 
into in connection with or as security for the Note, it is agreed as follows: 
(i) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under law 
applicable to the Lender that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or 
received under the Note, this Agreement or under any of the other aforesaid 
Security Instruments or agreements or otherwise in connection with this 
transaction shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount allowed by 
such applicable law, and any excess shall be cancelled automatically and if 
therefore paid shall be credited by the Lender on the principal amount of the 
Indebtedness (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the Indebtedness 
shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to the Borrower); 
and (ii) in the event that the maturity of the Note is accelerated by reason 
of an election of the Lender resulting from any Event of Default under this 
Agreement or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted 
prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest under law 
applicable to this transaction may never include more than the maximum amount 
allowed by such applicable law, and (iii) excess interest, if any, provided 
for in this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Loans shall be 
cancelled automatically and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited by the 
Lender on the principal amount of the Indebtedness (or, to the extent that 
the principal amount of the Indebtedness shall have been or would thereby 
be paid in full, refunded by the Lender to the Borrower). The right to 
accelerate the maturity of the Note does not include the right to accelerate 
any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, 
and the Lender does not intend to collect any unearned interest in the event 
of acceleration. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Lender for the 
use, forbearance or detention of sums included in the Indebtedness shall, to 
the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and 
spread throughout the full term of the Note until payment in full so that the 
rate or amount of interest on account of the Indebtedness does not exceed the 
applicable usury ceiling, if any. As used in this Section the term 
"applicable law" shall mean the laws which govern this Agreement as described 
in Section (or the law of any other jurisdiction whose laws may be mandatorily 
applicable notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement), or law of the 
United States of America applicable to the Lender and the Loans which would 
permit the Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a greater 
amount of interest than under any other applicable law. 

Section 8.14 References.. The words "herein," "hereof," 
"hereunder" and other words of similar import when used in this Agreement 
refer to this Agreement as a whole, and not to any particular article, 
section or subsection. Any reference herein to a Section or Subsection

Agreement unless otherwise stated herein. Any reference herein to an exhibit 
shall be deemed to refer to the applicable exhibit attached hereto unless 
otherwise stated herein. 

Section 8.15 Taxes, etc.. Any taxes (excluding income taxes) 
payable or ruled payable by federal or state authority in respect of the Note, 
this Agreement or the other Security Instruments shall be paid by the 
Borrower, together with interest and penalties, if any.

Section 8.16 Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this 
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Lender shall not be obligated 
to extend credit to the Borrower in an amount in violation of any limitation 
or prohibition provided by any applicable statute or regulation. 

Section 8.17 Entire Agreement. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN

AND THE BORROWER AND SUPERSEDE ALL OTHER AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS 
BETWEEN SUCH PARTIES RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND THEREOF. THIS 
WRITTEN LOAN AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF 
PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. 
THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

are incorporated herein and shall be considered a part of this Agreement for

this Agreement or the exhibits hereto are only for the convenience of the 
parties and shall not be construed to have any effect or meaning with respect

divisions, such other content being controlling as to the agreement between

certificate, instrument or other writing, or any action taken or to be taken, 
is by the terms of this Agreement required to be satisfactory to any party, 
the determination of such satisfaction shall be made by such party in its 
sole and exclusive judgment exercised in good faith.

or more counterparts, and it shall not be necessary that the signatures of 
all parties hereto be contained on any one counterpart hereof; each 
counterpart shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall

valuable consideration to Grantor cash in hand paid by Grantee,
the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
Grantor does hereby GRANT, BARGAIN, SELL, CONVEY, ASSIGN, SET
OVER and DELIVER unto Grantee effective as of the date hereof an
overriding royalty interest in each of the Subject Interests and
in and to the Hydrocarbons in and under and that may be produced

Royalty Percentage of the Net Profit attributable to the Subject
Interests, together with all and singular the rights and appurte
nances thereto in anywise belonging (the "Overriding Royalty").

successors and assigns forever, subject to the following terms,
provisions and conditions.

Section 1.02 Non-Operating Interest. The Overriding
Royalty conveyed hereby is a non-operating interest (being a real

any costs, expenses or liabilities attributable to the Subject
Interests (or any part thereof) or incurred in connection with
the production, saving or delivery of Subject Hydrocarbons. This
Conveyance is a conveyance of a real right.

Section 1.03 Certain Limitations. The Overriding Royalty
shall be subject to the following provisions:

(a) Grantee shall look solely to its share of the Subject
Hydrocarbons for satisfaction and discharge of the
Overriding Royalty, and Grantor shall not be personally
liable for the payment and discharge thereof.

(b) There shall not be included in the Subject Hydrocarbons
any Lease Use Hydrocarbons, or Non-Consent
Hydrocarbons, it being understood that the Overriding
Royalty shall be computed and delivered out of the
Overriding Royalty Percentage of Hydrocarbons available
after satisfaction of all of the foregoing.

Section 1.04 Royalties; Taxes. The Overriding Royalty
shall be delivered only after satisfaction of (and after
deduction for) any and all royalties and other burdens on

Unless made expressly subject and subordinate to this Conveyance
on terms satisfactory to Grantee, Grantor shall not mortgage,
pledge or hypothecate the Subject Interests or create or allow to

subordinate to this Conveyance. Any purported mortgage, pledge,
hypothecation, lien, security interest, assignment, sale,
conveyance or other transfer in contravention of the foregoing
terms shall be null and void. Grantor shall not pool,
communitize or unitize the Overriding Royalty or the Subject
Interests without the express written consent of Grantee, and any
purported pooling, communitization or unitization in
contravention of the preceding clause shall be null and void as
to Grantee and shall not have the effect of pooling or affecting
the Overriding Royalty.

Section 1.06 Title. Grantor warrants and represents that
the Leases are valid and subsisting oil and gas leases covering
the lands described in Exhibit A; that Grantor's ownership of the
Oil and Gas Interests entitles Grantor to a percentage of all
Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from the Leases and of
the proceeds of such production, after giving effect to and/or

Exhibit A. Grantor hereby binds itself and its legal representa
tives, successors and assigns, to warrant and forever defend all
and singular title to the Overriding Royalty and the Overriding
Royalty Hydrocarbons, subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances,
unto Grantee, its successors and assigns, against every person
whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part
thereof. There is also hereby conveyed to Grantee, by way of
substitution and subrogation, all rights of warranty and
contractual representations or covenants of any kind or nature
held by Grantor against any of Grantor's respective predecessors
in title.

Section 1.07 Payment of Proceeds. (a) On each Payment
Date Grantor shall pay to Grantee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account as may be designated by Grantee
by notice to Grantor from time to time the amount by which the

preceding the Month in which each such Payment Date occurs

their respective successors and assigns. All references herein
to either Grantor or Grantee shall include their respective
successors and assigns.

Section 3.03 Counterpart Execution. This Conveyance may
be executed in multiple originals all of which shall constitute
one and the same Conveyance.

Section 3.04 Certain References. Certain agreements,
contracts and other documents are listed in Exhibit A and
included in the definition of Permitted Encumbrances. References
herein or in Exhibit A to Permitted Encumbrances are made solely
for the purpose of protecting Grantor on Grantor's warranties and
representations as to the Subject Interests, and without regard
to whether or not any Permitted Encumbrance is valid, subsisting,
legal or enforceable or affects the Overriding Royalty; and such
references are not intended to constitute and shall not
constitute any sort of recognition or acknowledgment by any party
as to the validity, legality or enforceability of the same or of
any term, provision or condition thereof or the applicability
thereof to the Overriding Royalty, and shall not revive or ratify
the same or create any rights in any third person. With respect
to the Subject Interests governed by Louisiana law no provision
in this Agreement shall be construed as an agreement or
expression of intent by Grantee to acquire the Overriding Royalty
subject to any unrecorded Permitted Encumbrances; provided
however, no breach of any warranty of title hereunder shall arise
as the result of any claim made pursuant to any unrecorded
Permitted Encumbrance.

Section 3.05 Purchase Option. Grantee hereby grants
Grantor the option to purchase the Overriding Royalty at any time
on or after the Commencement Time for a purchase price equal to
the fair market value of the Overriding Royalty, as mutually
determined by Grantee and Grantor, as of the effective date of
such purchase. Grantor may elect to exercise such option by
notifying Grantee in writing. Grantee shall have no obligation
under this Section 3.05 unless the parties shall have agreed in
writing on the fair market value of the Overriding Royalty. The
purchase price shall be payable in immediately available funds at
the closing of such purchase. At the closing of Grantor's
purchase of the Overriding Royalty, Grantee shall deliver to

the effective date used to determine the purchase price and
containing a special warranty of title as to matters arising by,
through and under Grantee, but not otherwise.

Section 3.06 Partial Invalidity. Except as otherwise
expressly stated herein, in the event any provision contained in
this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable by a court or regulatory agency of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect.

Section 3.07 Abandonment Cost Account. In the event that,
as of the end of any month, the aggregate estimated future Net
Profit from the Subject Interests, as estimated in Grantor's most
recent reserve report, is less than 500% of the aggregate future
Abandonment Costs for all of the Subject Interests, as estimated
in such reserve report, Grantor may establish a separate account
(the "Abandonment Cost Account") and place therein an amount
equal to twenty percent (20%) of the amount otherwise payable to
Grantee hereunder (calculated without taking into account the
placing of such amounts in the Abandonment Cost Account for the
Subject Interests) for such month. At such time as the amount in

twelve percent (12%) of the aggregate estimated future Abandon
ment Costs for all of the Subject Interests, no further amount
shall be placed in such account until such time as the funds in
the Abandonment Cost Account shall be less than ten percent (10%)

added to the said Abandonment Cost Account. At any time, on or
prior to the date which any such Abandonment Costs must be

expended amounts for Abandonment Costs on the Subject Interests
for which an Abandonment Cost Account has been established,
Grantor shall release from the Abandonment Cost Account the
lesser of (i) an amount equal to said Abandonment Costs or
(ii) the total amount of funds in the Abandonment Cost Account
for the Subject Interests and to pay those amounts to Grantor.
If less than all of the funds in the Abandonment Cost Account are
to be released and paid to Grantor after Grantor has incurred and
paid all Abandonment Costs relating to all of the Subject
Interests, then the amounts, if any, in the Abandonment Cost
Account shall be released to Grantee.

Section 3.08 Perpetuities. It is not the intent of
Grantor or Grantee that any provision herein violate any
applicable law regarding the rule against perpetuities, the
suspension of the absolute power of alienation, or other rules
regarding the vesting or duration of estates, and this Conveyance
shall be construed as not violating such rule to the extent the
same can be so construed consistent with the intent of the
parties. In the event however that any provision hereof is
determined to violate such rule, then such provision shall
nevertheless be effective for the maximum period (but not longer
than the maximum period) permitted by such rule that will result
in no violation. To the extent the maximum period is permitted
to be determined by reference to "lives in being," Grantor and
Grantee agree that "lives in being" shall refer to lifetime of
the last to die of the living lineal descendants of the late
Joseph P. Kennedy (father of the late President of the United

Section 3.04 Certain References. Certain agreements,
contracts and other documents are listed in Exhibit A and
included in the definition of Permitted Encumbrances. References
herein or in Exhibit A to Permitted Encumbrances are made solely
for the purpose of protecting Grantor on Grantor's warranties and
representations as to the Subject Interests, and without regard
to whether or not any Permitted Encumbrance is valid, subsisting,
legal or enforceable or affects the Overriding Royalty; and such
references are not intended to constitute and shall not
constitute any sort of recognition or acknowledgment by any party
as to the validity, legality or enforceability of the same or of
any term, provision or condition thereof or the applicability
thereof to the Overriding Royalty, and shall not revive or ratify
the same or create any rights in any third person. No provision

expression of intent by Grantee to acquire the Overriding Royalty
subject to any unrecorded Permitted Encumbrances; provided
however, no breach of any warranty of title hereunder shall arise
as the result of any claim made pursuant to any unrecorded
Permitted Encumbrance.

Section 3.05 Purchase Option. Grantee hereby grants
Grantor the option to purchase the Overriding Royalty at any time
on or after the Commencement Time for a purchase price equal to
the fair market value of the Overriding Royalty, as mutually
determined by Grantee and Grantor, as of the effective date of

expressly stated herein, in the event any provision contained in
this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable by a court or regulatory agency of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect.

Section 3.07 Abandonment Cost Account. In the event that,
as of the end of any month, the aggregate estimated future Net
Profit from the Subject Interests, as estimated in Grantor's most
recent reserve report, is less than 500% of the aggregate future
Abandonment Costs for all of the Subject Interests, as estimated
in such reserve report, Grantor may establish a separate account
(the "Abandonment Cost Account") and place therein an amount
equal to twenty percent (20%) of the amount otherwise payable to
Grantee hereunder (calculated without taking into account the
placing of such amounts in the Abandonment Cost Account for the
Subject Interests) for such month. At such time as the amount in
the Abandonment Cost Account for the Subject Interests exceeds
twenty-four percent (24%) of the aggregate estimated future
Abandonment Costs for all of the Subject Interests, no further
amount shall be placed in such account until such time as the
funds in the Abandonment Cost Account shall be less than twenty
percent (20%) of said aggregate estimated future Abandonment
Costs. Any interest accrued on the account funds shall be
retained in and added to the said Abandonment Cost Account. At
any time, on or prior to the date which any such Abandonment
Costs must be incurred and Grantor is required to expend amounts
or has expended amounts for Abandonment Costs on the Subject
Interests for which an Abandonment Cost Account has been estab
lished, Grantor shall release from the Abandonment Cost Account
the lesser of (i) an amount equal to said Abandonment Costs or
(ii) the total amount of funds in the Abandonment Cost Account
for the Subject Interests and to pay those amounts to Grantor.
If less than all of the funds in the Abandonment Cost Account are
to be released and paid to Grantor after Grantor has incurred and
paid all Abandonment Costs relating to all of the Subject
Interests, then the amounts, if any, in the Abandonment Cost
Account shall be released to Grantee.

Section 3.08 Perpetuities. It is not the intent of
Grantor or Grantee that any provision herein violate any
applicable law regarding the rule against perpetuities, the
suspension of the absolute power of alienation, or other rules
regarding the vesting or duration of estates, and this Conveyance
shall be construed as not violating such rule to the extent the
same can be so construed consistent with the intent of the
parties. In the event however that any provision hereof is
determined to violate such rule, then such provision shall
nevertheless be effective for the maximum period (but not longer
than the maximum period) permitted by such rule that will result
in no violation. To the extent the maximum period is permitted
to be determined by reference to "lives in being," Grantor and
Grantee agree that "lives in being" shall refer to lifetime of
the last to die of the living lineal descendants of the late
Joseph P. Kennedy (father of the late President of the United
States of America).

such coverages shall contain provisions that no cancellation or

thirty (30) days' advance written notice thereof to Lender.
Irrespective of the requirements as to insurance to be carried as
provided for herein, the insolvency, bankruptcy or failure of any
insurance company carrying insurance of Borrower, the failure of
any insurance company to pay claims accruing, or the inadequacy

_________________________

Loss or damage, if any under this Policy, shall be payable to the
mortgagees (or trustees), as designated by endorsement or by
certificates of insurance, and this insurance, as to the interest
of the mortgagee (or trustee) only therein, shall not be
invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor or owner of
the within described property, nor by any foreclosure or other
proceedings or notice of sale relating to the property, nor by
any change in the title or ownership of the property, nor by the
occupation of the premises for purposes more hazardous than are

mortgagor or owner neglect to pay any premium due under this
Policy, the mortgagee (or trustee) shall, on demand, pay the
same.

Provided, also, that the mortgagee (or trustee) shall notify the
Underwriter of any change of ownership or occupancy or increase
of hazard which shall come to the knowledge of said mortgagee (or
trustee) and unless permitted by this Policy, it shall be noted

premium for such increased hazard for the term of the use
thereof; otherwise this Policy shall be null and void.

The Underwriters reserve the right to cancel this Policy at any
time as provided by its terms, but in such case this Policy shall
continue in force for the benefit only of the mortgagee (or
trustee) for ten (10) days after notice to the mortgagee (or
trustee) of such cancellation, and shall then cease, and the
Underwriters shall have the right, on like notice, to cancel this
agreement.

Whenever the Underwriters shall pay the mortgagee (or trustee)
any sum for loss or damage under this Policy and shall claim
that, as to the mortgagor or owner, no liability therefore
existed, the Underwriters shall, to the extent of such payment,
be thereupon legally subrogated to all the rights of the party to
whom such payment shall be made, under all securities held as
collateral to the mortgage debt, or may at its option pay to the
mortgagee (or trustee) the whole principal due, or to grow due on
the mortgage, with interest, and shall thereupon receive a full
assignment and transfer of the mortgage and of all such other
securities; but no subrogation shall impair the right of the
mortgagee (or trustee) to recover the full amount of the claim.

December 30, 1993

Joint Energy Development Investments
Limited Partnership
1400 Smith Street
Houston, Texas 77002

Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to Forest Oil Corporation, a New York 
corporation (the "Borrower"), in connection with the transactions covered by 
that certain Loan Agreement dated December 28, 1993, between Borrower and you, 
as Lender (the "Agreement"), providing for certain loans from you to Borrower. 
This opinion is rendered to you pursuant to Section 7.01 of the Agreement. 
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein and used (but not defined) 
herein are defined in the Agreement.

In connection with this opinion we have examined copies of the following
documents delivered in connection with the Agreement, all of which are dated as
of December 28, 1993 and which, notwithstanding the Agreement provisions, are 
referred to in this opinion as the "Principal Documents":

1. the Agreement;

2. the Note;

3. the Deed of Trust, Assignment of Production, Security Agreement,
and Financing Statement (the "Deed of Trust"); 

4. the Security Agreement between Borrower, as debtor, and Lender, 
as secured party, (the "Security Agreement");

5. UCC-1 Financing Statement for Texas; 

6. the Act of Mortgage, Assignment of Production, Security 
Agreement and Financing Statement executed by the Borrower as 
Mortgagor and Lender as Mortgagee;

7. the UCC-1 Financing Statement, executed by the Borrower as 
debtor, in favor of the Lender, as secured party (Louisiana);

8. Conveyance of Overriding Royalty (Wagner & Brown);

9. Production Agreement (Wagner & Brown);

10. Conveyance of Overriding Royalty (Eugene Island Block 326)

11. Production Agreement (Eugene Island Block 326)

12. the Borrowing Request executed by Borrower;

13. the Compliance Certificate executed by the Borrower; and

14. Swap Agreement (Basic Swap) between Lender and Borrower.

We have discussed the matters addressed in this opinion with officers 
and representatives of Borrower to the extent we have deemed appropriate to 
enable us to render this opinion. In particular, but without limitation, we 
have confirmed that the Borrower acknowledges, understands and agrees that the 
Principal Documents as written set forth the entire understanding and agreement 
of the parties thereto. 

In rendering the opinions expressed below we have assumed that 
obligations described in the Principal Documents have been duly authorized, 
executed and delivered by, and create and constitute the legal, valid, binding 
and enforceable obligations of, the Lender and parties thereto other than 
Borrower. Except for the matters specifically addressed herein, we have
assumed that each representation of Borrower contained in the Principal 
Documents is true and correct. 

In connection with our examination in connection with this opinion, 
we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all 
documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents 
of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies. We have 
not made any independent examination of the books and records of the Borrower. 
As to factual matters and information relevant to the opinions herein stated 
that are in the possession of the Borrower, we have relied solely upon 
representations made by duly authorized representatives of the Borrower and 
upon certificates of the Borrower and certain public officials. We have also 
assumed, without verification, for purposes of this opinion that no facts 
exist that would make available defenses of mutual mistake, fraud, concealment, 
undue influence, duress, or criminal activity.

In rendering the opinions expressed below we have assumed that (a) a 
Colorado court (or a federal court applying Colorado conflicts of laws rules) 
would apply the internal laws of the State of Colorado as the laws governing 
the interpretation, construction, and enforcement of the Agreement (except for 
any provisions of the Agreement relating to the title to any of the Mortgaged 
Properties and to the perfection, priority and enforcement of liens on and 
security interests in any of the Mortgaged Properties ["Foreign Law 
Provisions"]) and the determination of the rate or amount of interest which 
may lawfully be paid with respect to the Note; (b) the Agreement and the 
covenants of the Borrower to pay the Note and perform the obligations 
described therein create and constitute the legal, valid, binding and 
enforceable obligations of the Borrower and all other parties thereto under 
the laws of the State of Colorado to the extent that Colorado law is intended 
to apply thereto; and (c) the Note and the remaining obligations of Borrower 
under the Agreement are not usurious or illegal under the laws of the State 
of Colorado.

Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set forth 
above and below, we are of the opinion that:

1. Borrower is a corporation organized, validly existing and in 
good standing under the laws of the State of New York, has qualified and is 
authorized to transact business and is in good standing as a foreign 
corporation in the States of Texas and Louisiana, and has the necessary 
corporate power and authority to make and to perform its obligations under 
the Principal Documents.

2. The execution, delivery and performance by Borrower of the 
Principal Documents (i) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate 
action by Borrower, and (ii) do not and will not (A) violate any provision of 
its certificate of incorporation or by-laws as in effect on the date hereof, 
(B) violate any provision of law or regulation applicable to Borrower on the 
date hereof, or (C) to our knowledge, after due inquiry, result in the breach 
of, or constitute a default under, any agreement or instrument to which 
Borrower is a party on the date hereof or by which Borrower is bound on the 
date hereof, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than 
in favor of Lender).

3. The Principal Documents to which Borrower is a party have been 
duly executed and delivered by Borrower. The obligations of Borrower under
each of the Principal Documents that are governed by the laws of the State of
Texas are enforceable in accordance with the respective terms of the Principal
Documents under the laws of the State of Texas.

4. There are, to the best of our knowledge, except as set forth 
on Exhibit D to the Agreement, no actions, suits or proceedings pending or 
threatened against the Borrower before any court or arbitrator(s), or by or 
before any administrative agency or governmental authority, in which there is 
a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could have a material 
adverse effect on the financial condition or business of the Borrower or the 
execution or performance of the transactions contemplated by Principal 
Documents.

5. Other than (i) filings required to be made with governmental 
offices necessary to properly and fully register title to Borrower's 
properties in accordance with all applicable laws, and (ii) the filing of 
financing statements, the filing and recording of mortgages, filings required 
in connection with any enforcement proceedings and all other (including future) 
filings necessary to create, perfect or continue the perfection of any lien 
or security interest granted under the Principal Documents, including without 
limitation the proper and timely filing of Principal Document Nos. 3 and 5 
above with respect to Mortgaged Properties lying in the State of Texas, no 
authorizations, consents, approvals, licenses, filings or registrations with, 
any governmental or regulatory authority or agency are required of the 
Borrower in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the 
Borrower of the Principal Documents.

6. According to the records of the Minerals Management Service 
in Metairie, Louisiana, the Borrower is duly qualified to hold interests in 
federal offshore oil and gas leases.

7. A Texas court, or a Federal court applying Texas conflicts of 
laws principles, should give effect to the express choice of law provisions 
contained in the Agreement and the Note and, accordingly, should apply the 
internal laws of the State of Colorado to determine the legality and 
enforceability of the provisions of the Agreement and the Note (other than 
the Foreign Law Provisions) including the determination of whether the 
Agreement and the Note taken together are usurious.

8. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is an "investment 
company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company," within the 
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither the 
Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" 
of a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a 
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company," or a "public utility" within the 
meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

9. Fully executed counterparts of the Deed of Trust should be 
filed for record in the offices of each Texas county wherein the Mortgaged 
Properties lie. A fully executed Texas Financing Statement should be filed 
in the office of the Texas Secretary of State. No other filings are 
necessary or appropriate for the purposes intended to be accomplished thereby, 
other than continuation statements as required by the Texas Business and 
Commerce Code (the "Code") for property in Texas. Upon such filings, the Deed 
of Trust, and the Texas Financing Statement will constitute as security for 
the Note, (a) valid mortgage liens on the Mortgaged Property lying in Texas, 
if accurately and specifically described in each of said documents as being 
mortgaged thereby, and (b) a perfected security interest in all tangible 
personal property and fixtures located in Texas if adequately described 
therein as being covered thereby, to the extent the Code is applicable 
thereto, except:

(a) In the case of proceeds, continuation of perfection of the 
Lender's security interest therein is limited to the extent 
set forth in the Code;

(b) Continuation statements as required by the Code must be filed 
in order to maintain the effectiveness of the filings referred 
to in the above paragraph;

(c) In the case of goods which are installed in or affixed to, or 
become a part of a product or mass with goods, which are not 
items of collateral;

(d) In the case of goods which are or become fixtures, except for 
fixtures located on the real property portions of the properties 
covered thereby; and

(e) In the case of property which becomes collateral after the date 
hereof, Section 552 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code limits the 
extent to which property acquired by a debtor after the 
commencement of a case under the Federal Bankruptcy Code may be 
subject to a security interest arising from a security agreement 
entered into by the debtor before the commencement of such case.

We call to your attention to the fact that the perfection of the 
above security interests will be terminated (i) as to any collateral (as to 
which the filing of a financing statement is necessary) acquired by the
Borrower more than four (4) months after the Borrower changes its name,
identity or corporate structure so as to make the financing statements
seriously misleading, unless new appropriate financing statements indicating
the new name, identity or corporate structure of the Borrower are properly
filed before the expiration of such four (4) months and (ii) as to any 
collateral consisting of accounts, general intangibles, mobile goods and (in 
the case of a non-possessory security interest) chattel paper four (4) 
months after the Borrower changes its chief executive office to a new
jurisdiction (or, if earlier, when perfection under the laws of the State
of Texas would have otherwise ceased) unless such security interests are 
perfected in such new jurisdiction before that termination.

The foregoing opinions are subject to and in all respects qualified by 
the following:

The opinions expressed herein as to validity, binding effect and 
enforceability are subject to the effect of liquidation, conservatorship, 
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance 
or other similar laws generally affecting the rights of creditors, the 
application of equitable principles (whether in equity or at law) and the 
availability of equitable remedies (whether in equity or at law) including 
the concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. 
A court applying such principles of equity, among other things, might not 
allow the declaration of an event of default based upon an event deemed 
immaterial or might not require the Borrower to perform certain covenants. 
The opinions expressed above are also qualified to the extent that any law, 
statute, ordinance, rule, regulation and principle may modify, limit, render 
unenforceable or delay certain of your rights or remedies under the Principal 
Documents; however, the application of such principles would not substantially 
diminish the practical realization of the benefits intended to be conferred 
thereby, except for the economic consequences of any judicial, administrative 
or procedural delay which may result from any such law, statute, ordinance, 
rule, regulation and principle. No opinion is expressed as to the validity, 
binding effect or enforceability of any provision releasing, exculpating or 
exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability 
for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves 
gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct. 

Enforcement of obligations or exercise of rights under the Principal 
Documents may also be affected by constitutional limitations of notice and due 
process requirements, the effect of Texas law and court decisions which provide 
that certain suretyship rights and defenses are available to a party that 
encumbers its property to secure the obligations of another,and the 
requirements of the Code that you exercise your rights under the Principal 
Documents in a commercially reasonable manner. Further, we express no opinion 
as to the provisions in the Principal Documents for waiver of any objections 
to forum non conveniens.

In connection with the opinion expressed in paragraph 7 above, we have 
taken note of the fact that Borrower's chief executive office is located in 
Colorado, the Principal Documents were signed in Colorado, repayments on the 
Note are to be made in Colorado; and we have taken as true the recitations of 
Section 8.12 of the Agreement.

We express no opinion as to the effect of the law of any jurisdiction 
other than the State of Texas where an enforcement of the Principal Documents 
may be sought which limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or 
collectible. In rendering this opinion, we have assumed that the rate of 
interest provided for in the Principal Documents is not in excess of the rate 
of interest that could lawfully be collected, contracted for, charged, received 
or reserved or taken under Colorado law.

We are counsel admitted to practice law in the State of Texas, and this 
opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Texas, and the United States of 
America, all as in effect on the date hereof. This opinion does not cover or 
apply to the effect of the laws of the States of Colorado or New York on the 
Agreement, the Borrower or any of the other Principal Documents.

We express no opinion with respect to the need for licenses, permits, 
authorizations or approvals required in the operation of Borrower's business 
including, without limitation, the operation, production and transportation of 
oil and gas production from or attributable to the properties covered by the 
Principal Documents.

We express no opinion as to any matter other than as expressly set 
forth above, and no opinion is to or may be inferred or implied herefrom. 
Specifically, no opinion on Borrower's titles, the descriptions of Borrower's 
properties as affixed to the Principal Documents, or on the provisions of any 
document in, or referred to in, Borrower's chain of title to any of the 
properties, is expressed or is to be inferred from this opinion. This opinion 
is given as of the date hereof, and we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, 
obligation to advise you of any change in any matter set forth herein.

In connection with opinions expressed herein as being limited "to our 
knowledge", our examination has been limited to discussions with the officers 
and representatives of Borrower as its counsel, and, with your express 
permission, we have made no independent investigation as to the accuracy or 
completeness of any representations, warranties, data or other information, 
written or oral, made or furnished by any of them to us or to Lender. However, 
based solely upon our knowledge, as defined above, we have no reason to 
believe that any express representation or warranty of Borrower contained in 
the Principal Documents is untrue or inaccurate in any material respect.

The opinions expressed herein are for the benefit of the Lender, its 
Affiliates and any persons who are controlled or managed by Enron Corp. or any 
of its Affiliates, and their respective lenders and their counsel, and may be 
relied upon only by such persons. This opinion may not be published, quoted

Opinion of Colorado Counsel
to Borrower 

December __, 1993

Joint Energy Development Investments Limited Partnership
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002

Re: Loan Agreement dated as of December __, 1993 (the "Loan 
Agreement"), by and among Joint Energy Development Investments 
Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, as lender 
("Lender"), and Forest Oil Corporation, a New York corporation, 
as borrower ("Borrower"). 

Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to the Borrower in connection with 
the transactions contemplated by the Loan Agreement. This opinion is rendered 
to you pursuant to Section 7.01 of the Loan Agreement. Capitalized terms used 
but not defined herein or on Exhibit "A" hereto are used as defined in the Loan 
Agreement.

In such capacity, we have examined the documents described on 
Exhibit "A" (with such documents, together with the Loan Agreement, hereinafter 
collectively referred to as the "Principal Documents"). We have also examined 
(i) a certificate of __________________ , President of Borrower, dated _______
_________, 1993 (the "Officer's Certificate"), (ii) certain certificates of 
public officials, and (iii) copies, certified or otherwise identified to our 
satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Borrower as we have deemed 
necessary for the purposes of this opinion. We have relied on the Officer's 
Certificate with respect to the matters contained therein that we have not 
independently established. We have also assumed, without verification, for 
purposes of this opinion that no facts exist that would make available defenses 
of mutual mistake, fraud, concealment, undue influence, duress, or criminal 
activity.

In rendering the opinions herein set forth, we have assumed 
(i) the due organization and valid existence of all parties to the Principal 
Documents, (ii) the due authorization, execution, and delivery of the Principal 
Documents by all parties to such document and that each such document is valid, 
binding and enforceable against the parties thereto (other than the Borrower), 
(iii) the genuineness of all signatures, (iv) the authenticity of all documents 
and instruments submitted to us as originals, (v) the conformity to original 
documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, and (vi) the legal 
capacity of all natural persons.

Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as we 
have deemed necessary, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and 
limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that: 

1. The Borrower is a corporation in good standing and 
duly qualified to do business in the State of Colorado.

2. The Principal Documents to which the Borrower is a 
party have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower. 

3. The Principal Documents to which the Borrower is a 
party constitute valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, 
enforceable in accordance with their terms. 

4. The Security Agreement creates, as security for the 
Indebtedness, a security interest in the Collateral (as such term is 
defined in the Security Agreement). The Financing Statement is in 
proper form for filing with the Office of the Secretary of State of 
the State of Colorado. The Financing Statement has been filed in the 
Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado. No other 
filings are necessary or appropriate to perfect or maintain perfection 
of the security interest created by the Security Agreement, other than 
continuation statements as required by the Uniform Commercial Code as 
in effect in Colorado (hereinafter referred to as the "Colorado UCC"). 

5. Lender's security interest in the Collateral is prior 
in right to the security interest of any other Person in the Collateral, 
subject only to the encumbrances described in Exhibit A to the Act of 
Mortgage.

6. No state or local mortgage recording tax, stamp tax or 
other fee, tax or governmental charge is required to be paid in 
Colorado in connection with the execution, delivery, filing or recording 
of the Principal Documents, other than statutory filing and recording 
fees that have been paid in connection with the filing of the Financing 
Statement.

The opinions set forth above are subject in all respects to the 
following qualifications, exceptions and assumptions: 

[List as appropriate]

We are licensed attorneys only in the State of Colorado and, therefore, 
we express opinions herein only insofar as to matters governed by the laws of 
the State of Colorado and, to the extent applicable, the federal laws of the 
United States of America.

This opinion is furnished to you in connection with the transactions 
contemplated by the Loan Agreement. It may be relied upon solely by Lender, 
its Affiliates, and any Person providing financing to Lender or its Affiliates 
in connection herewith. It may not be relied upon by any other person or in 
any other context without our prior written consent; provided, however, that 
you may, without our consent, furnish copies of this opinion as required by 
law or order of any court or governmental agency.

Very truly yours,

December __, 1993

Joint Energy Development Investments Limited Partnership
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002

Re: Loan Agreement dated as of December __, 1993 (the "Loan 
Agreement"), by and among Joint Energy Development Investments 
Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, as lender 
("Lender"), and Forest Oil Corporation, a New York corporation, 
as borrower ("Borrower"). 

Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to the Borrower in connection with 
the transactions contemplated by the Loan Agreement. This opinion is rendered 
to you pursuant to Section 7.01 of the Loan Agreement. Capitalized terms used 
but not defined herein or on Exhibit "A" hereto are used as defined in the Loan 
Agreement.

In such capacity, we have examined the documents described on 
Exhibit "A" (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Principal 
Documents"). We have also examined (i) a certificate of __________________ , 
President of Borrower, dated ________________, 1993 (the "Officer's 
Certificate"), (ii) certain certificates of public officials, and (iii) 
copies,certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such corporate
records of the Borrower as we have deemed necessary for the purposes of this 
opinion. We have relied on the Officer's Certificate with respect to the 
matters contained therein that we have not independently established. We have 
also assumed, without verification, for purposes of this opinion that no facts 
exist that would make available defenses of mutual mistake, fraud, concealment,
undue influence, duress, or criminal activity.

In rendering the opinions herein set forth, we have assumed 
(i) the due organization and valid existence of all parties to the Principal 
Documents, (ii) the due authorization, execution, and delivery of the Principal 
Documents by all parties to such document and that each such document is valid, 
binding and enforceable against the parties thereto (other than the Borrower), 
(iii) the genuineness of all signatures, (iv) the authenticity of all documents 
and instruments submitted to us as originals, (v) the conformity to original 
documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, and (vi) the legal 
capacity of all natural persons.

Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as we 
have deemed necessary, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and 
limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that: 

1. The Borrower is a corporation in good standing and 
duly qualified to do business in the State of Louisiana. 

2. The Principal Documents to which the Borrower is a 
party have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower. 

3. The Principal Documents to which the Borrower is a 
party constitute valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, 
enforceable in accordance with their terms. 

4. The forms of the Act of Mortgage, the acknowledgments 
thereto and the Financing Statements comply with all applicable 
recording, filing and registration laws of the State of Louisiana. 
The property descriptions of the immovable properties situated in 
Louisiana contained in the Act of Mortgage, if accurate, are legally 
sufficient for the purposes of all applicable recording, filing and 
registration laws of the State of Louisiana.

5. A fully executed counterpart of the Act of Mortgage 
has been filed for record in the offices of the respective Clerks of 
Court or Ex-Officio Recorders of the parishes listed on Exhibit B, 
and a fully executed counterpart of the Financing Statement (with a 
copy of the Act of Mortgage attached thereto) has been filed in 
________________________ Parish, Louisiana and with the Secretary of 
State of the State of Texas. No other filings are necessary or 
appropriate for the purposes intended to be accomplished thereby, 
other than continuation statements as required by the Uniform 
Commercial Code as in effect in Louisiana (hereinafter referred to as 
the "Louisiana UCC"). The Act of Mortgage constitutes, as security 
for the Indebtedness (i) a valid mortgage lien on all immovable property 
and interests in immovable property located in the State of Louisiana 
and accurately and specifically described in the Act of Mortgage as 
being mortgaged thereby, and (ii) a perfected security interest in the 
Collateral (as such term is hereinafter defined).

As used herein, the term "Collateral" shall mean any of the 
Borrower's accounts, general intangibles, inventory, goods, fixtures 
and equipment (as such terms are defined in the Louisiana UCC), if any, 
adequately described in the Act of Mortgage.

6. Lender's mortgage lien in the Mortgaged Properties is 
prior in right to the lien of any other Person in the Mortgaged 
Properties, subject only to the encumbrances described in Exhibit A 
to the Act of Mortgage. Lender's security interest in the Collateral 
is prior in right to the security interest of any other Person in the 
Collateral, subject only to the encumbrances described in Exhibit A to 
the Act of Mortgage.

7. Each of the Eugene Island Conveyance and the Wagner 
and Brown Conveyance (the "Conveyances"), including, without limitation, 
the forms of acknowledgements, exhibits and schedules thereto, complies 
with all applicable recording, filing and registration laws of the State 
of Louisiana. The property descriptions of the immovable property 
situated in Louisiana contained in the Conveyances, if accurate, are 
legally sufficient for the purposes of all applicable recording, filing 
and registration laws of the State of Louisiana. Each of the 
Conveyances constitutes the legal, valid and binding conveyance of the 
properties described therein. A fully executed counterpart of each of 
the Conveyances has been filed for record in the offices of the

listed on Exhibit B.

PRODUCTION AGREEMENT
(Wagner & Brown)

This Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into this 28th 
day of December, 1993, by and between FOREST OIL CORPORATION, a New York 
corporation ("Grantor"), and JOINT ENERGY DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS LIMITED 
PARTNERSHIP, a Delaware limited partnership ("Grantee").

WHEREAS, by Conveyance of Overriding Royalty Interest of even date 
herewith from Grantor to Grantee (the "Conveyance"), Grantee has purchased 
and acquired from Grantor and Grantor has sold and conveyed to Grantee an 
overriding royalty interest in the Subject Interests.

NOW, THEREFORE, as a material inducement to cause Grantee to purchase 
the Overriding Royalty and in consideration of the mutual benefits and 
obligations of the parties hereunder, Grantee and Grantor have agreed, and 
hereby agree, as follows:

1. Definitions. Each capitalized term used herein but not 
defined herein shall have the meaning given to it in the Conveyance.

2. Marketing.

(a) Grantor shall have the right and obligation to 
market all Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Subject 
Interests, including the Hydrocarbons attributable to the Overriding 
Royalty (the "Overriding Royalty Hydrocarbons"). All such Hydrocarbons 
shall be sold by Grantor pursuant to arm's length contracts with parties 
not affiliated with Grantor containing terms negotiated by Grantor as a 
prudent operator. Grantor shall comply with the terms of all such sales 
contracts and deliver Hydrocarbons thereunder at the contract prices and 
on the terms applicable thereto without deduction for nonperformance of 
noncompliance. Grantor will take all appropriate and reasonable measures 
to enforce the performance of under each sales contract of the obligations 
of the purchaser thereunder. All Hydrocarbons shall be delivered by Grantor 
to the purchasers thereof into the pipelines to which the wells producing 
such Hydrocarbons may be connected or to such other point of purchase as 
is reasonably required in the marketing of such Hydrocarbons.

(b) All proceeds received by Grantor from the sale of 
Overriding Royalty Hydrocarbons sold on behalf of Grantee pursuant to the 
terms hereof are received by Grantor in trust for Grantee and shall be held 
in trust by Grantor for Grantee; provided, however, Grantor shall pay such 
proceeds by wire transfer to such account as Grantee shall have designated 
from time to time to Grantee on each Payment Date. Grantor will diligently 
enforce the terms of all sales agreements under which Subject Hydrocarbons 
are sold on behalf of Grantee, including full and prompt payment of all 
amounts due from such sales. In the event of any late payment by any 
purchaser, Grantor shall remit to Grantee any interest or penalties collected 
with respect to the sale of Overriding Royalty Hydrocarbons.

3. Rate of Production.

Grantor shall prudently operate and produce with respect to 
those Subject Interests operated by Grantor, and shall use its best efforts 
to cause to be prudently operated and produced, with respect to the Subject 
Interests not operated by Grantor, the Subject Wells in accordance with good 
engineering practices. 

4. Operation of Subject Interests. At all times from the date 
hereof until the termination of the Overriding Royalty and whether or not 
Grantor is the operator of the Subject Interests, Grantor, at Grantor's cost 
and expense, shall:

(i) Cause the Subject Interests to be maintained in full force 
and effect, and to be developed, protected against drainage, and continuously 
operated for the production of Hydrocarbons in a good and workmanlike manner 
as would a prudent operator (and without regard to the burden of the Overriding 
Royalty), all in accordance with generally accepted industry practices, 
applicable operating agreements, and all applicable federal, state and local 
laws, rules and regulations, and shall otherwise comply with all applicable 
laws, rules and regulations;

(ii) Pay, or cause to be paid, promptly as and when due and payable, 
all rentals and royalties payable in respect of the Subject Interests or the 
production therefrom, and all costs, expenses and liabilities incurred in or 
arising from the operation or development of the Subject Interests, or the 
producing, treating, gathering, storing, marketing or transporting of 
Hydrocarbons therefrom;

(iii) Cause all wells, machinery, equipment and facilities of any 
kind now or hereafter located on the Subject Interests, and necessary or 
useful in the operation thereof for the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom, 
to be provided and to be kept in good and effective operating condition as 
would a prudent operator (and without regard to the burden of the Overriding 
Royalty), and all repairs, renewals, replacements, additions and improvements
thereof or thereto, useful or needful to such end, to be promptly made;

(iv) Give or cause to be given to Grantee written notice of every 
adverse claim or demand made by any person affecting the Subject Interests, 
the Hydrocarbons produced therefrom, the Overriding Royalty and/or the 
Overriding Royalty Hydrocarbons in any manner whatsoever, and of any suit or 
other legal proceeding instituted with respect thereto, and at Grantor's 
expense cause all necessary and proper steps to be taken with reasonable 
diligence to protect and defend the Subject Interests, the Hydrocarbons 
produced therefrom, the Overriding Royalty and/or the Overriding Royalty 
Hydrocarbons against any such adverse claim or demand, including (but not 
limited to) the employment of counsel for the prosecution or defense of 
litigation and the contest, release or discharge of such adverse claim or 
demand;

(v) Cause the Subject Interests to be kept free and clear of 
liens, charges and encumbrances of every character, other than (1) Taxes 
constituting a lien but not due and payable, (2) the Permitted Encumbrances 
and (3) the "Chase Liens" as defined and as may be permitted under that 
certain Loan Agreement of even date herewith between Grantor, as borrower, 
and Grantee, as lender;

(vi) Pay all Taxes when due and before they become delinquent, 
and reimburse Grantee for any Taxes paid by Grantee as a result of the 
Overriding Royalty or the Overriding Royalty Hydrocarbons or the production 
of same;

operating expenses and all billings under applicable joint operating agreements 
(except to the extent contested in good faith); and

(viii) Not resign as operator of any of the Subject Interests operated 
by Grantor until and unless the successor operator has been approved in writing 
by Grantee. 

5. Insurance; Damage or Loss. Grantor shall maintain or cause 
to be maintained, at its sole cost and expense and with financially sound and 
reputable insurers reasonably satisfactory to Grantee, insurance covering the 
Leases and all pipelines, wells, and facilities located thereon against such 
liabilities, casualties, risks and contingencies, and in such types as is 
customary in the case of independent oil companies engaged in operations of 
similar property, including, without limitation, insurance of the types and 
coverages described in Schedule 1 hereto and with limits of coverage no less 
than those set out in Schedule 1. Such insurance shall name Grantee as an 
additional insured as Grantee's interests appear. Grantor shall furnish 
certificates of such insurance to Grantee and shall obtain endorsements to 
such policies providing that the insurer will notify Grantee not less than 
thirty (30) days prior to the expiration or termination of such policy of 
insurance.

with respect to the annual financial statements, accompanied by a report of 
the Grantor's independent certified public accountants stating that their 
examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards 
and that in their opinion such financial statements fairly present Grantor's 
financial condition, results of operations and changes in financial position 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently 
applied.

(ii) Annually, as soon as available, but no later than 90 
days after the end of each calendar year, (commencing with the calendar year

appropriate categories, as of such date attributable to the 
Subject Interests,

(B) a projection of the rate of production of, and net income 
from,such reserves, 

(C) a calculation of the present worth of such net income from 
suchreserves, 

(D) a calculation of the present worth of such net income 
discountedat a rate or rates designated from time to time 
by Grantee, and 

(E) a schedule or complete description of all assumptions, 
estimates and projections made or used in the preparation 
of such report, including without limitation estimated future 
product prices, capital expenditures, operating expenses and 
taxes.

Each such report shall be prepared in accordance with customary and generally 
accepted standards and practices for petroleum engineers, shall be based on 
such assumptions as to costs, product prices and similar factors as Grantee

be conducted during normal business hours at Grantor's offices or at the 
offices where Grantor maintains the records relating to the items set forth 
above. This right to audit shall be a free and unrestricted right. If, as 
a result of any audit, it is determined that any amount is due Grantee as a 
result of the failure of Grantor to properly deliver Grantee its share of the 
Net Profits in accordance with the terms of the Conveyance and this Agreement, 
Grantor shall pay Grantee Net Profits which Grantor failed to remit, together 
with interest at the Floating Rate from the date that such amount should have 
been paid in accordance with the terms of the Conveyance and this Agreement 
to the date of payment.

authorized representatives of Grantee, at any reasonable time, but at Grantee's 
risk and expense, to make such inspection of the Subject Interests and the 
property, machinery, equipment and facilities used in the operation thereof 
as such representatives shall deem proper.

the termination of the Overriding Royalty, if Grantor shall fail to perform 
or observe in any material respect any of the covenants or agreements provided 
herein or in the Conveyance to be performed or observed by Grantor, Grantee, 
in addition to Grantee's right to recover damages and all other remedies 
available to Grantee at law or in equity, may, if such failure shall continue
unremedied after fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof is delivered 
to Grantor:

(i) pay, or cause to be paid, any of the costs, expenses, Taxes 
(which Taxes are not being contested in good faith by the Grantor) or other 
amounts which the Grantor has agreed to pay under the Conveyance which have 
become delinquent, and be reimbursed on demand by Grantee for all amounts so 
paid or incurred, together with interest at the Floating Rate from the date 
of such payment until the date of reimbursement; and

Hydrocarbons attributable to Grantor's interest in the Subject Interests and 
apply the proceeds thereof to any amount owed by Grantor hereunder; and

(iii) setoff any amount owed by Grantor or its Affiliates to Grantee 
or its Affiliates against any amount owed to Grantor hereunder; and

(iv) apply to a court of equity for the specific performance or

any power herein granted and for the appointment of a receiver of the Subject 
Interests and the Hydrocarbons produced therefrom.

Interests is authorized and directed to make payment to the Grantee out of 
the Hydrocarbons attributable to Grantor's interest in the Subject Interests 
for any amount which Grantee shall certify to such purchaser that it has paid 
and which Grantor is obligated to pay hereunder. Grantor hereby designates 
Grantee as its agent and attorney in fact to execute any instruments which 
may be necessary or appropriate, including without limitation designations 
of operator, to enable Grantee to exercise its rights under this Section 8.

12. Successors and Assigns. All the covenants and agreements of 
Grantor and Grantee herein contained shall be deemed to be covenants running 
with the land and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Grantor's 
interest in the Subject Interests and Grantee's interest in the Overriding 
Royalty and shall inure to the benefit of Grantor, Grantee, and their 
respective successors and permitted assigns. The foregoing notwithstanding, 
nothing herein is intended to modify or shall have the effect of modifying 
the restrictions on assignment set forth in the Conveyance regarding 
assignments, transfer or pooling of Grantor's interest in the Subject 
Interests; and the preceding sentence shall not be deemed to permit any 
assignment or other transfer of the interest of Grantor in any of the Subject 
Interests that is not specifically permitted by the provisions of the

secured thereby shall be entitled, to the extent such mortgage, pledge or 
deed of trust so provides and upon the occurrence or existence of the event 
or condition therein stated, if so conditioned, to exercise all of the 
rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein conferred upon Grantee, and 
to give or withhold all consents herein required or permitted to be obtained 
from Grantee. No assignment by Grantee of its rights hereunder will be 
binding on Grantor until Grantee shall have notified Grantee of the assignment 
and furnished a copy of the same to Grantor.

13. Damages. It is recognized that Grantee will look solely to 
the Overriding Royalty Hydrocarbons for satisfaction and discharge of the 
Overriding Royalty, and that Grantor is not personally liable for the payment 
and discharge thereof. However, the foregoing provision shall not relieve 
Grantor of any obligations under this Agreement or any obligation to respond 
in damages for any breach of any of the provisions hereof or of the 
Conveyance.

14. Cost of Litigation. In the event of a breach of this 
Agreement, or if a dispute arising hereunder is not resolved by mutual 
agreement, and either party should sue the other party to enforce its rights 
hereunder or for breach hereof, the party prevailing in such litigation shall 
be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in addition 
to any other remedy or recovery to which it may be entitled.

15. Entire Agreement; Amendments; Waiver. This Agreement 
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto. This Agreement 
may not be amended and no rights hereunder may be waived except by a written 
document signed by the duly authorized representatives of the parties. No 
waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be or 
shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not 
similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless 
otherwise expressly provided.

16. Headings. The headings of the sections of this Agreement 
are for guidance and convenience of reference only and shall not limit or 
otherwise affect any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.

17. Counterpart Execution; Recordation. This Agreement may be

PRODUCTION AGREEMENT
(Eugene Island Block 326)

This Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into this 28th day 
of December, 1993, by and between FOREST OIL CORPORATION, a New York 
corporation ("Grantor"), and JOINT ENERGY DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS LIMITED 
PARTNERSHIP, a Delaware limited partnership ("Grantee").

WHEREAS, by Conveyance of Overriding Royalty Interest of even date 
herewith from Grantor to Grantee (the "Conveyance"), Grantee has purchased 
and acquired from Grantor and Grantor has sold and conveyed to Grantee an 
overriding royalty interest in the Subject Interests.

NOW, THEREFORE, as a material inducement to cause Grantee to purchase 
the Overriding Royalty and in consideration of the mutual benefits and 
obligations of the parties hereunder, Grantee and Grantor have agreed, and 
hereby agree, as follows:

1. Definitions. Each capitalized term used herein but not 
defined herein shall have the meaning given to it in the Conveyance.

2. Marketing.

(a) Grantor shall have the right and obligation to market 
all Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Subject Interests, 
including the Hydrocarbons attributable to the Overriding Royalty (the 
"Overriding Royalty Hydrocarbons"). All such Hydrocarbons shall be sold by 
Grantor pursuant to arm's length contracts with parties not affiliated with 
Grantor containing terms negotiated by Grantor as a prudent operator. Grantor 
shall comply with the terms of all such sales contracts and deliver 
Hydrocarbons thereunder at the contract prices and on the terms applicable 
thereto without deduction for nonperformance of noncompliance. Grantor will 
take all appropriate and reasonable measures to enforce the performance of 
under each sales contract of the obligations of the purchaser thereunder. 
All Hydrocarbons shall be delivered by Grantor to the purchasers thereof into 
the pipelines to which the wells producing such Hydrocarbons may be connected 
or to such other point of purchase as is reasonably required in the marketing 
of such Hydrocarbons.

(b) All proceeds received by Grantor from the sale of 
Overriding Royalty Hydrocarbons sold on behalf of Grantee pursuant to the 
terms hereof are received by Grantor in trust for Grantee and shall be held 
in trust by Grantor for Grantee; provided, however, Grantor shall pay such 
proceeds by wire transfer to such account as Grantee shall have designated 
from time to time to Grantee on each Payment Date. Grantor will diligently 
enforce the terms of all sales agreements under which Subject Hydrocarbons 
are sold on behalf of Grantee, including full and prompt payment of all 
amounts due from such sales. In the event of any late payment by any 
purchaser, Grantor shall remit to Grantee any interest or penalties collected 
with respect to the sale of Overriding Royalty Hydrocarbons.

3. Rate of Production.

Grantor shall prudently operate and produce with respect to 
those Subject Interests operated by Grantor, and shall use its best efforts 
to cause to be prudently operated and produced, with respect to the Subject 
Interests not operated by Grantor, the Subject Wells in accordance with good 
engineering practices.

4. Operation of Subject Interests. At all times from the date 
hereof and whether or not Grantor is the operator of the Subject Interests, 
Grantor, at Grantor's cost and expense, shall:

(i) Cause the Subject Interests to be maintained in full force 
and effect, and to be developed, protected against drainage, and continuously 
operated for the production of Hydrocarbons in a good and workmanlike manner 
as would a prudent operator (and without regard to the burden of the 
Overriding Royalty), all in accordance with generally accepted industry 
practices, applicable operating agreements, and all applicable federal, state 
and local laws, rules and regulations, and shall otherwise comply with all 
applicable laws, rules and regulations;

(ii) Pay, or cause to be paid, promptly as and when due and 
payable, all rentals and royalties payable in respect of the Subject Interests 
or the production therefrom, and all costs, expenses and liabilities incurred 
in or arising from the operation or development of the Subject Interests, or 
the producing, treating, gathering, storing, marketing or transporting of 
Hydrocarbons therefrom;

(iii) Cause all wells, machinery, equipment and facilities of any 
kind now or hereafter located on the Subject Interests, and necessary or 
useful in the operation thereof for the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom, 
to be provided and to be kept in good and effective operating condition as 
would a prudent operator (and without regard to the burden of the Overriding 
Royalty), and all repairs, renewals, replacements, additions and improvements 
thereof or thereto, useful or needful to such end, to be promptly made;

(iv) Give or cause to be given to Grantee written notice of every 
adverse claim or demand made by any person affecting the Subject Interests, 
the Hydrocarbons produced therefrom, the Overriding Royalty and/or the 
Overriding Royalty Hydrocarbons in any manner whatsoever, and of any suit or 
other legal proceeding instituted with respect thereto, and at Grantor's 
expense cause all necessary and proper steps to be taken with reasonable 
diligence to protect and defend the Subject Interests, the Hydrocarbons 
produced therefrom, the Overriding Royalty and/or the Overriding Royalty 
Hydrocarbons against any such adverse claim or demand, including (but not 
limited to) the employment of counsel for the prosecution or defense of 
litigation and the contest, release or discharge of such adverse claim or 
demand;

(v) Cause the Subject Interests to be kept free and clear of 
liens, charges and encumbrances of every character, other than (1) Taxes 
constituting a lien but not due and payable, (2) the Permitted Encumbrances 
and (3) the "Chase Liens" as defined and as may be permitted under that 
certain Loan Agreement of even date herewith between Grantor, as borrower, 
and Grantee, as lender;

(vi) Pay all Taxes when due and before they become delinquent, 
and reimburse Grantee for any Taxes paid by Grantee as a result of the 
Overriding Royalty or the Overriding Royalty Hydrocarbons or the production 
of same;

(vii) Pay promptly when due and before they become delinquent all 
operating expenses and all billings under applicable joint operating agreements 
(except to the extent contested in good faith); and

(viii) Not resign as operator of any of the Subject Interests 
operated by Grantor until and unless the successor operator has been approved 
in writing by Grantee.

5. Insurance; Damage or Loss. Grantor shall maintain or cause 
to be maintained, at its sole cost and expense and with financially sound 
and reputable insurers reasonably satisfactory to Grantee, insurance covering 
the Leases and all pipelines, wells, and facilities located thereon against 
such liabilities, casualties, risks and contingencies, and in such types as 
is customary in the case of independent oil companies engaged in operations 
of similar property, including, without limitation, insurance of the types 
and coverages described in Schedule 1 hereto and with limits of coverage no 
less than those set out in Schedule 1. Such insurance shall name Grantee as 
an additional insured as Grantee's interests appear. Grantor shall furnish 
certificates of such insurance to Grantee and shall obtain endorsements to 
such policies providing that the insurer will notify Grantee not less than 
thirty (30) days prior to the expiration or termination of such policy of 
insurance.

6. Information. (a) At all times from the date hereof Grantor, 
at its own expense, shall furnish to Grantee the following reports and 
information at the times indicated below.

(i) Quarterly within sixty (60) days after the end of 
each fiscal quarter of Grantor and annually within one hundred twenty (120) 
days after the end of each fiscal year of Grantor, Grantor shall furnish 
Grantor's financial statements as of the end of and for such period, 
including a balance sheet and statements of income, stockholder's equity and 
cash flow, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles and, with respect to the annual financial statements, accompanied 
by a report of the Grantor's independent certified public accountants stating 
that their examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards and that in their opinion such financial statements fairly present 
Grantor's financial condition, results of operations and changes in financial 
position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
consistently applied.

(ii) Annually, as soon as available, but no later than 
90 days after the end of each calendar year, (commencing with the calendar 
year in which the Effective Time occurs), Grantor shall furnish an internally 
prepared engineering report satisfactory to Grantee, as of January 1 of such 
year. Each of the reports delivered hereunder shall incorporate all current 
information and data available to Grantor pertinent to the estimation of oil 
and gas reserves attributable to Subject Interests and setting forth the 
following: 

(A) an estimation of the oil and gas reserves, classified by 
appropriate categories, as of such date attributable to the Subject 
Interests,

(B) a projection of the rate of production of, and net income 
from, such reserves, 

(C) a calculation of the present worth of such net income from 
such reserves, 

(D) a calculation of the present worth of such net income 
discounted at a rate or rates designated from time to time by Grantee, and 

(E) a schedule or complete description of all assumptions, 
estimates and projections made or used in the preparation of such report, 
including without limitation estimated future product prices, capital 
expenditures, operating expenses and taxes.

Each such report shall be prepared in accordance with customary and generally 
accepted standards and practices for petroleum engineers, shall be based on 
such assumptions as to costs, product prices and similar factors as Grantee 
shall designate from time to time. Grantee shall be furnished a copy of any 
other reserve report prepared for Grantor by any independent petroleum 
engineering firm covering the Properties.

(iii) Monthly, Grantor shall furnish Grantee a lease 
operating statement for each Lease showing gross and net volumes of 
Hydrocarbons produced and sold from the Lease, average sales prices, 
severance taxes, lease operating expenses, and any other revenues and 
expenses associated with each Lease, a capital expenditure summary, and, 
from the foregoing, a detailed statement showing the computation of the 
Net Profits for such Month, and Gross Proceeds and Production Costs received 
or incurred during such Month.

(iv) Upon request and to the extent available, Grantor 
shall furnish Grantee copies of surface maps showing property lines and well 
locations, well logs, core analysis data, flow and pressure tests, natural 
gas analysis and casing programs and other similar information related to 
the Subject Interests, Subject Wells and the production therefrom.

(v) Promptly upon Grantor's receipt, Grantor shall 
furnish Grantee copies of all independent petroleum engineering reports 
pertaining to the Subject Interests.

(vi) Upon request, Grantor shall furnish such other 
information as Grantee may reasonably request.

(b) Grantee, at its expense, shall have the right from time to 
time to audit the books and records of Grantor with respect to the Subject 
Interests, including without limitation, all information with respect to 
volumes of Hydrocarbons produced from the Leases, the sales price of 
Hydrocarbons sold by Grantor, the computation of Net Profits, the calculation 
of Lease Use Hydrocarbons and Non-Consent Hydrocarbons, and the payment by 
Grantee of all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Subject 
Interests. Such audits shall be conducted by Grantee so as to result in a 
minimum disruption in the ongoing business and affairs of Grantor and shall 
be conducted during normal business hours at Grantor's offices or at the 
offices where Grantor maintains the records relating to the items set forth 
above. This right to audit shall be a free and unrestricted right. If, as 
a result of any audit, it is determined that any amount is due Grantee as a 
result of the failure of Grantor to properly deliver Grantee its share of 
the Net Profits in accordance with the terms of the Conveyance and this 
Agreement, Grantor shall pay Grantee Net Profits which Grantor failed to 
remit, together with interest at the Floating Rate from the date that such 
amount should have been paid in accordance with the terms of the Conveyance 
and this Agreement to the date of payment.

7. Access to Subject Interests. Grantor shall permit the duly 
authorized representatives of Grantee, at any reasonable time, but at Grantee's 
risk and expense, to make such inspection of the Subject Interests and the 
property, machinery, equipment and facilities used in the operation thereof 
as such representatives shall deem proper.

8. Remedies of Grantee. At any time and from time to time, if 
Grantor shall fail to perform or observe in any material respect any of the 
covenants or agreements provided herein or in the Conveyance to be performed 
or observed by Grantor, Grantee, in addition to Grantee's right to recover 
damages and all other remedies available to Grantee at law or in equity, may, 
if such failure shall continue unremedied after fifteen (15) days after 
written notice thereof is delivered to Grantor:

(i) pay, or cause to be paid, any of the costs, expenses, Taxes 
(which Taxes are not being contested in good faith by the Grantor) or other 
amounts which the Grantor has agreed to pay under the Conveyance which have 
become delinquent, and be reimbursed on demand by Grantee for all amounts so 
paid or incurred, together with interest at the Floating Rate from the date 
of such payment until the date of reimbursement; and

(ii) sell, on behalf and for the account of Grantor, all of the 
Hydrocarbons attributable to Grantor's interest in the Subject Interests and 
apply the proceeds thereof to any amount owed by Grantor hereunder; and

(iii) setoff any amount owed by Grantor or its Affiliates to 
Grantee or its Affiliates against any amount owed to Grantor hereunder; and

(iv) apply to a court of equity for the specific performance or 
observance of any such covenant or condition and in aid of the execution of 
any power herein granted and for the appointment of a receiver of the Subject 
Interests and the Hydrocarbons produced therefrom. 

Any purchaser of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Subject 
Interests is authorized and directed to make payment to the Grantee out of 
the Hydrocarbons attributable to Grantor's interest in the Subject Interests 
for any amount which Grantee shall certify to such purchaser that it has paid 
and which Grantor is obligated to pay hereunder. Grantor hereby designates 
Grantee as its agent and attorney in fact to execute any instruments which 
may be necessary or appropriate, including without limitation designations 
of operator, to enable Grantee to exercise its rights under this Section 8. 
This designation and appointment shall be irrevocable as long as the 
Overriding Royalty remains in effect.

9. Force Majeure. In the event of either party being rendered 
unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations 
under this Agreement other than to make payments due hereunder, it is agreed 
that on such party's giving notice and full particulars of such force majeure 
in writing or by telecopy to the other party as soon as possible after the 
occurrence of the cause relied on, then the obligations of the party giving 
such notice, so far as they are affected by such force majeure, shall be 
suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused but for no 
longer period, and such cause shall as far as possible be remedied with all 
reasonable dispatch.

10. Notices. All notices, requests, demands, instructions and 
other communications required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in

12. Successors and Assigns. All the covenants and agreements of 
Grantor and Grantee herein contained shall be deemed to be covenants running 
with the land and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Grantor's 
interest in the Subject Interests and Grantee's interest in the Overriding

respective successors and permitted assigns. The foregoing notwithstanding, 
nothing herein is intended to modify or shall have the effect of modifying 
the restrictions on assignment set forth in the Conveyance regarding 
assignments, transfer or pooling of Grantor's interest in the Subject 
Interests; and the preceding sentence shall not be deemed to permit any 
assignment or other transfer of the interest of Grantor in any of the 
Subject Interests that is not specifically permitted by the provisions of 
the Conveyance. Nothing contained in this instrument or in the Conveyance 
shall in any way limit or restrict the right of Grantee, or Grantee's 
successors and assigns, to sell, convey, assign or mortgage the Overriding 
Royalty in whole or in part. If Grantee, or Grantee's successors and assigns, 
at any time shall execute a mortgage, pledge or deed of trust covering all 
or any part of the Overriding Royalty as security for any obligation, the 
mortgagee, the pledgee or the trustee therein named or the holder of the 
obligation secured thereby shall be entitled, to the extent such mortgage, 
pledge or deed of trust so provides and upon the occurrence or existence of 
the event or condition therein stated, if so conditioned, to exercise all 
of the rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein conferred upon Grantee, 
and to give or withhold all consents herein required or permitted to be 
obtained from Grantee. No assignment by Grantee of its rights hereunder

document signed by the duly authorized representatives of the parties. No 
waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be or

function in Joint Operations is the direct supervision of other 
employees and/or contract labor directly employed on the Joint 
Property in a field operating capacity.
"Technical Employees" shall mean those employees having special and 
specific engineering, geological or other professional skills, and 
whose primary function in Joint Operations is the handling of 
specific operating conditions and problems for the benefit of the 
Joint Property.
"Personal Expenses" shall mean travel and other reasonable 
reimbursable expenses of Operator's employees.
"Material" shall mean personal property, equipment or supplies acquired 
or held for use on the Joint Property.
"Controllable Material" shall mean Material which at the time is so 
classified in the Material Classification Manual as most recently 
recommended by the Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies.

however, all bills and statements rendered to Non-Operators by 
Operator during any calendar year shall conclusively be presumed to 
be true and correct after twenty-four (24) months following the end 
of any such calendar year, unless within the said twenty-four (24) 
month period a Non-Operator takes written exception thereto and makes

Producing Well Rate $2,350 located in the Gulf of Mexico 
is accepted for tow
(2) Application of Overhead - Fixed Rate Basis for Drilling 
Well Rate shall be as follows:
(a) Charges for drilling wells shall begin on the 
date when drilling or completion equipment 
arrives on location and terminate on the date 
the drilling or completion equipment moves off 
location or rig is released, whichever occurs

during suspension of drilling operations for 
fifteen (15) or more consecutive calendar days.
(b) Charges for wells undergoing any type of 
workover or recompletion for a period of five 
(5) consecutive work days or more shall be made 
at the drilling well rate. Such charges shall 
be applied for the period from date workover 
operations, with rig or other units used in 
workover, commence through date of rig or 
other unit release, except that no charge shall 
be made during suspension of operations for 
fifteen (15) or more consecutive calendar days.
(3) Application of Overhead - Fixed Rate Basis for Producing 
Well Rate shall be as follows:

for any portion of the month shall be considered 
as a one-well charge for the entire month.
(b) Each active completion in a multi-completed well 
in which production is not commingled down hole 
shall be considered as a one-well charge 
providing each completion is considered a 
separate well by the governing regulatory 
authority.
(c) An inactive gas well shut in because of 
overproduction or failure of purchaser to take 
the production shall be considered as a one-well 
charge providing the gas well is directly 
connected to a permanent sales outlet.

in which plugging and abandonment operations 
are completed on any well. This one-well 
charge shall be made whether or not the well 
has produced except when drilling well rate 
applies.
(e) All other inactive wells (including but not 
limited to inactive wells covered by unit 
allowable, lease allowable, transferred 
allowable, etc.) shall not qualify for an 
overhead charge.
(4) The well rates shall be adjusted as of the first day 
of April each year following the effective date of 
the agreement to which this Accounting Procedure is 
attached. The adjustment shall be computed by 
multiplying the rate currently in use by the percentage 
increase or decrease in the average weekly earnings of 
Crude Petroleum and Gas Production Workers for the last 
calendar year compared to the calendar year preceding 
as shown by the index of average weekly earnings of 
Crude Petroleum and Gas Fields Production Workers as 
published by the United States Department of Labor,

and shall also include any remedial operations requiring 
a period of five (5) consecutive work days or more on 
any or all wells; also, preliminary expenditures 
necessary in preparation for drilling and expenditures 
incurred in abandoning when the well is not completed 
as a producer, and original cost of construction or 
installation of fixed assets, the expansion of fixed 
assets and any other project clearly discernible as a 
fixed asset, except Major Construction as defined in 
Paragraph 2 of this Section III. All other costs shall 
be considered as Operating except that catastrophe costs 
shall be assessed overhead as provided in Section III, 
Paragraph 3.

2. Overhead - Major Construction

less than $100,000; plus
(2) 3 % of total costs in excess of $100,000 but less than 
$1,000,000; plus
(3) 2 % of total costs in excess of $1,000,000.
Total cost shall mean the gross cost of any one project. For the 
purposes of this paragraph, the component parts of a single project 
shall not be treated separately and the cost of drilling and workover 
wells and artificial lift equipment shall be excluded.
On each project, Operator shall advise Non-Operator(s) in advance

II.

This Mortgage is executed and delivered by Mortgagor to secure and 
enforce the Indebtedness described below:

(a) All Indebtedness as such term is defined in that certain Loan 
Agreement dated December 28, 1993 by and among Mortgagor and Beneficiary (as 
amended or restated from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"), providing for 
loans and advances to be made from time to time by Beneficiary to Mortgagor

(c) Any additional loans or advances made by Beneficiary to or for 
the benefit of Mortgagor pursuant to the Loan Agreement or any other instrument

The term "Indebtedness" as used herein shall mean and include the Note 
and all other indebtedness described, referred to or mentioned in 
paragraphs (a) through (d), inclusive, of this Section II, whether now 
existing or hereafter arising.

The Indebtedness secured hereby is payable on or before December 31, 
2000. 

III.

Mortgagor hereby represents, warrants and covenants as follows:

(a) To the extent of the undivided interests specified on attached 
Exhibit A, Mortgagor has good and marketable title to and is possessed of the 
Mortgaged Property; the Mortgaged Property is free of any and all liens, 
encumbrances, security interests, contracts, agreements, preferential purchase 
rights, unitization agreements or unitization orders or other restrictions or 
limitations of any nature or kind (collectively called the "Encumbrances") 
except those permitted Encumbrances which may be specified herein or on 
attached Exhibit A; that Mortgagor's ownership of the Leases and the undivided 
interests therein as specified on attached Exhibit A will, after giving full 
effect to all Encumbrances, afford Mortgagor not less than those net interests 
in the production from or which is allocated to such Leases as specified on 
attached Exhibit A and will cause Mortgagor to bear not more than that portion 
of the costs of drilling, developing and operating the wells identified on 
Exhibit A as such portion is specified on said Exhibit; none of the 
Encumbrances include any "take or pay," gas balancing or other similar 
provisions in accordance with which Hydrocarbons have been or may be produced 
and delivered without Mortgagor then or thereafter receiving full payment 
therefor and no gas imbalances presently exist; except as otherwise disclosed 
by Mortgagor to Beneficiary in writing, none of the Mortgaged Property is 
subject to any contractual or other arrangement whereby payment for production 
therefrom is to be deferred for a substantial period of time after the month 
in which such production is delivered (i.e., in the case of oil, not in excess 
of 60 days, and in the case of gas, not in excess of 90 days); none of the 
Mortgaged Property is subject to a gas sales contract which contains terms 
which are not customary in the industry; none of the Mortgaged Property is 
subject at present to any regulatory refund obligation and to Mortgagor's 
knowledge no facts exist which might cause the same to be imposed; 
Hydrocarbons currently being produced and sold from or allocated to the 
Mortgaged Property are being purchased by those parties and entities 
identified as "Purchaser" on attached Exhibit A and Mortgagor is currently 
receiving payment and accounting for the proceeds attributable to such 
Hydrocarbons from those parties or entities identified as "Remitter" on said 
attached Exhibit A.

(b) Mortgagor will warrant and defend the title to the Mortgaged 
Property against the claims and demands of all other persons whomsoever and 
will maintain and preserve the lien created hereby so long as any of the 
Indebtedness secured hereby remains unpaid. Should an adverse claim be made 
against or a cloud develop upon the title to any part of the Mortgaged 
Property, Mortgagor agrees it will immediately defend against such adverse 
claim or take appropriate action to remove such cloud at Mortgagor's cost and 
expense, and Mortgagor further agrees that the Trustee and/or Beneficiary may 
take such other action as they deem advisable to protect and preserve their 
interests in the Mortgaged Property, and in such event Mortgagor will 
indemnify the Trustee and Beneficiary against any and all cost, attorney's 
fees and other expenses which they may incur in defending against any such 
adverse claim or taking action to remove any such cloud. Such obligation of 
Mortgagor shall be payable as provided in the Loan Agreement. Except for 
sales of Hydrocarbons as and when produced and in the ordinary course of 
Mortgagor's business or as may be otherwise provided for in writing, Mortgagor 
will not sell, convey or in any manner dispose of the Mortgaged Property or 
any portion thereof without first securing the written consent of the 
Beneficiary.

(c) This Mortgage is, and always will be kept, a direct first lien 
and security interest upon the Mortgaged Property subject only to the permitted
Encumbrances described on Exhibit A and Mortgagor will not create or suffer to 
be created or permit to exist any lien, security interest or charge prior or 
junior to or on a parity with the lien and security interest of this Mortgage 
upon the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof or upon the rents, issues, 
revenues, profits and other income therefrom, and Mortgagor will, from time to 
time, pay or cause to be paid as they become due and payable all taxes, 
assessments and governmental charges lawfully levied or assessed upon the 
Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, or upon or arising from any of the 
rents, issues, revenues, profits and other income from the Mortgaged Property, 
or incident to or in connection with the production of Hydrocarbons or other 
minerals therefrom, or the operation and development thereof; provided, that 
the foregoing covenant shall be suspended so long as the amount, applicability 
or validity of any such charges is being diligently contested in good faith by 
appropriate proceedings and if Mortgagor shall have set up reserves therefor 
which are adequate under generally accepted accounting principles. 

(d) Mortgagor will at its own expense do or cause to be done all 
things necessary to preserve and keep in full repair, working order and 
efficiency all of the Mortgaged Property, including, without limitation, all 
equipment, machinery and facilities, and from time to time will make all the 
needful and proper repairs, renewals and replacements so that at all times the 
state and condition of the Mortgaged Property will be fully preserved and 
maintained in accordance with generally accepted practices in the industry.

(e) Mortgagor will promptly pay and discharge its share of all 
rentals, delay rentals, royalties and indebtedness accruing under, and 
Mortgagor will perform or cause to be performed each and every act, matter or 
thing required by, each and all of the assignments, deeds, leases, subleases, 
contracts and agreements described or referred to herein or affecting 
Mortgagor's interests in the Mortgaged Property, and will do all other things 
necessary to keep unimpaired Mortgagor's rights with respect thereto and 
prevent any forfeiture thereof or default thereunder. Mortgagor will operate 
the Mortgaged Property in a careful and efficient manner in accordance with 
the practices of the industry and in compliance with all applicable contracts 
and agreements and in compliance in all material respects with all applicable 
proration and conservation laws of the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged 
Property is situated, and all applicable laws, rules and regulations of every 
other agency and authority from time to time constituted to regulate the 
development and operation of the Mortgaged Property and the production and 
sale of Hydrocarbons and other minerals therefrom. Mortgagor will do or cause 
to be done such development work as may be reasonably necessary to the prudent 
and economical operation of the Mortgaged Property in accordance with the 
approved practices of operators in the industry, including all that which may 
be appropriate to be done to protect from diminution the productive capacity 
of the Mortgaged Property and each producing well thereon including, without 
limitation, cleaning out and reconditioning each well from time to time, 
plugging and completing at a different interval or zone each such well, 
drilling a substitute well to conform to changed spacing regulations and to 
protect the Mortgaged Property against drainage whenever and as often as is 
necessary.

(f) Mortgagor will maintain the insurance coverages as specified in 
Section 4.09 of the Loan Agreement. The loss payable clauses with respect to 
all property damage coverage shall be endorsed in favor of and made payable to 
the Beneficiary as the interests of the Beneficiary may appear and the 
Beneficiary shall be named as an additional insured with respect to all 
insurance providing liability coverages. The Beneficiary shall have the right 
to collect, and Mortgagor hereby assigns to the Beneficiary, any and all 
monies that may become payable under any policies of property damage insurance 
and the Beneficiary may apply all or any part of the sums so collected at the 
Beneficiary's election toward payment of the Indebtedness, whether or not such 
Indebtedness is then due and payable. If Beneficiary elects to apply such 
proceeds to the Indebtedness and after payment in full of such Indebtedness 
should any surplus remain, said surplus shall be paid over to Mortgagor.

(g) Mortgagor will permit the Trustee and/or the Beneficiary and the 
agents of either of them to visit and inspect any of the Mortgaged Property at 
their sole risk, to examine the books of account of Mortgagor and to discuss 
the affairs, finances or accounts of Mortgagor, and to be advised as to the 
same by any officer or employee of Mortgagor, all at such reasonable times or 
intervals as the Trustee or the Beneficiary may desire.

(h) Mortgagor will, upon request by Beneficiary, furnish or cause to 
be furnished to the Beneficiary reports prepared by or for Mortgagor 
concerning the productivity and the productive life of all or any wells 
included in the Mortgaged Property; the quantity of the Hydrocarbons and other 
minerals recoverable therefrom; the projected income and expense attributable 
to the Mortgaged Property; and the expediency of any change in methods of 
treatment or operation of all of any well included in the Mortgaged Property; 
any new drilling or development; any abandonment or proposed abandonment of 
any well; any plugging of any well or reopening of same at a different 
interval or zone; any method of repressuring in the field or any other action 
with respect to the Mortgaged Property; and further upon request of the 
Beneficiary, will furnish a report of Ryder, Scott & Co. or another 
independent engineer acceptable to the Beneficiary covering such of the 
foregoing matters as shall be so requested. Mortgagor will, also upon request 
by the Beneficiary, furnish the Beneficiary within thirty (30) days after the 
end of Mortgagor's fiscal quarter a report showing for such fiscal quarter the 
gross proceeds of the sale of Hydrocarbons and other minerals from the 
Mortgaged Property, the quantities so sold, the taxes deducted from or paid 
out of such proceeds, the number of wells operated, drilled and abandoned and 
such other information as the Beneficiary may reasonably request.

(i) Mortgagor will comply with the obligations of Sections 4.08 and 
8.04 of the Loan Agreement with respect to payment of or reimbursement for 
expenses and indemnification made by the Mortgagor to or for the benefit of 
Beneficiary. Any amount to be paid hereunder by Mortgagor to the Trustee or 
the Beneficiary shall be a demand obligation owing by Mortgagor (which 
obligation Mortgagor hereby expressly promises to pay) to the Trustee or the 
Beneficiary (as the case may be) and shall bear interest as set for in the 
Loan Agreement.

(j) Mortgagor will execute and deliver such further instruments and 
do such further acts as may be necessary or desirable or as may be reasonably 
requested by the Trustee or the Beneficiary to carry out more effectively the 
purposes of this Mortgage and to subject to the lien created hereby any 
properties, rights and interests covered or intended to be covered hereby. At 
the request of the Beneficiary, Mortgagor will deliver to Beneficiary an 
inventory and/or financing statements describing and showing the make, model, 
serial number and location of all equipment and machinery forming a part of 
the Mortgaged Property.

(k) If any tax is levied or assessed against the Indebtedness 
described herein or any part thereof, or against this Mortgage, or against the 
Beneficiary with respect to the Indebtedness or any part thereof or this 
Mortgage, Mortgagor shall promptly pay the same.

(l) All or portions of the Mortgaged Property may be comprised of 
interests in the Leases which are other than working interests or which may be 
operated by a party or parties other than Mortgagor and with respect to all or 
any such Leases as may be comprised of interests other than working interests 
or which may be operated by parties other than Mortgagor, Mortgagor's 
covenants as expressed in paragraphs (d) through (g) inclusive of this 
Section III are modified to require that Mortgagor use its best efforts to 
obtain compliance with such covenants by the working interest owners or the 
operator or operators of such Leases.

(m) Mortgagor agrees that if Mortgagor fails to perform any act or 
to take any action which Mortgagor is required to perform or take hereunder or 
pay any money which Mortgagor is required to pay hereunder, the Trustee and/or 
the Beneficiary in Mortgagor's name or its own name may, but shall not be 
obligated to, perform or cause to perform such act or take such action or pay 
such money, and any expenses so incurred by the Trustee or the Beneficiary and 
any money so paid by the Trustee or the Beneficiary shall be a demand 
obligation owing by Mortgagor to the Trustee or the Beneficiary and the 
Trustee or the Beneficiary, upon making such payment, shall be subrogated to 
all of the rights of the person, corporation or body politic receiving such 
payment. Each amount due and owing by Mortgagor to holders of the 
Indebtedness and/or the Trustee pursuant to this Mortgage shall bear interest 
from the date of such expenditure or payment or other occurrence which gives 
rise to such amount being owed to the Trustee or the Beneficiary until paid as 
provided in the Loan Agreement, and all such amounts together with such 
interest thereon shall be a part of the Indebtedness and shall be secured by 
this Mortgage.

(n) Mortgagor is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of (i) 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter called the "Code"), 
Sections 1445 and 7701 (i.e., Mortgagor is not a nonresident alien, foreign 
corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust or foreign estate as those 
terms are defined in the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder), or 
(ii) 22 U.S.C.A. Section 3101 et seq. (International Investment Survey Act of
1976).

IV.

(a) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default as defined in 
Section 6.01 of the Loan Agreement, Beneficiary may, in accordance with the 
provisions of the Loan Agreement declare the Note to be due and payable 
whereupon said Note shall become immediately due and payable without notice of 
any kind; provided, however, that the occurrence of an Event of Default as 
described in Section 6.01(e), (f) and (g) of the Loan Agreement shall result in 
the immediate and automatic acceleration of maturity of the Note and all other 
Indebtedness. All costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by 
the Beneficiary in protecting and enforcing its rights hereunder shall 
constitute a demand obligation owing by Mortgagor and shall bear interest as 
provided in the Loan Agreement and shall constitute a portion of the 
indebtedness secured hereby and shall have the benefit of the lien, privilege 
and security interest hereby created.

(b) If the Note or any of the Indebtedness shall become due and 
payable, and Mortgagor shall not promptly pay the same, the Beneficiary shall 
have the right and option to proceed with foreclosure by directing the 
Trustee, or his successors or substitutes in trust, to proceed with 
foreclosure and to sell, to the extent permitted by law, all or any portion of 
the Mortgaged Property at one or more sales, as an entirety or in parcels, at 
such place or places and otherwise in such manner and upon such notice as may 
be required by law, or, in the absence of any such requirement, as the Trustee 
may deem appropriate, and to make conveyance to the purchaser or purchasers. 
Any sale of any part of the Mortgaged Property located in the State of Texas 
shall be made at the area designated by the Commissioner's Court (or if no 
area is designated by the Commissioners Court, the area designated in the 
notice of sale at the courthouse of the county in which such part of the 
Mortgaged Property to be sold at such sale is located), on the first Tuesday 
in any month, between the hours of 10:00 o'clock A.M. and 4:00 o'clock P.M. to 
the highest bidder for cash at public auction, after the Trustee shall have 
given notice of sale in accordance with the statutes of the State of Texas 
then in force governing sales of real estate under powers conferred by deed of 
trust. Where any part of the Mortgaged Property is situated in more than one 
county, notices as above provided shall be posted and filed in all such 
counties, and all such Mortgaged Property may be sold in any such county and 
such notice shall designate the county where such Mortgaged Property is to be 
sold. The affidavit of any person having knowledge of the facts to the effect 
that such notice was completed shall be prima facie evidence of the fact of 
notice. In the event any sale hereunder is not completed or is defective in 
the opinion of the Beneficiary, such sale shall not exhaust the power of sale 
hereunder, and the Beneficiary shall have the right to cause a subsequent sale 
or sales to be made by the Trustee. Upon receipt of the sale price in the 
case of a third party purchase or upon the crediting of the Indebtedness to 
the sales price if the purchaser is the Beneficiary, the Trustee is hereby 
authorized, empowered and directed to make due conveyance to the purchaser or 
purchasers, with general warranty binding upon Mortgagor and the heirs, 
successors and assigns of Mortgagor subject to the matters set forth on 
Exhibit A. The right of sale hereunder shall not be exhausted by one or more 
such sales, and the Trustee may make other and successive sales until all of 
the Mortgaged Property be legally sold or the Note and all of the Indebtedness 
shall have been paid. Mortgagor hereby irrevocably appoints the Trustee to be 
the attorney of Mortgagor and in the name and on behalf of Mortgagor to 
execute and deliver any deeds, transfers, conveyances, assignments, assurances 
and notices which Mortgagor ought to execute and deliver and do and perform 
any and all such acts and things which Mortgagor ought to do and perform under 
the covenants herein contained and generally, to use the name of Mortgagor in 
the exercise of all or any of the powers hereby conferred on the Trustee. Upon 
any sale, whether under the power of sale hereby given or by virtue of 
judicial proceedings, it shall not be necessary for the Trustee or any public 
officer acting under execution or order of court to have physically present or 
constructively in his possession any of the Mortgaged Property, and Mortgagor 
hereby agrees to deliver all of such personal property to the purchasers at 
such sale on the date of sale, and if it should be impossible or impracticable 
to make actual delivery of such property, then the title and right of 
possession to such property shall pass to the purchaser at such sale as 
completely as if the same had been actually present and delivered. Recitals 
contained in any conveyance made by the Trustee to any purchaser at any sale 
made pursuant hereto shall conclusively establish the truth and accuracy of 
the matters therein treated, including, without limiting the generality of the 
foregoing, nonpayment of the unpaid principal sum of, or the interest accrued 
on, the Note or any of the Indebtedness after the same has become due and 
payable, advertisement and conduct of such sale in the manner provided herein 
and appointment of any successor trustee hereunder. Upon any sale, whether 
made under the power of sale hereby given or by virtue of judicial 
proceedings, the receipt of the Trustee, or of the officer making a sale under 
judicial proceedings, shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or 
purchasers at any sale for his or their purchase money, and such purchaser or 
purchasers, his or their assigns or personal representatives, shall not, after 
paying such purchase money and receiving such receipt of the Trustee or of 
such officer therefor, be obliged to see to the application of such purchase 
money, or be in anywise answerable for any loss, misapplication or 
nonapplication thereof. The Trustee or his successor or substitute may 
appoint or delegate any one or more persons as agent to perform any act or 
acts necessary or incident to any sale held by Trustee, including the posting 
of notices and the conduct of sale, but in the name and on behalf of Trustee, 
his successor or substitute. If Trustee or his successor or substitute shall 
have given notice of sale hereunder, any successor or substitute trustee 
thereafter appointed may complete the sale and the conveyance of the property 
pursuant thereto as if such notice had been given by the successor or 
substitute trustee conducting the sale. The Beneficiary shall have the right 
to become the purchaser at any sale held by the Trustee or by any receiver or 
public officer and shall have the right to have the amount of Indebtedness 
then owing to the Beneficiary credited against the amount of the bid made by 
the Beneficiary at such sale. 

(c) If the Note or any of the Indebtedness shall become due and 
payable and shall not be promptly paid, the Trustee or the Beneficiary shall 
have the right and power to proceed by a suit or suits in equity or at law, 
whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein 
contained or in aid of the execution of any power herein granted, or for any 
foreclosure hereunder or for the sale of the Mortgaged Property under the 
judgment or decree of any court or courts of competent jurisdiction, or for 
the appointment of a receiver pending any foreclosure hereunder or the sale of 
the Mortgaged Property under the order of a court or courts of competent 
jurisdiction or under other legal process, or for the enforcement of any other 
appropriate legal or equitable remedy. Any money advanced by the Trustee 
and/or the Beneficiary in connection with any such receivership shall be a 
demand obligation (which obligation Mortgagor hereby expressly promises to 
pay) owing by Mortgagor to the Trustee and/or the Beneficiary and shall bear 
interest from the date of making such advance by the Trustee and/or the 
Beneficiary until paid as provided in the Loan Agreement. Mortgagor agrees to 
the full extent that it lawfully may, that, in case one or more of the Events 
of Default shall have occurred and shall not have been remedied, then, and in 
every such case, the Trustee or Beneficiary shall have the right and power to 
enter into and upon and take possession of all or any part of the Mortgaged 
Property in the possession of Mortgagor, its successors or assigns, or its or 
their agents or servants, and may exclude Mortgagor, its successors or 
assigns, and all persons claiming under Mortgagor, and its or their agents or 
servants wholly or partly therefrom; and, holding the same, the Trustee may 
use, administer, manage, operate and control the Mortgaged Property and 
conduct the business thereof to the same extent as Mortgagor, its successors 
or assigns, might at the time do and may exercise all rights and powers of 
Mortgagor, in the name, place and stead of Mortgagor, or otherwise as the 
Trustee shall deem best. All reasonable costs, expenses and liabilities of 
every character incurred by the Trustee and/or the Beneficiary in 
administering, managing, operating, and controlling the Mortgaged Property 
shall constitute a demand obligation (which obligation Mortgagor hereby 
expressly promises to pay) owing by Mortgagor to the Trustee and/or the 
Beneficiary and shall bear interest from date of expenditure until paid as 
provided in the Loan Agreement, all of which shall constitute a portion of the 
Indebtedness and shall be secured by this Mortgage and by any other instrument 
securing the Indebtedness. In connection with any action taken by the Trustee 
and/or the Beneficiary pursuant to this paragraph (c), the Trustee and/or the 
Beneficiary shall not be liable for any loss sustained by Mortgagor resulting 
from any act or omission of the Trustee and/or the Beneficiary in 
administering, managing, operating or controlling the Mortgaged Property 
unless such loss is caused by its own willful misconduct and/or bad faith, nor 
shall the Trustee and/or the Beneficiary be obligated to perform or discharge 
any obligation, duty or liability of Mortgagor. Mortgagor shall and does 
hereby agree to indemnify the Trustee and/or the Beneficiary for, and to hold 
the Trustee and/or the Beneficiary harmless from, any and all liability, loss 
or damage which may or might be incurred by the Trustee and/or the Beneficiary 
(except for liability, loss or damage resulting by reason of the willful 
misconduct and/or bad faith of the Trustee and/or the Beneficiary) or the 
exercise of rights or remedies hereunder; should the Trustee and/or the 
Beneficiary make any expenditure on account of any such liability, loss or 
damage, the amount thereof, including costs, expenses and reasonable 
attorneys' fees, shall be a demand obligation (which obligation Mortgagor 
hereby expressly promises to pay) owing by Mortgagor to the Trustee and/or the 
Beneficiary and shall bear interest from the date expended until paid as 
provided in the Loan Agreement, shall be a part of the Indebtedness and shall 
be secured by this Mortgage and any other instrument securing the secured 
indebtedness. Mortgagor hereby assents to, ratifies and confirms any and all 
actions of the Trustee and/or the Beneficiary with respect to the Mortgaged 
Property taken under this paragraph (c), except as otherwise provided herein.

(d) Every right, power and remedy herein given to the Trustee or the 
Beneficiary shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right, power 
and remedy herein specifically given or now or hereafter existing in equity, 
at law or by statute; and each and every right, power and remedy whether 
specifically herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to 
time and so often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the Trustee 
or the Beneficiary, and the exercise, or the beginning of the exercise, of any 
such right, power or remedy shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to 
exercise, at the same time or thereafter any other right, power or remedy. No 
delay or omission by the Trustee or the Beneficiary in the exercise of any 
right, power or remedy shall impair any such right, power or remedy or operate 
as a waiver thereof or of any other right, power or remedy then or thereafter 
existing.

(e) Any sale or sales of the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, 
whether under the power of sale herein granted and conferred or under and by 
virtue of judicial proceedings, shall operate to divest all right, title, 
interest, claim and demand whatsoever, either at law or in equity, of 
Mortgagor of, in and to the premises and the property sold, and shall be a 
perpetual bar, both at law and in equity, against Mortgagor, its successors 
and assigns, and against any and all persons claiming or who shall thereafter 
claim all or any of the property sold from, through or under Mortgagor, its 
successors and assigns subject to the matters set forth on Exhibit A; and 
Mortgagor, if requested by the Trustee or the Beneficiary so to do, shall join 
in the execution and delivery of all proper conveyances, assignments and 
transfers of the properties so sold. The proceeds of any sale of the 
Mortgaged Property or any part thereof and all other moneys received by the 
Trustee in any proceedings for the enforcement hereof, whose application has 
not elsewhere herein been specifically provided for, shall be applied first, 
to the payment of all reasonable expenses incurred by the Trustee or the 
Beneficiary incident to the enforcement of this Mortgage, the Note or any of 
the Indebtedness (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
reasonable expenses of any entry or taking of possession, of any sale, of 
advertisement thereof, and of conveyances, and court costs, compensation of 
agents and employees, legal fees and a reasonable commission to the Trustee 
acting), and to the payment of all other reasonable charges, expenses, 
liabilities and advances incurred or made by the Trustee or the Beneficiary 
under this Mortgage or in executing any trust or power hereunder; and then to 
payment of the Note and the Indebtedness in such order and manner as the 
Beneficiary may elect. The Beneficiary may resort to any security given by 
this Mortgage or to any other security now existing or hereafter given to 
secure the payment of any of the Indebtedness secured hereby, in whole or in 
part, and in such portions and in such order as may seem best to the 
Beneficiary in its sole and uncontrolled discretion, and any such action shall 
not in anywise be considered as a waiver of any of the rights, benefits or 
liens created by this Mortgage. Should any surplus or balance remain from any 
sale of the Mortgaged Property after the payment in full of the Indebtedness, 
any such surplus or balance shall be paid to Mortgagor. Mortgagor agrees, to 
the full extent that it may lawfully so agree, that it will not at any time 
insist upon or plead or in any manner whatever claim or take the benefit or 
advantage of any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or redemption law 
now or hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement or 
foreclosure of this Mortgage or the absolute sale of the Mortgaged Property or 
the possession thereof by any purchaser at any sale made pursuant to any 
provision hereof, or pursuant to the decree of any court of competent 
jurisdiction; but Mortgagor, for itself and all who may claim through or under 
it, so far as it or they now or hereafter lawfully may, hereby waives the 
benefit of all such laws. Mortgagor, for itself and all who may claim through 
or under it, waives to the extent that it may lawfully do so, any and all 
right to have the property included in the Mortgaged Property marshaled upon 
any foreclosure of the lien hereof, and agrees that the Trustee or any court 
having jurisdiction to foreclose such lien may sell the Mortgaged Property as 
an entirety or in parcels. If any law referred to herein and now in force, of 
which Mortgagor or its successor or successors might take advantage despite 
the provisions hereof, shall hereafter be repealed or cease to be in force, 
such law shall not thereafter be deemed to constitute any part of the contract 
herein contained or to preclude the operation or application of the provisions 
hereof.

V. 

(a) Mortgagor has absolutely and unconditionally assigned, 
transferred, and conveyed, and does hereby absolutely and unconditionally 
assign, transfer and convey unto Beneficiary, its successors and assigns, 
Mortgagor's net revenue interest share as set forth in Exhibit A of all of the 
Hydrocarbons and all products obtained or processed therefrom, and the 
revenues and proceeds now and hereafter attributable to the Hydrocarbons and 
said products and all payments in lieu of the Hydrocarbons such as "take or 
pay" payments or settlements. The Hydrocarbons and products are to be 
delivered into pipe lines connected with the Mortgaged Property, or to the 
purchaser thereof, to the credit of the Beneficiary, free and clear of all 
taxes, charges, costs, and expenses; and all such revenues and proceeds shall 
be paid directly to the Beneficiary, for deposit to the Lender's Account as 
defined in the Loan Agreement, with no duty or obligation of any party paying 
the same to inquire into the rights of the Beneficiary to receive the same, 
what application is made thereof, or as to any other matter. Mortgagor agrees 
to perform all such acts, and to execute all such further assignments, 
transfers and division orders, and other instruments as may be required or 
desired by the Beneficiary or any party in order to have said proceeds and 
revenues so paid to the Beneficiary. The Beneficiary is fully authorized to 
receive and receipt for said revenues and proceeds; to endorse and cash any 
and all checks and drafts payable to the order of Mortgagor or the Beneficiary 
for the account of Mortgagor received from or in connection with said revenues 
or proceeds and apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of the Indebtedness, 
when received, regardless of the maturity of any of the Indebtedness, or any 
installment thereof; and to execute transfer and division orders in the name 
of Mortgagor, or otherwise, with warranties binding Mortgagor. The 
Beneficiary shall not be liable for any delay, neglect, or failure to effect 
collection of any proceeds or to take any other action in connection therewith 
or hereunder; but the Beneficiary shall have the right, at its election, in 
the name of Mortgagor or otherwise, to prosecute and defend any and all 
actions or legal proceedings deemed advisable by the Beneficiary in order to 
collect such funds and to protect the interests of the Beneficiary, and/or 
Mortgagor, with all costs, expenses and attorneys' fees incurred in connection 
therewith being paid by Mortgagor. Mortgagor hereby agrees to indemnify the 
Beneficiary against all claims, actions, liabilities, judgments, costs, 
charges and attorneys' fees made against or incurred by it based on the 
assertion that the Beneficiary has received funds from the production of 
Hydrocarbons claimed by third persons either before or after the payment in 
full of the Indebtedness. The Beneficiary shall have the right to defend 
against any such claims, actions and judgments, employing its attorneys 
therefor, and if the Beneficiary is not furnished with reasonable indemnity, 
it shall have the right to compromise and adjust any such claims, actions and 
judgments. Mortgagor agrees to indemnify and pay to the Beneficiary any and 
all such claims, judgments, costs, charges and attorney's fees as may be paid 
in any judgment, release or discharge thereof or as may be adjudged against 
the Beneficiary. Such obligation shall be payable on demand and shall bear 
interest from the date of demand therefor until paid as provided in the Loan 
Agreement. Mortgagor hereby appoints Beneficiary as its attorney-in-fact to 
pursue any and all rights of Mortgagor to liens on and security interests in 
the Hydrocarbons securing payment of proceeds of runs attributable to the 
Hydrocarbons, including but not limited to those liens and security interests 
provided for by Section 9.319 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code and/or 
any similar laws of any other states in which the Mortgaged Property or any 
part thereof may be located. In addition to the rights granted to Trustee 
and/or Beneficiary in Section I (c) of this Mortgage, Mortgagor hereby further 
transfers and assigns to Beneficiary any and all such liens, security 
interests, financing statements or similar interests of Mortgagor attributable 
to its interest in the Hydrocarbons and proceeds of runs therefrom arising 
under or created by said statutory provision, judicial decision or otherwise. 
The power of attorney granted to Beneficiary in this paragraph, being coupled 
with an interest, shall be irrevocable so long as the Indebtedness or any part 
thereof remains unpaid.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions in
this Article, for so long as no Suspension Event as defined in the Loan 
Agreement shall exist, Mortgagor shall have the license to collect all of the 
revenues attributable to the Mortgaged Property; and no such payment shall 
affect or impair the lien of this Mortgage or the validity and effect of the 
assignment contained in this Article V(a). During a Suspension Event, such 
license shall be revoked and all proceeds of the sale of oil, gas or other 
minerals in and under or produced from the Mortgaged Property assigned 
hereunder shall be paid directly to Mortgagee in the manner provided in 
Article V(a). In the event payments are made directly to Mortgagee and then, 
at the request of Mortgagee, payments are, for periods of time, paid to 
Mortgagor, Mortgagee shall nevertheless have the right, effective upon written 
notice, to require that future payments be again made to it.

(b) Nothing herein contained shall modify or otherwise alter the 
obligation of Mortgagor to make prompt payment of all principal and interest 
owing on the Note and all other Indebtedness when and as the same become due 
regardless of whether the proceeds of the Hydrocarbons are sufficient to pay 
the same and the rights provided in accordance with the foregoing assignment 
provision shall be cumulative of all other security of any and every character 
now or hereafter existing to secure payment of the Indebtedness.

(c) To further secure the Indebtedness, Mortgagor hereby grants to 
the Beneficiary a security interest in and to the Mortgaged Property insofar as
the Mortgaged Property consists of equipment, accounts, contract rights, 
general intangibles, inventory, Hydrocarbons, fixtures and any and all other 
personal property of any kind or character defined in and subject to the 
provisions of the Texas Uniform Commercial Code, including the proceeds and 
products from any and all of such personal property. Upon the happening of 
any of the Events of Default, the Beneficiary is and shall be entitled to all 
of the rights, powers and remedies afforded a secured party by the applicable 
Uniform Commercial Code with reference to the personal property and fixtures 
in which the Beneficiary has been granted a security interest herein, or the 
Trustee or the Beneficiary may proceed as to both the real and personal 
property covered hereby in accordance with the rights and remedies granted 
under this Mortgage in respect of the real property covered hereby. Such 
rights, powers and remedies shall be cumulative and in addition to those 
granted to the Trustee or the Beneficiary under any other provision of this 
instrument or under any other instrument executed in connection with or as 
security for the Note or any of the Indebtedness. Written notice mailed to 
Mortgagor as provided herein at least five business (5) days prior to the date 
of public sale of any part of the Mortgaged Property which is personal 
property subject to the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, shall 
constitute reasonable notice.

(d) Without in any manner limiting the generality of any of the 
other provisions of this Mortgage: (i) some portions of the goods described or 
to which reference is made herein are or are to become fixtures on the land 
described or to which reference is made herein or on attached Exhibit A; 
(ii) the security interests created hereby under applicable provisions of the 
Uniform Commercial Code of one or more of the jurisdictions in which the 
Mortgaged Property is situated will attach to Hydrocarbons (minerals including 
oil and gas) or the accounts resulting from the sale thereof at the wellhead 
or minehead located on the land described or to which reference is made 
herein; (iii) this instrument is to be filed of record in the real estate 
records as a financing statement, and (iv) Mortgagor is the record title owner 
of the real estate or interests in the real estate comprised of the Mortgaged 
Property.

VI.

(a) It shall be no part of the duty of the Trustee to see to any 
recording, filing or registration of this Mortgage or any other instrument in 
addition or supplemental thereto, or to give any notice thereof, or to see to 
the payment of or be under any duty in respect of any tax or assessment or 
other governmental charge which may be levied or assessed on the Mortgaged 
Property, or any part thereof, or against Mortgagor, or to see to the 
performance or observance by Mortgagor of any of the covenants and agreements 
contained herein. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the execution, 
acknowledgment or validity of this Mortgage or of any instrument in addition 
or supplemental hereto or for the sufficiency of the security purported to be 
created hereby, and makes no representation in respect thereof or in respect 
of the rights of the Beneficiary. The Trustee shall have the right to advise 
with counsel upon any matters arising hereunder and shall be fully protected 
in relying as to legal matters on the advice of counsel. The Trustee shall 
not incur any personal liability hereunder except for his own willful 
misconduct and/or bad faith; and the Trustee shall have the right to rely on 
any instrument, document or signature authorizing or supporting any action 
taken or proposed to be taken by him hereunder, believed by him in good faith 
to be genuine.

(b) The Trustee may resign by written notice addressed to or be 
removed at any time with or without cause by an instrument in writing duly 
executed on behalf of the Beneficiary. In case of the death, resignation or 
removal of the Trustee, a successor trustee may be appointed by the 
Beneficiary by instrument of substitution complying with any applicable 
requirements of law, or, in the absence of any such requirement, without other 
formality than appointment and designation in writing. Written notice of such 
appointment and designation shall be given by the Beneficiary to Mortgagor, 
but the validity of any such appointment shall not be impaired or affected by 
failure to give such notice or by any defect therein. Such appointment and 
designation shall be full evidence of the right and authority to make the same 
and of all the facts therein recited, and, upon the making of any such 
appointment and designation, this Mortgage shall vest in the successor trustee 
named all the estate and title in and to all of the Mortgaged Property, and he 
shall thereupon succeed to all of the rights, powers, privileges, immunities 
and duties hereby conferred upon the Trustee named herein, and one such 
appointment and designation shall not exhaust the right to appoint and 
designate a successor trustee hereunder but such right may be exercised 
repeatedly as long as any Indebtedness remains unpaid hereunder. If no 
successor Trustee shall have been appointed as contemplated by the foregoing 
provisions, or if appointed shall not have accepted the appointment, within 30 
days after the resignation of, or the occurrence of a vacancy in the office 
of, the Trustee, then upon application of the Beneficiary or the retiring 
Trustee, a successor trustee may be appointed by any court of competent 
jurisdiction. In case the Note or any or all of the Indebtedness shall become 
due and payable and shall not promptly be paid, then upon request of the 
Beneficiary, the Trustee shall give security, satisfactory to the Beneficiary, 
for the faithful performance and discharge of his duties hereunder. The cost 
of, or premium paid for, any bond which may be given as all or part of such 
security shall be an expense of the Trustee for which he is entitled to 
reimbursement as provided herein. To facilitate the administration of the 
duties hereunder, the Beneficiary may appoint multiple trustees to serve in 
such capacity or in such jurisdictions as the Beneficiary may designate.

VII.

(a) If all Indebtedness secured hereby shall be paid, this Mortgage
shall become null and void and the Mortgaged Property shall revert to 
Mortgagor, and the Beneficiary shall forthwith cause satisfaction and 
discharge of this Mortgage to be entered upon the record at the expense of 
Mortgagor and shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered 
such instruments of satisfaction and reassignment as may be appropriate. 
Otherwise, this Mortgage shall remain and continue in full force and effect.

(b) If any provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable in any 
jurisdiction, the other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and 
effect in such jurisdiction and the remaining provisions hereof shall be 
liberally construed in favor of the Trustee and the Beneficiary in order to 
effectuate the provisions hereof, and the invalidity or unenforceability of 
any provision hereof in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or 
enforceability of any such provision in any other jurisdiction.

(c) This instrument may be construed as a mortgage, deed of trust, 
chattel mortgage, conveyance, assignment, security agreement, pledge, 
financing statement, hypothecation or contract, or any one or more of them, in 
order fully to effectuate the lien hereof and the purposes and agreements 
herein set forth.

(d) The term "Mortgagor" as used herein shall mean and include all 
and each of the individuals, partnerships, corporations or other legal entities
or persons executing this Mortgage. The number and gender of pronouns used in 
referring to Mortgagor shall be construed to mean and correspond with the 
number and gender of the individuals, partnerships, corporations or other 
legal entities or persons executing this Mortgage as Mortgagor. The term 
"Beneficiary" as used herein shall mean and include any legal owner, holder, 
assignee or pledgee of any of the Indebtedness secured hereby. The terms used 
to designate Trustee, Beneficiary and Mortgagor shall be deemed to include the 
respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of such 
parties.

(e) To the extent that proceeds of the Note are used to pay 
indebtedness secured by any outstanding lien, security interest, charge or 
prior encumbrance against the Mortgaged Property, such proceeds have been 
advanced by the Beneficiary at Mortgagor's request, and the Beneficiary shall 
be subrogated to any and all rights, security interests and liens owned by any 
owner or holder of such outstanding liens, security interests, charges or 
encumbrances, irrespective of whether said liens, security interests, charges 
or encumbrances are released, and it is expressly understood that, in 
consideration of the payment of such other indebtedness by the Beneficiary, 
Mortgagor hereby waives and releases all demands and causes of action for 
offsets and payments to, upon and in connection with the said indebtedness.

(f) This instrument is made with full substitution and subrogation of 
the Trustee and his successors in this trust and his and their assigns in and 
to all covenants and warranties by others heretofore given or made in respect 
of the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof.

(g) The covenants and agreements herein contained shall constitute 
covenants running with the land and interests covered or affected hereby and 
shall be binding upon the heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns 
of the parties hereto.

(h) All notices, requests, consents, demands and other 
communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be 
deemed sufficiently given or furnished if delivered by registered or certified 
United States mail, postage prepaid, or by personal service (including express 
or courier service) at the addresses specified at the end of this Mortgage 
(unless changed by similar notice in writing given by the particular party 
whose address is to be changed). Any such notice or communication shall be 
deemed to have been given either at the time of personal delivery or, in the 
case of delivery at the address and in the manner provided herein, upon 
receipt; provided that, service of notice as required by Texas Property 
Code Section 51.002, as amended, or as required by any laws of any other 
state in which portions of the Mortgaged Property may be situated shall for
all purposes be deemed appropriate and sufficient with the giving of such
notice.

(i) In the event there is a foreclosure sale hereunder and at the 
time of such sale Mortgagor or Mortgagor's representatives, successors or 
assigns or any other person claiming any interest in the Mortgaged Property by,
through or under Mortgagor, are occupying or using the Mortgaged Property or 
any part thereof, each and all shall immediately become the tenant of the 
purchaser at such sale, which tenancy shall be a tenancy from day to day, 
terminable at the will of either the landlord or tenant, or at a reasonable 
rental per day based upon the value of the property occupied, such rental to 
be due daily to the purchaser; to the extent permitted by applicable law, the 
purchaser at such sale shall, notwithstanding any language herein apparently 
to the contrary, have the sole option to demand immediate possession following 
the sale or to permit the occupants to remain as tenants at will. In the 
event the tenant fails to surrender possession of said property upon demand, 
the purchaser shall be entitled to institute and maintain a summary action for 
possession of the Mortgaged Property (such as an action for forcible entry and 
detainer) in any court having jurisdiction. The purchaser or purchasers at 
foreclosure shall have the right to affirm or disaffirm any lease of the 
Mortgaged Property or any part thereof.

(j) This instrument shall be governed by and enforced in accordance 
with the laws of the State of Texas. Mortgagor and Beneficiary expressly 
acknowledge, agree and confirm, however, that the Note and the Loan Agreement 
are and shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the 
State of Colorado.

(k) THE PARTIES HERETO SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT THEY HAVE A DUTY TO 
READ THIS MORTGAGE AND AGREE THAT THEY ARE CHARGED WITH NOTICE AND KNOWLEDGE 
OF THE TERMS HEREOF; THAT SUCH PARTIES HAVE IN FACT READ THIS AGREEMENT AND 
ARE FULLY INFORMED AND HAVE FULL NOTICE AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TERMS CONDITIONS 
AND AFFECTS OF THIS AGREEMENT; THAT EACH HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY INDEPENDENT 
LEGAL COUNSEL OF ITS CHOICE THROUGHOUT THE NEGOTIATIONS PRECEDING EXECUTION 
HEREOF AND EACH HAS RECEIVED THE ADVICE OF ITS ATTORNEY IN ENTERING INTO THIS 
MORTGAGE. EACH PARTY HERETO RECOGNIZES THAT CERTAIN OF THE TERMS OF THIS 
MORTGAGE RESULT IN ONE PARTY ASSUMING THE LIABILITY INHERENT IN SOME ASPECTS 
OF THE TRANSACTION AND RELIEVING THE OTHER PARTY OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
SUCH LIABILITY. EACH PARTY HERETO COVENANTS AND AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT 
CONTEST THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY EXCULPATORY PROVISION OF THIS 
MORTGAGE ON THE BASIS THAT SUCH PARTY HAD NO NOTICE OR KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH 
PROVISION OR THAT THE PROVISION IS NOT "CONSPICUOUS."

III.

Mortgagor hereby represents, warrants and covenants as
follows:

(a) To the extent of the undivided interests specified on
attached Exhibit A, Mortgagor has good and marketable title to
and is possessed of the Mortgaged Property; the Mortgaged
Property is free of any and all liens, encumbrances, security
interests, contracts, agreements, preferential purchase rights,
unitization agreements or unitization orders or other
restrictions or limitations of any nature or kind (collectively
called the "Encumbrances") except those permitted Encumbrances
which may be specified herein or on attached Exhibit A; that
Mortgagor's ownership of the Leases and the undivided interests
therein as specified on attached Exhibit A will, after giving
full effect to all Encumbrances, afford Mortgagor not less than
those net interests, as specified on attached Exhibit A as in the
production from those wells and/or units (identified on Exhibit
A) located on the Mortgaged Property (or properties now or
hereafter pooled or unitized therewith), or production which is
allocated to such Leases, and will cause Mortgagor to bear not
more than that portion, as specified on attached Exhibit A as, of
the costs of drilling, developing and operating such wells and/or
units as specified on Exhibit A; none of the Mortgaged Property
is subject to a gas sales contract which contains terms which are
not customary in the industry; none of the Mortgaged Property is
subject at present to any regulatory refund obligation and to
Mortgagor's knowledge no facts exist which might cause the same
to be imposed; Hydrocarbons currently being produced and sold
from or allocated to the Mortgaged Property are being purchased
by those parties and entities identified as "Purchaser" on
attached Exhibit A and Mortgagor is currently receiving payment
and accounting for the proceeds attributable to such Hydrocarbons
from those parties or entities identified as "Remitter" on said
attached Exhibit A.

(b) Mortgagor will warrant and defend the title to the
Mortgaged Property against the claims and demands of all other
persons whomsoever and will maintain and preserve the lien and
privilege created hereby so long as any of the Indebtedness
secured hereby remains unpaid. Should an adverse claim be made
against or a cloud develop upon the title to any part of the
Mortgaged Property, Mortgagor agrees that it will immediately
defend against such adverse claim or take appropriate action to
remove such cloud at Mortgagor's cost and expense, and Mortgagor
further agrees that the Mortgagee may take such other action as
it deems advisable to protect and preserve its interests in the
Mortgaged Property, and in such event Mortgagor will indemnify
the Mortgagee against any and all costs, attorneys' fees and
other expenses which it may incur in defending against any such
adverse claim or taking action to remove any such cloud. Such
obligation of Mortgagor shall be payable as provided in the Loan
Agreement. Except for sales of Hydrocarbons as and when
produced and in the ordinary course of Mortgagor's business or as
may be otherwise provided for in writing, Mortgagor will not
sell, convey or in any manner dispose of the Mortgaged Property
or any portion thereof without first securing the written consent
of the Mortgagee.

(c) This Mortgage is, and always will be kept, a direct
first lien, privilege and security interest upon the Mortgaged
Property subject only to the permitted Encumbrances described on
Exhibit A and Mortgagor will not create or suffer to be created
or permit to exist any lien, security interest or privilege, or
charge prior or junior to or on a parity with the lien and
security interest of this Mortgage upon the Mortgaged Property or
any part thereof or upon the rents, issues, revenues, profits and
other income therefrom, and Mortgagor will, from time to time,
pay or cause to be paid as they become due and payable all taxes,
assessments and governmental charges lawfully levied or assessed
upon the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof, or upon or
arising from any of the rents, issues, revenues, profits and
other income from the Mortgaged Property, or incident to or in
connection with the production of Hydrocarbons or other minerals
therefrom, or the operation and development thereof; provided,
that the foregoing covenant shall be suspended so long as the
amount, applicability or validity of any such charges is being
diligently contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
if Mortgagor shall have set up reserves therefor which are
adequate under generally accepted accounting principles.
Mortgagor will not change its name, identity or corporate
structure, or change the location of its chief executive office
or its chief place of business or the place where it keeps its
books and records concerning the Mortgaged Property (including,
particularly, the proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons) without
notifying the Mortgagee of such change in writing at least thirty
(30) days prior to the effective date of such change.

(d) Mortgagor will at its own expense do or cause to be
done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full repair,
working order and efficiency all of the Mortgaged Property,
including, without limitation, all equipment, machinery and
facilities, and from time to time will make all the needful and
proper repairs, renewals and replacements so that at all times
the state and condition of the Mortgaged Property will be fully
preserved and maintained in accordance with generally accepted
practices in the industry.

(e) Mortgagor will promptly pay and discharge its share of
all rentals, delay rentals, royalties and indebtedness accruing

and every act, matter or thing required by, each and all of the

described or referred to herein or affecting Mortgagor's
interests in the Mortgaged Property, and will do all other things
necessary to keep unimpaired Mortgagor's rights with respect
thereto and prevent any forfeiture thereof or default thereunder.
Mortgagor will operate the Mortgaged Property in a careful and
efficient manner in accordance with the practices of the industry
and in compliance with all applicable contracts and agreements
and in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
proration and conservation laws of the jurisdiction in which the
Mortgaged Property is situated, and all applicable laws, rules
and regulations of every other agency and authority from time to
time constituted to regulate the development and operation of the
Mortgaged Property and the production and sale of Hydrocarbons
and other minerals therefrom. Mortgagor will do or cause to be
done such development work as may be reasonably necessary to the
prudent and economical operation of the Mortgaged Property in
accordance with the most approved practices of operators in the
industry, including all which may be appropriate to be done to
protect from diminution the productive capacity of the Mortgaged
Property and each producing well thereon including, without
limitation, cleaning out and reconditioning each well from time
to time, plugging and completing at a different interval or zone
each such well, drilling a substitute well to conform to changed
spacing regulations and to protect the Mortgaged Property against
drainage whenever and as often as is necessary.

(f) Mortgagor will maintain the insurance coverages as
specified in Section 4.09 of the Loan Agreement. The loss
payable clauses with respect to all property damage coverage
shall be endorsed in favor of and made payable to the Mortgagee
as the interests of the Mortgagee may appear and the Mortgagee
shall be named as an additional insured with respect to all
insurance providing liability coverages. The Mortgagee shall
have the right to collect, and Mortgagor hereby assigns to the
Mortgagee, any and all monies that become payable under any
policies of property damage insurance and the Mortgagee shall
hold and apply the sums so collected in accordance with Section
4.09 of the Loan Agreement.

(g) Mortgagor will permit the Mortgagee and its agents to
visit and inspect any of the Mortgaged Property at their sole
risk, to examine the books of account of Mortgagor and to discuss
the affairs, finances or accounts of Mortgagor, and to be advised
as to the same by any officer or employee of Mortgagor, all at
such reasonable times or intervals as the Mortgagee may desire.

(h) Mortgagor will, upon request by Mortgagee, furnish or
cause to be furnished to the Mortgagee reports prepared by or for
Mortgagor concerning the productivity and the productive life of
all or any wells included in the Mortgaged Property; the quantity
of the Hydrocarbons and other minerals recoverable therefrom; the
projected income and expense attributable to the Mortgaged
Property; and the expediency of any change in methods of
treatment or operation of all of any well included in the
Mortgaged Property; any new drilling or development; any
abandonment or proposed abandonment of any well; any plugging of
any well or reopening of same at a different interval or zone;
any method of repressuring in the field or any other action with
respect to the Mortgaged Property; and further upon request of
the Mortgagee, will furnish a report of Ryder, Scott & Co., or
another independent engineer acceptable to the Mortgagee covering
such of the foregoing matters as shall be so requested.
Mortgagor will, also upon request of the Mortgagee, furnish the
Mortgagee within thirty (30) days after the end of Mortgagor's
fiscal quarter a report showing for such fiscal quarter the gross
proceeds of the sale of Hydrocarbons and other minerals from the
Mortgaged Property, the quantities so sold, the taxes deducted
from or paid out of such proceeds, the number of wells operated,
drilled and abandoned and such other information as the Mortgagee
may reasonably request.

(i) Mortgagor will comply with the obligations of
Sections 4.08 and 8.04 of the Loan Agreement with respect to
payment of or reimbursement for expenses and indemnifications
made by the Mortgagor to or for the benefit of the Mortgagee.
Any amount to be paid hereunder by Mortgagor to the Mortgagee
shall be a demand obligation owing by Mortgagor (which obligation
Mortgagor hereby expressly promises to pay) to the Mortgagee and
shall bear interest as provided in the Loan Agreement.

(j) Mortgagor will execute and deliver such further
instruments and do such further acts as may be necessary or
desirable or as may be reasonably requested by the Mortgagee to
carry out more effectively the purposes of this Mortgage and to

to be covered hereby. At the request of the Mortgagee, Mortgagor
will deliver to Mortgagee an inventory and/or financing
statements describing and showing the make, model, serial number
and location of all equipment and machinery forming a part of the
Mortgaged Property.

(k) If any tax is levied or assessed against the
Indebtedness described herein or any part thereof, or against
this Mortgage, or against the Mortgagee with respect to the
Indebtedness or any part thereof or this Mortgage, Mortgagor
shall promptly pay the same.

(l) All or portions of the Mortgaged Property may be
comprised of interests in the Leases which are other than working
interests or which may be operated by a party or parties other
than Mortgagor and with respect to all or any such Leases as may
be comprised of interests other than working interests or which
may be operated by parties other than Mortgagor, Mortgagor's
covenants as expressed in paragraphs (d) through (g) inclusive of
this Section III are modified to require that Mortgagor use its
best efforts to obtain compliance with such covenants by the
working interest owners or the operator or operators of such
Leases.

(m) Mortgagor agrees that if Mortgagor fails to perform any
act or to take any action which Mortgagor is required to perform
or take hereunder or pay any money which Mortgagor is required to
pay hereunder, the Mortgagee in Mortgagor's name or its own name
may, but shall not be obligated to, perform or cause to perform
such act or take such action or pay such money, and any expenses
so incurred by the Mortgagee and any money so paid by the
Mortgagee shall be a demand obligation owing by Mortgagor to the
Mortgagee and the Mortgagee, upon making such payment, shall be
subrogated to all of the rights of the person, corporation or
body politic receiving such payment. Each amount due and owing
by Mortgagor to holders of the Indebtedness and/or Mortgagee
pursuant to this Mortgage shall bear interest from the date of
such expenditure or payment or other occurrence which gives rise
to such amount being owed to the Mortgagee until paid as provided
in the Loan Agreement, and all such amounts together with such
interest thereon shall be a part of the Indebtedness and shall be
secured by this Mortgage.

IV.

(a) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, as defined
in Section 6.01 of the Loan Agreement, Mortgagee may, in
accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement, declare the
Note to be due and payable whereupon said Note shall become
immediately due and payable without notice of any kind; provided,
however, that the occurrence of an Event of Default as described
in Section 6.01(e), (f) and (g) of the Loan Agreement shall
result in the immediate and automatic acceleration of maturity of
the Note and all other Indebtedness mentioned or referred to
herein. All costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred by the Mortgagee in protecting and enforcing their
rights hereunder shall constitute a demand obligation owing by
Mortgagor and shall bear interest as provided in the Loan
Agreement and shall constitute a portion of the indebtedness
secured hereby and shall have the benefit of the lien, privilege
and security interest hereby created.

(b) If the Note or any of the Indebtedness shall become due
and payable and shall not be promptly paid, the Mortgagee shall
have the right and power to proceed by a suit or suits in equity
or at law, whether for the specific performance of any covenant
or agreement herein contained or in aid of the execution of any
power herein granted, or for any foreclosure hereunder or for the
sale of the Mortgaged Property under the judgment or decree of
any court or courts of competent jurisdiction, or for the
appointment of a receiver pending any foreclosure hereunder or
the sale of the Mortgaged Property under the order of a court or
courts of competent jurisdiction or under executory or other
legal process, or for the enforcement of any other appropriate
legal or equitable remedy. Any money advanced by the Mortgagee
in connection with any such receivership shall be a demand
obligation (which obligation Mortgagor hereby expressly promises
to pay) owing by Mortgagor to the Mortgagee and shall bear
interest from the date of making such advance by the Mortgagee
until paid as provided in the Loan Agreement. Mortgagor agrees
to the full extent that it lawfully may, that, in case one or
more of the Events of Default shall have occurred and shall not
have been remedied, then, and in every such case, the Mortgagee
shall have the right and power to enter into and upon and take
possession of all or any part of the Mortgaged Property in the
possession of Mortgagor, its successors or assigns, or its or
their agents or servants, and may exclude Mortgagor, its
successors or assigns, and all persons claiming under Mortgagor,
and its or their agents or servants wholly or partly therefrom;
and, holding the same, the Mortgagee may use, administer, manage,
operate and control the Mortgaged Property and conduct the
business thereof to the same extent as Mortgagor, its successors
or assigns, might at the time do and may exercise all rights and
powers of Mortgagor, in the name, place and stead of Mortgagor,
or otherwise as the Mortgagee shall deem best. All reasonable
costs, expenses and liabilities of every character incurred by
the Mortgagee in administering, managing, operating, and
controlling the Mortgaged Property shall constitute a demand
obligation (which obligation Mortgagor hereby expressly promises
to pay) owing by Mortgagor to the Mortgagee and shall bear
interest from date of expenditure until paid as provided in the
Loan Agreement, all of which shall constitute a portion of the
Indebtedness and shall be secured by this Mortgage and by any
other instrument securing the Indebtedness. In connection with
any action taken by the Mortgagee pursuant to this paragraph (b),
the Mortgagee shall not be liable for any loss sustained by
Mortgagor resulting from any act or omission of the Mortgagee in
administering, managing, operating or controlling the Mortgaged
Property unless such loss is caused by its willful misconduct
and/or bad faith, nor shall the Mortgagee be obligated to perform
or discharge any obligation, duty or liability of Mortgagor.
Mortgagor shall and does hereby agree to indemnify the Mortgagee
for, and to hold the Mortgagee harmless from, any and all
liability, loss or damage which may or might be incurred by the
Mortgagee (except for liability, loss or damage resulting by
reason of the willful misconduct and/or bad faith of the
Mortgagee or the exercise of rights or remedies hereunder; should
the Mortgagee make any expenditure on account of any such
liability, loss or damage, the amount thereof, including costs,
expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees, shall be a demand
obligation (which obligation Mortgagor hereby expressly promises
to pay) owing by Mortgagor to the Mortgagee and shall bear
interest from the date expended until paid as provided in the
Loan Agreement, shall be a part of the Indebtedness and shall be
secured by this Mortgage and any other instrument securing the
secured indebtedness. Mortgagor hereby assents to, ratifies and
confirms any and all actions of the Mortgagee with respect to the
Mortgaged Property taken under this paragraph (b). In connection
with each and all of the foregoing and acting pursuant to the
authority granted under Louisiana Revised Statutes 9:5131, et
seq., Mortgagor hereby expressly designates Mortgagee, or its
agents, servants or employees as Keeper of each and all of the
Mortgaged Property. Mortgagor for itself, its successors and
assigns does by these presents agree and stipulate that it shall
be lawful for and Mortgagor does hereby authorize Mortgagee
without making a demand or putting in default, putting in default
being expressly waived, to cause all and singular the Mortgaged
Property to be seized and sold subject to the matters set forth
on Exhibit A by executory or other legal process without
appraisement (appraisement being hereby expressly waived) either
in its entirety or in lots, or parcels as Mortgagee may determine
to the highest bidder for cash or on such terms as Mortgagee may
direct, Mortgagor for itself, its successors and assigns hereby
confessing judgment for the full amount of the Note in principal
and interest and all other Indebtedness secured and to be secured
hereby. Mortgagor hereby expressly waives: (a) the benefit of
appraisement as provided for in Articles 2332, 2336, 2723 and
2724 of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure and all other laws
conferring the same; (b) the demand and 3 days delay accorded by
Articles 2639 and 2721 of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure;
(c) the notice of seizure required by Articles 2293 and 2721 of
the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure; (d) the benefit of any
other provisions of Articles 2331, 2722 and 2723 of the Louisiana
Code of Civil Procedure; and Mortgagor agrees to the immediate
seizure of the property subject hereto in the event of suit
hereon.

(c) Every right, power and remedy herein given to the
Mortgagee shall be cumulative and in addition to every other
right, power and remedy herein specifically given or now or
hereafter existing in equity, at law or by statute; and each and
every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein given
or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time and so
often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the
Mortgagee, and the exercise, or the beginning of the exercise, of
any such right, power or remedy shall not be deemed a waiver of
the right to exercise, at the same time or thereafter any other
right, power or remedy. No delay or omission by the Mortgagee in
the exercise of any right, power or remedy shall impair any such
right, power or remedy or operate as a waiver thereof or of any
other right, power or remedy then or thereafter existing.

(d) Any sale or sales of the Mortgaged Property or any part
thereof, shall operate to divest all right, title, interest,
claim and demand whatsoever, either at law or in equity, of
Mortgagor of, in and to the premises and the property sold, and
shall be a perpetual bar, against Mortgagor, its successors and
assigns, and against any and all persons claiming or who shall
thereafter claim all or any of the property sold from, through or
under Mortgagor, its successors and assigns; and Mortgagor, if
requested by the Mortgagee so to do, shall join in the execution
and delivery of all proper conveyances, assignments and transfers
of the properties so sold. The proceeds of any sale of the
Mortgaged Property or any part thereof and all other moneys
received by the Mortgagee in any proceedings for the enforcement
hereof, whose application has not elsewhere herein been
specifically provided for, shall be applied first, to the payment
of all reasonable expenses incurred by the Mortgagee incident to
the enforcement of this Mortgage, the Note or any of the
Indebtedness (including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, reasonable expenses of any entry or taking of
possession, of any sale, of advertisement thereof, and of
conveyances, and court costs, compensation of agents and
employees, and legal fees), and to the payment of all other
reasonable charges, expenses, liabilities and advances incurred
or made by the Mortgagee under this Mortgage; and then to payment
of the Note and the Indebtedness in such order and manner as the
Mortgagee may elect. The Mortgagee may resort to any security
given by this Mortgage or to any other security now existing or
hereafter given to secure the payment of any of the Indebtedness
secured hereby, in whole or in part, and in such portions and in
such order as may seem best to the Mortgagee in its sole and
uncontrolled discretion, and any such action shall not in anywise
be considered as a waiver of any of the rights, benefits or liens
created by this Mortgage. Should any surplus or balance remain
from any sale of the Mortgaged Property after the payment in full
of the Indebtedness, any such surplus or balance shall be paid to
Mortgagor. Mortgagor agrees, to the full extent that it may
lawfully so agree, that it will not at any time insist upon or
plead or in any manner whatever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or
redemption law now or hereafter in force, in order to prevent or
hinder the enforcement or foreclosure of this Mortgage or the
absolute sale of the Mortgaged Property or the possession thereof
by any purchaser at any sale made pursuant to any provision
hereof, or pursuant to the decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction; but Mortgagor, for itself and all who may claim
through or under it, so far as it or they now or hereafter
lawfully may, hereby waives the benefit of all such laws.
Mortgagor, for itself and all who may claim through or under it,
waives to the extent that it may lawfully do so, any and all
right to have the property included in the Mortgaged Property
marshaled upon any foreclosure of the lien hereof, and agrees
that the Mortgagee or any court having jurisdiction to foreclose
such lien may sell the Mortgaged Property as an entirety or in
parcels. If any law referred to herein and now in force, of
which Mortgagor or its successor or successors might take
advantage despite the provisions hereof, shall hereafter be
repealed or cease to be in force, such law shall not thereafter
be deemed to constitute any part of the contract herein contained
or to preclude the operation or application of the provisions
hereof. Mortgagee or any future holder or holders of the Note
may at any time and from time to time release to Mortgagor or its
order all or any portion of the funds received from the proceeds
of oil, gas or other minerals as hereinafter provided without in
anywise impairing, releasing or discharging the lien, privilege
and security of this Mortgage or affecting the validity thereof.

V.

(a) Mortgagor has absolutely and unconditionally assigned,
transferred, and conveyed, and does hereby absolutely and
unconditionally assign, transfer and convey unto Mortgagee, its
successors and assigns, all of the Hydrocarbons and all products
obtained or processed therefrom, and the revenues and proceeds
now and hereafter attributable to the Hydrocarbons and said
products and all payments in lieu of the Hydrocarbons such as
"take or pay" payments or settlements. The Hydrocarbons and
products are to be delivered into pipe lines connected with the
Mortgaged Property, or to the purchaser thereof, to the credit of
the Mortgagee, free and clear of all taxes, charges, costs, and
expenses; and all such revenues and proceeds shall be paid
directly to the Mortgagee, for deposit to the Lender's Account as
defined in the Loan Agreement, with no duty or obligation of any
party paying the same to inquire into the rights of the Mortgagee
to receive the same, what application is made thereof, or as to
any other matter. Mortgagor agrees to perform all such acts, and
to execute all such further assignments, transfers and division
orders, and other instruments as may be required or desired by
the Mortgagee or any party in order to have said proceeds and
revenues so paid to the Mortgagee. The Mortgagee is fully
authorized to receive and receipt for said revenues and proceeds;
to endorse and cash any and all checks and drafts payable to the
order of Mortgagor or the Mortgagee for the account of Mortgagor
received from or in connection with said revenues or proceeds and
apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of the Indebtedness,
when received, regardless of the maturity of any of the
Indebtedness, or any installment thereof; and to execute transfer
and division orders in the name of Mortgagor, or otherwise, with
warranties binding Mortgagor. The Mortgagee shall not be liable
for any delay, neglect, or failure to effect collection of any
proceeds or to take any other action in connection therewith or
hereunder; but the Mortgagee shall have the right, at its
election, in the name of Mortgagor or otherwise, to prosecute and
defend any and all actions or legal proceedings deemed advisable
by the Mortgagee in order to collect such funds and to protect
the interests of the Mortgagee, and/or Mortgagor, with all costs,
expenses and attorneys' fees incurred in connection therewith
being paid by Mortgagor. Mortgagor hereby agrees to indemnify
the Mortgagee against all claims, actions, liabilities,
judgments, costs, charges and attorneys' fees made against or
incurred by it based on the assertion that the Mortgagee has
received funds from the production of Hydrocarbons claimed by
third persons either before or after the payment in full of the
Indebtedness. The Mortgagee shall have the right to defend
against any such claims, actions and judgments, employing its
attorneys therefor, and if the Mortgagee is not furnished with
reasonable indemnity, it shall have the right to compromise and
adjust any such claims, actions and judgments. Mortgagor agrees
to indemnify and pay to the Mortgagee any and all such claims,
judgments, costs, charges and attorney's fees as may be paid in
any judgment, release or discharge thereof or as may be adjudged
against the Mortgagee. Such obligation shall be payable on
demand and shall bear interest from the date of demand therefor
until paid as provided in the Loan Agreement. In addition to the
rights granted to Mortgagee in Section I (c) of this Mortgage,
Mortgagor hereby further transfers and assigns to Mortgagee any
and all such liens, security interests, financing statements or
similar interests of Mortgagor attributable to its interest in
the Hydrocarbons and proceeds of runs therefrom arising under or
created by said statutory provision, judicial decision or
otherwise. The power of attorney granted to Mortgagee in this
paragraph, being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable
so long as the Indebtedness or any part thereof remains unpaid.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing
provisions in this Article, for so long as no Suspension Event as
defined in the Loan Agreement shall exist, Mortgagor shall have
the license to collect all of the revenues attributable to the
Mortgaged Property; and no such payment shall affect or impair
the lien of this Mortgage or the validity and effect of the
assignment contained in this Article V(a). During a Suspension
Event, such license shall be revoked and all proceeds of the sale
of oil, gas or other minerals in and under or produced from the
Mortgaged Property assigned hereunder shall be paid directly to
Mortgagee in the manner provided in Article V(a). In the event
payments are made directly to Mortgagee and then, at the request
of Mortgagee, payments are, for periods of time, paid to
Mortgagor, Mortgagee shall nevertheless have the right, effective
upon written notice, to require that future payments be again
made to it.

(a) Nothing herein contained shall modify or otherwise
alter the obligation of Mortgagor to make prompt payment of all
principal and interest owing on the Note and all other
Indebtedness when and as the same become due regardless of
whether the proceeds of the Hydrocarbons are sufficient to pay
the same and the rights provided in accordance with the foregoing
assignment provision shall be cumulative of all other security of
any and every character now or hereafter existing to secure
payment of the Indebtedness.

(b) To further secure the Indebtedness, Mortgagor hereby
grants to the Mortgagee a security interest in and to the
Mortgaged Property insofar as the Mortgaged Property consists of
equipment, accounts, contract rights, general intangibles,
inventory, Hydrocarbons, fixtures and any and all other personal
property of any kind or character defined in and subject to the
provisions of the Louisiana Commercial Laws (the "Uniform
Commercial Code"), including the proceeds and products from any
and all of such personal property. Upon the happening of any of
the Events of Default, the Mortgagee is and shall be entitled to
all of the rights, powers and remedies afforded a secured party
by the Uniform Commercial Code with reference to the personal
property and fixtures in which the Mortgagee has been granted a
security interest herein, or the Mortgagee may proceed as to both
the real and personal property covered hereby in accordance with
the rights and remedies granted under this Mortgage in respect of
the real property covered hereby. Mortgagor acknowledges that
the provisions of Article IV hereof, including but not limited to
the confession of judgment and appointment of a keeper, are
applicable to the security interest affecting such personal
property and fixtures. Such rights, powers and remedies shall be
cumulative and in addition to those granted to the Mortgagee
under any other provision of this instrument or under any other
instrument executed in connection with or as security for the

any part thereof becomes vested in a person other than Mortgagor,
Mortgagee may, without notice to Mortgagor, deal with such
successor or successors in interest with reference to this
Mortgage and to the Indebtedness in the same manner as with
Mortgagor, without in any way vitiating or discharging the
Mortgagor's liability hereunder or for the payment of the
Indebtedness or performance of the obligations secured hereby. No
transfer of the Mortgaged Property, no forbearance on the part of
the Mortgagee, and no extension of the time for the payment of

the same instrument.

(k) Mortgagor and Mortgagee acknowledge that none of the

to be paraphed for identification herewith. Further,
notwithstanding any reference to the Loan Agreement or any other
document referred to herein, all persons dealing with the
Mortgaged Property shall be entitled to rely upon any document or
certificate of Mortgagee as to the occurrence of an event, such
as an Event of Default, and shall not be charged with and shall

referred to herein to determine the accuracy thereof.
