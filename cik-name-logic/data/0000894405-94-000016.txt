An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Clipper Exxpress Company as

CLIPPER EXXPRESS COMPANY
Notes to Financial Statements
Years Ended December 31, 1993 and 1992

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business

Clipper Exxpress Company (the Company), a Delaware corporation, is a
transcontinental general commodities freight forwarder, specializing in
less-than-trailer load (LTL) shipments, and a shipper's agent,
specializing in the arrangement of door-to-door movements of trailer
load (TL) shipments of general commodity freight throughout the United
States. As a freight forwarder, the Company arranges the movement of
merchandise from its point of origin to its destination with railroads
and over the road carriers acting as the source of transportation, which
allows for direct nonstop service to major metropolitan areas. As a
shipper's agent, the Company arranges all the components of the movement
of TL freight for the customer from the point of origin to its
destination, including pickup and delivery, railroad services,
monitoring of the shipment's progress, and consolidation of billing.

Property and Equipment

Depreciation is provided for using straight-line and accelerated
methods over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
generally 5 to 10 years for equipment and 20 to 30 years for buildings.

Loss and Damage Claims

Estimated loss and damage claims against the Company are accrued for
when incurred. In most instances, the Company files a counterclaim
against the line haul carrier.

Revenue Recognition

The Company records revenue and corresponding expenses on all freight
movements on the date the shipment moves.

Income Taxes

Federal income taxes are not reflected in the accompanying financial
statements because the revenue and expenses of the Company are
reportable in the individual Federal income tax returns of its
stockholders, who have made an S corporation election.
<PAGE>
CLIPPER EXXPRESS COMPANY
Notes to Financial Statements, Continued

State income taxes are provided for and included in operating expenses
in the financial statements for those states in which the Company is
subject to state income taxes.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents
include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, and short-term
certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or
less, which are recorded at cost.

(2) Line of Credit

The Company has a revolving line of credit with a bank for up to
$3,000,000. No borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 1993 or
1992. Letters of credit issued by the bank reduce the amount of the
line of credit available.

(3) Benefit Plans

The Company has a defined contribution retirement benefit plan
covering eligible employees. Under the plan, the Company makes annual
contributions based upon the criteria set forth in the plan. Company
contributions reported in the statements of earnings amounted to
approximately $573,000 and $553,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

(4) Related-party Transactions

The Company performs various management and administrative services
for two affiliated companies, Agricultural Express of America, Inc. and
Agile Freight System, Inc. Fees received by the Company for services
rendered approximated $218,000 in 1993 and $238,000 in 1992.

On January 20, 1988 the Company sold its corporate office facility at
the appraised market value of $2,500,000 to the Lemont Partners, a
partnership owned by the Company's stockholders. The Company leases the
office facility from the partnership under an operating lease through
December 31, 1997 with annual lease payments of approximately $260,000.
The gain on the sale of the facility of $287,000 has been deferred and
is being amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the
lease. Rent expense payable to Lemont Partners for the corporate office
facility and terminals was $385,000 in 1993 and $374,000 in 1992.
<PAGE>
CLIPPER EXXPRESS COMPANY
Notes to Financial Statements, Continued

On December 31, 1993, the Company sold its Jersey City facility at the
appraised market value of $1,750,000 to the Lemont Partners, a
partnership owned by the Company's stockholders. The Company leases the
facility from the partnership under an operating lease through December
31, 1998 with annual lease payments of approximately $168,000. The gain
on the sale of the facility of $1,315,000 has been deferred and is being
amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease.

The Company has a note receivable from Agile Freight System, Inc. The
note is due on demand and bears interest at a variable rate (3.79% at
December 31, 1993).

The Company paid Agile Freight System, Inc. approximately $4,787,000
and $4,762,000 for long-haul road transportation and cartage in 1993 and
1992, respectively.

(5) Commitments and Contingencies

As of December 31, 1993, the Company had outstanding letters of credit
of $250,000 which guarantee payments due to certain railroad carriers.

The Company leases revenue equipment under a lease agreement
classified as an operating lease. The revenue equipment is subleased on
the same terms to an affiliated company. The remaining lease obligation
under the agreement is approximately $196,000 in 1994, $196,000 in 1995,
and $82,000 in 1996.

The Company leases its corporate office facility, terminals and
computer and other equipment under lease agreements classified as
operating leases. The long-term rental obligations as of December 31,
1993 are as follows:

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature and Organization of Business

Agricultural Express of America, Inc. (the Company), a Delaware
corporation, is a motor carrier specializing primarily in intermodal,
long haul, and full-load shipments of perishable exempt commodities from
the West Coast to eastern destinations with railroads as the primary
source of transportation.

Depreciation is provided for using straight-line and accelerated
methods over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
generally five to seven years.

Loss and Damage Claims

Estimated losses and damage claims against the Company are accrued for
when incurred.

Revenue Recognition

The Company records revenue and corresponding expenses on all freight
movements on the date the shipment moves.

Federal income taxes are not reflected in the accompanying financial
statements because the revenue and expenses of the Company are
reportable in the individual Federal income tax returns of its stockho
lders, who have made an S corporation election.

State income taxes are provided for and included in operating expenses
in the financial statements for those states in which the Company is
subject to state income taxes.

(2) Related-party Transactions

Various administrative and management services are performed for the
Company by Clipper Exxpress Company (Clipper), an affiliate. Charges
for these services reported in the statements of earnings amounted to
approximately $147,000 and $167,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Rent expense payable to Clipper Exxpress Company for the office
facility was $9,000 in 1993 and in 1992.

During 1989, the Company issued 188 shares of common stock to an
officer in exchange for cash and a promissory note. The promissory note
is payable through the year 2003 and bears interest at a variable rate
(3.79% at December 31, 1993). Principal and interest on the note
receivable are payable solely from distributions attributable to the
shares of common stock owned by the officer.

(3) Benefit Plans

The Company has a defined contribution retirement benefit plan
covering eligible employees. Under the plan, the Company makes annual
contributions based upon the criteria set forth in the plan. Company
contributions reported in the statements of earnings amounted to
approximately $7,800 and $24,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

(4) Equipment Purchases/Long-Term Debt

During 1992, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase 300
trailers, which previously had been leased under operating leases, at a
total cost of $2,400,000, of which $1,857,200 was unpaid at December 31,
1992. The purchase and refurbishment of the fleet was partially
financed with a $2,000,000 revolving line of credit secured in 1993, of
which $1,000,000 was outstanding at December 31, 1993. On May 31, 1994,
the Company can convert the revolving credit line to a term loan payable
in 12 equal quarterly installments. As of April 24, 1994, the Company
has borrowed $1,800,000 under the revolving credit line and intends to
convert that amount to a term loan. At December 31, 1993, $300,000,
representing payments expected to be due in 1994, have been classified
as a current liability and the remainder shown as long-term debt. The
loan agreement bears interest at a variable rate (5.75% at December 31,
1993) and is collateralized by the equipment.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

[1] Reflects the allocation of the estimated purchase price ($60.4 million)
and related debt to fund the Clipper Acquisition. The purchase price
will be subject to certain closing audit adjustments. The preliminary
purchase price allocation is as follows:

Current assets $ 23,030
Other assets 4,861
Goodwill 49,233
Current liabilities (14,149)
Long-term liabilities (2,550)
---------
Total purchase price $ 60,425
=========

[2] Reflects payment, related debt, and amortization of noncompete agreement
relating to the Clipper Acquisition; $1 million over the five year term
of the agreement.

[3] Reflects amortization of goodwill recorded on the Clipper Acquisition;
$49.2 million over 30 years.

[4] Reflects interest on funds borrowed to finance the Clipper Acquisition;
$61 million at an assumed rate of 5.075%.

[5] Reflects adjustment of income tax expense at the marginal tax rate of
38.9% for the effect of the pro forma adjustments, and to provide for
federal taxes on income of the Clipper Group and Commercial Warehouse
Company which have not historically recorded federal income taxes as a
result of their status as S corporations.

[6] Reflects issuance of 310,000 shares of the Company's common stock for
all of the outstanding common stock of the Traveller Group. This
transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests. Due to
immateriality, the Company's historical financial statements will not be
restated to include the accounts of the Traveller Group. Also, the
acquisition of the Traveller Group was not a material transaction
requiring separate financial statements to be filed as part of the Form
8-K filing. Traveller Enterprises' fiscal year end is March 31,
therefore for purposes of the pro forma consolidated statements of
operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the six months ended
June 30, 1994, accounts of Traveller Enterprises have been combined
using operating results for the year ended March 31, 1994 and the six
months ended September 30, 1994, respectively.
