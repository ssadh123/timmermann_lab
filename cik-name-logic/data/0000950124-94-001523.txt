Item 5. Other Events

On September 29, 1994, Yellow Corporation (the company) announced that it
will record a charge to earnings in the third quarter of $6.7 million, $4.1
million after taxes, or $.14 per share. This charge, recorded as an
extraordinary item, is to write-off the book value of its intrastate operating
rights. The non-cash charge resulted from the recent passage of the Trucking
Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 which deregulates the entry and rates
for the intrastate operations of all transportation companies.

The company expects to announce third quarter results on October 20, 1994.

undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
