FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NL ANNOUNCES IMPROVED RESULTS

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- July 25, 1994 -- NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE:NL) announced a net
loss for the second quarter of 1994 of $15.5 million, or $.30 per share, on
sales of $237 million compared to a net loss in the second quarter of 1993 of
$28.0 million, or $.55 per share, on sales of $221 million. NL's net loss for
the first six months of 1994 was $21.9 million, or $.43 per share, on sales of
$439 million. The net loss for the comparable 1993 period was $41.5 million, or
$.82 per share, on sales of $420 million.

Operating income of Kronos' titanium dioxide pigments ("TiO2") business in the
second quarter was $17.6 million, an increase of $10 million over the second
quarter of 1993, due to a 10% increase in sales volumes and lower operating
costs. Kronos' operating income in the first half of 1994 was $8.4 million
higher than the first half of 1993. Primarily as a result of improved pricing
in Europe in the first quarter, Kronos' average TiO2 selling prices in the first
half of 1994 approximated both first-half 1993 and full year 1993 average
selling prices. J. Landis Martin, President and CEO, stated, "The continued
recovery of worldwide economies resulted in increased sales volumes for Kronos. 
We anticipate that the impact of the previously-announced price increases will
further improve Kronos' operating income in the second half of the year."

Rheox's operating income for the second quarter and first half of 1994 also
improved as a result of higher sales volumes and lower operating costs.

Corporate expenses, net in the second quarter were higher than 1993 due to
increased provisions for environmental remediation costs. Interest expense in
the second quarter and first half of 1994 declined from the 1993 periods due to
lower levels of debt and lower average interest rates.

NL Industries, Inc. is a major international producer of titanium dioxide
pigments and specialty chemicals.
