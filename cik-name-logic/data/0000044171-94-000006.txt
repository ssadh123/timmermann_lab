Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
____________________________________

On August 3, 1994, Grow Group, Inc. (the "Company"),
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sinclair Acquisition Corp.
(the "Buyer"), completed the acquisition of substantially all of
the assets of Sinclair Paint Company ("Sinclair"), a division of
Insilco Corporation ("Insilco"). The acquisition was effectuated
pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase
Agreement"), dated May 7, 1994 (a copy of which was attached as
Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, date of
earliest event reported: May 7, 1994), as amended by a First
Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 1, 1994
(a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1(b)). The
discussion of the Asset Purchase Agreement contained herein is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the Asset Purchase
Agreement, as amended.

Sinclair is engaged in the manufacture and sale of
architectural paints through 49 company-operated stores in four
Western states. Sinclair generated over $95 million in revenue
in calendar 1993. The Sinclair operation will augment the
Company's other architectural paint operations.

The purchase price, which was negotiated between the
parties, was $51 million (subject to post-closing adjustments). 
In addition, the Buyer assumed certain obligations of Sinclair. 
The purchase price was paid in full at the closing and was funded
through a combination of cash and borrowings.

To the best of the Company's knowledge, there were no
material relationships between Insilco and its affiliates and the
Company or any of the Company's affiliates, directors or officers
or any associate of any director or officer of the Company.

Item 5. Other Events.
____________

In connection with the acquisition of the Sinclair
assets, the amount of the Company's credit facilities with
Chemical Bank New Jersey, N.A., Fleet Bank and PNC Bank,
Kentucky, Inc., (collectively, the "Banks") was increased from
$40 million to $60 million. The Credit Agreement (the "Credit
Agreement"), dated as of March 31, 1993, as amended on August 6,
1993, by and among the Company, Grow Group Insurance, Ltd., the
Banks and Chemical Bank, was further amended on August 3, 1994
to, among other things, waive certain provisions of the Credit
Agreement to the extent they would restrict the Buyer's
performance under the Asset Purchase Agreement and amend the
defined levels of leverage and capital expenditures.

<PAGE>

The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement
are secured by the accounts receivable of the Company and Cello
Corp., Sinclair Acquisition Corp. and Zynolyte Products Company,
wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. Such subsidiaries also
guaranteed the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement.

Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information
and Exhibits
______________________________________________________

(a) Financial statements of business acquired:

The financial statements of Sinclair included herein
are prepared on a historical basis and include breakdowns between
a predecessor company and the current entity and "Fresh Start"
accounting adjustments due to the bankruptcy proceedings
described in Note (2) to the Sinclair financial statements. As a
result of these and other factors, the Sinclair financial
statements are not comparable nor are these financial statements
necessarily indicative of future results of operations or
financial position. The Company's acquisition decision was
affected by extensive reviews and examinations of detailed
financial and other information, both current and forecasted.

The following financial statements of Sinclair are
presented herein:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors
Insilco Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and
liabilities of Sinclair Paint Company (a division of Insilco
Corporation) as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the related
statements of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended
December 31, 1993 (successor period), three months ended March
31, 1993 and year ended December 31, 1992 (predecessor periods). 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Sinclair Paint Company as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows the nine-month
period ended December 31, 1993, the three-month period ended
March 31, 1993 and the year ended December 31, 1992 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements,
effective March 31, 1993, the Company emerged from bankruptcy and
applied fresh start accounting. As a result, the statement of
assets and liabilities at December 31, 1993 and the related
statements of operations and cash flows for the nine-month period
ended December 31, 1993 are presented on a different basis than
that for the periods before fresh start and, therefore, are not
comparable.

SINCLAIR PAINT COMPANY
(A Division of Insilco Corporation)
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 1993 and 1992

(1) Nature of Business
__________________

The Sinclair Paint Company (the Company) is a division of
Insilco Corporation (Parent) which manufactures paints and
sells a variety of paints and related products (ladders,
tape, spray equipment, and the like) through approximately
50 retail stores in California, Hawaii and Arizona.

The financial statements of Sinclair Paint have been
prepared from the historical books and records of the
Company and Parent, except that certain reserves established
and maintained at the Parent level have been excluded from
the financial statements. The Company has applied the
principles of fresh start accounting as a result of the
reorganization described in notes 2 and 4.

The divisional balances in the statements of assets and
liabilities represent the Parent's investment and advances
to the Company on a historical-cost basis adjusted for
equity in operations and intercompany transactions. 
Expenses allocated to the Company not settled with the
Parent become a permanent component of the divisional
investment. The Parent believes that such expense
allocations are reasonable and proper. Cash generated by
the Company is transferred to the Parent on a daily basis
for cash management purposes. The cumulative amount of cash
transferred since the Company's acquisition represents a
reduction to the divisional investment account balance.

(2) Plan of Reorganization 
______________________

On April 1, 1993, the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries
(collectively with the Parent, the Debtors) emerged from
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Chapter
11 cases) pursuant to a plan of reorganization (the Plan of
Reorganization) which was confirmed by the United States
Bankruptcy Court (the Bankruptcy Court). For financial
reporting purposes, the effective date of the Plan of
Reorganization was March 31, 1993 (the Plan Effective Date). 
For periods prior to the Plan Effective Date, the Company is
sometimes referred to herein as the Predecessor. The
Chapter 11 cases were commenced on January 13, 1991 (the
Petition Date) when the Debtors filed separate voluntary
petitions for reorganization.

(3) Asset Purchase Agreement
________________________

On May 7, 1994, Insilco entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement (Agreement) with Grow Group Inc. (Grow). Under
the terms of the Agreement, Grow will acquire the majority
of the Company's assets and assume certain liabilities, as
defined in the Agreement.

(4) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis for Presentation - Fresh Start Accounting
_______________________________________________
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the Statement of Position 90-7, "Financial
Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy
Code" (the Reorganization SOP), issued by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. As of the Plan
Effective Date, the Company adopted the "fresh start"
accounting principles prescribed by the Reorganization SOP.

As a result of the application of the Reorganization SOP,
including the application of fresh start accounting as of
March 31, 1993, financial information for periods subsequent
to the Plan Effective Date is not comparable with financial
information for prior periods.

The following summarizes the Reorganization SOP's
significant fresh start accounting principles and the
significant assumptions utilized in the application thereof.

Valuation of Assets and Liabilities
___________________________________

Using a valuation of the Company performed by the Parent's
financial advisor as well as fair values of the Company's
identifiable intangible assets, inventories and fixed and
other tangible assets based on management's estimates, the
Parent determined the total reorganization value of all of
its assets to be approximately $40 million as of the Plan
Effective Date, or approximately $18 million less than the
historical carrying value of its tangible assets.

10
<PAGE>

SINCLAIR PAINT COMPANY
(A Division of Insilco Corporation)

Notes to Financial Statements, Continued

In preparing the valuation of the Company, the Parent's
financial advisor conducted extensive due diligence and
updated its due diligence examinations as it deemed
appropriate. The activities included, but were not
restricted to the following: (i) a review and analysis of
the historical financial and operating performance of the
Predecessor based on data and reports provided by the 
Company, (ii) extensive discussions concerning the business,
operations, assets, present condition and future prospects
of the Company conducted with the Parent's senior management
and with selected operating management as deemed necessary,
(iii) a comparison of the Company's financial and operating
information with similar data available from public sources
for selected comparable companies and (iv) a review and
analysis of the Company's projected operating performance
based on business plans, which are revised periodically to
reflect actual and anticipated results of economic
developments.

SINCLAIR PAINT COMPANY
(A Division of Insilco Corporation)
Notes to Financial Statements, Continued

As a result of the valuation of assets described above, the
Company adjusted assets by approximately $18 million to the
estimated reorganization value in the three months ended
March 31, 1993. The effect of the Plan of Reorganization
and fresh start accounting principles on the Company's March
31, 1993 statement of assets and liabilities follows:

The Company has been included in the Parent's consolidated
Federal income tax return for the periods ended December 31,
1993, March 31, 1993 and the year ended December 31, 1992. The
Company was not party to any formal tax sharing agreement, and
accordingly, no provision or benefit for income taxes has been
reflected in the accompanying statements of income. In addition,
no deferred income taxes have been reflected for temporary
differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax
and financial reporting purposes.

(5) Transactions with Parent
________________________

The Parent provides various treasury functions for the Company
and maintains a cash management system under which excess cash
generated by the Company is transferred to the Parent and working
capital requirements of the company are paid by the Parent. 
Incident to this system, the Parent pays for certain expenses,
such as insurance, payroll taxes, and 401(k) contributions
specifically related to the Company. The Parent also provides
certain services to the group such as operations management,
treasury, insurance and benefits management, legal, accounting
and tax, among others. Costs charged to the Company for these
services are allocated based on management's estimates of the
Company's proportionate share of the total group's expenses. 
Management believes that these expenses are reasonably allocated. 
Expenses allocated to the Company by the Parent for these
services totaled approximately $1 million, $300 thousand and $1.3
million for the periods ended December 31, 1993, March 31, 1993
and the year ended December 31, 1992, respectively. The Company
is also allocated pension costs by the Parent. See note 7 for a
discussion of the Company's retirement plans.

SINCLAIR PAINT COMPANY
(A Division of Insilco Corporation)

Notes to Financial Statements, Continued

If net expenses charged to the Company for services provided by
the Parent are not settled with the Parent, they become a
permanent component of the divisional investment reflected in the
accompanying balance sheets. To the extent that expenses paid by
the Parent for the Company have not been settled by the Parent at
December 31, 1993, March 31, 1993 or December 31, 1992,
respectively, the corresponding liability allocated to the
Company is included on the statements of assets and liabilities
within divisional investment.

(6) Lease Commitments
_________________
The Company leases certain property, plant and equipment under
various leasing arrangements, most of which provide that the
Company pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other
operating expenses associated with the asset. These leases are
being accounted for as operating leases. Minimum future rental
payments under all operating leases are as follows (in
thousands):

1994 $ 4,652
1995 3,802
1996 2,989
1997 2,367
1998 2,181
Thereafter 10,050 
__________

Total minimum lease payments $26,041 
__________
__________

Rental expense for the periods ended December 31, 1993, March 31,
1993 and the year ended December 31, 1992 was approximately $2.3
million, $.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively.

(7) Pension Plans
_____________
Substantially all employees of the Company were covered under
various pension plans of the Parent during 1993 and 1992. The
benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of
service and employees' compensation near retirement. Plan assets
consist principally of equity investments, government obligations
and noncallable corporate debt securities. The Parent also
contributes to various multiemployer plans sponsored by
bargaining units for its union employees. The various plans'
assets and obligations remain with the Parent company after the
closing date of the agreement described in note 3.

16
<PAGE>

SINCLAIR PAINT COMPANY
(A Division of Insilco Corporation)

Notes to Financial Statements, Continued

The Parent allocated pension expense to the Company based on
its estimated share of the Parent's pension expense. 
Pension expense allocated to the Company was $318, $91 and
$78 for the periods ended December 31, 1993, March 31, 1993
and the year ended December 31, 1992, respectively.

(8) Contingencies
_____________

There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the
Parent relative to the division, including those related to
commercial transactions and environmental matters. Such
matters have not been reserved for at the division level but
are instead reflected on the Parent's financial statements
as the related contingent liabilities, if any, will remain
with the Parent company subsequent to the closing of the
Asset Purchase Agreement described in note 3.

operations of the Company and Sinclair as of June 30, 1994 and
for the year then ended. The pro forma condensed balance sheet
and statements of operations should be read in conjunction with
the pro forma adjustments described in the accompanying notes and
with the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto which are contained in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 1994. The following pro
forma condensed consolidated balance sheet and statements of
operations are presented for illustrative purposes only and are
not necessarily indicative of the financial position and actual
results of operations that would have been reported had the
purchase been consummated on June 30, 1993 or of the future
financial position and results of operations of the Company which
will result from the consummation of the transaction.

Management intends to restructure the operations of Sinclair
and the Company's Ameritone Paint Company, which it believes will
result in significant reductions in material costs and
administrative expenses as well as factory labor and
manufacturing overhead. These savings will come from negotiated
volume discounts from vendors, staff reductions and efficiencies,
reduced plant overhead and other efficiencies of scale. In
addition, restructuring charges estimated to range from
$1,000,000 to $2,000,000, relating to Ameritone Paint Company
operations are expected to be incurred. These savings and
restructuring charges have not been reflected in the pro forma
financial statements because a formal plan has not yet been
finalized.
