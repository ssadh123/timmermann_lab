Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountants

On June 7, 1994, Arbor Property Trust (including its predecessor
limited partnership, the "Company") engaged Arthur Andersen & Co. as its
certifying accountant, thereby replacing as of the same date Deloitte &
Touche. The change in the Company's certifying accountant was effected in
connection with the Company's change in operating structure from a
partnership to a real estate investment trust and the relocation of its
executive offices to Pennsylvania. The change was approved by the Managing
Trustees of the Company.

No report on the financial statements of the Company issued by
Deloitte & Touche during the last two fiscal years contained an adverse
opinion or disclaimer of opinion, or was qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, nor were there any
disagreements during such period between Deloitte & Touche and the Company
concerning any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements
if not resolved would have required Deloitte & Touche to make reference to
the subject matter thereof in connection with its report. During the last
two fiscal years and through the date hereof, none of the events listed in
paragraphs (A) through (D) of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K have
occurred; and during such period the Company has not consulted with Arthur
Andersen & Co. regarding any matter referred to under paragraphs (i) or
(ii) of Item 304(a)(2) of Regulation S- K.
