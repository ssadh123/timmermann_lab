Item 5. OTHER EVENTS

On January 24, 1994, Anuhco, Inc. was served notice that a former employee
of American Freight System, Inc. ("AFS") (an Anuhco subsidiary) had filed 
suit in the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas, alleging breach of
contract, promissory estoppel, tortious interference, and misrepresentation
and fraud, as it relates to an alleged incentive compensation arrangement
between the former employee and AFS. The suit claims, from Anuhco and
others, actual damages in excess of $2 million and punitive damages of
$5 million.

Management believes such claims are without merit and that they will
not likely have a material adverse effect on Anuhco's financial position
or business. Management intends to vigorously defend against such suit.

Item 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS

Not Applicable.
