Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

At the 1994 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, held on April 20, 1994,
the Shareholders of Westbank Corporation voted to appoint the firm
of Deloitte & Touche ("Deloitte") to serve as independent
accountants for fiscal year 1994. The decision to appoint Deloitte
as the Corporation's accountants was recommended by the Audit
Committee and approved by the Board of Directors for submission to
the Shareholders at the 1994 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

None of the "reportable events" described under Item 304(a) (1)
(v) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934 ("Regulation S-K") occurred within the Corporation's two
most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim periods
preceding the date hereof.

During the last two fiscal years and the subsequent interim
periods preceding April 20, 1994, the Corporation did not consult
Deloitte regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item
304(a) (2) (i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
