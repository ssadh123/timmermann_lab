ITEM 5. Other Events

As previously reported, on March 21, 1994, the Secretary of Labor issued
a final order approving a settlement agreement between Arizona Public
Service Company (the "Company") and a former contract employee who had
raised a U.S. Department of Labor claim. See "Palo Verde Nuclear Generating
Station" in Part II, Item 5 in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1994. On May 19, 1994 the Secretary
of Labor rescinded the order of March 21, 1994 and remanded the matter to
the responsible Administrative Law Judges ordering them to submit new
recommended orders (i) clarifying specifically the scope of the settlement
agreement and (ii) clarifying the extent to which any claims by the former
contract employee remain unresolved by the settlement agreement. The
Company currently expects that the settlement agreement, as originally
approved, will ultimately be approved by the Secretary of Labor.
