<PAGE>

1. DEFINITIONS
-----------

The terms defined in the Glossary attached as Appendix A hereto, when
---------- 
used in this Agreement, shall have the meanings set forth in such Glossary,
unless the context requires otherwise.

2. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY; PERFORMANCE BY AFFILIATES
------------------------------------------------------

2.1. Each obligation and liability of CENTOCOR under this Agreement shall
be an independent, joint and several obligation of CENTOCOR and CBV. Each of
CENTOCOR and CBV shall be fully liable for performance under this Agreement,
notwithstanding (a) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale
or other disposition of all, or substantially all of the assets, marshalling of
assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the
benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition with creditors or
readjustment of, or other similar proceedings affecting CBV or CENTOCOR or any
contest of the validity of this Agreement in any such proceeding; or (b) any Law
or Court Order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction which might in any
manner affect any of such terms or provisions or any of the rights of WELLCOME
or BW with respect thereto or which might cause or permit CBV or CENTOCOR to
invoke any defense to, or any alteration in the time, amount or manner of
performance of, any or all of their respective obligations under this Agreement,
except to the extent such Law or Court Order renders such obligations unlawful
or to the extent such Court Order constitutes a remedy for a breach by WELLCOME
or BW. The invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement as to either of
CENTOCOR or CBV shall not render this Agreement invalid or unenforceable as to
the other. The invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement in any

-3-
<PAGE>

jurisdiction shall not in itself render this Agreement invalid or unenforceable
in another jurisdiction. If any obligation hereunder of either CBV or CENTOCOR
is not performed by such party punctually, the other of CBV or CENTOCOR, as
applicable, will, without demand being made by WELLCOME, immediately perform
such obligation.

2.2. To the extent that BW has an obligation hereunder, either expressly
or by assignment by WELLCOME, WELLCOME hereby guarantees the full payment and
performance of such obligation. Each of WELLCOME and BW shall be fully liable
for performance of their obligations under this Agreement, notwithstanding (a)
the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the assets, marshalling of assets and
liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of
creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition with creditors or
readjustment of, or other similar proceedings affecting BW or WELLCOME or any
contest of the validity of this Agreement in any such proceeding; or (b) any Law
or Court Order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction which might in any
manner affect any of such terms or provisions or any of the rights of CENTOCOR
with respect thereto or which might cause or permit BW or WELLCOME to invoke any
defense to, or any alteration in the time, amount or manner of performance of,
any or all of the respective obligations under this Agreement, except to the
extent such Law or Court Order renders such obligations unlawful or to the
extent such Court Order constitutes a remedy for a breach by CENTOCOR or CBV. 
The invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement as to either of WELLCOME or
BW shall not render the respective obligations of the other under this Agreement
invalid or unenforceable. The invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement
in any jurisdiction shall not in itself render this Agreement invalid or
unenforceable in another jurisdiction. If

-4-
<PAGE>

any obligation hereunder of BW is not performed by it punctually, WELLCOME will,
without demand being made by CENTOCOR, immediately perform such obligation.

3. APPOINTMENT AS DISTRIBUTOR
--------------------------

3.1. CENTOCOR and CBV hereby appoint WELLCOME and its Affiliates as the
exclusive distributor for CENTOCOR and its Affiliates of the 17-1A Product in
the Territory and grant WELLCOME and its Affiliates the exclusive right to
promote, sell, market and distribute the 17-1A Product in the Territory subject
to the terms and conditions herein set forth.

3.2. WELLCOME hereby agrees to act in that capacity subject to the terms
and conditions herein set forth.

3.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, if both (a) either (x) the Product Committee determines that it
is inadvisable for WELLCOME or its Affiliates to promote, use, sell, market or
distribute the 17-1A Product in any country in the Territory or (y) WELLCOME or
its Affiliates are prevented by any applicable Law from doing so, and (b)
CENTOCOR'S promotion, use, sale, marketing or distribution in such country does
not adversely affect WELLCOME'S promotion, use, sale, marketing or distribution
in any other country of the Territory, then, for so long as WELLCOME or its
Affiliates do not promote, use, sell, market or distribute the 17-1A Product in
a country described in clause (a) of this Section 3.3, CENTOCOR or its
---------- ----------- 
authorized agent may promote, use, sell, market or distribute the 17-1A Product
in such country; provided, however, neither CENTOCOR nor its authorized agent
-------- ------- 
may, without the express written consent of WELLCOME, use either the Panorex
Trademarks or the Wellcome House Marks or otherwise associate WELLCOME with

-5-
<PAGE>

such promotion, use, sale, marketing or distribution of the 17-1A Product.

3.4. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, and except with
WELLCOME'S express written consent to the contrary, if WELLCOME or any of its
Affiliates are no longer prevented by applicable Law from promoting, using,
selling, marketing or distributing the 17-1A Product in a country referenced in
Section 3.3(b) hereof or the Product Committee determines that it is no longer
- -------------- 
inadvisable for WELLCOME and its Affiliates to engage in promoting, using,
selling, marketing or distributing the 17-1A Product in a country in the
Territory, then WELLCOME may upon at least ninety (90) days' prior notice to
CENTOCOR commence sales of the 17-1A Product in such country. Immediately upon
WELLCOME'S commencing sales in such country, CENTOCOR shall cease all of its
efforts in such country with respect to the 17-1A Product, except that CENTOCOR
and its authorized agent may fulfill any outstanding orders then existing with
respect to such country.

3.5. Subject to the provisions with respect to early termination set
forth in Sections 26 and 27 hereof, this Agreement shall commence on the date
------------------
hereof and shall continue in full force and effect with respect to each country
in the Territory for a period of fifteen (15) years from First Commercial Sale
in such country. During the period commencing one (1) year prior to the
expiration of the aforementioned fifteen (15) year period with respect to any
country in the Territory (a "Country Expiration Date"), CENTOCOR and WELLCOME
-----------------------
shall negotiate in good faith with respect to the renewal of this Agreement with
respect to such country on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the
parties; provided, however, nothing contained herein shall obligate either
-------- -------
CENTOCOR or WELLCOME to renew this Agreement. Prior to the date which is six
(6) months

-6-
<PAGE>

prior to a Country Expiration Date, neither CENTOCOR nor CBV, nor any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents or Affiliates
shall solicit, initiate, furnish information relating to or participate in
negotiations with any Third Party with respect to the promotion, use, sale,
marketing, distribution or supply of the 17-1A Product or of any pharmaceutical
product containing the 17-1A Antibody with respect to the applicable country in
the Territory. Following the date which is six (6) months prior to a Country
Expiration Date, CENTOCOR shall have the right to negotiate with Third Parties
with respect to rights in the applicable country to promote, use, sell, market
and distribute the 17-1A Product.

3.6. If the parties hereto fail to renew this Agreement with respect to a
given country in the Territory as provided in Section 3.5 hereof, whether for
----------- 
any reason or for no reason, then CENTOCOR shall pay to WELLCOME, in cash, with
respect to such country for which this Agreement was not renewed, a Termination
Fee. A "Termination Fee," with respect to a country, means an amount equal to 
( ** )

-7-
<PAGE>

3.7. To assure appropriately the rights hereby granted to WELLCOME and
except to the extent required by applicable Law, during the term of this
Agreement, neither CENTOCOR nor its Affiliates shall (a) release or deliver, or
authorize the release or delivery of, or otherwise transfer or assign its rights
in, the Wistar Hybridoma, the Centocor Hybridoma or any cell line producing the
17-1A Antibody or a Derivative 17-1A Antibody to any Third Party; (b) grant any
rights to manufacture, have manufactured or sell, including the right to sell
for resale, any products incorporating the 17-1A Antibody or any Derivative
17-1A Antibody; or (c) assign or transfer the Centocor Technology or otherwise
grant to Third Parties the right to use the Centocor Technology to develop,
make, have made, use, market, promote or sell 17-1A Product or Derivative 17-1A
Product other than such rights as are granted to WELLCOME, as have been
previously granted to Ajinomoto or as are granted to another Permitted
Distributor in accordance with this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 3.7
-----------
shall limit the ability of CENTOCOR and CBV to assign their rights and delegate
their duties as provided in Section 25 hereof.
---------- 

3.8. If CENTOCOR or any of its Affiliates enters into an agreement with
another distributor with respect to 17-1A Product at any time at which pursuant
to this Agreement WELLCOME or any of its Affiliates is the exclusive distributor
of 17-1A Product in any country in the Territory, then CENTOCOR or its
Affiliates, as applicable, shall agree with such other distributor, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, that (a) with respect to selling into any
country in which WELLCOME or any of its Affiliates is exclusive distributor,
such other distributor shall refrain, with respect to 17-1A Product, from
seeking customers, from establishing any branch, and from maintaining any
distribution depot, and (b) with respect to selling in any

-8-
<PAGE>

country in which WELLCOME or any of its Affiliates is exclusive distributor,
other than a member of the European Economic Community or such other country
that by applicable Law prohibits the restriction contained in this clause (b),
---------- 
such other distributor shall refrain from directly or indirectly selling 17-1A
Product.

4. OPTION FOR JAPAN, REPUBLIC OF KOREA, PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND TAIWAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1. If at any time CENTOCOR shall terminate Ajinomoto as CENTOCOR'S
distributor of 17-1A Product in any country in the Ajinomoto Territory, or
modify the Ajinomoto Agreement so as to permit CENTOCOR to appoint another
distributor for the 17-1A Product on a non-exclusive basis for any country in
the Ajinomoto Territory or to appoint an exclusive distributor of the 17-1A
Product for a portion of such country, or the Ajinomoto Agreement shall expire
by its terms, CENTOCOR shall promptly give WELLCOME written notice of such
termination, modification or expiration. Thereupon, at WELLCOME'S exclusive
option to be exercised by written notice to CENTOCOR not later than ninety (90)
days after WELLCOME'S receipt of CENTOCOR'S notice, CENTOCOR and WELLCOME shall
negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of a clinical and regulatory
development agreement and a supply, distribution and sale agreement for the
country or portion of a country with respect to which Ajinomoto's rights are no
longer exclusive (the "Former Ajinomoto Territory"). It is the intent of the
-------------------------- 
parties that such supply, distribution and sale agreement be on terms and
conditions similar to this Agreement, subject to such modifications as may be
necessary to reflect the special circumstances of the applicable country in the
Former Ajinomoto Territory and any subsisting or remaining rights of Ajinomoto
and further subject to the intent of the parties that the relative economic
benefits of the parties as a whole with respect to the

-9-
<PAGE>

Former Ajinomoto Territory be substantially equivalent to the relative economic
benefits of the parties as a whole with respect to the Territory. If WELLCOME
and CENTOCOR are unable to come to agreement within (**) 
following WELLCOME'S exercise of the option to negotiate, unless such
period shall be extended by mutual consent of the parties hereto, then CENTOCOR

distribute the 17-1A Product, subject to the further provisions of this Section
-------
4.1. If CENTOCOR shall reach agreement in principle with any such Third Party as

within such period WELLCOME rejects such terms and conditions or fails to accept
such terms and conditions, then, for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days

enter into an agreement on such terms and conditions with the applicable Third
Party.

4.2. Any distribution rights obtained pursuant to this Section 4 with

sell Final 17-1A Product that resulted from Filling and Capping at the
Greenville Facility in the Territory outside North America. "Force Majeure"
-------------
means a cause beyond the reasonable control and without the fault or negligence
of the applicable party, including, without limitation, act of God; Law; war;
insurrection or civil commotion; destruction of production facilities or
materials by earthquake, fire, flood or storm; labor disturbance; epidemic; or
failure of suppliers; public utilities or common carrier. "Inadequate Supplies"
-------------------
of Final 17-1A Product means Final 17-1A Product delivered by CENTOCOR such
that, in any (**) months, CENTOCOR has delivered in at least (**) of
those months less than (**) of the Final 17-1A Product it
is required to deliver in those months pursuant to Section 6.6 hereof (including
-----------
amounts which were required to be delivered in prior months pursuant to Section
-------
6.6 hereof and were not delivered). Nothing in this Section 5.2 releases
- --- -----------
CENTOCOR from its obligations to supply Salable 17-1A Product under Section 6.6
-----------
hereof.

5.3. All Firm Orders placed by WELLCOME for the supply of the Final 17-1A

Wellcome's Standard Terms and Conditions of 

-11-
<PAGE>

Purchase in force at that time (copies of the current versions of which are
annexed hereto as Schedule 5.3 hereof) insofar as such terms and conditions are
------------
not varied by or inconsistent with this Agreement. In the event of
inconsistencies between the terms of this Agreement and Wellcome's Standard
Terms and Conditions of Purchase, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

5.4. WELLCOME shall from time to time place Firm Orders for the Salable
17-1A Product with CENTOCOR as provided in Section 6 hereof.
--------- 

5.5. CENTOCOR shall supply WELLCOME, at WELLCOME'S option, at any time

relevant and necessary storage information.

5.6. In the event that WELLCOME elects to exercise its option under the
provisions of Section 5.5 hereof, WELLCOME shall inform CENTOCOR of its decision
----------- 
in writing. CENTOCOR shall be obliged to provide the stock of Final 17-1A

6. FORECAST - ORDER AND DELIVERY PROCEDURES
----------------------------------------

6.1. WELLCOME shall provide to CENTOCOR not later than thirty (30) days
prior to the commencement of each Quarter (such Quarter, the "Initial Quarter"
--------------- 
and the immediately succeeding quarter, the "Second Quarter") a forecast of
-------------- 
WELLCOME'S requirements for Salable 17-1A Product for each of the Initial
Quarter and the immediately succeeding three (3) quarters (a

-12-
<PAGE>

"Requirements Forecast"). The Initial Quarter and Second Quarter forecasts
--------------------- 
shall not include requirements for any Launch Country. A "Launch Country" means
-------------- 
any country in the Territory until Launch has occurred in such country and
WELLCOME has notified CENTOCOR that such country is no longer to be treated as a
Launch Country.

6.1.1. Each Requirements Forecast shall differentiate between
requirements for Final 17-1A Product and Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody with
differentiation among the countries for which the Final 17-1A Product is to be
labeled and packaged. With respect to Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody, such
Requirements Forecasts, Launch Forecasts (as described below) and Firm Orders
shall specify the bulk vial equivalent to be delivered rather than the actual
quantity of Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody. In calculating such actual quantity,
Centocor shall take into account process yield as determined by the Product
Committee and batch specific and any other factors that would influence yield.

6.1.2. The quantity forecast for each of Final 17-1A Product and
Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody for the Initial Quarter in each Requirements
Forecast other than the first Requirements Forecast under this Section 6.1 shall
----------- 
not be more than (**) above or below such quantity forecast for
the Second Quarter in the immediately preceding Requirements Forecast. Such
limits on variations in quantities of Final 17-1A Product shall not limit the
right of WELLCOME to vary its Firm Orders with respect to the countries for
which such quantities are to be labeled and packaged. There shall be no
restriction on the quantities shown in the forecasts for the Second Quarter and
subsequent quarters in each Requirements Forecast.

-13-
<PAGE>

6.2. When the Product Committee identifies a potential Launch in a
country in the Territory, but not earlier than one (1) year and not later than
six (6) months prior to such date, WELLCOME will begin providing to CENTOCOR
forecasts of WELLCOME'S requirements of 17-1A Product in such country (a "Launch
------
Forecast") for the twelve (12) month period beginning on the Launch and shall
- -------- 
continue such forecasts until the applicable country ceases to be a Launch
Country. The Launch Forecast shall be updated from time to time as WELLCOME
shall desire or the Product Committee shall request.

6.3. The Requirements Forecasts and Launch Forecasts shall not constitute
Firm Orders. To constitute a Firm Order, an order must be submitted in writing
on the Purchase Order form, be labeled as a Firm Order by WELLCOME or its
Affiliate, as applicable, and shall specify all necessary or appropriate
instructions with regard to the labeling and destination of the Final 17-1A
Product or Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody, as applicable.

6.4. WELLCOME shall submit Firm Orders for Salable 17-1A Product for
delivery during a Quarter equal to the quantities (but not necessarily for the
countries) forecast for such Quarter in the Requirements Forecast which reflects
such Quarter as the Initial Quarter.

6.5. With respect to a Launch Country, WELLCOME shall upon receipt of all
Regulatory Approvals with respect to such country, submit Firm Orders for
delivery in a Quarter of the lesser of the amounts set forth in the then most
recent Launch Forecast for such Quarter (pro rated if Regulatory Approval comes
after the beginning of such Quarter) or as agreed by the Product Committee. Once
a Launch Country is included in the forecast for the Initial 

-14-
<PAGE>

Quarter of a Requirements Forecast, WELLCOME shall not be required to place Firm
Orders under this Section 6.5.
------------

6.6. CENTOCOR shall fulfill each Firm Order submitted pursuant to
Sections 6.4 or 6.5 hereof for Final 17-1A Product and Pre Formulated Bulk
- ------------------- 
Antibody specified in such Firm Order. Salable 17-1A Product ordered pursuant to
Section 6.4 hereof shall be delivered within four (4) weeks of CENTOCOR'S
- ----------- 
receipt of the applicable Firm Order. Salable 17-1A Product ordered pursuant to
Section 6.5 hereof shall be delivered within a period selected by the Product
- ----------- 
Committee but in no event later than ninety (90) days after CENTOCOR'S receipt
of the applicable Firm Order. Upon delivery to WELLCOME, all Final 17-1A
Product shall have at least (**) of its shelf life
remaining and Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody shall have such shelf life that upon
Filling and Capping, the shelf life remaining shall be (**) 
for Final 17-1A Product. At CENTOCOR'S request, WELLCOME will accept Final
17-1A Product with a shelf life less than (**) , but in the
event such Final 17-1A Product is not sold due to the limited shelf life
remaining, CENTOCOR will refund the payment made by WELLCOME to CENTOCOR for
such stock.

6.7. CENTOCOR and CBV shall use commercially reasonable efforts to supply
to WELLCOME any requirements of WELLCOME in excess of those required to be
delivered under Section 6.6 hereof.
----------- 

6.8. If there is a shortfall or anticipated shortage of Final 17-1A
Product and/or Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody and/or any other essential materials
used in the production of 17-1A Product and/or any delay in shipment or delivery
occasioned by CENTOCOR or its Affiliates, CENTOCOR hereby undertakes and agrees
(a) immediately to notify WELLCOME and its Affiliates as

-15-
<PAGE>

to the reason for the shortage of supply and to provide an indication of the
duration of the delay and (b) to use its best efforts to allocate to WELLCOME as
much Final 17-1A Product and Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody as is available as a
matter of priority in accordance with WELLCOME'S estimated requirements and Firm
Order(s) made under the terms hereof. CENTOCOR shall not grant an equal or
higher priority to any Third Party than to WELLCOME and its Affiliates with
respect to shipment of products from the Leiden Facility, except as may exist on
the date hereof. Nothing in this Section 6.8 releases CENTOCOR from its
----------- 
obligations to supply Salable 17-1A Product under Section 6.6 hereof.
----------- 

6.9. CENTOCOR shall use best efforts to make up all shortfalls in
delivery in accordance with a Firm Order as promptly as possible and shall
promptly supply Final 17-1A Product and Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody to WELLCOME
to meet such Firm Order.

6.10. WELLCOME shall in its forecasting and ordering maintain inventories
of Salable 17-1A Product in accordance with inventory management systems it uses
for other products of similar status and exposure in the marketplace.

7. PAYMENT TERMS FOR 17-1A PRODUCT

of such Final 17-1A Product on the

-16-
<PAGE>

(**) of Net Sales of such
Final 17-1A Product;

(b) (**) of Net Sales by WELLCOME and
its Affiliates of such Final 17-1A Product on the (**) 
of Net Sales of such Final 17-1A Product; and

(c) (**) of Net Sales by WELLCOME and
its Affiliates of such Final 17-1A Product on Net Sales thereafter for the term
of this Agreement.

The appropriate Purchase Price level shall be measured from the date of First
Commercial Sale in the Territory, based on total Net Sales made in the initial
term and any renewal term of this Agreement.

7.1.2. For all Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody supplied to the
Greenville Facility, WELLCOME shall pay as the Purchase Price to CENTOCOR 
(**) of Net Sales
by WELLCOME and its Affiliates of Final 17-1A Product resulting from the Filling
and Capping of such Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody.

7.1.3. Notwithstanding Section 7.1.2 hereof, if any Pre Formulated
------------- 
Bulk Antibody supplied to the Greenville Facility shall be rendered unsalable by
reason of a failure of Filling and Capping, or if any such Pre Formulated Bulk
Antibody shall be deemed to be Unnecessary Waste, the Purchase Price thereof
shall be the lesser of the (**)

CENTOCOR'S cost shall mean direct labor, direct materials, variable burden and
fixed burden allocated to Pre Formulated Bulk 

-17-
<PAGE>

Antibody. "Unnecessary Waste" means the difference between the yield of Final
----------------- 
17-1A Product from Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody actually achieved in Filling and
Capping at the Greenville Facility and the feasible yield as determined by the
Product Committee. The Product Committee shall determine such feasible yield
taking into account actual yields at the Leiden Facility, special circumstances
at the Greenville Facility (including the length of time it has been conducting
Filling and Capping and variations in equipment) and the composition of specific
shipment of Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody.

7.1.4. (**)

Nothing in this Section 7.1.4 or in any negotiations or agreements entered into
------------- 
pursuant to this Section 7.1.4 shall limit the indemnification obligations of

------------ 

-18-
<PAGE>

7.1.5. If the Centocor Hybridoma or the Wistar Hybridoma enters,
or is established already to be in, the public domain, in the Territory and, as
a result, a 17-1A Product or Derivative 17-1A Product competitive with the 17-1A
Product is marketed, sold or distributed hereunder by a Third Party in the
Territory, then the percentage applied to Net Sales under Sections 7.1.1 and
------------------
7.1.2 hereof shall be adjusted by multiplying such percentage by (**) .
- ----- 

7.2. INTERIM PAYMENTS
----------------

7.2.1. As further set forth in this Section 7.2, initial payments
----------- 
will be made based on estimates of the Purchase Price ("Final 17-1A Product
-------------------
Interim Prices" and "Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody Interim Prices,"
- -------------- ------------------------------------------- 
respectively).

7.2.2. As interim payment of the Purchase Price, WELLCOME and its
Affiliates will pay the then current Final 17-1A Product Interim Price within 
(**) after WELLCOME'S receipt of the invoice for Final 17-1A Product and
the then current Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody Interim Price within (**) 
after WELLCOME'S receipt of the invoice for Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody shipped
pursuant to a Firm Order, provided that such Final 17-1A Product or Pre
Formulated Antibody has met the standards set forth in Section 21.4 hereof, and
------------ 
provided further that from and after payment of the Purchase Price for Final
17-1A Product delivered by CENTOCOR in an aggregate of (**) , payments
of the Final 17-1A Product Interim Price shall be due within (**) after
WELLCOME'S receipt of invoice. If the days outstanding for WELLCOME'S average

reasonable estimates of items that will be deducted therefrom to determine Net
Sales, WELLCOME will notify CENTOCOR of an initial Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody
Interim Price and an initial Final 17-1A Product Interim Price.

7.2.4. The initial Pre Formulated Bulk Antibody Interim Price
shall be based on an estimate of the 
(**) 
such estimate approved by the Product Committee.

7.2.5. The Final 17-1A Product Interim Price and the Pre
Formulated Bulk Antibody Interim Price (collectively, the "Interim Prices") 
--------------
(**) as directed by the Product Committee
(**) .

7.3. ADJUSTMENTS TO PURCHASE PRICE
-----------------------------

7.3.1. On a basis not more frequently than monthly or less
frequently than quarterly, WELLCOME shall submit to CENTOCOR itemized
adjustments to the Purchase Price based on the deductions from gross sales price
that constitute adjustments to Net Sales and on variations in its actual gross
sales prices.

7.3.2. If WELLCOME holds for CENTOCOR pursuant to Section 8.6
-----------
hereof any inventory of 17-1A Product that is rendered unsalable by expiration
of its shelf life, a change in any Regulatory Approvals or recalls, market
withdrawals or

-20-
<PAGE>

corrections (except to the extent such recalls, market withdrawals or
corrections have been (a) solely the result of WELLCOME'S Filling and Capping at
the Greenville Facility but only other than in compliance with the 17-1A Product
Specification or such other written specifications as are issued by the Product
Committee or the CGMP Regulations, or (b) solely the result of WELLCOME'S
storage, physical handling or distribution of 17-1A Product but only other than
in compliance with the 17-1A Product Specification or CGMP Regulations), then
the Net Sales of such inventory shall be deemed (**) . The allocation of
costs other than payment of the Purchase Price with respect to 17-1A Product
that is subject to recalls, market withdrawals or corrections shall be governed
by Section 20.5 hereof.
------------ 

7.3.3. If any inventory of 17-1A Product is rendered unsalable by
reason of any casualty or event or circumstance for which an adjustment is not
made by reason of Sections 7.3.1 or 7.3.2 hereof, the Net Sales of such

inventory shall be deemed (**), provided that WELLCOME shall pay to CENTOCOR
for such inventory the lesser of

(**)

CENTOCOR'S cost shall mean direct labor, direct materials, variable
burden and fixed burden allocated to Final 17-1A Product or Pre Formulated Bulk
Antibody, as applicable.

7.3.4. If such adjustments result in reductions of the Purchase
Price from the applicable Interim Price, WELLCOME may apply such adjustments as
a credit against subsequent invoices. If such adjustments result in additional
amounts owing 

-21-
<PAGE>

to CENTOCOR, WELLCOME shall pay such amounts to CENTOCOR within ten (10) days of
the submission of the applicable adjustment.

7.4. MANNER OF PAYMENT
-----------------

7.4.1. CENTOCOR shall direct all invoices for Salable 17-1A

other amounts due hereunder, currencies shall be converted on the basis of
exchange rates calculated on WELLCOME'S normal basis taking exchange rates
published in the London Financial Times on the relevant day closest to the end

foreign taxing authority in connection with the accrual or payment of any of the
Purchase Price, WELLCOME shall have the right to pay such tax or withholding to
the local taxing authorities on behalf of CENTOCOR and to deduct from the
amounts due to CENTOCOR the amounts paid for such taxes or withholding,

-22-
<PAGE>

provided that WELLCOME shall deliver to CENTOCOR evidence of payment. If the
Purchase Price in any country is higher than the maximum permitted by the Laws
of such country, the Purchase Price paid with respect to the Net Sales in such
country shall be reduced to the maximum rate permitted by Law.

7.5. RECORDS, REPORTS, AUDITS
------------------------

7.5.1. WELLCOME and its Affiliates shall maintain records of Net
Sales to enable the amounts due to CENTOCOR hereunder to be determined. 
WELLCOME shall provide to CENTOCOR copies of WELLCOME'S monthly unit sales
distribution reports.

Antibody, and

(b) the Net Sales of 17-1A Product units sold in the

WELLCOME, not more than once in each WELLCOME fiscal year nor more than once in
respect of any WELLCOME fiscal year, through an independent public accountant
selected by CENTOCOR and acceptable to WELLCOME, which acceptance shall not
unreasonably be refused, to have access during normal business hours to those
records of WELLCOME as may reasonably be necessary to verify the

-23-
<PAGE>

accuracy of the payments of the Purchase Price in respect of any fiscal year
ending not more than eighteen (18) months prior to the date of such notice. 
Upon the expiration of eighteen (18) months following the end of any fiscal
year, the calculation of Purchase Price payable with respect to sales during
such fiscal year shall be binding and conclusive upon CENTOCOR, and WELLCOME and
its Affiliates shall be released from any liability or accountability with
respect to the Purchase Price for sales during such fiscal year. If such
independent public accountant's report shows any underpayment of the Purchase
Price, within thirty (30) days after WELLCOME'S receipt of such report, WELLCOME
shall remit or shall cause its Affiliate to remit to CENTOCOR (a) the amount of
such underpayment and (b) if such underpayment exceeds five percent (5%) of the
total Purchase Price owed for the fiscal year then being reviewed, the
reasonable and necessary fees and expenses of such independent accountant
performing the audit. Otherwise such fees and expenses shall be borne by
CENTOCOR. Any overpayment shall be fully creditable against the future Purchase
Price payable in subsequent payment periods.

7.5.4. All written statements provided by WELLCOME hereunder shall
be in the English language.

7.5.5. CENTOCOR agrees that all information which is the subject
matter of this Section 7 and which is subject to review under this Section 7 is

concerning Adverse Reactions

-17-

arising out of any Clinical Trials and shall take all steps required by
applicable Law with respect to such Adverse Reactions.

15. CONFIDENTIALITY
---------------

15.1. "Proprietary Information" for the purposes of this Section 15 
----------------------- ---------- 
means all inventions, discoveries, improvements and methods, business plans,
marketing techniques and plans, manufacturing and other plant designs, locations
of operations and any other information affecting the business operations of the
Disclosing Party and which is identified by the Disclosing Party at the time of
disclosure as being confidential or proprietary.

15.2. Except as expressly provided herein otherwise, each Receiving
Party shall, during the term of this Agreement including any renewals hereof,
and for a period of five (5) years following expiration or the termination
hereof, but in any event not for less than a period of ten (10) years from the
date hereof, maintain the confidentiality of all Proprietary Information
disclosed by the Disclosing Party hereunder and shall neither use the same
except as expressly authorized by this Agreement or any other Alliance Document,
nor disclose the same to any Third Party without the prior written consent of
the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Section 15, however, shall be construed
---------- 
to require any party hereto to maintain the confidentiality and non-use of any
information or material that (a) at the time of disclosure, is already in the
public domain; (b) after disclosure, enters the public domain otherwise than by
an act or omission of the Receiving Party in violation of the terms of this
Agreement; (c) prior to disclosure under this Agreement was already in the
possession of the Receiving Party or its Affiliates, provided that such
information or material was not obtained, directly or indirectly, from the
Disclosing Party 

-18-
<PAGE>

under this Agreement or under any other obligation of confidentiality from the
Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party; (d) becomes known to the Receiving
Party from a Third Party, provided that such information or material was not
obtained, directly or indirectly, from the other party on a confidential basis;
(e) is required in the reasonable judgment of the Receiving Party to be
disclosed to a Governmental Entity in furtherance of this Agreement or the
Alliance Agreement or pursuant to any Law, Permit, or Court Order; or (f)
results from research or development by the Receiving Party or its Affiliate
independent of disclosures from the Disclosing Party. Disclosures made prior to
the date of this Agreement pursuant to that certain Confidentiality Agreement
between CENTOCOR and WELLCOME dated September 14, 1993 shall be governed by such
Confidentiality Agreement and to the extent not inconsistent therewith this
Section 15; other disclosures prior to the date of this Agreement of 
- ---------- 
Proprietary Information shall be governed by the terms of this Section 15.
---------- 

15.3. Nothing in this Section 15 shall prevent any party hereto from
---------- 
disclosing its own information relating to its business, financial affairs,
products, research development, marketing and other commercial activities to any
Affiliate or any Third Party. In addition, notwithstanding the restrictions in
this Section 15 on confidentiality and use, any party hereto may disclose
---------- 
Proprietary Information which is disclosed to it hereunder to any of its
Affiliates which agrees to be bound by the terms of this Section 15.
---------- 

15.4. Nothing in this Section 15 shall prevent or restrict WELLCOME and
---------- 
its Affiliates from using and/or disclosing Proprietary Information received
from CENTOCOR or CBV where such use and/or disclosure is reasonably regarded by
WELLCOME or its Affiliates as necessary to enable WELLCOME to carry out its
obligations under the Target Program or the Post Target Program, 

-19-
<PAGE>

provided that WELLCOME and its Affiliates shall take all reasonable steps to
ensure that disclosure of any such Proprietary Information is as limited as
possible and disclosed on a confidential basis.

16. OTHER ANTIBODIES
----------------

16.1. During the term of this Agreement and the Supply Agreement,
CENTOCOR shall not develop, conduct clinical trials or seek regulatory approval
or license out rights to any Third Party with respect to, marketing, selling or
distributing any Derivative 17-1A Antibody or any product derived therefrom or
from the 17-1A Antibody except with, and pursuant to an agreement with,
WELLCOME.

16.2. If the Product Committee determines that it is not scientifically
or commercially feasible to continue the Target Program with the 17-1A Product,
or a Termination Event occurs, WELLCOME may, but is under no obligation to,
substitute under this Agreement for the 17-1A Product another product that is or
contains a Derivative 17-1A Antibody.

17. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY
---------------------------

17.1. Each obligation and liability of CENTOCOR under this Agreement
shall be an independent, joint and several obligation of CENTOCOR and CBV. Each
of CENTOCOR and CBV shall be fully liable for performance under this Agreement
notwithstanding (a) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale
or other disposition of all, or substantially all of the assets, marshalling of
assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the
benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition with creditors or
readjustment of, or other similar proceedings affecting CBV or CENTOCOR or any
contest of the validity of this Agreement in any 

-20-
<PAGE>

such proceeding; or (b) any Law or Court Order now or hereafter in effect in any
jurisdiction which might in any manner affect any of such terms or provisions or
any of the rights of WELLCOME or BW with respect thereto or which might cause or
permit CBV or CENTOCOR to invoke any defense to, or any alteration in the time,
amount or manner of performance of any or all of their respective obligations
under this Agreement except to the extent such Law or Court Order renders such
obligations unlawful or to the extent such Court Order constitutes a remedy for
a breach by WELLCOME or BW. The invalidity or unenforceability of this
Agreement as to either of CENTOCOR or CBV shall not render this Agreement
invalid or unenforceable as to the other. The invalidity or unenforceability of
this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not in itself render this Agreement
unenforceable in another jurisdiction. If any obligation hereunder of either
CBV or CENTOCOR is not performed by such party punctually, the other of CBV or
CENTOCOR, as applicable, will, without demand being made by WELLCOME,
immediately perform such obligation.

17.2. To the extent that BW has an obligation hereunder, either
expressly or by assignment by WELLCOME, WELLCOME hereby guarantees the full
payment and performance of such obligation. Each of WELLCOME and BW shall be
fully liable for performance of their obligations under this Agreement
notwithstanding (a) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale
or other disposition of all, or substantially all of the assets, marshalling of
assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the
benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition with creditors or
readjustment of, or other similar proceedings affecting BW or WELLCOME or any
contest of the validity of this Agreement in any such proceeding; or (b) any Law
or Court Order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction which might in any
manner affect any of such terms or provisions or any of the rights of CENTOCOR
with respect thereto or which might cause or permit BW or 

-21-
<PAGE>

WELLCOME to invoke any defense to, or any alteration in the time, amount or
manner of performance of any or except to the extent such Law or Court Order
renders such obligations unlawful or to the extent such Court Order constitutes
a remedy for a breach by CENTOCOR or CBV. The invalidity or unenforceability of
this Agreement as to either of WELLCOME or BW shall not render the respective
obligations of the other under this Agreement invalid or unenforceable. The
invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not
in itself render this Agreement unenforceable in another jurisdiction. If any
obligation hereunder of BW is not performed by it punctually, WELLCOME will,
without demand being made by CENTOCOR, immediately perform such obligation.

18. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
------------------------------

18.1. All Parties. WELLCOME and BW hereby represent and warrant 
----------- 
jointly and severally as to each of WELLCOME and BW; and CENTOCOR and CBV hereby
jointly and severally represent and warrant as to each of CENTOCOR and CBV:

18.1.1. Organization, Standing and Qualification. It is a
---------------------------------------- 
corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.

18.1.2. Power and Authority; Enforceability. It has the 
----------------------------------- 
requisite power and authority (corporate and otherwise) to execute, deliver and
perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 
The execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement and the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary action (corporate and otherwise) on its part. This
Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
applicable

-22-
<PAGE>

bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally.

18.1.3. Validity of Contemplated Transactions. The execution,
------------------------------------- 
delivery and performance by it of this Agreement and the consummation by it of
the transactions contemplated hereby do not (a) violate or contravene any
provision of its charter or bylaws; (b) violate, breach, conflict with,
constitute a Default under, cause the acceleration of any payments pursuant to,
or otherwise impair the good standing, validity, or effectiveness of any
agreement, contract, indenture, lease, license, or mortgage to which it is a
party or by which it or any of its properties or assets are bound; (c) subject
any of its properties or assets to any Lien or to any indenture, mortgage,

18.2. By CENTOCOR and CBV. CENTOCOR and CBV represent and warrant that
------------------- 
with respect to each of them:

18.2.1. Intellectual Property. To the best of CENTOCOR'S

-23-
<PAGE>

use pursuant to legal, valid, binding and enforceable agreements all
Intellectual Property necessary or appropriate in connection with the
development, production, testing and sale by them of the 17-1A Product. The
inception, development and reduction to practice of any of the Intellectual
Property in connection with the development, production, testing and sale by
them of the 17-1A Product has not constituted or involved the misappropriation
by CENTOCOR or its Affiliates or, to the best of its knowledge, by Third
Parties, of trade secrets or other rights of any other Person (including,
without limitation, any Governmental Entity). In connection with the
development, production, testing and sale (including sale for resale) by them of
the 17-1A Product, neither CENTOCOR nor any of its Affiliates (and in connection
with their resale of the 17-1A Product, neither WELLCOME nor any of its
Affiliates), to the best of CENTOCOR'S knowledge, is or may be infringing on or
otherwise acting adversely to the rights of any Person under or in respect of
any of the Intellectual Property of such Person. To the best of CENTOCOR'S and
CBV'S knowledge, no Person is or may be infringing on or otherwise acting
adversely to the rights of CENTOCOR or any of its Affiliates under or in respect
of any of the Intellectual Property which is used in connection with the
development, production, testing and sale by them of the 17-1A Product.

18.2.2. Wistar License. CENTOCOR is party to the Wistar 
-------------- 
License, which is valid, binding and enforceable, and, pursuant to such license,
is the exclusive licensee of the Wistar Rights, has not sublicensed the Wistar
Rights to any Person excluding Ajinomoto pursuant to the Ajinomoto Agreement,
and no Person other than CENTOCOR is entitled, either currently or during the
term of the Supply Agreement, to license the Wistar Rights. CENTOCOR holds such
Wistar Rights free and clear of all Liens, claims and other encumbrances,
covenants, conditions, or restrictions. There are no licenses, options, rights
of first refusal, conditional sales agreements or other arrangements, 

-24-
<PAGE>

whether oral or written, which affect any portion of or all such Wistar Rights
other than the rights granted to Ajinomoto pursuant to the Ajinomoto Agreement.

18.2.3. Cell Line. The cell line from which CENTOCOR and CBV
--------- 
obtain the 17-1A Antibody is the Centocor Hybridoma. To the extent that such
cell line differs from the Wistar Hybridoma, CENTOCOR and CBV own all right,
title and interest in such cell line, free and clear of all Liens, claims and
other encumbrances, conditions, covenants or restrictions.

18.2.4. Conducted Clinical Trials. The Conducted Clinical 
------------------------- 
Trials were conducted solely and exclusively by the Persons identified on
Schedule 12.1 hereto, and CENTOCOR owns all data, information, and results of
- -------------
the Conducted Clinical Trials free and clear of all Liens, claims and other
encumbrances, conditions, covenants or restrictions except applicable patient
confidentiality rights. There are no licenses, options, rights of first
refusal, conditional sales agreements or other arrangements, whether oral or
written, which affect any portion of or all the data, information, and results
of the Conducted Clinical Trials.

18.2.5. Capacity. CENTOCOR and CBV own or lawfully control
-------- 
facilities and Intellectual Property, and have employees with expertise,
necessary or appropriate to produce the 17-1A Product pursuant to Regulatory
Approvals in quantities sufficient to fulfill their obligations under this
Agreement and the Supply Agreement without, to the best of CENTOCOR'S and CBV'S
knowledge, infringing the rights of any Third Party.

18.2.6. Veracity of Statements. No representation or warranty
---------------------- 
by it contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, schedule or other
document or instrument furnished to it pursuant hereto, contains or will contain
any untrue 

-25-
<PAGE>

statement of a material fact or omits or will omit to state a material fact
necessary to make it not misleading.

18.3. The representations and warranties contained herein shall survive
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

19. INDEMNIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO TARGET PROGRAM AND POST TARGET PROGRAM.

their respective Affiliates and the respective directors, officers, employees

against any and all Losses arising out of, relating to or resulting from:

19.1.1. the Target Program, including, but not limited to,
patient claims in connection with the Target Program; except to the extent such
Losses arise out of the negligence or willful misconduct of WELLCOME or any of
its Affiliates in connection with the Target Program; and

19.1.2. the Post Target Program to the extent such Losses arise
out of the negligence or willful misconduct of CENTOCOR or any of its Affiliates
in connection with the Post Target Program.

19.2. By WELLCOME and BW. Subject to compliance by the applicable
------------------- 
Indemnitee as defined below with its obligations set forth in Sections 19.4 and

- ---- 
CENTOCOR'S Affiliates and the respective directors, officers, employees and
agents of CENTOCOR, CBV and the CENTOCOR'S Affiliates, harmless 

-26-
<PAGE>

from and against any and all Losses arising out of, relating to or resulting
from the Post Target Program to the extent such Losses arise out of the
negligence or willful misconduct of WELLCOME, BW or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the Post Target Program.

19.3. "Indemnitor" means CENTOCOR and CBV with respect to Section 19.1
---------- ------------
hereof and WELLCOME and BW with respect to Section 19.2 hereof. "Indemnitee"
------------ ----------

CENTOCOR'S Affiliates and the respective directors, officers, employees and
agents of CENTOCOR, CBV and CENTOCOR'S Affiliates with respect to Section 19.2
------------
hereof.

19.4. Notice. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of written 
------ 
notice of the commencement of any suit, audit, demand, judgment, action,
investigation or proceeding relating to a Loss (a "Third Party Action") or
------------------ 
promptly after an Indemnitee incurs a Loss or has knowledge of the existence of
a Loss, such Indemnitee will, if a claim with respect thereto is to be made
against Indemnitor due to Indemnitor's obligation to provide indemnification
hereunder, give Indemnitor written notice of such Loss or the commencement of
such Third Party Action; provided, however, the failure to provide such notice
-------- ------- 
within a reasonable period of time shall not relieve Indemnitor of any of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent it is prejudiced by such failure.

19.5. Defense. The Indemnitor shall control the defense and settlement
------- 
of a Third Party Action, except that (a) the applicable Indemnitee may assume
such defense provided that the obligation of the Indemnitor to pay the
attorneys' fees of such Indemnitee shall cease upon such election and (b) upon
the 

-27-
<PAGE>

applicable Indemnitee determining that its interests are divergent from
those of the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee may assume such defense and the
Indemnitor shall remain liable for the attorneys' fees of such Indemnitee. If
the Indemnitor defends such action, it shall not enter into any resolution or
other compromise of such action unless it (x) pays in cash or posts an adequate
bond for the payment of the amount of such resolution or other compromise and
obtains a complete release of the Indemnitee or (y) obtains the prior written
consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

resolution or other compromise of such action unless such Indemnitee obtains the
consent of the Indemnitor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 
The party defending the action shall keep the other parties informed on an
ongoing basis of the status of such Third Party Action and shall deliver to such
other parties copies of all documents relating to the Third Party Action as the
other party may reasonably request. The party assuming such defense shall
receive from the others all necessary and reasonable cooperation in the defense
of a Third Party Action including, but not limited to, the services of employees
of such other parties who are familiar with the events or circumstances out of
which any such Third Party Action may have arisen.

19.6. The indemnifications contained in this Section 19 shall survive
---------- 
termination of this Agreement.

20. MISCELLANEOUS

neither the Centocor Group or any of its members, nor the Wellcome Group or any
of its members, shall be deemed the agent of the other group or of any of such
group's members for any purpose whatsoever, and neither the Centocor Group or
any of its members, nor the Wellcome Group or any of its members, shall have
authority to enter into any contract or agreement, assume any obligation or make
any warranty or representation for or on behalf of the other group or any of its

execute any such counterpart, each of which when executed and delivered shall be
deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts taken together shall
constitute but one and the same instrument. The execution of this Agreement and
any such amendment or supplement by any party hereto will not become effective
until counterparts hereof have been executed by all the parties hereto.

20.17. Savings Clause. Any restriction or information provision (as 
-------------- 
each of these terms or expressions are defined in the RTPA) contained in this
Agreement or in any arrangement of which this Agreement forms part by virtue of
which this Agreement or any such arrangement is registrable under the RTPA shall
not take effect in the United Kingdom until the day after the day on

Times on the last Business Day of the Quarter in respect of which the royalty
payment is made.

5.4.3. In the event any tax or withholding is levied by any
foreign taxing authority in connection with the accrual or payment of any of
royalties, WELLCOME shall have the right to pay such tax or withholding to the
local taxing authorities on behalf of CENTOCOR and to deduct from the amounts
due to CENTOCOR the amounts paid for such taxes or withholding, provided that
WELLCOME shall deliver to CENTOCOR evidence of payment. If royalties in any
country are higher than the maximum permitted by the Laws of such country,
royalties paid with 

-8-

5.5.3. CENTOCOR shall have the right upon prior notice to
WELLCOME, not more than once in each WELLCOME fiscal year nor more than once in
respect of any WELLCOME fiscal year, through an independent public accountant,
selected by CENTOCOR and acceptable to WELLCOME, which acceptance shall not
unreasonably be refused, to have access during normal business hours to those
records of WELLCOME as may reasonably be necessary to verify the accuracy of the
payments of royalties in respect of any fiscal year ending not more than
eighteen (18) months prior to the date of such notice. Upon the expiration of
eighteen (18) months following the end of any fiscal year, the calculation of
royalties payable with respect to sales during such fiscal year shall be binding
and conclusive upon CENTOCOR and CBV, and WELLCOME and its Affiliates shall be
released from any liability or accountability with respect to royalties for
sales during such fiscal year. If such independent public accountant's report
shows any underpayment of royalties, within thirty (30) days after WELLCOME'S
receipt of such report, WELLCOME shall remit or shall cause its Affiliate to
remit to CENTOCOR (a) the amount of 

-9-
<PAGE>

such underpayment and (b) if such underpayment exceeds five percent (5%) of the
total royalties owed for the fiscal year then being reviewed, the reasonable and
necessary fees and expenses of such independent accountant performing the 
audit. Otherwise such fees and expenses shall be borne by CENTOCOR. Any
overpayment shall be fully creditable against future royalties payable in
subsequent payment periods.

5.5.4. All written statements provided by WELLCOME hereunder shall
be in the English language.

5.5.5. CENTOCOR agrees that all information which is the subject
matter of this Section 5.5 and which is subject to review under this Section 5.5

<PAGE>

11.15. Independent Contractors. It is expressly understood and agreed that

members, shall be deemed the agent of the other group or of any of its members
for any purpose whatsoever, and neither the Centocor Group or any of its
members, nor the Wellcome Group or any of its members, shall have authority to
enter into any contract or agreement, assume any obligation or make any warranty
or representation for or on behalf of the other group or any of its members. 
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create or constitute a partnership
or the relationship of employer and employee between the Wellcome Group or any
of its members on the one hand and the Centocor Group or any of its members on

termination hereof, but in any event not for less than a period of ten (10)
years from the date hereof, maintain the confidentiality of all Proprietary

<PAGE>

hereunder and shall neither use the same except as expressly authorized by this
Agreement, the Alliance Agreement or any other Alliance Document, nor disclose
the same to any Third Party that is not an Affiliate of the Receiving Party
without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this
Section 11.16, however, shall be construed to require any party hereto to
- -------------
maintain the confidentiality and non-use of any information or material that (a)
at the time of disclosure, is already in the public domain; (b) after
disclosure, enters the public domain otherwise than by an act or omission of the
Receiving Party in violation of the terms of this Agreement; (c) prior to
disclosure under this Agreement was already in the possession of the Receiving
Party or its Affiliates, provided that such information or material was not
obtained, directly or indirectly, from the Disclosing Party; (d) becomes known
to the Receiving Party from a Third Party, provided that such information or
material was not obtained, directly or indirectly, from the Disclosing Party on
a confidential basis; (e) is required in the reasonable judgment of the

Disclosures of Proprietary Information made prior to the date hereof shall be
governed by this Section 11.16.
-------------

11.16.3. Nothing in this Section 11.16 shall prevent any party
------------- 
hereto from disclosing its own information relating to its business, financial
affairs, products, research development, marketing and other commercial
activities to any Affiliate or any Third Party. In addition, notwithstanding
the restrictions in this Section 11.16 on confidentiality and use, any party
------------- 
hereto may disclose Proprietary Information which is disclosed to it hereunder
to any of its Affiliates which agrees to be bound by the terms of this Section
-------
11.16.
- ----- 

-24-
<PAGE>

11.17. Continuing Obligation. Except as otherwise specifically provided
--------------------- 
herein, neither termination nor expiration of this Agreement shall relieve any
party from any obligation under this Agreement which accrued or arose from facts
and circumstances in existence prior thereto.

11.18. Covenant Not to Sue. CENTOCOR and CBV agree that during the term of
------------------- 
this Agreement neither they nor their Affiliates will assert or cause to be
asserted against WELLCOME, its Affiliates or sublicensees any Intellectual
Property rights relating to the manufacture of Biological Products not licensed
hereunder that are or may be infringed by reason of the exercise by WELLCOME,
its Affiliates or its sublicensees of the license granted hereunder for which a
royalty is paid to CENTOCOR under Section 5.2 hereof; provided, however, nothing
----------- -------- ------- 
herein shall prohibit CENTOCOR, CBV or their Affiliates from instituting any
suit they are obligated to institute pursuant to the terms of a license
agreement with a Third Party pursuant to which a license to such Intellectual
Property has been granted.

11.19. Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendment or supplement hereto
------------ 
may be executed in any number of counterparts and any party hereto may execute
any such counterpart, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed
to be an original and all of which counterparts taken together shall constitute
but one and the same instrument. The execution of this Agreement and any such
amendment or supplement by any party hereto will not become effective until
counterparts hereof have been executed by all the parties hereto.

11.20. Savings Clause. Any restriction or information provision (as each
-------------- 
of these terms or expressions are defined in the RTPA) contained in this
Agreement or in any arrangement of which this Agreement forms part by virtue of
which this 

-25-
<PAGE>

Agreement or any such arrangement is registrable under the RTPA shall not take
effect in the United Kingdom until the day after the day on which full
particulars of this Agreement (and of any such arrangement) shall have been duly
furnished to the Office of Fair Trading under Section 24 of the RTPA. 
----------
11.21. Further Assurances. At the request of any party hereto, the other
------------------ 
parties hereto shall execute and deliver from time to time such further
instruments and shall provide reasonable cooperation in such proceedings or
actions as shall be necessary or reasonably appropriate to effectuate the
purposes of this Agreement including, without limitation, registering or
recording the rights granted hereunder; provided, however, if any party hereto
-------- ------- 
desires to notify this Agreement under Article 85(3) of the Treaty of Rome
establishing the European Economic Community, such party shall give the other
parties ninety (90) days prior written notice of such notification and if during
such period a party shall reasonably object to such notification, the objecting
party need not cooperate in such notification and such notification shall not be
implemented. Except as otherwise provided in the Alliance Documents, the
executions, deliveries and cooperation of each party under this section shall be
without further consideration and at such party's expense.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly caused this Agreement to

and CBV shall defend, indemnify and hold WELLCOME and its Affiliates and the
respective directors, officers, employees and agents of WELLCOME and its
Affiliates, harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of,
relating to or resulting from the breach by CENTOCOR or CBV of any of their
representations, warranties and covenants contained within this Agreement.

shall defend, indemnify and hold CENTOCOR, CBV and their Affiliates and the
respective directors, officers, employees and agents of CENTOCOR and CBV and
their Affiliates, harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of,
relating to or resulting from the breach by WELLCOME of any of its
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement.

10
<PAGE>

7.3. "Indemnitor" means CENTOCOR and CBV with respect to Section 7.1
---------- -----------
hereof and WELLCOME with respect to Section 7.2 hereof. "Indemnitee" means any
----------- ---------- 
of WELLCOME and its Affiliates and the respective directors, officers, employees
and agents of WELLCOME and its Affiliates with respect to Section 7.1 hereof and
----------- 
any of CENTOCOR, CBV and their Affiliates and the respective directors,
officers, employees and agents of CENTOCOR, CBV and their Affiliates with
respect to Section 7.2 hereof.
----------- 

7.4. Notice. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of written notice
------ 
of the commencement of any suit, audit, demand, judgment, action, investigation
or proceeding relating to a Loss (a "Third Party Action") or promptly after an
------------------ 
Indemnitee incurs a Loss or has knowledge of the existence of a Loss, such
Indemnitee will, if a claim with respect thereto is to be made against
Indemnitor due to Indemnitor's obligation to provide indemnification hereunder,
give Indemnitor written notice of such Loss or the commencement of such Third
Party Action; provided, however, the failure to provide such notice within a
-------- ------- 
reasonable period of time shall not relieve Indemnitor of any of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent it is prejudiced by such failure.

7.5. Defense. Indemnitor shall control the defense and settlement of a
------- 
Third Party Action, except that the applicable Indemnitee may assume such
defense provided that the obligation of Indemnitor to pay the attorneys' fees of
such Indemnitee shall cease upon such election. If Indemnitor defends such
action, it shall not enter into any resolution or other compromise of such
action unless it (a) pays in cash or posts an adequate bond for the payment of
the amount of such resolution or other compromise and obtains a complete release
of the Indemnitee or (b) obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnitee,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnitee defends
such

action, such Indemnitee shall not enter into any resolution or other compromise
of such action unless such Indemnitee obtains the consent of Indemnitor, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The party defending the action
shall keep the other parties informed on an ongoing basis of the status of such
Third Party Action and shall deliver to such other parties copies of all
documents relating to the Third Party Action as the other parties may reasonably
request. The party assuming such defense shall receive from the other parties

including, but not limited to, the services of employees of such other parties
who are familiar with the events or circumstances out of which any such Third
Party Action may have arisen.

7.6. The indemnifications contained in this Section 7 shall survive

expiration or termination of this Agreement.

8. INFRINGEMENT
------------

In the event that any party hereto obtains knowledge of any infringement or
misappropriation by a Third Party of the Intellectual Property rights relating
to the Centocor Technology (an "Infringement"), such party shall inform the
------------ 
other parties promptly of such Infringement and provide the other parties with
any available evidence of such Infringement or misappropriation. WELLCOME shall
have the right but not the obligation to prosecute at its own cost and expense
any claim of Infringement of the Intellectual Property rights relating to the
Centocor Technology. If WELLCOME does not commence action against an infringer
within ninety (90) days after learning of the Infringement, CENTOCOR or CBV may
commence action against the infringer. At the reasonable request of the party
filing suit, the other parties, at their own expense, will provide reasonable
assistance, including, without limitation, permitting the use of their
respective names in all

12

suits and signing all necessary documents if appropriate to the situation. Any

the remainder to be retained by the party bringing the action.

Proprietary Information made prior to the date hereof shall be governed by the
terms of this Section 10.16.
------------- 

10.16.3. Nothing in this Section 10.16 shall prevent any party
------------- 
hereto from disclosing its own information relating to its business, financial
affairs, products, research development, marketing and other commercial
activities to any Affiliate or any Third Party. In addition, notwithstanding
the restrictions in this Section 10.16 on confidentiality and use, any party

to any of its Affiliates which agrees to be bound by the terms of this Section
-------
10.16.
- ----- 

10.17. Continuing Obligation. Except as otherwise specifically provided

amendment or supplement by any party hereto will not become effective until
counterparts hereof have been executed by all the parties hereto.

10.20. Savings Clause. Any restriction or information provision (as each
-------------- 
of these terms or expressions are defined in the RTPA) contained in this
Agreement or in any arrangement of which this Agreement forms part by virtue of

not take effect in the United Kingdom until the day after the day on which full
particulars of this Agreement (and of any such arrangement) shall have been duly

---------- 
22

Affiliate or any Third Party. In addition, notwithstanding the restrictions in
this Section 8.16 on confidentiality and use, any party hereto may disclose

it is obligated to institute pursuant to the terms of a license agreement with a
Third Party pursuant to which a license to such Intellectual Property has been
granted.

8.19. Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendment or supplement hereto

party hereto will not become effective until counterparts hereof have been
executed by all the parties hereto.
