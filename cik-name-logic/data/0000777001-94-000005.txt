THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC.
REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS;
ANNOUNCES NEW CHIEF ECONOMIST, WAYNE ANGELL

New York, New York - April 11, 1994 - The Bear Stearns Companies
Inc. (NYSE;BSC) today announced earnings for the company's third
fiscal quarter ended March 25, 1994.

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 1994 was $115.5
million, or 93 cents per share, a 5% increase in net income from
$110.4 million, or 92 cents per share for the comparable quarter
last year. Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 1994 was
$354.6 million, or $2.79 per share, a 49% increase in net income
from $237.7 million, or $1.99 per share for the comparable period
a year ago.

The company's annualized pre-tax return on equity for the
first nine months of fiscal 1994 was 50.3%.

Chief Executive Officer and President, James E. Cayne, stated
"We are gratified by the results for the third quarter. We
continue to believe in the strength and stability of the Bear
Stearns franchise. Recent announcements of senior hirings are a
reflection of that strength.

While the fourth quarter is only two weeks old, both the
equity and fixed income markets have been subject to extreme
volatility. Bear Stearns has been impacted by these conditions
resulting in moderate mark-to-market losses. This is not the first
time we have suffered losses and it will not be the last. We will
continue our efforts to use our capital to sustain the highest
return on equity and the highest profit margin in the industry."

Revenues, net of interest expense, for the quarter ended March
25, 1994 were $653.6 million, a 15% increase from $570.5 million
for the comparable quarter last year. For the nine months ended
March 25, 1994, revenues, net of interest expense, were $2.0
billion, a 36% increase from $1.5 billion a year ago.

Separately, Bear Stearns announced today that Wayne D. Angell
has joined the firm as Chief Economist and Senior Managing
Director. Mr. Angell is one of the country's most respected
economists having just completed an eight-year term as a member of
the Federal Reserve Board. At the Federal Reserve he served as
Chair of the Board's Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Activities
and as Chair of the G-10 Committee on Payment and Settlement
Systems.

Commenting on the new hire, James E. Cayne, said, "We are
thrilled that Wayne has decided to join Bear Stearns as Chief
Economist and Senior Managing Director. His combined experiences
at the Federal Reserve; in politics as a State Legislator; and in
education as Chairman of the Economics Department and Dean of
Ottawa University, have given him the stature that very few others
command."

In 1956 Mr. Angell began an extended career at Ottawa
University as an assistant professor in the Economics Department. 
He was promoted to full professor and subsequently named Department
Chairman, Division Chairman and finally Dean of the College. From
1956 to 1985 and while at Ottawa University, he completed two terms
as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and served
as a bank officer and director of the Peoples' National Bank of
Ottawa, KS, Hume Bank, Council Grove National Bank, First Bank and
the Investment Committee of Franklin Savings Association. In 1960
he was elected to the Kansas State House of Representatives to
which he was reelected twice, in 1962 and 1964. During his term,
he chaired the Water Resources Committee and the Economic
Development Committee.

Mr. Angell received a BA from Ottawa University in 1952 and an
MA in Economics, Phi Beta Kappa, from the University of Kansas in
1953. He holds a PhD in Economics from the University of Kansas.

Mr. Angell is the recipient of numerous honors and awards,
including Who's Who in America, honorary Doctor of Humane Letters
from Ottawa University, Distinguished Kansan of the Year of the
Native Sons and Daughters and Distinguished Service Award from the
Alumni Association of Ottawa University.
