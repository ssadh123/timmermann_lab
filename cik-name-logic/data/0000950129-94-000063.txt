Enron Oil & Gas Company
1400 Smith Street
Houston, Texas 77002

Gentlemen:

Pursuant to your request, we have prepared estimates, as of
January 1, 1994, of the proved oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and
natural gas reserves of certain selected properties in the United States and
Canada owned by Enron Oil & Gas Company, hereinafter referred to as "Enron."
The properties consist of working interests located in the states of New
Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming and in the offshore waters of Texas in the
United States and in the province of Saskatchewan in Canada. Our estimates are
reported in detail in our "Report as of January 1, 1994 on Proved Reserves of
Certain Properties in the United States owned by Enron Oil & Gas Company --
Selected Properties" and our "Report as of January 1, 1994 on Proved Reserves
of Certain Properties in Canada owned by Enron Oil & Gas Company -- Selected
Properties." We also have reviewed data provided to us by Enron that it
represents to be Enron's estimates of the reserves, as of January 1, 1994, for
the same properties as those included in our aforementioned reports.

Proved reserves estimated by us and referred to herein are
judged to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs
under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation of
current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and
equipment. Proved reserves are defined as those that have been proved to a
high degree of certainty by reason of actual completion, successful testing, or
in certain cases by adequate core analyses and electrical-log interpretation
when the producing characteristics of the formation are known from nearby
fields. These reserves are defined areally by reasonable geological
interpretation of structure and known continuity of oil- or gas-saturated
material. This definition is in agreement with the definition of proved
reserves prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Enron represents that its estimates of the proved reserves, as
of January 1, 1994, net to its leasehold interests in the properties included
in our report are as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
OIL, CONDENSATE, AND
NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS NATURAL GAS NET EQUIVALENT
(THOUSAND BARRELS) (MILLION CUBIC FEET) MILLION CUBIC FEET
- -------------------- -------------------- ------------------
<S> <C> <C>
6,737 1,216,700 1,257,122
</TABLE>

Note: Net equivalent million cubic feet is based on 1 barrel of oil,
condensate, or natural gas liquids being equivalent to 6,000 cubic feet of gas.

Enron has advised us, and we have assumed, that its estimates
of proved oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas reserves are in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Proved reserves estimated by us for the properties included in
our reports, as of January 1, 1994, are as follows:

<TABLE>

OIL, CONDENSATE, AND
NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS NATURAL GAS NET EQUIVALENT

- --------------------- -------------------- ------------------ 
<S> <C> <C>
6,533 1,191,431 1,230,629
</TABLE>

Note: Net equivalent million cubic feet is based on 1 barrel of oil,
condensate, or natural gas liquids being equivalent to 6,000 cubic feet of
gas.

In making a comparison of the detailed estimates prepared by
us and by Enron of the properties involved, we have found differences, both
positive and negative, in reserve estimates for individual fields. These 
differences appear to be compensating to a great extent when considering the 
reserves of Enron in the properties included in our reports, resulting in 
overall differences not being substantial. It is our opinion that the reserve 
estimates prepared by Enron on the 

<PAGE> 3

properties reviewed by us and referred to above, when compared on a net-
equivalent-cubic-feet-of-gas basis, do not differ materially from those 
prepared by us.

Submitted,

DeGOLYER and MacNAUGHTON
