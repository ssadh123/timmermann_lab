Item 5. Other Events.

On February 22, 1994, American Financial Corporation
("AFC") announced that it is offering to issue $550 million
principal amount of 9-1/2% Debentures Due April 20, 2004 in
exchange for all of its outstanding debentures. There is an
aggregate of approximately $550 million principal amount of AFC's
debentures presently outstanding. See the attached News Release.
In its offering materials, AFC stated that while fourth quarter
results are not yet available, AFC anticipates that it will
report substantial earnings for that period.

On February 10, 1994, Penn Central announced that it
is considering a proposal from AFC that Penn Central purchase the
personal lines insurance businesses owned by AFC's wholly-owned
subsidiary, Great American Insurance Company ("GAI"). See the
attached News Release. If a transaction involving the personal
lines business is accomplished, it may be changed from the
transaction proposed with respect to the nature of the
transaction, price, and form of consideration paid.

A Penn Central shareholder has filed a purported
derivative action against AFC and the Penn Central board of
directors in state court in Cincinnati, Ohio. The action alleges
that the proposal from AFC, if consummated, would constitute a
waste of Penn Central's assets and seeks to enjoin the
transaction or damages if it is consummated. AFC believes that
the lawsuit is without merit.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FEBRUARY 10, 1994

PENN CENTRAL CONSIDERING ACQUISITION
OF PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE BUSINESSES

CINCINNATI, OHIO February 10, 1994 -- The Penn Central
Corporation announced that it is considering a proposal from
American Financial Corporation (AFC) for the purchase by Penn
Central of the personal lines insurance businesses owned by Great
American Insurance Company (GAI) for a proposed purchase price of
approximately $380 million in cash. GAI is a wholly owned
subsidiary of AFC.

GAI's personal lines businesses reported net earned premiums
of $342 million in 1993 and $322 million in 1992. Approximately
70% of these premiums came from standard private passenger
automobile insurance, 25% from multiperil homeowners' insurance
and 5% from other lines. GAI has advised PCC that separate
income statements for the personal lines businesses are not
available because these lines have been included with GAI's other
insurance lines for financial reporting purposes. However, GAI
estimates that on a stand-alone basis the personal lines
businesses had pro forma accident year statutory combined ratios
of 99.0% in 1993 and 99.1% in 1992. AFC's proposal for the sale
of the personal lines businesses to PCC would include the
transfer by GAI of an investment portfolio of securities with a
market value of approximately $450 million, consisting
principally of investment grade bonds. GAI estimates that the
GAAP net book value of the businesses that would be transferred
at closing would be approximately $200 million.

The Penn Central board of directors has at this stage
concluded that the proposed acquisition merits serious
consideration, in part because it could further Penn Central's
strategy of achieving higher returns by investing its substantial
cash resources in profitable property and casualty insurance
businesses. The board also noted that the proposed acquisition
is potentially attractive in that it could provide Penn Central
with the opportunity to become a full-service provider of private
passenger automobile insurance on a nation wide basis that can
take advantage of Penn Central's existing auto insurance
management and underwriting skills.

The Penn Central board has appointed a special committee of
its outside directors to review the proposal. The special
committee is empowered to negotiate all aspects of the proposed
transaction, including the purchase price proposed by AFC.
Completion of a transaction would be subject to certain
conditions, including approval by the special committee, receipt
by Penn

Central of an appropriate fairness opinion from an investment
banking firm and any required regulatory approvals.

AFC owns 40.5% of Penn Central's common shares and AFC's
principal shareholder, Carl H. Lindner, is Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Penn Central.

Penn Central is engaged primarily in specialty property and
casualty insurance.
