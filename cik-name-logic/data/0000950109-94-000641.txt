Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
------------------------------------

On March 16, 1994, CoreStates Financial Corp (the "Corporation") acquired
all of the outstanding shares of Constellation Bancorp ("Constellation"). The 
acquisition was effected through a merger of Constellation with and into the 
Corporation (the "Merger") in accordance with (i) an Amended and Restated 
Agreement and Plan of Merger between the Corporation and Constellation dated as
of August 2, 1993 (the "Agreement"). The Agreement is attached as Appendix I 
to Constellation's Proxy Statement, dated February 11, 1994 (the "Proxy 
Statement"), which is Exhibit 2.1 hereto. The Articles of Merger dated March 
16, 1994 are Exhibit 2.2 hereto. The statements herein are qualified in their 
entirety by Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, which are incorporated herein by reference.

In the Merger, shareholders of Constellation received 0.4137 share of 
common stock of the Corporation, par value $1.00 per share ("Corporation 
Common Shares"), for each outstanding share of common stock of Constellation, 
no par value per share ("Constellation Common Shares"). A total of 11,288,051 
Corporation Common Shares were issued in the Merger. In addition, each option 
to purchase Constellation Common Shares outstanding under Constellation's 
stock option plans was converted into an option to purchase the number of 
Corporation Common Shares equal to the number of Constellation Common Shares 
subject to such option multiplied by a formula to reflect the exchange ratio 
for the Merger. The Merger is being treated for accounting purposes as a 
pooling of interests.

Constellation, a bank holding company, was engaged through Constellation 
Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries in providing commercial banking services, 
consumer banking services, financial and corporate services, trust services, 
mortgage origination service, mortgage administration services and equipment 
leasing services. The Corporation intends to continue such uses for the assets
of Constellation.
