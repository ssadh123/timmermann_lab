Item 5. Other Events. 

The Issuer announced today that in an effort to restructure its 
securities portfolio it expects its principal subsidiary Central 
Fidelity National Bank to recognize security losses of approximately $30 
million pre-tax in the fourth quarter of 1994. The losses will result 
from the anticipated sale of approximately $500 million of fixed rate 
investment securities having an average yield of 6.06% and an average 
maturity of 4 years. 

Since the beginning of this year, the Federal Reserve has increased the 
federal funds rate six times for a total of 2.50%. Accordingly, this 
action is being taken to further reduce the Issuer's exposure to 
continued increases in interest rates to levels higher than previously 
anticipated. 

The proceeds of the securities sale will be used to reduce short-term 
borrowings by $100 million and to reinvest the balance in adjustable 
rate investment securities. The net result of these transactions will be 
to reduce 1994 consolidated earnings per share by approximately $.50. It 
is anticipated that these measures should have a positive effect on the 
Issuer's earnings in 1995. 

This action will reduce the Issuer's cumulative 1-year liability 
sensitivity position to approximately 11% of earning assets at year-end. 
Scheduled maturities of remaining securities will further reduce the 
nterest sensitive gap to approximately 6% of earning assets by year end 
1995.

CENTRAL FIDELITY REPORTS 
SECURITIES PORTFOLIO RESTRUCTURING 

November 30, 1994 

Central Fidelity Banks, Inc. (NASDAQ-CFBS) announced today that in an 
effort to restructure its securities portfolio it expects to recognize 
security losses of approximately $30 million pre-tax in the fourth
quarter of 1994. The losses will result from the anticipated sale of
approximately $500 million of fixed rate investment securities having 
an average yield of 6.06% and an average maturity of 4 years. 

Since the beginning of this year, the Federal Reserve has increased 
the federal funds rate six times for a total of 2.50%. Accordingly, 
this action is being taken to further reduce the Company's exposure 
to continued increases in interest rates to levels higher than 
previously anticipated. 

The proceeds of the securities sale will be used to reduce short-term 
borrowings by $100 million and to reinvest the balance in adjustable 
rate investment securities. The net result of these transactions 
will be to reduce 1994 earnings per share by approximately $.50. 
It is anticipated that these measures should have a positive effect 
on the Company's earnings in 1995. 

This action will reduce the Company's cumulative 1-year liability 
sensitivity position to approximately 11% of earning assets at 
year-end. Scheduled maturities of remaining securities will further 
reduce the interest sensitive gap to approximately 6% of earning 
assets by year end 1995. 

Lewis N. Miller, Jr., Chief Executive Officer stated, "These actions 
are prudent in consideration of the interest rate environment we 
have experienced this year and are consistent with Central 
Fidelity's emphasis upon the quality of our balance sheet and 
earnings capacity." 

Central Fidelity Banks, Inc. is a Richmond, Virginia based bank 
holding company with 230 branch offices throughout the state.
