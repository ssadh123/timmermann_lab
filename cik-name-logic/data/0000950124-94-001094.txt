Item 2 Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On May 26, 1994, IDEX Corporation ("IDEX"), through its newly formed
subsidiary HPI Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware Corporation, purchased all 
of the outstanding shares of common stock of Hale Products, Inc. ("Hale"), a
Delaware Corporation, for approximately $90 million (includes the refinancing
of certain indebtedness). The purchase price was arrived at through
arms-length negotiations between IDEX and the stockholders of Hale. The
acquisition was financed through borrowings under IDEX's existing bank
revolving credit facility with Continental Bank N.A., as agent for the
participating banks, as amended and restated as of May 23, 1994.

Item 7 Financial Statements and Pro Forma 
Financial Information

It is impracticable, at this time, to provide the required financial
statements and pro forma financial information for Hale. Therefore, the
required financial statements and pro forma financial information has not been
included in this Form 8-K report. The required financial statements and pro
forma financial information will be filed under cover of an amendment to the
Form 8-K within 60 days.
