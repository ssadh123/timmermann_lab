FIRSTFED REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER 
OF 1994

FirstFed Financial Corp., holding company for First Federal Bank of
California, today announced a net loss of $25.6 million or $2.42 per
share of common stock for the second quarter of 1994. For the second 
quarter of 1993, the Company reported net earnings of $8.3 million or 
$0.78 per share. For the first quarter of 1994, the Company recorded 
a net loss of $6.1 million or $0.58 per share. 

For the first six months of 1994 the Company recorded a net loss of 
$31.7 million or $3.01 per share compared to a net loss of $8.1 million
or $0.77 per share for the first six months of 1993. Second quarter
results and results for the first six months of the year reflect losses
resulting from the January 17, 1994 earthquake and the recession in
Southern California.

As indicated in a press release dated June 20, 1994, the Company
recorded a $55.0 million provision for loan losses for the second
quarter, $23.1 million of which was for estimated losses resulting
from the earthquake and $31.9 million was for estimated losses
stemming from the weak Southern California economy and real estate
market. When combined with the $24.7 million provision recorded
during the first quarter of 1994, total loss provisions for the first 
six months of 1994 reached $79.7 million.

The Bank recorded a total provision of $30.6 million for earthquake-
related losses during the first six months of the year. Based on 
current information available, management believes that the loan loss
provisions recorded to date fully reflect the extent to which collateral
supporting the Bank's loan portfolio and real estate owned by the Bank 
was affected by the earthquake. Charge-offs related to earthquake-damaged 
properties totaled $11.8 million for the first six months of the year.

As of June 30, 1994, the Bank's general valuation allowance was $77.0 
million or 2.62% of the Bank's portfolio of loans and real estate owned. 
This compares to $41.1 million or 1.43% at March 31, 1994 and $44.3 
million, or 1.60%, at June 30, 1993. Additionally, the Bank has 
valuation allowances, recorded as a liability, for loans which it has

<PAGE> 

sold with recourse. As of June 30, 1994, these allowances totaled
$6.3 million, or 2.13% of the loans sold with recourse. This compares
to $5.8 million, or 1.89% at March 31, 1994 and $8.2 million, or 2.23%
at June 30, 1993.

Total loan charge-offs, including those for earthquake damage, were
$18.6 million for the second quarter of 1994 compared to $8.8 million
for the second quarter of last year. Loan charge-offs for the first 
quarter of 1994 were $24.7 million. Total loan charge-offs for the first
six months of 1994 were $43.3 million, compared with $21.2 million
for 1993. Multi-family loans in particular have been affected by the
Southern California economy. The current economic recession has
adversely affected multi-family properties due to lower rental income,
higher vacancy rates and lower rates of real estate appreciation and
sales.

Non-performing assets were $113.1 million or 3.03% of total assets at
June 30, 1994, down from $118.2 million or 3.23% of total assets at
December 31, 1993 and $149.6 million or 4.14% of total assets at
June 30, 1993. The decrease in non-performing assets during the
first six months of 1994 is attributable to specific reserves 
established for non-performing loans and continuing sales of real estate 
acquired by foreclosure.

As of June 30, 1994, the Bank had an additional $84.0 million in loans
on which the principal and interest payments had been temporarily
modified. Typically these modifications are for six to twelve months
and reduce the borrowers' payments to no less than the monthly interest 
payment required under the note. The Bank had established loan loss 
allowances of $6.1 million for these loans. Less than 5% of these 
modified loans were 90 days or more delinquent as of June 30, 1994.

The Bank implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 
114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," ("SFAS No. 
114") as of January 1, 1994. As of June 30, 1994, the Bank had $149.0 
million of loans which were considered impaired, net of $31.1 million 
in loan loss allowances related to such loans. This compares to $119.2 
million of loans, net of allowances of $24.4 million as of March 31, 
1994. Of the $149.0 million, $55.9 million are included in the modified 
loans noted above.

Management continues to focus on the disposition of foreclosed real
estate. Sales of foreclosed real estate totaled $34.2 million and $53.0
million for the second quarter and first six months of 1994,
respectively, compared to $26.7 million and $37.6 million for the
second quarter and first six months of 1993.

Net interest income, the Company's primary source of core earnings,
was $19.8 million for the second quarter of 1994 compared to $23.6
million for the first quarter of 1994 and $23.6 million for the second
quarter of 1993. The dollar amount of net interest income during the
second quarter of 1994 dropped due to decreased interest margins
resulting from four interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve
Board thus far in 1994. During periods of increasing interest rates,
the Bank's cost of funds increases more rapidly than the yield on the
adjustable rate loan portfolio. Correspondingly, the Bank's interest
margin decreased to 2.05% for the second quarter of 1994 from 2.43% for 
the first quarter of 1994. 

The Bank also increased its long-term liabilities, which are more
costly and which contributed to the decrease in interest margin. Long-
term liabilities are used to help offset the impact of future increases 
in interest rates and the effect from the "lagging" nature of the index
upon which substantially all of the Bank's loans are based. The effect
of these longer term liabilities can be seen in the Bank's one-year gap, 
expressed as a percentage of total assets, which has increased to a 
positive 15.89% at June 30, 1994 from 11.50% at the same time last year. 

Loan originations for the second quarter of 1994 increased to $197.0
million compared to $154.7 million for the first quarter of 1994. The
increase in loan originations during the second quarter of 1994
reflects the strong demand for adjustable rate mortgages which are
an area of primary focus for the Bank. The Bank's portfolio of
adjustable rate mortgages comprised 98.9% of its total loans
outstanding as of June 30, 1994.

Expense control remained a priority for the Bank during the second
quarter. The ratio of non-interest expense to total average assets for
the second quarter of 1994 was 1.26%, comparable to 1.27% for the
second quarter of 1993. On a year-to-date- basis, the expense ratio
was 1.29% for both the first six months of 1994 and 1993.

The Bank continues to exceed all minimum regulatory capital
requirements at the end of the second quarter of 1994. The most
stringent requirement, a risk-based capital ratio of 8% of risk-weighted
assets, was exceeded by the Bank, which had a risk-based capital ratio 
of 8.71% of total risk-weighted assets at the end of the quarter. The 
tangible and core capital ratios each were 4. 57% at the end of the 
quarter.

William S. Mortensen, Chairman and CEO of FirstFed commented, "We have 
built strong reserves to deal with both the continuing effects of the 
economic recession and the recent earthquake in Southern California. 
Management remains committed to Southern California and has positioned 

3

the Bank for growth as the economy recovers by building strong core 
earnings, maintaining a low expense ratio and emphasizing the origination 
of adjustable rate mortgages."

As announced on July 20, 1994, FirstFed has filed a registration
statement for the issuance of $50 million in 10-year notes. The
registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission but has not yet become
effective. The securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be
accepted prior to the time the Registration Statement becomes
effective. This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or
solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these
securities in any State in which such offer, solicitation or sale would
be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities
laws of any such state. A written prospectus meeting the requirements 
of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933 will be available in the 
future from Goldman, Sachs & Co., 85 Broad Street, New York, New 
York 10004.
