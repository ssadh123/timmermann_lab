Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

On October 6, 1994, the Registrant, upon the recommendation
of the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors, dismissed Deloitte &
Touche and appointed Coopers & Lybrand as the Registrant's certifying
accountant.

During the two fiscal years ended June 24, 1994 and
June 25, 1993, and during the interim period from June 24, 1994,
through October 6, 1994, the Registrant had no disagreements with
Deloitte & Touche on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure. 
Further, during the two fiscal years ended June 24, 1994 and June 25,
1993, and during the interim period from June 25, 1994, through
October 6, 1994, neither the Registrant nor anyone on the Registrant's
behalf consulted Coopers & Lybrand regarding either the application of
accounting principles to a specified transaction or the type of audit
opinion that might be rendered on the Registrant's financial
statements.
