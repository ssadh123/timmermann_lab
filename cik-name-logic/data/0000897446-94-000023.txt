Item 5 - Other Events

On March 10, 1994, Maryland Cable Corp. ("Maryland Cable") and
Maryland Cable Holdings Corp. ("Holdings") filed a Consolidated
Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization ("Prepackaged Plan") under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy
Court - Southern District of New York.

As previously reported, Maryland Cable has been attempting to
restructure both its Senior Bank Debt (which became due and
payable on December 31, 1993) and its Senior Subordinated
Discount Notes. Maryland Cable is currently in default under its
bank credit agreement by virtue of its failure to pay the
principal amount of the Senior Bank Debt ($85 million) when due. 
As a result of this default, there is also a default under the
Senior Subordinated Discount Notes.

In an effort to protect the Registrant's interest in Maryland
Cable, the Registrant entered into an Exchange Agreement, dated
as of December 31, 1993, with Maryland Cable and the holders of
approximately 92% of Maryland Cable's Senior Subordinated
Discount Notes. The Exchange Agreement provides that, subject to
the approvals and conditions described below, the Registrant will
receive approximately $9,500,000 in exchange for all of its
economic interest and investment in Maryland Cable, and will be
paid a management fee for managing Maryland Cable's cable systems
from January 1, 1994, to the date of the closing of the
transaction.

Closing of the Exchange Agreement transaction is subject to the
receipt of approvals from the holders of at least 99% of the
principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Discount Notes (and
of each holder of $100,000 of such Notes), the holders of the
Senior Bank Debt, the various franchising authorities, and the
Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC"), and is subject to
numerous other closing conditions.

As of March 10, 1994, the requisite approvals from the holders of
the Senior Subordinated Discount Notes and the Senior Bank Debt
had not been received. As a result, as provided in the Exchange
Agreement, Maryland Cable filed a voluntary petition for relief
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. This
filing included the Prepackaged Plan, to which the requisite
majority of all impaired creditors other than the holders of the
Senior Debt had consented. Under the Prepackaged Plan, the
Registrant would receive the same aggregate consideration as it
would receive under the terms of the Exchange Agreement.

There is no assurance that the Prepackaged Plan as filed will be
approved or that the proposed restructuring described in the
Prepackaged Plan will be consummated.

A copy of the Prepackaged Plan is attached as an Exhibit to this
Report.

Holdings, (ii) Maryland Cable, NewCo, and Holdings shall be
deemed to have granted general releases in favor of ML

the Discount Note Holders shall be deemed to have granted a
general release in favor of ML Opportunity, except that the

action under the existing partnership agreement of ML
Opportunity, and (iv) ML Opportunity shall be deemed to have
granted a general release in favor of each of the Discount Note
Holders.
6.10 Indemnification. 
(a) NewCo shall use reasonable efforts to obtain
from the parties to any agreements to which ML Opportunity is
the obligor for the benefit of Maryland Cable, either
(i) terminations of those agreements or (ii) assignments of

Opportunity as an obligor for the benefit of Maryland Cable
under such agreements (except that neither of the Debtors shall
be obligated to reject the agreements under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code if by utilizing said section, a Claim would
arise). If NewCo is unable to obtain such terminations, or
assignments and releases, from on and after the Effective Date
NewCo shall indemnify and hold harmless ML Opportunity from any
loss, liability, damage or expense (including, but not limited
to, reasonable attorneys' fees) whether arising before or after
the Effective Date resulting from the incurrence of obligations
under any such agreements to the extent such obligations were
incurred for the benefit of Maryland Cable. These agreements
relate to certain programming agreements and other agreements

of Maryland Cable.
(b) NewCo shall indemnify and hold harmless any
Person who is an officer or director of any or both of ML
Opportunity or the Debtors from any loss, liability, damage, or
expense (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys'
fees) resulting from any tax liabilities of any or both of the
Debtors for which ML Opportunity and/or the officer or director
of any or both of the Debtors could otherwise be liable and for
which the officer or director would have been entitled to
indemnification under the certificate of incorporation of
Maryland Cable or Holdings, or applicable law, provided,
however, that NewCo is given prompt notice of any claims for
taxes and the opportunity to contest such assertions and control
resolutions of any proceedings with respect thereto.

(a) each Discount Note Holder shall deliver to

Cable shall have filed or shall file with the Federal
Communications Commission and with any municipal or county
authorities that have issued the franchises for the cable
television system of Maryland Cable from which consent to the
transactions contemplated by this Plan must be obtained an
application or applications requesting consent to such
transactions. Maryland Cable shall also apply for extensions or
renewals of each of the franchises for the system, or for new
franchises for the system, as reasonably requested by NewCo. 
Maryland Cable, NewCo and all parties receiving distributions
under this Plan shall, with due diligence, take all reasonable
steps necessary to expedite the processing of such application
or applications and to secure the consents or approvals being
sought. All costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel) in connection with the preparation
and processing of any such applications shall be borne
exclusively by Maryland Cable.
6.13 Hart-Scott-Rodino Filings. The Debtors shall
have made or shall make any filings required to comply with the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and shall with due
diligence take all reasonable steps to expedite the processing
of such filings. To the extent necessary, holders of Claims and
Equity Interests shall cooperate with the Debtors in preparing
the filings and shall provide any information requested in
connection therewith.
6.14 Conduct of Business. Between the Filing Date and
the Effective Date, Maryland Cable shall operate its business in
the ordinary course consistent with prior practices taking into
consideration the occurrence of the Filing Date and its impact
thereon, except as contemplated by the Plan and except for
changes required by or resulting from The Cable Television
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, the Bankruptcy
Code or Bankruptcy Rules.
6.15 Employees.
(a) Employment and Severance. As of the
Effective Date, NewCo shall offer employment to each Person
employed by Maryland Cable immediately prior to the Effective
Date. Any employee of Maryland Cable who is employed by NewCo
shall be employed on substantially the same terms and conditions
of employment and with employee benefits substantially similar
to those provided to such employees by Maryland Cable
immediately prior to the Effective Date. NewCo shall give each
of the employees of Maryland Cable that it employs past service
credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting under all
employee benefit plans and payroll practices for employees of
NewCo established by NewCo on or after the Effective Date. In
accordance with Maryland Cable's policies in effect on December
31, 1993, which are described on schedule 10.9 to the Exchange
Agreement (the "Policies"), NewCo shall pay severance and
accrued vacation to any employee of Maryland Cable entitled to
severance under the Policies that (i) NewCo terminates within 90
days after the Effective Date, or (ii) NewCo offers to employ
but who denies employment with NewCo.
(b) Spinoff of Multivision 401(k) Plan.
(1) The employees of Maryland Cable
participate in the MultiVision Cable TV Corp. 401(k) Plan (the
"401(k) Plan"). Effective as of the Effective Date NewCo shall
establish a plan intended to qualify under section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and a
trust maintained thereunder intended to be exempt from federal
income taxation under Section 501 of the Code ("NewCo's Plan")
for the benefit of employees of Maryland Cable who become
employees of NewCo on the Effective Date ("Covered Employees"). 
Within 120 days after the Effective Date (or as soon as
practicable thereafter) MultiVision shall cause the trustee of
the 401(k) Plan to transfer to the funding agent of NewCo's
Plan, for the benefit of Covered Employees, an amount, in Cash,
equal to the total account balances (whether or not vested),
including actual investment earnings through the date of
transfer, held under the 401(k) Plan for the Covered Employees,
except for any amounts as to which withdrawal requests have been
duly submitted prior to such transfer and which shall be paid by
the 401(k) Plan to Covered Employees prior to such transfer in
accordance with ERISA and the Code and the terms of the 401(k)
Plan (the "Transferred Assets"). The Transferred Assets shall
not in any event be less than the amount required under Section
414(1) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
(2) With respect to the transfer of the
Transferred Assets to NewCo's Plan as contemplated herein, ML
Opportunity and NewCo shall notify the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS"), no later than 90 days following the Effective Date (or
as soon practicable thereafter), pursuant to Section 6058(b) of
the Code, of the contemplated transfer (and shall notify any
other agency of the United States government entitled by law to
such notice) and shall provide such further information or
documents as the IRS (or other agency) may require. ML
Opportunity and NewCo shall use reasonable efforts to obtain any
necessary IRS (or other agency) approval without material
modification of the transactions contemplated hereby.
(3) NewCo's Plan shall provide, as of the
date of such transfer, benefits for each Covered Employee which
are not less than such Covered Employee's respective account
balances (including any net earnings or losses accrued thereon
from the Effective Date to the actual date of transfer) under
the 401(k) Plan as of the date of such transfer. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Date, NewCo agrees to take
all actions necessary to obtain a favorable determination letter
from the IRS with respect to NewCo's Plan. NewCo shall
indemnify and hold harmless the 401(k) Plan, ML Opportunity, ML
Media Partners, L.P., Multivision and other affiliates of
Multivision and each of their trustees and fiduciaries from and
against any losses, liabilities, claims, damages, costs and
expenses relating to (i) the failure by NewCo to obtain such
favorable determination letter, and (ii) any liability or
obligation arising in connection with the transferred accounts
of the Covered Employees in NewCo's Plan.
(4) Pending the transfer of the Transferred
Assets, the accounts of the Covered Employees shall remain in
the trust fund for the 401(k) Plan and ML Opportunity shall
cause the trustee of the 401(k) Plan to pay any current benefits
from the 401(k) Plan or make any distributions to Covered
Employees as they become due. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this section 6.15, on and after the Effective Date,
NewCo shall make all payments required by the employer of the
Covered Employees and all administrative fees relative to the
401(k) Plan.
(5) ML Opportunity and NewCo shall provide
each other with such records and information as they may
reasonably request relating to their respective obligations
under this section or the administration of the 401(k) Plan or
NewCo's Plan.
(c) Medical Benefits. Maryland Cable
participates with MultiVision and ML Media Partners, L.P. in the
MultiVision medical plan, which plan is to a large extent self-
insured. NewCo shall provide all Covered Employees (and their
dependents) with medical benefit coverage under plan(s)
maintained or established by NewCo. As to any Covered Employee
(or a dependent thereof) who was covered by MultiVision's
medical plan as of the Effective Date, NewCo shall waive any
pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods contained
in NewCo's medical plan (except to the extent that such
exclusions would have then applied or waiting periods were not
satisfied under MultiVision's medical plan) and credit or
otherwise consider any monies paid (or accrued) under
MultiVision's medical plan by Covered Employees (or their
dependents) prior to the Effective Date toward any deductibles,
co-pays or other maximums under NewCo's medical plan for the
first plan year after the Effective Date. NewCo shall be
responsible for satisfying its and any of Maryland Cable's, ML
Media Partners, L.P.'s or MultiVision's obligations under
Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code to
provide continuation coverage ("COBRA") to any Covered Employee
or any former employee of Maryland Cable entitled to receive
COBRA coverage on or prior to the Effective Date, in accordance
with law. On and after the Effective Date, NewCo shall be
responsible for, and shall indemnify and shall hold each other
participant in the MultiVision medical plan harmless from and
against, NewCo's pro rata share (based upon the relative number
of participants in the MultiVision medical plan in a manner
consistent with the practice of MultiVision for calendar year
1993) of claims incurred under the MultiVision medical plan
relating to the period prior to the Effective Date to the extent
funds provided by Maryland Cable to such plan before the
Effective Date are not sufficient to satisfy such pro rata share
of such claims. NewCo's responsibility for claims incurred
under the MultiVision medical plan extends to its pro rata share
(based upon the relative number of participants in the
MultiVision medical plan in a manner consistent with the
practice of MultiVision for calendar year 1993) of claims
incurred by persons other than Maryland Cable employees who
participated in the MultiVision medical plan prior to the
Effective Date. Each other participant in the MultiVision
medical plan shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and
shall hold NewCo harmless from and against, such participant's
pro rata share (based upon the relative number of participants
in the MultiVision medical plan in a manner consistent with the
practice of MultiVision for calendar year 1993) of all claims
incurred under the MultiVision medical plan.
6.16 Disbursement of Funds and Delivery of Partnership
Interests. NewCo, or such Person designated by NewCo and
approved by the Bankruptcy Court, shall, on the Effective Date
or as soon thereafter as is practicable, (i) make the Cash
payments; (ii) make the Pro Rata distributions of the Discount
Note Holders' Designation to the holders of Allowed Claims in
Class 4; (iii) issue the Replacement Notes on a pro rata basis
to the Holders of Allowed Claims in Class 2A, in accordance with
and to the extent provided for in the Plan; and (iv) issue the
Preferred Limited Partnership Interests on a pro rata basis to
the subscribers pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. 
Distributions of Cash and Limited Partnership Interests pursuant
to this Plan shall be effectuated when NewCo or its designee
receives all applicable documentation requested of holders of
Allowed Claims and Equity Interests pursuant to this Plan and
the Confirmation Order.
6.17 Reserve Provisions for Disputed Claims.
(a) Cash respecting Disputed Claims (other than
Disputed Claims in Class 4) pending on the Effective Date shall
not be distributed, but, if necessary, shall be deposited by the
Debtors in an interest bearing account on the Effective Date in
the full amount of all Disputed Claims; provided, however, that
if a holder of a Disputed Claim is not receiving a distribution
under this Plan and such Disputed Claim is not being discharged
by this Plan or is assumed by NewCo, the Debtors shall not be
required to reserve any Cash with respect thereto.

(b) For the purposes of effectuating the
provisions of this section 6.17 and the distributions to holders
of Allowed Claims, the Bankruptcy Court, on or prior to the
Effective Date or such date or dates thereafter as the
Bankruptcy Court shall set, may fix or liquidate the amount of
Disputed Claims pursuant to Section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy
Code, in which event the amounts so fixed or liquidated shall be
deemed the amounts of the Disputed Claims pursuant to section
502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code for purposes of distribution under
this Plan. In lieu of fixing or liquidating the amount of any
Disputed Claim, the Bankruptcy Court may determine the amount to
be reserved for such Disputed Claim, or such amount may be fixed
by agreement in writing by and between the Debtors and the
holder thereof.
(c) When a Disputed Claim becomes an Allowed
Claim, there shall be distributed to the holder of such Allowed
Claim, in accordance with the provisions of this Plan, Cash plus
any interest earned thereon from the Effective Date.
(d) No holder of a Disputed Claim shall have any
Claim against the Cash reserved with respect to such Claim until
such Disputed Claim shall become an Allowed Claim. In no event
shall any holder of any Disputed Claim be entitled to receive
(under the Plan or otherwise) from the Debtors or the Reserve
any Cash payment which is greater than the amount reserved for
such Claim pursuant to this section 6.17, plus any interest
earned thereon since the Effective Date. In no event shall the
Debtors or NewCo have any responsibility or liability for any
loss to or of any amount reserved under the Plan.
(e) To the extent a Disputed Claim ultimately
becomes an Allowed Claim in an amount less than the amount
reserved for such Disputed Claim, then the resulting surplus
shall be retained by NewCo.
(f) In the event that there is an outstanding
Disputed Claim of a Discount Note Holder subsequent to the
Effective Date which ultimately becomes an Allowed Claim, NewCo
shall issue a sufficient number of additional Limited
Partnership Interests and shares of common stock in the NewCo
General Partner such that the new interests and shares, together
with the existing interests and shares, shall be sufficient to
enable the holder of such subsequently Allowed Claim to receive
a Pro Rata portion of the Discount Note Holders' Designation.
6.18 Disputed Payments. In the event of any dispute
between and among Claimants and/or the holders of a Disputed
Claim as to the right of any Person to receive or retain any
payment or distribution to be made to such Person under the
Plan, NewCo may, in lieu of making such payment or distribution
to such Person, instead hold such payment or distribution until
the disposition thereof shall be determined by the Bankruptcy
Court.
6.19 Fractional Cents. Whenever any payment of a
fraction of a cent would otherwise be called for, the actual
payment shall reflect a rounding of such fraction to the nearest
whole cent (rounding down in the case of .50 or less and
rounding up in the case of more than .50).
6.20 Unclaimed Property. Any Person who fails to
claim any Cash or Limited Partnership Interest within one year
from the Effective Date or from such other date as a Claim
becomes an Allowed Claim shall forfeit all rights to any
distribution under the Plan and shall have no claim whatsoever
against the Debtors or NewCo or any holder of an Allowed Claim
to whom distributions are made.
6.21 Set-Offs. Nothing contained in this Plan shall
constitute a waiver or release by the Debtors of any right of
set-off the Debtors may have against any Claimant.
6.22 Withholding Taxes. The Debtors shall be entitled
to deduct any federal, state or local withholding taxes from any
payments made with respect to Allowed Claims, as appropriate.
6.23 Revesting. Except as otherwise provided by the
Plan, upon the Effective Date, title to all properties and
assets dealt with by the Plan shall pass to NewCo free and clear
of all Claims and interests, including liens or other encum-
brances, of creditors and of equity security holders and the
Confirmation Order shall be a judicial determination of
discharge of all of the Debtors' liabilities except as provided
in the Plan.
6.24 Discharge. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code or the Plan, the
distributions made pursuant to the Plan will be in full and
final satisfaction, settlement, release and discharge as against
the Debtors, of any debt that arose before the Confirmation Date
and any debt of a kind specified in Section 502(g), 502(h) or
502(i) of the Bankruptcy Code and all Claims and interests of
any nature, including, without limitation, any interest accrued
thereon from and after the Filing Date, whether or not (i) a
proof of Claim or interest based on such debt, obligation or
interest is filed or deemed filed under Section 501 of the Bank-
ruptcy Code, (ii) such Claim or interest is allowed under
Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code or (iii) the holder of such
Allowed Claim or interest has accepted the Plan. Therefore,
upon the Effective Date, all Claimants holding Claims against
the Debtors, including, without limitation, non-Debtor
affiliates of the Debtors, and holders of interests of the
Debtors shall be precluded from asserting against the Debtors,
or any of their assets or properties, any other or further
Claims or interests based upon any act or omission, transaction
or other activity of any kind or nature that occurred prior to
the Effective Date, and the Confirmation Order shall permanently
enjoin said Claimants and holders of Equity Interests, their
successors and assigns, from enforcing or seeking to enforce any
such Claims or Equity Interests.
6.25 Extinguishment of Liens. Except as otherwise
provided for in the Plan, upon full satisfaction of an Allowed
Secured Claim, all liens respecting such Claim shall be deemed
extinguished and of no further force and effect.

ARTICLE VII

SUBSTANTIVE CONSOLIDATION
7.1 Substantive Consolidation. Pursuant to the
Substantive Consolidation Order, on the Effective Date: (i) all
intercompany Claims and Equity Interests by, in and among the
Debtors and/or their non-Debtor affiliates will be eliminated;
(ii) except as otherwise provided in the Plan all assets and all
proceeds thereof and all liabilities of the Debtors will be
treated as though they were pooled; (iii) any obligation of any
Debtor and all guarantees thereof executed by, or joint
liability of, any of the Debtors will be deemed to be one
obligation of the consolidated Debtors; (iv) any Claims filed or
to be filed in connection with any such obligation guaranteed,
or joint liability, will be deemed one Claim against the
consolidated Debtors; (v) each and every Claim filed in the
individual case of any of the Debtors will be deemed filed
against the consolidated Debtors in the consolidated case; and
(vi) for purposes of determining the availability of the right
of set-off under Section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors
shall be treated as one entity so that, subject to the other
provisions of Section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code, debts due to
any of the Debtors may be set off against the debts of any of
the Debtors.
7.2 Extinguishment of Guarantees. On the
Confirmation Date, and in accordance with the terms of the Plan
and the Substantive Consolidation Order, all Claims based upon
guarantees of collection, payment or performance, or joint
liability of one or more Debtors, as to the obligations of any
other Debtor, shall be discharged, released and of no further
force and effect.

ARTICLE VIII

8.1 Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases. All
executory contracts (including, without limitation, partnership
agreements) and unexpired leases not expressly rejected or
disaffirmed prior to the Confirmation Date, or that are not at
the Confirmation Date the subject of pending actions to reject
and disaffirmed shall, as of the Effective Date, be deemed
assumed by the Debtors and assigned by the Debtors to NewCo
pursuant to Sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code. In
accordance with Section 1123(a)(5)(G) of the Bankruptcy Code, by
the Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, the
Debtors shall cure all defaults, if any, under any executory
contract or lease assumed pursuant to this section 8.1 by (i)
making a Cash payment of only those amounts set forth in proofs
of Claim or where no such Claim has been filed, as determined by
the Debtors, or (ii) on such terms as agreed to in writing
between the Debtors and such claimants, unless an objection is
filed with the Bankruptcy Court and served on counsel to the
Debtors on or prior to the date set by the Bankruptcy Court for
filing objections to Confirmation of this Plan and the Court
after notice and hearing determines that the Debtors are
obligated to pay a different amount as cure under Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code.
