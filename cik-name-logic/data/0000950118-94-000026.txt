Pioneer Financial and Signet To Merge

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

RICHMOND, VA - (February 17, 1994) - Signet Banking Corporation and Pioneer
Financial Corporation today jointly announced an agreement to merge. Pioneer is
the parent company of Pioneer Federal Savings Bank, a $400 million financial
institution located in Chester, Va. The transaction is expected to close in the
fall of 1994.

In a statement jointly issued by the two Virginia companies, George R.
Whittemore, Pioneer president, said, "We are delighted to have our organization
join Signet in a transaction that will benefit our shareholders, customers and
employees. Signet has extensive knowledge of the businesses and markets we

serve, and will nurture the community relationships we have formed over the
years."

"This transaction will establish Signet in Hopewell and Chase City, and will
enhance our existing network in Chester, Colonial Heights, Petersburg and
Richmond," added Robert M. Freeman, Signet chairman and chief executive officer.
"We look forward to giving our new customers in these markets expanded products
with the same level of personalized, quality service Pioneer has always
delivered."

According to the terms of the agreement, the transaction will be a tax-free
exchange of stock. Pioneer's shareholders will receive .6232 shares of Signet
common stock for each Pioneer share held subject to adjustment under certain
circumstances. Based on Signet's closing stock price of $38 as of February 16,
1994, the transaction has an aggregate value of approximately $60 million, or
$23.68 per share.

Freeman noted that the transaction will be non-dilutive, adding that Signet
plans to repurchase an equivalent number of shares in conjunction with the
merger.

All offices and banking services of Pioneer will operate as usual until the
merger is consummated in the fall. At that time Pioneer will convert to Signet,
and customers will be able to bank at any Signet office. After conversion, 10 of
Pioneer's 11 branches will remain open. The branch at Parham and Woodman will be
consolidated into a Signet branch less than a block away. Signet expects to
retain most of Pioneer's employees.

"Our intention is to make the transition as least disruptive as possible for
Pioneer's employees and its customers," Freeman said. Pioneer's board of
directors will be asked to join a Signet advisory board.

Signet Banking Corporation, with $11.8 billion in assets, serves commercial and
individual customers through 239 regional offices in Virginia, Maryland and the
District of Columbia.
