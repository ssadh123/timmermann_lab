Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On July 11, 1994, (the "Effective Date"), USBANCORP, INC.
("USBANCORP"), a Pennsylvania bank holding company, and Johnstown
Savings Bank ("JSB"), a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank,
consummated the merger contemplated by the Agreement dated as of
November 10, 1993, as amended January 18, 1994 and July 11, 1994,
between such parties (the "Agreement"). 

On the Effective Date, pursuant to the Agreement, USBANCORP
merged JSB with and into United States National Bank in Johnstown
("USNB"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of USBANCORP, with USNB
surviving the Merger ("Merger"). The separate existence of JSB
ceased, and all property, rights, powers, duties, obligations and
liabilities of JSB were automatically transferred to USNB, in
accordance with Federal and Pennsylvania law.

The Merger was treated as a purchase for financial
accounting purposes and, in accordance with Paragraph 93 of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, recorded as if
consummated at the close of business on June 30, 1994. The
recorded purchase price was based on the average of the closing
prices of USBANCORP Common Stock on the NASDAQ/NMS for the ten
trading days immediately preceding the Effective Date. The ten
day average of USBANCORP's Common Stock was $25.125, which
resulted in a final cost of the acquisition being $43.8 million,
to be paid by the issuance of 957,857 common shares and $19.7
million in cash. Accounting for the acquisition as a purchase,
USBANCORP has recognized newly created core deposit intangibles
of $5.7 million and goodwill of $19.2 million and will begin
realizing net income immediately from July 1, 1994.

The foregoing summary of the Merger is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Agreement and historical financial
statements of JSB which are incorporated herein by reference.

Item 5. Other Events.

On the Effective Date, the directors of USBANCORP duly
elected and holding office immediately prior to the Effective
Date remained as directors of USBANCORP and, in accordance with
the Agreement, James C. Dewar and James M. Edwards, Jr., each of
whom were directors of JSB immediately prior to the Effective
Date, were elected to USBANCORP's Board of Directors (to serve
until USBANCORP's 1995 and 1996 annual meeting of shareholders,
respectively).

Further, on the Effective Date, the directors of USNB duly
elected and holding office immediately prior to the Effective
Date remained as directors of USNB and, in accordance with the
Agreement, Messrs. Dewar and Edwards, together with Howard M.
Picking, III and Kim W. Kunkle, each of whom were directors of
JSB prior to the Effective Date, were elected to USNB's Board of
Directors.

Immediately following the Effective Date, USNB sold Standard
Mortgage Corporation ("SMC") of Georgia, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of JSB to Community Bancorp, Inc., another wholly -
owned subsidiary of USBANCORP. SMC is a mortgage banking company
organized under the laws of the State of Georgia and originates
and sells residential mortgage loans and services mortgage loans.
