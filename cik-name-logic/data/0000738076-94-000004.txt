Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

(a) On January 14, 1994, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of 
Reorganization dated December 16, 1993 (the "Agreement") among 3Com 
Corporation (the "Company"), 3Sub Corporation, a Delaware corporation and 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("3Sub"), and Synernetics Inc., a 
Delaware corporation ("Synernetics"), 3Sub was merged with and into 
Synernetics, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The 
holders of capital stock of Synernetics received cash at the rate of 
approximately $8.4402 per share. The negotiated value for the outstanding 
shares of Synernetics stock was approximately $104,000,000 less (i) the 
value of the Company's stock reserved for issuance in connection with the 
post-merger exercise of vested Synernetics stock options assumed by 3Com 
(including options that accelerated and became vested in connection with 
the merger), (ii) severance payments made to certain employees of 
Synernetics, and (iii) approximately $385,000 attributable to stock options 
granted by Synernetics to three of its employees in December 1993 after the 
terms of the merger had been substantially negotiated. Such amount was 
paid using funds from the Company's working capital. Under the terms of 
the Agreement, a portion of such amount was deposited into an escrow 
account as security for the indemnification of the Company by Synernetics 
for breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants of 
Synernetics set forth in the Agreement. Such account is the sole and 
exclusive source of any claim or remedy by the Company against Synernetics 
or its stockholders in connection with the merger. Subject to reduction 
based on outstanding or resolved claims, the funds in such account shall be 
distributed to the Synernetics stockholders on a pro rata basis in the 
future. In addition to the purchase price for outstanding shares of 
Synernetics' stock, 3Com assumed all outstanding options held by 
Synernetics' employees.

The Company and Synernetics have had a business relationship since 
1991, when they entered into contracts under which (i) Synernetics granted 
a non-exclusive license to the Company to permit the Company to develop, 
manufacture and distribute products based on Synernetics' then-existing 
products, (ii) the Company and Synernetics agreed to engage in certain 
joint development efforts, and (iii) the Company and Synernetics were each 
entitled to purchase, on an OEM basis, certain products manufactured by the 
other. Except as set forth above, no material relationship existed between 
the Company and Synernetics or any of its affiliates, any director or 
officer of the Company, or any associate of any such director or officer.

Synernetics is engagaged in the business of developing, 
manufacturing, marketing and servicing computer networking equipment. The 
Company intends to continue selling such equipment and to integrate the 
Synernetics product line and technology into the Company's business.

financial statements. The Company intends to file all required financial

and into Synernetics in a statutory merger pursuant to the
Agreement of Merger and in accordance with applicable provisions
of Delaware law so that:

(i) Each share of capital stock of Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall, by virtue of
the Merger, and without further action on the part of any holder
thereof, continue to be issued and shall be converted into one
share of Synernetics' common stock outstanding after the Merger;

(ii) Each share of Synernetics' capital
stock, if any, that is owned directly or indirectly by
Synernetics shall be canceled and no cash or other consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(iii) Each Synernetics Share shall, by
virtue of the Merger, and without further action on the part of
any holder thereof, be canceled. 3Com shall pay the Cash
Consideration to Synernetics such that each holder of such
Synernetics Shares shall receive an amount equal to the number of
such shares held by such holder multiplied by the Synernetics
Share Price.

(iv) At the Effective Time, Section 4 of the
Certificate of Incorporation of Synernetics shall be amended in
its entirety to read as follows:

"The total number of shares of all classes of stock that
this Corporation is authorized to issue is 1,000 shares of
Common Stock, $.01 par value per share."

Except as provided in this Section 2.1(a)(iv), the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Synernetics in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall not be amended by virtue of the
Merger and shall remain the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, respectively, of Synernetics after the Effective Time
unless and until further amended as provided by law, such
Certificate of Incorporation and such Bylaws. 

(v) The directors of Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the directors of Synernetics after
the Effective Time, and the officers of Synernetics immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the officers of
Synernetics after the Effective Time. Such directors and
officers shall hold their position as directors and officers
until the election and qualification of their respective
successors or until their tenure is otherwise terminated in
accordance with the Bylaws of Synernetics.

2.2 The Closing. Subject to termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 11 (Termination of Agreement)
below, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Ware
& Freidenrich, A Professional Corporation, 400 Hamilton Avenue,
Palo Alto, California, as soon as possible upon the satisfaction
or waiver of all conditions set forth in Section 9 (Conditions to
Synernetics' Obligations) and Section 10 (Conditions to 3Com's
and Sub's Obligations) hereof (the "Closing Date"). 

2.3 Effective Time. Simultaneously with the Closing,
the Agreement of Merger shall be filed in the offices of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall
become effective immediately upon the filing of the Agreement of
Merger with such offices. The date and time of the effectiveness
of the Merger under the laws of Delaware is hereinafter sometimes
referred to as the "Effective Time."

2.4 Appraisal Rights. If holders of Synernetics
capital stock are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with
the Merger under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, any Dissenting Shares shall not receive the Synernetics
Share Price in cash but shall be converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the law of the
State of Delaware. Synernetics shall give 3Com prompt notice of
any demand received by Synernetics for appraisal of Synernetics'
capital stock, and 3Com shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand. 
Synernetics agrees that, except with the prior written consent of
3Com or as required under the Delaware General Corporation Law,
it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demand for appraisal. Each
holder of Dissenting Shares ("Dissenting Shareholder") who,
pursuant to the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, becomes entitled to payment of the value of shares of
Synernetics' common stock or Synernetics' preferred stock shall
receive payment therefor (but only after the value therefor shall
have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such
provisions). In the event of legal obligation, after the
effective time of the Merger, to deliver the Synernetics Share
Price to a holder of shares of Synernetics' capital stock who
shall have failed to make an effective demand for appraisal or
shall have lost his status as a Dissenting Shareholder, 3Com
shall deliver, upon surrender by such Dissenting Shareholder of
his certificate or certificates representing shares of
Synernetics' capital stock, as applicable, the cash to which such
Dissenting Shareholder is then entitled under this Section 2.4
(Appraisal Rights) and the Agreement of Merger.

TREATMENT REQUESTED ] Dollars
($[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]) of the Cash Consideration 
shall be deposited intoan escrow account pursuant to 
Section 5.10 (Escrow Agreement).

(a) Surrender of Synernetics Certificates. 
Immediately after the Effective Time, each holder of a
certificate or certificates representing Synernetics Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall surrender such certificate(s) to an officer of Synernetics
designated for such purpose. Each certificate which immediately
before the Effective Time evidenced Synernetics Shares shall,
from and after the Effective Time until such certificate is
surrendered to Synernetics or its transfer agent, be deemed, for
all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive the
consideration described below; provided, however, that no
dividend or other distribution payable to the holder of such
certificate after the Effective Time shall be paid in respect of
such certificate until such certificate is so surrendered by such
holder. 

(b) 3Com to Provide Cash. Promptly after the
Effective Time, 3Com shall make available to an officer of
Synernetics designated for such purpose the Cash Consideration
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 (The Merger) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Synernetics capital stock, less the amount
deposited into the Escrow Account pursuant to Section 5.10.

the contrary in this Section 2.6 (Surrender of Certificates), no
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Synernetics
Shares for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In
the event any Certificates evidencing Synernetics Shares shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, 3Com shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, the cash amount
otherwise issuable under Section 2.1 (The Merger) upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, provided,
however, the 3Com may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issue thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to indemnify 3Com against any
claim that may be made against 3Com with respect to the
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

course of business or which would constitute a breach of any of
the representations contained in this Agreement. 

3.7 Title and Related Matters. Synernetics has good
and marketable title to all the properties, interests in
properties and assets, real and personal, reflected in the
Synernetics Balance Sheet or acquired after the date of the
Synernetics Balance Sheet (except properties, interests in
properties and assets sold or otherwise disposed of since the
date of the Synernetics Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of
business), free and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges,
charges or encumbrances of any kind or character, except the lien
of current taxes not yet due and payable and except for liens
which in the aggregate do not secure more than Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000) in liabilities. The equipment of Synernetics
necessary to the operation of its business is in good operating
condition and repair. All real or personal property leases to
which Synernetics is a party are valid, binding, enforceable and
effective in accordance with their respective terms. There is
not under any of such leases any existing material default or
event of default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a material default. The Synernetics
Disclosure Schedule contains a description of all real property
leased or owned by Synernetics, describing its interest in said
property and with respect to real property a description of each
parcel and a summary description of the buildings, structures and
improvements thereon. True and correct copies of Synernetics'
leases have been made available to 3Com or its representatives.

3.8 Proprietary Rights.

(a) Synernetics owns all right, title and
interest in and to all patents, copyrights, technology, software,
software tools, know-how, processes, trade secrets, trademarks,
service marks, trade names and other proprietary rights used in
or necessary for the conduct of Synernetics' business as
conducted to the date hereof or contemplated, including, without
limitation, the technology and all proprietary rights developed
or discovered in connection with or contained in the Synernetics
Products, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances
(including without limitation distribution rights) (all of which
are referred to as "Proprietary Rights"). The foregoing
representation as it relates to Third Party Technology (as
hereinafter defined) is limited to Synernetics' interest pursuant
to the Third Party Licenses (as hereinafter defined), all of
which are valid and enforceable and in full force and effect and
which grant Synernetics such right to Third Party Technology as
are employed in or necessary to the business of Synernetics as
conducted or proposed to be conducted. The Synernetics
Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate and complete description
of (i) all patents, trademarks (with separate listings of
registered and unregistered trademarks), tradenames, and
registered copyrights in or related to the Synernetics Products,
all applications and registration statements therefor, and a list
of all licenses and other agreements relating thereto, and (ii) a
list of all licenses and other agreements with third parties (the
"Third Party Licenses") relating to any software, technology,
know-how, or processes that Synernetics is licensed or otherwise
authorized by such third parties to use, market, distribute or
incorporate into products distributed by Synernetics (such
software, technology, know-how and processes are collectively
referred to as the "Third Party Technology"). All of
Synernetics' trademark or tradename registrations related to the
Synernetics Products and all of Synernetics' copyrights in any of
the Synernetics Products are valid and in full force and effect;
and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
alter or impair any such rights. No claims have been asserted
against Synernetics (and Synernetics is not aware of any claims
which are likely to be asserted against Synernetics) by any
person challenging Synernetics' use or distribution of any
patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets,
software, technology, know-how or processes utilized by
Synernetics (including, without limitation, the Third Party
Technology) or challenging or questioning the validity or
effectiveness of any license or agreement relating thereto
(including, without limitation, the Third Party Licenses). To
Synernetics' knowledge, none of the Synernetics Products nor the
use of any patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, software,
technology, know-how or processes by Synernetics in its current
business infringes on the rights of, constitutes misappropriation
of, or in any way involves unfair competition with respect to,
any proprietary information or intangible property right of any
third person or entity, including without limitation any patent,
trade secret, copyright, trademark or tradename.

(b) Synernetics has not granted any third party
any right to manufacture, reproduce, distribute, market or
exploit any of the Synernetics Products or any adaptations,
translations, or derivative works based on the Synernetics
Products or any portion thereof. Except with respect to the
rights of third parties to the Third Party Technology, no third
party has any right to manufacture, reproduce, distribute, market
or exploit any works or materials of which any of the Synernetics
Products are a "derivative work" as that term is defined in the
United States Copyright Act, Title 17, U.S.C. Section 101.

(c) All designs, drawings, specifications, source
code, object code, documentation, flow charts and diagrams
incorporating, embodying or reflecting any of the Synernetics
Products at any stage of their development (the "Synernetics
Components") (i) were written, developed and created solely and
exclusively by employees of Synernetics without the assistance of
any third party or entity or (ii) were created by third parties
who assigned ownership of their rights to Synernetics in valid
and enforceable consultant confidentiality and invention
assignment agreements or (iii) to the extent such Synernetics
Components contain technology licensed from third parties, such
licenses are in full force and effect and permit Synernetics to
distribute the Synernetics Components without material
limitation. Synernetics has at all times used commercially
reasonable efforts to treat the Synernetics Products and
Synernetics Components as containing trade secrets and has not
disclosed or otherwise dealt with such items in such a manner as
to cause the loss of such trade secrets by release into the
public domain.

(d) To Synernetics' knowledge, no employee of
Synernetics is in violation of any term of any employment
contract, patent disclosure agreement or any other contract or
agreement relating to the relationship of any such employee with
Synernetics or, to the best of Synernetics' knowledge, any other
party because of the nature of the business conducted by
Synernetics or proposed to be conducted by Synernetics.

(e) Each person presently or previously employed
by Synernetics (including independent contractors, if any) with
access to confidential information has executed a confidentiality
and non-disclosure agreement pursuant to the form of agreement
previously provided to 3Com or its representatives. Such
confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements constitute valid
and binding obligations of Synernetics and such person,
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. To the
best of Synernetics' knowledge, neither the execution or delivery
of such agreements, nor the carrying on of Synernetics' business
as employees by such persons, nor the conduct of Synernetics'
business as currently anticipated, will conflict with or result
in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of or
constitute a default under any material contract, covenant or
instrument under which any of such persons is obligated.

(f) No product liability or warranty claims which
individually or in the aggregate could exceed $50,000 have been
communicated to or, to Synernetics knowledge, threatened against
Synernetics nor, to the best of Synernetics' knowledge, is there
any specific situation, set of facts or occurrence out of which
such a claim is likely to arise. The Synernetics Disclosure
Schedule sets forth all bugs known to Synernetics in the
Synernetics Products.

3.9 Employee Benefit Plans. There is no unfunded
prior service cost with respect to any bonus, deferred
compensation, pension, profit-sharing, retirement, stock
purchase, stock option, or other employee benefit or fringe
benefit plans, whether formal or informal, maintained by
Synernetics. To Synernetics' knowledge, each bonus, deferred
compensation, pension, profit-sharing, retirement, stock
purchase, stock option, and other employee benefit or fringe
benefit plans, whether formal or informal, maintained by
Synernetics conforms in all material respects to all applicable
requirements of the Employees Retirement Income Security Act of
1974. The Synernetics Disclosure Schedule lists and describes

vacation, severance pay retirement, stock option, group insurance
or other plans (whether written or not) providing employee

with 3Com, Synernetics has not granted to any third party
(including, without limitation, OEMs and site license customers)
any rights to reproduce or manufacture any of the Synernetics
Products, nor has Synernetics granted to any third party any
exclusive rights of any kind with respect to any of the
Synernetics Products, including, without limitation, territorial
exclusivity or exclusivity with respect to particular versions,

customers, except such liabilities, obligations and claims as, in
the aggregate, do not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000).

(k) Synernetics has not guaranteed any
obligations of other persons or made any agreements to acquire or
guarantee any obligations of other persons.

(l) Synernetics has no outstanding loan or
advance to any person; nor is it party to any line of credit,
standby financing, revolving credit or other similar financing
arrangement of any sort which would permit the borrowing by
Synernetics of any sum not reflected in the financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 3.4 (Financial Statements).

(m) All material contracts, agreements and
instruments to which Synernetics is a party are valid, binding,
in full force and effect, and enforceable by Synernetics in
accordance with their respective terms. No such material
contract, agreement or instrument contains any material

(o) Synernetics is not in default under or in
breach or violation of any contract, commitment or restriction to
which Synernetics is a party or to which it or any of its
properties is bound, where such defaults, breaches, or violations
would, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
operations, assets, financial condition or prospects of
Synernetics. To the best of Synernetics' knowledge, no other

(a) Immediately upon the Effective Time, 3Com
shall offer to enter into an agreement with each holder of an
Option any portion of which has not been exercised prior to the
Effective Time providing for the assumption by 3Com of the
obligations of Synernetics under such Option in a form reasonably
acceptable to Synernetics and its counsel (the "Option Assumption
Agreement"). Each Option Assumption Agreement shall provide that
the Option assumed by 3Com thereby will continue to be
exercisable on the terms and conditions set forth in the option
agreement evidencing such Option, except that: (i) the Option
shall be deemed not to have terminated in accordance with the
Notice described in Section 5.11, (ii) the Option shall be
exercisable for a number of shares of 3Com Common Stock equal to
the number of shares of Synernetics common stock subject to such
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Synernetics Share Price
and the denominator of which is the 3Com Closing Price (with the
resulting number of shares of 3Com Common Stock rounded down to
the nearest whole number), (iii) the per share exercise price
shall be an amount equal to the aggregate exercise price prior to
the Merger divided by the number of shares of 3Com Common Stock
subject to such Option rounded up to the nearest whole cent, and
(iv) continuous employment with Synernetics, whether occurring
before or after the Effective Time, shall be credited to an
optionee for purposes of determining the number of shares subject
to exercise, vesting or repurchase after the Effective Time. It
is the intention of the parties that the Options assumed by 3Com
qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options
as defined in Section 422 of the Code ("incentive stock options")
to the extent the Options qualified as incentive stock options
prior to the Effective Time.

(b) 3Com and Synernetics agree that neither of
them will treat the consideration received pursuant to Section
2.1 with respect to Synernetics Shares issued upon exercise of
incentive stock options exercised prior to the Effective Time as
wages and will not make wage withholding with respect thereto,
provided that such Options are irrevocably exercised at least two
days prior to the Closing and the exercise price therefor
deposited in Synernetics bank account for the benefit of
Synernetics at least two days prior to the Closing. 

6.5 Indemnification of Directors, etc. 3Com agrees to
cause Synernetics to maintain in effect for six years from and
after the Closing Date any provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of Synernetics and any successor
corporation relating to the rights to indemnification of
directors and officers of Synernetics with respect to acts or
omissions occurring before the Effective Time. In the event 3Com
takes any action which would impair Synernetics' ability to
fulfill its obligations thereunder, 3Com will assume in all
respects the performance by Synernetics after the Effective Time
of Synernetics' indemnification obligations under its Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws.

6.6 Payment of Bonuses. 3Com agrees that it will pay
or cause Synernetics to pay all amounts payable under the
Synernetics Bonus Plan with respect to the year ended January 2,
1994 upon completion of the financial statements of Synernetics
for such year, or if 3Com has elected in writing prior to January
2, 1994 to complete an audit of such financials for such fiscal
year, then upon completion of such audit.

12. Miscellaneous.

12.1 Governing Laws. It is the intention of the

agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision which will

purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.

12.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the exhibits
hereto, the documents referenced herein, and the exhibits
thereto, constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements or

instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a
writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. The waiver by a
party of any breach hereof for default in payment of any amount

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
notwithstanding any investigation of the parties hereto and shall
terminate on the date one year after the Closing Date.

EXHIBIT E

ESCROW AGREEMENT

This Escrow Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as
of January 14, 1994 by and among 3Com Corporation, a California
corporation ("3Com"), Synernetics, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Synernetics"), the Representative named in Section 7 hereof and
the Escrow Agent named herein.

RECITALS

A. 3Com, 3Sub Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of 3Com ("Sub"), and Synernetics have
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of
December 16, 1993 (the "Plan") pursuant to which Sub will merge
with and into Synernetics, with Synernetics surviving the Merger. 
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise
defined herein will have the meanings given them in the Plan.

B. The Plan provides for [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED 
] Dollars ($[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT 
REQUESTED]) of the Cash Consideration (the "Escrow Amount") to be 
placed in an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") to secure certain
obligations to 3Com under the Plan on the terms and conditions
set forth herein.

C. The parties hereto desire to establish the terms and
conditions pursuant to which the Escrow Amount will be deposited,
held in, and disbursed from the Escrow Account.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1. Escrow.

(a) Escrow of Escrow Amount. The Escrow Amount will
be held in escrow by The First National Bank of Boston (the
"Escrow Agent"), as collateral for obligations of Synernetics
under Section 5.10 (Escrow Agreement) of the Plan, until 3Com is
required to release such Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. The Escrow Agent agrees to accept delivery of
the Escrow Amount and to hold such Escrow Amount in escrow
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(b) Payment for Breach of Representations and
Warranties. Synernetics agrees to pay 3Com for breaches of those
certain representations and warranties of Synernetics set forth
in Section 5.10 (Escrow Agreement) of the Plan. The parties
agree that the Escrow Amount will be security for this
obligation. Promptly after the receipt by 3Com of notice or
discovery of any claim, damage or legal action or proceeding
giving rise to rights under Section 5.10 (Escrow Agreement) of
the Plan, 3Com will give the Representative and the Escrow Agent
written notice of such claim, damage, legal action or proceeding
(a "Claim") in accordance with Section 3 hereof. 3Com shall
notify the Representative of the status or progress of any such
Claim.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement or in any of the other Transaction Documents: (a) the
Escrow Account shall be the sole and exclusive source of any
claim or remedy by 3Com or Sub arising out of the breach or
alleged breach by Synernetics of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements in the Plan or in any of the
other Transaction Documents, (b) no stockholder, officer,
director or employee of Synernetics shall have any liability for
any breach by Synernetics of the Plan or of any of the other
Transaction Documents, and (c) except as specifically provided in
the following paragraph, Synernetics shall be liable only as to
any individual claim [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED 

] Synernetics' maximum liability shall not exceed the
amounts maintained in the Escrow Account at the time any
indemnification claim is resolved. The amount of the [CONFIDENTIAL 
TREATMENT REQUESTED] shall be increased by the amount of any excess 
reserves on the Synernetics November 28, 1993 Balance Sheet 
delivered to 3Com (the "Closing Balance Sheet") as determined when 
the relevant asset category is fully realized (for example once all 
inventory reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet is either sold or 
written-off, any unapplied reserve will be added to the 
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]), provided however that with 
respect to any excess reserves for fixed assets, if any, the 
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] shall be increased by only one-
half of such amount. 3Com agrees to make decisions affecting
Synernetics' financial statements and related reserves in a
manner consistent with 3Com's internal policies.

Synernetics has authorized a severance or similar
arrangement for the following Synernetics' employees: Steve
Anderson, Sean Welch and Melissa Weiksnar (the "Certain
Employees"). One Hundred Forty Four Thousand Three Hundred
Seventy Dollars ($144,370) of the Escrow Amount shall relate only
to claims for severance pursuant to such arrangements made by the
Certain Employees in connection with such employee's termination
within six months of the Closing Date. 3Com may not make claims
against such $144,370 amount (a) for any matter other than such
severance amounts or (b) in the event a Certain Employee is
terminated on a date subsequent to the six month anniversary of
the Closing Date. The limitations under subsection (c) of the
immediately preceding paragraph shall not apply to any claim made
by 3Com against the escrow for such severance amounts.

(c) Limitation on Liability. The maximum liability of
Synernetics for any matter set forth in this Agreement shall not
exceed the forfeiture of the entire Cash Consideration that is
held in escrow. Payments for Claims shall be deducted from the
Escrow Amount of each shareholder of Synernetics immediately
prior to the Closing (collectively "Holders") in proportion to
the ratio of the number of Synernetics Shares held by such Holder
over the total number of Synernetics Shares held by all Holders
immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.

2. Deposit of Escrow Amount; Release from Escrow.

(a) Delivery of Escrow Amount. On the Closing Date
(i) the Escrow Amount will be delivered by 3Com to the Escrow
Agent by check made payable to the Escrow Account.

(b) Distribution to Holders. [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT 
REQUESTED ] the Escrow Agent
shall release from escrow to the Holders an aggregate of 
[CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED] Dollars ($[CONFIDENTIAL 
TREATMENT REQUESTED]), less (i) any amounts delivered to
3Com in satisfaction of Claims by 3Com and (ii) any amounts
withheld with respect to any pending but unresolved Claims of
3Com (the "Released Amount"), such that each Holder shall receive
such Holder's pro rata portion of the Released Amount. In the
event that on the six month anniversary of the Closing Date none
(or less than all) of the Certain Employees have made a claim for
severance pursuant to Section 1(b), the Escrow Agent shall
release to the Holders, in the manner described in this
Section 2(b), in addition to the Released Amount, the sum of One
Hundred Forty Four Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy Dollars
($144,370) less any severance amounts, if any, paid to a Certain
Employee pursuant to Section 1(b). The balance of the Escrow
Amount less any amounts described in clause (i) or (ii) of the
first sentence of this Paragraph shall be released [CONFIDENTIAL 
TREATMENT REQUESTED] after the Closing Date.

(c) Release of Escrow Amount. The Escrow Amount will
be held by the Escrow Agent until required to be released
pursuant to Section 2(b) above. Within 5 business days after the
release condition is met, the Escrow Agent will deliver to each
Holder the requisite Released Amount to be released on such date
as identified by 3Com and the Representative to the Escrow Agent
in writing, together with interest accrued on such requisite
Released Amount. 3Com and Representative undertake to deliver a
notice to Escrow Agent identifying the Escrow Amount to be
released within such five-day period. Released Amounts shall be
released to the respective Holders in proportion to their
respective interests.

(d) Investment of Escrow Account. Escrow Agent shall
invest the Escrow Account as directed in writing by the
Representative (or by 3Com if the Representative does not so
direct) in any of the following:

(i) obligations issued or guaranteed by The
United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof;

(ii) certificates of deposit or interest bearing
accounts with national banks or corporations endowed with trust
powers having capital and surplus in excess of $500,000,000;

(iii) commercial paper that at the time of
investment is rated A-1 by Standard & Poor's Corporation or
Prime-1 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;

(iv) repurchase agreements with any bank or
corporation described in clause (ii) fully secured by obligations
described in clause (i); or

(v) the 1784 Institutional U.S. Treasury Money
Market Fund.

(e) Interest. Accrued interest on each Release Amount
shall be paid to the Holders on [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED]. 
Accrued interest on the balance of the escrow amount due the Holders 
at the expiration of the escrow period shall be paid to the Holders. 
Accrued interest on any amounts delivered to 3Com in satisfaction
of Claims by 3Com shall be paid to 3Com at the time such amount
is delivered to 3Com. The parties hereto and the Holders agree
to provide the Escrow Agent with certified taxpayer
identification numbers prior to the release of any funds from the
Escrow Account.

(f) No Encumbrance. No interest in the Escrow Amount
or any beneficial interest therein may be pledged, sold, assigned
or transferred, including by operation of law, by a Holder or be
taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any debt or other liability of a Holder, prior to
the delivery to such Holder of the Released Amount by the Escrow
Agent.

3. Notice of Claim.

(a) Each notice of a Claim by 3Com (the "Notice of
Claim") shall be in writing to the Representative and the Escrow
Agent and shall contain the following information to the extent
it is reasonably available to 3Com:

(i) 3Com's good faith estimate of the reasonably
foreseeable maximum amount of the alleged Damages; and

(ii) A brief description in reasonable detail of
the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged
Damages based on 3Com's good faith belief thereof.

(b) 3Com shall provide written notice of any third
party claim which could result in a Notice of Claim promptly
after 3Com becomes aware of such third party claim. 3Com agrees
not to settle such claims without the prior written consent of
Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 3Com
further agrees that it will not on its own initiative seek a
resolution of any third party claim prior to March 1, 1994.

(c) The Escrow Agent will not release any of the
Escrow Amount held in the Escrow Account to 3Com pursuant to a
Notice of Claim until such Notice of Claim has been resolved in
accordance with Section 4 below.

(d) In the event 3Com receives a claim from a third
party for damages caused by one or more breaches of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.10 (Escrow
Agreement) of the Plan, 3Com shall promptly send a Notice of
Claim in accordance with this Section 3 and shall keep the
Representative and Escrow Agent informed of the status of such
claim. In the event a claim is made involving in excess of
$150,000, 3Com agrees to keep the Representative regularly
informed of the status thereof and solicit the recommendations of
the Representative regarding the disposition of such matter. The
parties agree that a claim against 3Com alleging an infringement
of patents or other rights based on the sale by 3Com of
Synernetics products prior to the Closing shall be deemed to be a
claim to which this escrow applies, and that the Representative
shall be entitled to the same rights with respect to such claims
as are provided for claims against Synernetics.

4. Resolution of Notice of Claim and Transfer of Escrow
Shares. Any Notice of Claim received by Representative and the
Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 3 above will be resolved as
follows:

(a) Uncontested Claims. In the event that the
Representative does not contest a Notice of Claim in writing to
the Escrow Agent and 3Com or pay the amount demanded within
30 calendar days after such Notice of Claim is deemed delivered
pursuant to Section 7 below, the Escrow Agent will immediately
deliver to 3Com an amount equal to the amount specified in the
Notice of Claim and notify the Representative of such transfer.

(b) Contested Claims. In the event that the
Representative gives written notice contesting all or a portion
of a Notice of Claim to 3Com and the Escrow Agent (a "Contested
Claim") within the 30-day period provided above, the matter will
be settled by binding arbitration. Any portion of the Notice of
Claim which is not contested shall be resolved as set forth above
in Section 4(a). The final decision of the arbitrator shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent, the Representative, the Holders

of the Notice of Claim, or (ii) receipt of a copy of the final 
award of the arbitrator.

proceeding instituted to resolve a Contested Claim.

(ii) Compensation of Arbitrator. Any such
arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator who
shall be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be
determined by the parties or by the American Arbitration
Association, but based upon reasonable hourly or daily consulting
rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties are not able to
agree upon his or her rate of compensation.

(iii) Selection of Arbitrator. The AAA Rules
for the selection of the arbitrator shall be followed.

(iv) Payment of Costs. 3Com and the Holders as a
group shall each advance fifty percent (50%) of the initial
compensation to be paid to the arbitrator in any such arbitration
and fifty percent (50%) of the costs of transcripts and other
normal and regular expenses of the arbitration proceedings;
provided, however, that the arbitrator shall have the discretion
to grant to the prevailing party in any arbitration an award of
attorneys' fees and costs, and all costs of arbitration.

(v) Discovery. The parties shall be entitled to
conduct discovery proceedings in accordance with the provisions
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, subject to any
limitation imposed by the arbitrator.

claim were litigated in a judicial proceedings.

(vii) Judgment. Upon the conclusion of any
arbitration proceedings hereunder, the arbitrator shall render

chosen in accordance with these provisions shall not have the
power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these
arbitration provisions or the provisions of this Agreement or the
Plan.

(ix) Exclusive Remedy. Except as specifically
provided in this Agreement or the Plan, arbitration shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the parties for any Contested Claim
arising out of such Agreement or Plan.

(c) No Exhaustion of Remedies. The parties
acknowledge that no other action need be taken by 3Com before
proceeding directly in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. 

5. Inventory. The parties have agreed that an inventory
of fixed assets shall be conducted as provided in Section 12.1 of
the Plan. The parties agree that, should the aggregate net book
value of such fixed assets as indicated by such inventory exceed
the net book value of the Synernetics fixed assets as set forth
in the Synernetics Balance Sheet (as defined in the Plan), no
Claim may be made by 3Com with respect to the condition or
existence of any Synernetics' fixed assets. Further, the parties
agree that any excess of the net book value of fixed assets on
the Synernetics Balance Sheet over the net book value as
demonstrated by such inventory shall constitute a Claim. 

6. Limitation of Escrow Agent's Liability.

(a) The Escrow Agent will incur no liability with
respect to any action taken or suffered by it in reliance upon
any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other
document believed by it to be genuine and duly authorized, nor
for any other action or inaction, except its own willful
misconduct or negligence. The Escrow Agent will not be
responsible for the validity or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any agreement amendatory or supplemental hereto. In all
questions arising under the Agreement, the Escrow Agent may rely
on the advice or opinion of counsel, and for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Escrow Agent based on
such advice or opinion, the Escrow Agent will not be liable to
anyone. The Escrow Agent will not be required to take any action
hereunder involving any expense unless the payment of such
expense is made or provided for in a manner satisfactory to it.

(b) In the event conflicting demands are made or
notices are served upon the Escrow Agent with respect to the
Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent will have the absolute right, at
the Escrow Agent's election, to do either or both of the
following: resign so a successor can be appointed pursuant to
Section 11 or file a suit in interpleader and obtain an order
from a court of competent jurisdiction requiring the parties to
interplead and litigate in such court their several claims and
rights among themselves. In the event such interpleader suit is
brought, the Escrow Agent will thereby be fully released and
discharged from all further obligations imposed upon it under
this Agreement, and 3Com will pay the Escrow Agent (subject to
reimbursement from the Holders pursuant to Section 10 hereof) all
costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees expended or
incurred by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the exercise of Escrow
Agent's rights under this Section 6 (such costs, fees and
expenses shall be treated as extraordinary fees and expenses for
the purposes of Section 10 hereof).

(c) In consideration of its acceptance of the
appointment as Escrow Agent, the other parties hereto, jointly
and severally, agree to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent
harmless as to any liability incurred by it to any person, firm
or corporation by reason of its having accepted the same or in
carrying out any of the terms hereof, and to reimburse the Escrow
Agent for all its costs and expenses, including, but not limited
to, reasonable counsel fees and expenses, incurred by reason of
any matter as to which an indemnity is paid; provided, however,
that no indemnity need be paid in the case of the Escrow Agent's
negligence or willful misconduct.

7. Holders' Representative. For purposes of this
Agreement the Holders, without any further action on the part of
any such Holders, shall be deemed to have consented to the
appointment of Allan Wallack as the initial representative of the
Holders (the "Representative"), as the attorney-in-fact for and
on behalf of each Holder, and the taking by the Representative of
any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or
permitted to be taken by him under this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the exercise of the power to (i) authorize
delivery to 3Com of the Escrow Amount, or any portion thereof, in
satisfaction of Claims, (ii) agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
such Claims, (iii) resolve any Claims and (iv) take all actions
necessary in the judgment of the Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other terms,
conditions and limitations of this Agreement. Accordingly, the
Representative has unlimited authority and power to act on behalf
of Synernetics and each Holder with respect to this Agreement and
the disposition, settlement or other handling of all Claims,
rights or obligations arising under this Agreement. The Holders
will be bound by all actions taken by the Representative in
connection with this Agreement and 3Com shall be entitled to rely
on any action or decision of the Representative. In performing
his functions hereunder, the Representative will not be liable in
any manner whatsoever to the Holders. At any time during the
term of this Agreement, Holders of a majority of the Synernetics
Shares immediately prior to the closing of the Merger can appoint
a new Representative by written consent by sending notice and a
copy of the written consent appointing such new Representative
signed by such Holders of a majority of the Synernetics Shares to
3Com and the Escrow Agent. Such appointment will be effective
upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the date
such consent is received by 3Com and the Escrow Agent.

8. Notices. Any notice provided for or permitted under
this Agreement will be treated as having been given when
(i) delivered personally, (ii) sent by confirmed telex or
telecopy, (iii) sent by commercial overnight courier with written

the State of California without regard to conflict-of-law
principles and will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of,
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an
original, but all of which together will constitute one and the
same instrument.

(c) Entire Agreement. Except as set forth in the Plan
and the Agreement of Merger between 3Com and Synernetics, this
Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement

instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a
writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. The waiver by a
party of any breach hereof for default in payment of any amount
due hereunder or default in the performance hereof shall not be
deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any
succeeding breach or default.

10. Expenses.

(a) Escrow Agent and Arbitrator. All fees and
expenses of the Escrow Agent incurred in the ordinary course of
performing its responsibilities hereunder will be paid by 3Com
upon receipt of a written invoice by Escrow Agent. Any
extraordinary fees and expenses, including without limitation any
fees or expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with
a dispute over the distribution of the Escrow Amount or the

liability for the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent or of the
arbitrator appointed under Section 4 may be paid by 3Com and
recovered as a Claim hereunder out of the Escrow Amount. If 3Com

permitted hereunder, then the Escrow Agent will, upon demand by
3Com, deliver to 3Com a portion of the Escrow Amount equal to
such portion of fees and expenses.

duties or obligations hereunder by giving resignation to the

the Escrow Account at such time to such designated successor.

REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement"), and this SIDE AGREEMENT
regarding the Agreement is entered into this 14th day of January
1994 in order to set forth certain additional understandings of
the parties with respect to the Agreement.

RECITAL

The parties intend to clarify certain matters that have
arisen with respect to the provisions of the Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby and, subject to the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, to agree upon the manner in
which certain matters are to be handled.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in reliance on the foregoing recitals and in
and for the consideration and mutual covenants set forth herein,
the parties agree as follows:

1. Definitions. Capitalized terms shall have the meanings
provided in the Agreement unless otherwise defined herein. 

2. Amendments to the Agreement and other Documents. The
parties agree that each of the following provisions of the
Agreement are hereby amended as set forth below. 

(a) Section 10.6 of the Agreement is amended to read
in full as follows:

Required Consents. 3Com shall have received
all material written consents, assignments,
waivers, authorizations or other certificates
reasonably deemed necessary by 3Com's legal
counsel to provide for the continuation in
full force and effect of any and all material
contracts and leases of Synernetics.

(b) Section 6.4(b) of the Agreement is amended to read
in full as follows:

(b) 3Com and Synernetics agree that neither of
them will treat the consideration received
pursuant to Section 2.1 with respect to
Synernetics Shares issued upon exercise of
incentive stock options exercised prior to the
Effective Time as wages and will not make wage
withholding with respect thereto, provided that
such Options are irrevocably exercised at least
two days prior to the Closing and the exercise
price therefor deposited in Synernetics bank
account for the benefit of Synernetics at least
two days prior to the Closing, and provided
further that with respect to any portion of any
option which is, or as of the date of exercise
becomes, subject to any repurchase right that by
its terms lapses under certain conditions in the
future, that a form of election under IRC Section
83(B) is filed prior to the Closing. 

(c) Section 5 of the Escrow Agreement is amended to
read in full as follows:

Inventory. The parties have agreed that an
inventory of fixed assets shall be conducted as
provided in Section 12.1 of the Plan. The parties
agree that, should the aggregate net book value of
such fixed assets as indicated by such inventory
exceed the net book value of the Synernetics'
fixed assets as set forth in the Synernetics'
Balance Sheet (as defined in the Plan), no Claim
may be made by 3Com with respect to the condition
or existence of any Synernetics' fixed assets. 
Further, the parties agree that any excess of the
net book value of fixed assets on the Synernetics
Balance Sheet over the net book value as
demonstrated by such inventory shall constitute a
Claim. 

(d) The penultimate sentence of the second paragraph
of Section 1(b) of the Escrow Agreement is amended to read in
full as follows:

The amount of the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED*] 
shall be increased by the amount of any excess 
reserves on the Synernetics November 28, 1993 
Balance Sheet delivered to 3Com (the "Closing 
Balance Sheet") as determined when the relevant 
asset category is fully realized (for example once 
all inventory reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet 
is either sold or written-off, any unapplied reserve 
will be added to the [CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED*]), 
provided however that with respect to any excess 
reserves for fixed assets, if any, the [CONFIDENTIAL 
TREATMENT REQUESTED*] shall be increased by only
one-half of such amount.

* CONFIDENTIAL PORTION HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH
THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

3. Synernetics Representation regarding Options. 
Synernetics represents that it has reviewed its books and records
regarding Options to be assumed by 3Com and represents that all
such Options were granted pursuant to Rule 701.

4. 3Com Agreement regarding Common Stock issued upon
Exercise of Options. 3Com agrees that, based in part upon the
representation in Section 3 above, the shares of Common Stock
issued upon exercise of Options after assumption thereof by 3Com
are subject to Rule 701 and the provisions thereof permitting the
sale of such shares without registration. 

5. Synernetics Representation regarding Wallack Options
and Severance. Synernetics represents that it has reviewed its
books and records and reviewed with its Board of Directors the
circumstances surrounding the granting of incentive stock options
to Allan L. Wallack (the "Wallack Options") and the terms of the
Employment Agreement with Allan L. Wallack dated June 15, 1990
(the "Wallack Employment Agreement"). Synernetics represents
that (i) it was the intention of Synernetics and of its Board of
Directors that the Wallack Options contain a term, referenced in
the Wallack Employment Agreement, providing that the vesting of
the shares issuable to Allan L. Wallack would in the event of
certain mergers, etc, be accelerated by two years, (ii) the
Wallack Employment Agreement was not a modification of the
Wallack Options and (iii) the reference to one year of
acceleration in the Wallack Options rather than two was an
administrative oversight. Synernetics further represents that
the amount set forth in Section 1(b) of the Escrow Agreement as
the Severance amount payable to the persons specified in such
Section is the sole and exclusive severance amount of any kind
offered to or arranged for such persons by Synernetics. These
representations shall have the same effect as if set forth in the
Agreement, and the Agreement shall be deemed amended to include
such representations.

6. Closing Matters. Synernetics and 3Com have agreed that
all payments to Synernetics stockholders will be made directly by
3Com pursuant to a schedule provided by Synernetics. It shall be
an additional closing condition that no employee shall have
exercised any portion of an option which would be unvested
immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger. Further,
3Com acknowledges that the conditions described in Section
6.4(b), as amended above, to avoid withholding on exercise of
incentive stock options as to which exercise forms have been
delivered to 3Com (or its legal counsel) as of the Closing, and
that 3Com will not withhold with respect to any of such option
exercises.

7. No Other Amendments. Except as modified hereby the
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this
Agreement as of the date first set forth above.
