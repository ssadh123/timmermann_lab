Item 5. Other Events

On April 19, 1994 Citicorp reported operating earnings of
$609 million, or $1.12 per common share fully diluted, in the
first quarter of 1994. These results were up from $370 million,
or $0.67 per share, in the same year-earlier quarter.

Including the cumulative effect of adopting the new
accounting standard for postemployment benefits, net income was
$553 million, or $1.01 per common share fully diluted. In the
year-earlier quarter, including the cumulative effect of a new
accounting method for income taxes, net income was $670 million,
or $1.24 per common share fully diluted.

John S. Reed, Chairman, said: "We had a good quarter. Our
strong emerging markets businesses, continued good operating
expense management, and significant improvement in credit costs
more than offset weak trading results."

Revenues, adjusted for credit-related costs, the effect of credit
card securitization and nonrecurring asset sales, declined by
approximately $100 million to $4.1 billion from the 1993 first
quarter; trading declined by $386 million to $71 million while
all other revenues increased by $269 million or 7%, chiefly in
businesses in emerging markets. Adjusted operating expenses at
$2.4 billion were approximately even with the 1993 first quarter
- -- despite increased spending for continued business expansion
in emerging countries -- and an improvement of $180 million from
the 1993 fourth quarter.

Both commercial and consumer credit costs declined. 
Commercial credit costs decreased for the ninth straight quarter,
to $60 million from $126 million in the 1993 fourth quarter and
from $380 million in the 1993 first quarter. Commercial cash-
basis loans and Other Real Estate Owned together dropped by $319
million in the quarter to $5.0 billion. Consumer credit costs
declined to $614 million in the quarter from $651 million in the
1993 fourth quarter and from $716 million in the 1993 first
quarter. 

First quarter earnings included a net pretax gain from asset
sales of $23 million ($14 million after tax). Net gains on asset
sales for the same 1993 quarter were $75 million pretax ($41
million after tax).

The company further strengthened its balance sheet during
the quarter by building commercial and consumer loan loss
reserves by $100 million to $4.2 billion, compared with $3.7 
billion a year ago. The reserve for the cross-border refinancing
portfolio was unchanged from the 1993 year-end total of $238
million after a pretax release to earnings of $34 million.

Total regulatory capital was increased to $23.5 billion, up $2.5
billion from $21.0 billion a year ago.

Citicorp estimated that its Tier 1 capital ratio increased to
6.8% at quarter-end from 6.6% at December 31, 1993, and its
combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio remained unchanged from
11.5% at year-end 1993. A year ago the Tier 1 ratio was 5.2% and
the combined ratio was 10%.

In adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 112 (accounting for postemployment benefits) as of January 1,
1994, Citicorp took an after-tax charge of $56 million as the
cumulative effect of the new standard.

Also in the quarter, Citicorp adopted SFAS No. 115
(accounting for certain investments in securities), which
increased stockholders' equity by $227 million after tax at March
31, 1994, and Interpretation No. 39 (covering reporting of off-
balance sheet contracts), which increased assets and liabilities
by approximately $15 billion at March 31. (Neither of these two
accounting changes affected the company's earnings or its Tier 1
and Tier 2 capital ratios, but they have the effect of reducing
return ratios.)

RESULTS OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Global Consumer

Net income in the Global Consumer businesses increased 44%
to a record $427 million in the quarter, compared with $296
million in the 1993 first quarter. The improvement was due to
strong revenues in the emerging economies and private banking
activities as well as to lower credit losses in the U.S.
businesses. 

Net income from the consumer businesses in North America,
Europe and Japan was $256 million, compared with $154 million in
the year-earlier quarter. Net income from consumer businesses in
the emerging economies was $171 million, compared with $142
million in the same 1993 quarter.

Adjusted revenues of $2.8 billion were 6% higher than in the
1993 first quarter, with revenues from the emerging economies up
19% and those from North America, Europe and Japan up slightly,
chiefly from strong private banking activity.

Consumer expenses in the quarter were $1.5 billion, a 5%
rise from a year ago, primarily in emerging markets.

Credit costs of $614 million, adjusted for the effect of
credit card securitization, fell by $102 million from the 1993
first quarter and $37 million from last year's fourth
quarter -- their lowest level since 1990. Net credit losses
continued to decline from the 1993 fourth quarter in the U.S.
credit card portfolio, with improvement also noted in U.S.
branches. Consumer loans on the balance sheet that are
delinquent 90 days or more were $3.5 billion at the quarter-end,
down from $3.9 billion a year earlier and virtually unchanged
from the 1993 year-end.

Global Finance

Global Finance businesses earnings were $264 million for the
first quarter, compared with $380 million for the same 1993
quarter. 

The businesses in North America, Europe and Japan earned $86
million for the quarter, while businesses in the emerging
economies earned $178 million. These results compared with $233
million and $147 million, respectively, in the year-ago quarter.

Global Finance adjusted revenues were $1.2 billion, an 18%
decline from the same 1993 quarter and 23% lower than the fourth
quarter of 1993. Revenues from trading-related activities for
the quarter were substantially lower compared with both periods
of the prior year. Interest rate and currency environments in
Europe and North America were volatile, and market prices
declined in Latin American securities. Global Finance revenues
excluding trading, however, remained strong, with good gains from 
emerging countries.

Operating expenses were lower by 4% and 7% compared with the
first and fourth quarters of 1993, respectively. Expenses for
the 1993 fourth quarter reflected higher incentive compensation
related to trading activity and for the year-ago quarter included
a pretax charge of $64 million ($35 million after tax) for
withdrawal from the portfolio management business for customers
in India.

In the quarter, Global Finance recoveries, chiefly in North
America and Europe, exceeded write-offs by $46 million. In
addition, other positive credit-related items in the quarter
totaled $12 million. These contrasted with credit costs in the
1993 first quarter of $69 million. Cash-basis loans of $699
million compared with $1.3 billion a year ago and $755 million at
the end of 1993. 

North America Commercial Real Estate

North America Commercial Real Estate reported continued
improvement in its portfolio. Cash-basis loans and OREO declined
to $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter, an improvement of $1.8
billion and $267 million, respectively, from the first and fourth
quarters of 1993. The reduction was due to multiple initiatives,
including restructurings, sales, paydowns, writeoffs and
writedowns. 

Cash-basis loans of $1.7 billion were down from $2.6 billion
at the end of the 1993 first quarter and even with $1.7 billion
at year-end 1993. OREO property decreased to $2.1 billion from
$3.0 billion a year ago and from $2.3 billion at year-end 1993. 
Consistent with the reduction of problem credits in the North
America Commercial Real Estate portfolio, its total exposure was
reduced $900 million during the quarter to $12.7 billion -- down
from $16.5 billion at the end of the 1993 first quarter.

North America Commercial Real Estate reported a net loss of
$76 million, a sharp reduction from a $204 million loss in the 
1993 first quarter, due to lower credit costs. Net write-offs
and writedowns declined to $104 million, compared with $260
million in the same 1993 quarter. 

Cross-Border Refinancing Portfolio

The cross-border refinancing portfolio reported net income
of $49 million, reflecting the release of $34 million of
reserves; net income in the same 1993 quarter amounted to $37
million, when there was no release of reserves. The first-
quarter results included the recognition of $22 million of
interest from Brazil, compared with $42 million in the year-ago
quarter.

On April 15, 1994 the Government of Brazil completed its
external-debt financing package covering essentially all of its
medium- and long-term commercial-bank debt. Citicorp exchanged
approximately $2.7 billion in face value of Brazilian debt for
$1.3 billion of Debt Conversion Bonds, $1.2 billion of Front
Loaded Interest Reduction Bonds, $122 million of New Money Bonds
and $60 million of Investment Feature Cruzeiro Bonds. In
addition, Citicorp purchased $221 million of New Money Bonds and
has received $274 million of an expected total of approximately
$325 million in bonds covering past due interest. 

In March the Government of Poland and its Bank Advisory
Committee reached a preliminary agreement on a financing package,
and negotiations are underway between the Governments of Panama
and Ecuador and their bank committees.

TAXES

The effective tax rate in the quarter was 39%, down from 45%
in the 1993 first quarter. 

Following are tables of financial highlights, an analysis of
operating margin pretax earnings, business results and credit
indicators are available on request, along with financial
statements. Further details concerning the financial results
will be available in May in Citicorp's Form 10-Q.
