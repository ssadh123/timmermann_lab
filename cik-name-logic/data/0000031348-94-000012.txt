ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On September 30, 1994 the company completed a transaction in
which it acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Theodore Bargman Co., a manufacturer and distributor of
locks, fixtures and lighting products for the recreational
vehicle industry. The transaction in which 231,809 shares
of the company's common stock were issued or became
issuable, subject to post closing adjustment, will be
accounted for as a pooling of interests. As the impact on
the company is minor, prior year results will not be
restated.

Under the terms of the Stock Acquisition Agreement dated as
of September 30, 1994, the company was required to issue
financial results combining Theodore Bargman Co. with the
company for the first full month of operations ending after
the closing date. In accordance with the agreement, the
following are the unaudited consolidated financial results
of the combined operations for the month ended October 31,
1994:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Sales $201,578,000
Net income $ 10,323,000
Earnings per share $0.17

All normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a
fair presentation have been included in the above results.
These results are not necessarily indicative of the results
which can be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31,
1995.
