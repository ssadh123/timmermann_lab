Item 5. Other Events.

a. Proposed Merger with LIVE Entertainment Inc.

Carolco Pictures Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Carolco"), LIVE Entertainment Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("LIVE"), and Carolco Acquisition Corp.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of LIVE ("CAC"), entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
August 10, 1994 (the "Merger Agreement") providing for
a business combination of Carolco and LIVE. The
Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that
CAC will be merged with and into Carolco (the
"Merger") with Carolco as the surviving corporation
continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of LIVE. At
the effective date of the Merger, LIVE will be renamed
Carolco Entertainment Inc. ("Carolco Entertainment"). 
The Merger has been structured with the intent that it
qualify as a tax free reorganization whereby each
Carolco stockholder will receive one share of newly
issued Carolco Entertainment common stock for each 5.5
shares of Carolco common stock held. The exchange
ratio will be adjusted based on the market price of
Carolco common stock prior to the consummation of the
Merger subject to two limitations designed to limit
the effect of market fluctuations on both Carolco and
LIVE stockholders. The number of Carolco shares to be
exchanged for each share of Carolco Entertainment will
be adjusted upward, if necessary, so that the market
value of Carolco shares to be exchanged for one share
of Carolco Entertainment is at least $3.00, but in no
event will more than 6.5 shares of Carolco be
exchanged for each share of Carolco Entertainment. 
Likewise, the number will be adjusted downward, if
necessary, so that the market value of Carolco shares
to be exchanged is no more than $4.00, but in no event
will fewer than 4.5 shares of Carolco be exchanged for
each share of Carolco Entertainment. If the Merger
had closed on the date of this report, the exchange
ratio would have been 6.5 to 1. In addition, each
outstanding share of Carolco's Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock will be converted into one share of a
new series of preferred stock to be authorized by
Carolco Entertainment. As a result, immediately upon
consummation of the Merger, the current LIVE
stockholders will own between approximately 21% and
28% of the surviving corporation and the remainder
will be owned by the current Carolco stockholders. 
Therefore, the Merger, if consummated, will be treated
as a reverse acquisition of LIVE by Carolco for
accounting and financial reporting purposes and the
purchase method of accounting will be applied to a
portion of the historical values of LIVE's assets and
liabilities. Additionally, to the extent of common
ownership between LIVE and Carolco (54.6% of LIVE's
common stock is owned by significant stockholders of
Carolco), a portion of the transaction will be treated
as a combination of companies under common control,
similar to a pooling. 

The Merger is subject to a number of conditions,
including the 

Page 2 of 11 pages

redemption of LIVE's Series B Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock, certain amendments to various public
and private securities of LIVE and the availability of
certain ongoing financing commitments prior to the
combination. The Merger is also subject to the
approval of the combination by the non-affiliated 
stockholders of both companies and other customary
conditions to closing. On June 30, 1994, The Seidler
Companies Incorporated ("Seidler") delivered its
written opinion to the Carolco Board of Directors
that, based on the conditions and assumptions
contained therein, the financial terms of the Merger
are fair to the unaffiliated stockholders of Carolco. 
Chemical Securities Inc., an affiliate of Chemical
Bank ("Chemical Securities"), delivered its written
opinion dated as of July 1, 1994 to the LIVE Board of
Directors that, based on the conditions and
assumptions contained therein, the exchange ratio for
the Merger is fair to the unaffiliated stockholders of
LIVE. The opinions of Seidler and Chemical Securities
will be updated to a date just prior to the
consummation of the Merger. There can be no
assurances that the conditions will be met, the Merger
will be consummated, or, if consummated, will be
consummated on the terms set forth above.

In conjunction with the Merger Agreement, Carolco
entered into Investor Representation Agreements dated
as of August 10, 1994 (the "Investor Representation
Agreements") with each of Pioneer LDCA, Inc.
("Pioneer"), Cinepole Productions B.V. ("Cinepole"),
RCS Video International Services B.V. ("RCS"), MGM
Holdings Corporation ("MGM Holdings") and New Carolco
Investments B.V. ("New CIBV"), which in the aggregate 
hold approximately 85.3% of the Carolco voting power
which would currently be entitled to vote on the
Merger. LIVE is also a party to the Investor
Representation Agreements of Pioneer, Cinepole and
RCS, which in the aggregate hold approximately 68.4%
of the LIVE voting power which would currently be
entitled to vote on the Merger. The Investor
Representation Agreements provide that, subject to
receipt of definitive proxy materials, such
stockholders will vote all shares of Carolco stock
and, with respect to Pioneer, Cinepole and RCS, all
shares of LIVE stock beneficially owned by them in
favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby. Pioneer, Cinepole, RCS, MGM
Holdings (collectively, the "Strategic Investors") and
New CIBV also entered into a Stockholders Agreement
(the "Stockholders Agreement") which provides for
certain corporate governance procedures relating to
the post-merger company.

To permit Carolco to proceed with certainty with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on
August 11, 1994, Mr. Kassar and Carolco entered into
a new employment agreement dated as of August 10, 1994
(the "1994 Employment Agreement") which amends and
restates the Employment Agreement of Mr. Kassar dated
as of May 3, 1993. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement
and an Assumption Agreement dated as of August 10,
1994 among Carolco, LIVE and Mr. Kassar, as of the
effective date of the 

Page 3 of 11 pages

Merger, LIVE will assume each of the obligations of
Carolco under the 1994 Employment Agreement. In
addition, Carolco entered into a related Stock Option
Agreement with Mr. Kassar dated as of August 10, 1994
(the "Stock Option Agreement").

The Merger Agreement, Investor Representation
Agreements, Stockholders Agreement, 1994 Employment
Agreement and Stock Option Agreement are Exhibits to
this Form 8-K.

a. Financial Condition and Operations of Carolco.

Carolco currently has two motion pictures in
pre-production: Cutthroat Island starring Geena Davis
and Matthew Modine and directed by Renny Harlin and
Showgirls directed by Paul Verhoeven. Both pictures
are currently scheduled to commence principal
photography in October 1994 and to be completed and
available for release in mid-1995. Carolco has
reached an agreement regarding the terms and has
accepted the commitment of a group of banks, including
Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland N.V., to provide an
individual production loan to finance a substantial
portion of the cost of Cutthroat Island. Although
management of Carolco believes it is likely that
Carolco will be able to satisfy all of the conditions
to the funding of such production loan, there can be
no assurance that this will be the case. In the event
Carolco is unable to successfully consummate such
production loan, it will be required to procure
financing from alternative sources in order to
complete the production of Cutthroat Island (although
no assurance can be given that such financing can be
obtained or obtained on terms acceptable to Carolco).
Prior to the commencement of the negotiations
described below to sell Showgirls to an affiliate of
MGM Holdings (such affiliate, "MGM"), a similar
production loan was being negotiated for that motion
picture.

Although agreements in principle have been reached
between Carolco and various distributors with regard
to the pre-sale of a substantial portion of the
distribution rights for both Cutthroat Island and
Showgirls, due to production and casting delays, the
documentation of these pre-sales has not yet been
completed. In addition, due to such delays, Carolco
has not yet obtained a completion bond (also known as
an "over-budget" guaranty) for either film. Carolco
will be unable to access the Cutthroat Island
production loan described above (and would not have
been able to access the Showgirls production loan,
assuming it were to be successfully negotiated) until
such pre-sales and completion bonds have been
finalized and pledged as collateral to secure such
production loans. Carolco recently determined that it
is unlikely that it will be able to access either of
such loans prior to late in the fourth quarter of
1994. In addition to its ongoing overhead expenses,
Carolco is currently funding the pre-production
expenses of both motion pictures from its current
cash balances. At the 

Page 4 of 11 pages

current rate of expenditure (including increased
expenditures when principal photography commences for
the two films), Carolco will face an extreme cash
shortage prior to the anticipated funding of the
production loans and will be unable to complete either
film. 

Several steps are currently being taken to address
Carolco's liquidity problem. Carolco has entered
into negotiations regarding the sale of its entire
interest in Showgirls to MGM. In addition, Pioneer
has agreed, subject to certain conditions, to advance
certain overage payments anticipated to be due with
respect to Cliffhanger and Terminator 2: Judgment Day
over the next several months from exisiting licenses
in Japan. RCS has agreed to
negotiate certain amendments to the agreement
pursuant to which it is required to purchase Carolco's 
7% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 on December
30, 1994 in order to permit Carolco to borrow against
the funds to be received from RCS prior to such date. 
Le Studio Canal+ S.A., an affiliate of Cinepole, has
agreed, subject to the sale of Showgirls to MGM and
the performance by Pioneer and RCS of their respective
agreements, to advance approximately $2,000,000 of
commisions which will be due to Carolco in the fourth
quarter of 1994 for serving as the foreign sales agent
for the motion picture Stargate. The agreements of
MGM, Pioneer, RCS and Le Studio Canal+ are subject to
the approvals of their respective boards of directors.

Carolco is continuing to use its best efforts to
complete the steps required to access the Cutthroat
Island production loan as soon as possible. It is
anticipated that a combination of borrowings under the
Cutthroat Island production loan, the funds to be
received from the proposed sale of Showgirls and the
interim financing arrangements described above will be
sufficient to fund the production of Cutthroat Island
and the other operations of Carolco through the
closing of the Cutthroat Island production loan. 
There can be no assurance that Carolco will be
successful in its efforts to borrow under the
Cutthroat Island production loan in a timely manner,
complete the sale of Showgirls or consummate the
interim financing arrangements described above. In the
event Carolco is not successful in these efforts, it
is likely that Carolco will be forced to cease
production of Cutthroat Island and, if not sold to
MGM, Showgirls, and Carolco may be unable to meet its
other obligations and may be unable to continue to
operate as a going concern.

The solicitation of votes of stockholders of both
Carolco and LIVE with respect to the Merger will be
made through the distribution of definitive proxy
materials in accordance with the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Carolco intends to file preliminary
proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with the Merger and in
connection with the preparation of such filing has
been informed by its independent 

Page 5 of 11 pages

auditors that because of Carolco's current financial
condition, the Report of Independent Auditors covering
Carolco's financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 1993 will be re-issued with an
explanatory paragraph which indicates that such
financial condition raises substantial doubt about the
ability of Carolco to continue as a going concern.

(2) If the Average Trading Price (as defined below)
(A) is less than 54.5 cents per share, the Exchange
Ratio shall not be 5.5 shares and instead shall be
equal to the number obtained by dividing $3.00 by
the Average Trading Price; provided, however, that

consecutive Trading Days (as defined below) ending
on a date that is three Trading Days prior to the
date of the Carolco Stockholder Meeting and the LIVE

regular way, as reported in a composite published
report of transactions which includes transactions
on the exchange or other principal markets on which
such security is traded or, if there is no such
composite report as to any day, the last reported
sale price, regular way (or if there is no such

principal United States securities trading market
(whether a stock exchange, National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System or
otherwise) on which such security is traded, and

issued in payment for fractional interests shall be
denominated in U.S. dollars and drawn on a United
States bank.

(ii) Conversion of Carolco Preferred Stock. Each

of Carolco Series A Preferred Stock, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares

prior to the Effective Date shall remain unchanged
by virtue of the Merger. Each Share of Series C

Section 4.b LIVE to Make Certificates Available.

(i) Exchange of Common Stock Certificates. Prior
to the Effective Date, LIVE shall authorize American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company (or such other person
or persons as shall be acceptable to LIVE and
Carolco) to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the
"Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the Effective
Date, LIVE shall deposit with the Exchange Agent in
trust for the holders of certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Date represented
shares of Carolco Common Stock (the "Carolco Common
Certificates"), and, subject to Section 4.3, each
such holder will be entitled to receive, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent in the manner set
forth in subsection (d) below of one or more Carolco
Common Certificates for cancellation, certificates
representing the number of shares of LIVE Common
Stock into which the shares represented by such
Carolco Common Certificates were converted in the
Merger. LIVE Common Stock into which Carolco Common
Stock shall be converted in the Merger shall be
deemed to have been issued at the Effective Date,
and Carolco Common Certificates shall, at and after
the Effective Date, be deemed to represent only the
right to receive, upon surrender of such Carolco
Common Certificates, the certificates contemplated
by the preceding sentence.

(ii) Exchange of Series A Certificates. At or prior
to the Effective Date, LIVE shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent in trust for the holders of
certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Date represented shares of Carolco Series
A Preferred Stock ("Series A Certificates"), and,
subject to Section 4.3, each such holder will be
entitled to receive, upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent in the manner set forth in subsection (d)
below of one or more Series A Certificates for
cancellation, certificates representing the number
of shares of LIVE Series D Preferred Stock into
which the shares represented by such Series A
Certificates were converted in the Merger. LIVE
Series D Preferred Stock into which Carolco Series A
Preferred Stock shall be converted in the Merger
shall be deemed to exist as of the Effective Date,
and Series A Certificates shall, at and after the
Effective Date, be deemed to represent only the
right to receive, upon surrender of such Series A
Certificates, the certificates contemplated by the
preceding sentence.

(iii) Exchange of Old LIVE Certificates. At or
prior to the Effective Date, LIVE shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent in trust for the holders of
certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Date represented shares of LIVE Common
Stock or LIVE Series C Preferred Stock or of
certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Date represented Contingent Payment Rights
(as defined in Section 5.3) (collectively, "Old LIVE
Certificates"), and, subject to Section 4.3, each
such holder will be entitled to receive, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent in the manner set
forth in subsection (d) below of one or more Old
LIVE Certificates for cancellation, certificates
representing the number of shares of LIVE Common
Stock or LIVE Series C Preferred Stock or Contingent
Payment Rights (reflecting the change of LIVE's name
at the Effective Date), equal to the number of
shares or rights represented by the Old LIVE
Certificates so exchanged ("New LIVE Certificates"). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at and after the
Effective Date, until the holder of an Old LIVE
Certificate surrenders such Old LIVE Certificate to
the Exchange Agent for cancellation in the manner
set forth in subsection (d) below, each Old LIVE
Certificate shall continue to represent the same
number of shares of LIVE Common Stock, LIVE Series C
Preferred Stock or Contingent Payment Rights as such
Old LIVE Certificate represented immediately prior
to the Effective Date.

(iv) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Date, but in any event no later
than five business days thereafter, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record (at such
address as appears on the books of LIVE or Carolco
or as such holder shall otherwise designate) of a
Carolco Common Certificate, a Series A Certificate
and/or an Old LIVE Certificate, as the case may be
(any such certificates are sometimes referred to
hereinafter individually as a "Certificate," and
collectively as "Certificates"), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to such
Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery
of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as
LIVE and Carolco shall mutually specify, including
procedures to be followed in the event a holder has
lost his certificates) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of
LIVE Common Stock and/or LIVE Series D Preferred
Stock and/or for New LIVE Certificates (the
"Mailing"). Upon surrender of such a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, at the
offices of the Exchange Agent and as otherwise
specified in the transmittal letter from the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing that number of
whole shares of LIVE Common Stock, or that number of
whole shares of LIVE Series D Preferred Stock, which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this Article 4, or New LIVE Certificates in
accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2(c),
and the Certificate so surrendered shall be
cancelled.

Section 4.c Dividends; Transfer Taxes.

(i) Dividends. No dividends or other
distributions, if any, that are declared on or after
the Effective Date on LIVE Common Stock (other than
LIVE Common Stock represented by an Old LIVE
Certificate) or LIVE Series D Preferred Stock or are
payable to the holders of record thereof will be
paid with respect to shares of such LIVE Common
Stock (other than LIVE Common Stock represented by
an Old LIVE Certificate) or LIVE Series D Preferred
Stock, until the holders thereof surrender their
Carolco Common Certificates or Series A
Certificates, as applicable, as provided in
Section 4.2. Nothing in this Agreement shall
require holders of Old LIVE Certificates to
surrender such Old LIVE Certificates, as permitted
in Section 4.2, as a condition to receipt of any
dividend or other distribution, if any, payable to
such holder with respect to shares of LIVE Common
Stock, LIVE Series C Preferred Stock or Contingent
Payment Rights represented by such Old LIVE
Certificate. Subject to the effect of any
applicable laws, there shall be paid to such record
holder of the certificates representing such LIVE
Common Stock or LIVE Series D Preferred Stock at the
time of such surrender, if required, or the
appropriate payment date, if later, or as promptly
as practicable thereafter, the amount of any
dividends or other distributions theretofore paid
with respect to whole shares of such LIVE Common
Stock or LIVE Series D Preferred Stock and having a
record date on or after the Effective Date. In no
event shall the person entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions be entitled to
receive interest on such dividends or other
distributions. 

(ii) Transfer Taxes. No transfer taxes shall be
payable by a (i) holder of Carolco Common Stock or
Carolco Series A Preferred Stock in connection with
such holder's receipt of shares of LIVE Common Stock
or LIVE Series D Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, upon surrender of a Carolco Common Certificate
or Series A Certificate or (ii) holder of LIVE
Common Stock, LIVE Series C Preferred Stock or
Contingent Payment Rights in connection with such
holder's exchange of an Old LIVE Certificate for a
New LIVE Certificate, except in any event if any
certificate representing shares of LIVE Common
Stock, LIVE Preferred Stock or Contingent Payment
Rights is to be paid to or issued in a name other
than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise
in proper form for transfer (including any signature
guarantees necessary) and that the person requesting
such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates for such shares of LIVE
Common Stock or LIVE Preferred Stock in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the Carolco
Common Certificate, Series A Certificate, or Old
LIVE Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent or LIVE, as
appropriate, that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. For purposes of this Agreement, "LIVE
Preferred Stock" means, collectively, the LIVE
Series C Preferred Stock and the LIVE Series D
Preferred Stock.

(iii) Delay in Delivery. Any certificates
delivered to the Exchange Agent by LIVE pursuant to
Sections 4.2(a) or 4.2(b) representing shares of
LIVE Common Stock or LIVE Series D Preferred Stock
(or any dividends or distributions thereon) which
remain undistributed to the previous stockholders of
Carolco for six months after the date of the Mailing
(as defined above in Section 4.2(e)) shall be
returned to LIVE, upon demand. Any persons who were
previously stockholders of Carolco who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 4 shall
thereafter look only to LIVE (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar laws) for
payment of their claim for LIVE Common Stock or LIVE
Series D Preferred Stock (or any dividends or
distributions thereon). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of a Carolco
Common Certificate or Series A Certificate for any
shares of LIVE Common Stock or LIVE Series D
Preferred Stock (or any dividends or distributions
thereon) delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

Section 4.d No Further Ownership Rights in
Carolco Common Stock. All shares of LIVE Common
Stock or LIVE Series D Preferred Stock issued upon
the surrender for exchange of shares of Carolco
Common Stock or Carolco Series A Preferred Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Carolco Common Stock or
Carolco Series A Preferred Stock, subject, however,
to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distribution with a
record date prior to the Effective Date which may
have been declared or made by Carolco on such shares
of Carolco Common Stock or Carolco Series A
Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 4.e Closing of Carolco Transfer Books. 
Upon the Effective Date, the stock transfer books of
Carolco shall be closed and no transfer of Carolco
Common Stock or Carolco Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Date,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Article 4.

subsequently revised, amended or superseded by
later-filed LIVE SEC Documents through and including
the date of this Agreement, the LIVE SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the

filed with the SEC (the "LIVE Balance Sheet"), there
has been no Material Adverse Change in LIVE, and

LIVE, which were not set forth on the LIVE Balance

LIVE and its Subsidiaries have conducted their

under the Securities Act to be filed with the SEC
pursuant to Section 9.2 (the "Registration

together with any amendments or supplements thereto
included within the Registration Statement (the
"Proxy Statement") will (a) in the case of the
Registration Statement, at the time it becomes
effective, contain any statement which, at the time
and in the light of the circumstances under which it
is made, is false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or which omits to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, or (b) in the case of the Proxy

material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Act and the Proxy Statement will comply
(with respect to LIVE and CAC) as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the

information (including financial information and
financial statements) supplied by Carolco for
inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement.

Section 5.k Reorganization. Neither LIVE nor any
of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed
to take any action which action or failure to take
action would jeopardize the qualification of the
Merger as a tax free reorganization under the Code.

Section 5.l Litigation. Except as set forth in
the LIVE LETTER or the LIVE SEC Documents, as of the
date hereof, there is no claim, suit, action or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of LIVE,
threatened against or affecting LIVE or any of its

Material Adverse Effect on LIVE (and LIVE is not
aware of any reasonable basis for any such suit,
action or proceeding), or (ii) challenge the
transactions contemplated hereby at law or in equity
or before or by any federal, state, local, foreign
or other governmental department, commission, board,
agency, instrumentality, or authority; nor is there

Section 5.m Loan Agreements, Customers and
Suppliers.

(i) Neither LIVE nor any of its Subsidiaries is in

the giving of notice or both would cause such a
violation of or default under) any loan or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license
or any other contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding, to which it is a party or by which it
or any of its properties or assets is bound, except

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
LIVE or except as are set forth in the LIVE LETTER. 
Set forth in the LIVE LETTER is a list of each loan
or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture
and other agreement and instrument pursuant to which
any indebtedness of LIVE or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than indebtedness solely among or between
LIVE and/or any of its Subsidiaries), in an
aggregate principal amount in excess of $3,000,000
is outstanding or may be incurred and the respective
principal amounts currently outstanding thereunder. 
For purposes of this Agreement, "indebtedness" shall
mean, with respect to any person, without
duplication, (i) any liability, contingent or
otherwise, (x) for borrowed money (whether or not
the recourse of the lender is to the whole of the
assets of the person or only to a portion thereof),
(y) evidenced by a note, debenture or similar
instrument (including a purchase money obligation),
or (z) for the payment of money relating to a
capitalized lease obligation; (ii) any liability of
others of the kind described in the preceding clause
which the person has guaranteed or which is
otherwise its legal liability; (iii) any obligation
secured by a lien to which the property or assets of

by or shall otherwise be the person's legal
liability, and (iv) any and all deferrals, renewals,
extensions and refundings of, or amendments,
modifications or supplements to, any liability of
the kind described in any of the preceding clauses
(i), (ii) or (iii). 

(ii) Neither LIVE nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default under (nor does there exist any condition
which upon the passage of time, the giving of notice
or both would cause such a violation of or default
under) any material agreement with any of its
customers or suppliers of products or services which
are of material importance to LIVE or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no such customer or supplier, to
the knowledge of LIVE or any of its Subsidiaries, is
in default under (nor does there exist any condition
which upon the passage of time, the giving of notice
or both would cause such customer or supplier to be
in violation of or default under) any of such
material agreements or except as are set forth in
the LIVE LETTER.

Section 5.n Permits. LIVE and each of its
Subsidiaries possess all franchises, permits,
licenses, certificates, approvals or other
authorizations necessary to own or lease and operate
their properties and to conduct their businesses,
except for incidental franchises, permits, licenses,
certificates, approvals and other authorizations
that would be readily obtainable by any qualified
applicant without undue burden in the event of any
lapse, termination, cancellation or forfeiture or
which if not obtained would not, in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on LIVE.

Section 5.o Absence of Changes in LIVE Benefit
Plans. Except as disclosed in the LIVE SEC
Documents or the LIVE LETTER, since the date of the
most recent audited financial statements included in
the LIVE SEC Documents, there has not been any

or any bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred
compensation, incentive compensation, stock
ownership, stock purchase, stock option, phantom
stock, retirement, vacation, severance, disability,
death benefit, hospitalization, medical fringe
benefit or other plan, arrangement or understanding
(whether or not legally binding) providing benefits
to any current or former employee or director of, or
any other person providing services to, LIVE or any
of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "LIVE Benefit
Plans") which will have a Material Adverse Effect on
LIVE. LIVE has delivered to Carolco true, correct
and complete copies of all LIVE Benefit Plans. Each
of the LIVE Benefit Plans is in material compliance
with all applicable laws including the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA") and the Code.

Section 5.p Intellectual Property. LIVE and its
Subsidiaries own, or are licensed or otherwise have
the right to use, all patents, patent rights,
trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade
name rights, service marks, service mark rights,
copyrights and other proprietary intellectual
property rights and computer programs (collectively,
the "LIVE Proprietary Rights") which are material to
the conduct of the business of LIVE and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. No claims are
pending or, to the knowledge of LIVE, threatened
that LIVE or any Subsidiary is infringing or
otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any
person with regard to any LIVE Proprietary Right,
except for such claims or threats which could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on LIVE. To the knowledge of LIVE, no person
is infringing the rights of LIVE with respect to any
LIVE Proprietary Right that would have a Material
Adverse Effect on LIVE. No lien, encumbrance or
restriction with respect to any LIVE Proprietary
Right has a Material Adverse Effect on LIVE, or so
far as LIVE can now foresee could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on LIVE.

Section 5.q Environmental Matters. To the
knowledge of LIVE, LIVE and each of its Subsidiaries
are in compliance with all applicable federal,
state, regional and local laws, statutes,
ordinances, judgments, rulings and regulations
relating to any matters of pollution, protection of
the environment or environmental regulation or
control (collectively, "Environmental Laws"), except
for violations of the Environmental Laws that could
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
LIVE.

Section 5.r Taxes. Except as set forth in the
LIVE LETTER or the LIVE SEC Documents: (a) each of
LIVE and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all
federal, state, local or foreign tax returns
required to be filed by it (except for all such
returns the failure of which timely filing would,
individually or in the aggregate, not have a
Material Adverse Effect on LIVE), and has paid (or
LIVE has paid on its behalf) all taxes shown as due
on the returns in respect of the periods covered by
such returns; (b) there are no tax liens upon any
property or assets of LIVE or any of its
Subsidiaries which would have a Material Adverse

yet due; (c) neither LIVE nor any of its
Subsidiaries is delinquent in the payment of any
material tax, assessment or governmental charge
which would have a Material Adverse Effect on LIVE;
(d) no deficiencies for any taxes have been
proposed, asserted or assessed against LIVE or any
of its Subsidiaries which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on LIVE or its Subsidiaries, and no
requests for waivers of the time to assess any such
taxes are pending; and (e) no audits of the tax
returns of LIVE or any of its Subsidiaries are
currently being conducted by a taxing authority and
neither LIVE nor its Subsidiaries have received any
notices of pending or proposed audits from a taxing
authority.

the best knowledge of the officers of LIVE, neither
LIVE, any Subsidiary of LIVE nor any director,
officer, agent, employee or other person associated
with or acting on behalf of any of them has (i) used
any corporate or other funds for unlawful
contributions, payments, gifts or entertainment or
made any unlawful expenditures relating to political
activity, or made any direct or indirect unlawful
payments to governmental officials or others or
established or maintained any unlawful or unrecorded
funds in violation of Section 30A of the Exchange
Act or (ii) accepted or received any unlawful
contributions, payments, gifts or expenditures. 
LIVE is in compliance in all material respects with
the provisions of Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act
and to the best knowledge of the officers of LIVE,
there is no failure of compliance with such
provisions.

Section 5.t Brokers. No broker, investment
banker or other person, other than Chemical or
Jefferson Capital Corporation, the fees and expenses
of which will be paid by LIVE in accordance with
LIVE's written agreements with Chemical and
Jefferson Capital Corporation (copies of which have
been delivered by LIVE to Carolco prior to the date
hereof), is entitled to any broker's, finder's or
other similar fee or commission in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
LIVE, any Subsidiary of LIVE or CAC.

Section 5.u Officers, Directors and Key
Employees. The LIVE LETTER sets forth (i) the name
and total compensation of each officer and director
of LIVE; (ii) the name of each officer and director
of any of LIVE's Subsidiaries; (iii) the name and
total compensation of each other officer, director,
employee, consultant, agent or other representative
of LIVE or any of its Subsidiaries whose current
annual rate of compensation (including bonuses and
commissions) exceeds $150,000; (iv) all wage or
salary increases or bonuses received by the persons
identified in Section 5.21(i) and (iii)
("Significant LIVE Employees") since December 31,

by LIVE or any of its Subsidiaries to pay such
increases or bonuses; and (v) a notation with
respect to each of such Significant LIVE Employees,
whether they have an employment agreement with LIVE
or any of its Subsidiaries and, if so, the date and
term of such agreement. Except as set forth in the
LIVE LETTER, (x) to the knowledge of LIVE or any of
its Subsidiaries, none of such Significant LIVE
Employees has made a threat to LIVE or any of its
Subsidiaries or to any of their officers or
directors to cancel or otherwise terminate such
Significant LIVE Employee's relationship with LIVE
or any of its Subsidiaries and (y) none of such
Significant LIVE Employees have "change of control"
clauses or agreements with LIVE or any of its
Subsidiaries (or similar clauses or agreements
permitting such Significant LIVE Employees to
terminate their employment relationship with LIVE or
any of its Subsidiaries) that would be triggered by
the Merger which have not been waived on the date
hereof.

Section 5.v State Takeover Statutes. Neither
Section 203 of the DGCL nor any other "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other
state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation applies to the Merger by virtue of LIVE
and CAC engaging in the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 5.w Insurance. LIVE and each of its
Subsidiaries have been and are insured by
financially sound and reputable insurers with
respect to their properties and the conduct of their
business in such amounts and against such risks as
are reasonable in relation to their respective
businesses, and each will use its best efforts to
maintain such insurance. Such insurance is in full
force and effect and no notice of cancellation or
termination has been received with respect to any of
said insurance. Except as disclosed in the LIVE
LETTER, there are no claims pending thereunder
except where such claim would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
LIVE.

Section 5.x Title to Properties and Related
Matters. Except with respect to the LIVE
Proprietary Rights, LIVE and each of its
Subsidiaries have good and marketable title (or
valid and subsisting leasehold interests) to all of
the personal properties and assets (tangible and
intangible) and the real properties utilized in
their businesses or reflected in the LIVE SEC
Documents or acquired after the date thereof (other
than properties sold or otherwise disposed of in the
ordinary course of business), which are material to
them, free and clear of all title defects, liens,
encumbrances and restrictions, except (i) as
reflected in the LIVE SEC Documents, (ii) to the
extent not described in clause (i), those described
in the LIVE LETTER, (iii) to the extent not
described in clause (i), statutory liens not yet due
or delinquent or the validity of which are being
contested or litigated in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which LIVE has set aside on its
books reserves that are adequate with respect
thereto; and (iv) liens, encumbrances, covenants,
rights of way, building or use restrictions,
easements, exceptions, variances, reservations and
other matters or limitations of any kind, if any,
which, when considered together with the liens
described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), do not
have a Material Adverse Effect on LIVE's business or
operations. All properties of LIVE and each of its
Subsidiaries are reflected in the LIVE SEC Documents
in the manner and to the extent required by
generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied. Neither the whole nor any
portion of the leaseholds or any other assets of
LIVE or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
governmental decree or order to be sold or is being
condemned, expropriated or otherwise taken by any
public authority with or without payment of
compensation therefor, nor to the knowledge of LIVE
or any of its Subsidiaries has any such
condemnation, expropriation or taking been proposed,
which would have a Material Adverse Effect on LIVE
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Section 5.y Accuracy of LIVE Disclosure. Neither
this Agreement, nor any document or other paper
furnished (or to be furnished pursuant hereto at the
Closing) by or on behalf of LIVE or CAC to Carolco
pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, contains or will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made, in
the context in which made, not false or misleading. 
There is no fact that LIVE has not disclosed to
Carolco in writing that has a Material Adverse
Effect on LIVE, or so far as LIVE can now foresee
will have a Material Adverse Effect on LIVE or on
the ability of LIVE to perform this Agreement.

Material Adverse Effect on Carolco.

lapse of time, or both) under, or result in or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or

filed all required reports, statements, forms and
documents with the SEC that Carolco was required to
file during the three-year period immediately
preceding the date hereof (the "Carolco SEC

subsequently revised, amended or superseded by
later-filed Carolco SEC Documents through and
including the date of this Agreement, the Carolco

or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The financial statements of
Carolco included in Carolco SEC Documents comply as
to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (except, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by Regulation S-X
promulgated by the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and
fairly present the consolidated financial position
of Carolco and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at
the dates thereof and the consolidated results of
their operations and statements of cash flows for
the periods included therein (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments and to any other adjustments described
therein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Carolco
makes no representation or warranty in this
Agreement regarding any information (including
financial information and financial statements)
supplied by LIVE for inclusion in any Carolco SEC
Documents.

Section 6.f No Material Adverse Change. Except
as set forth in the CAROLCO LETTER, since the date
of the most recent balance sheet and notes to
consolidated financial statements contained in
Carolco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 1993, or Carolco's Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31,
1994, as filed with the SEC ("Carolco Balance
Sheet"), there has been no Material Adverse Change
in Carolco and neither Carolco nor any of its
Subsidiaries knows of any such Material Adverse
Change that is threatened, nor has there been any
damage, destruction or loss affecting the assets,
properties, business, operations or condition
(financial or otherwise) of Carolco or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance
which would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Carolco, and which has not been subsequently
reported in any of the Carolco SEC Documents filed
with the SEC prior to the date hereof.

Section 6.g Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. 
Except as set forth in the Carolco SEC Documents or
the CAROLCO LETTER, as of the date of the Carolco
Balance Sheet neither Carolco nor any of its
Subsidiaries had any liabilities or obligations of
any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) required by generally accepted accounting
principles to be set forth on a financial statement
or in the notes thereto and which, individually or
in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse
Effect on Carolco, which were not set forth on the
Carolco Balance Sheet.

Section 6.h Absence of Certain Events. Except as
disclosed in Carolco SEC Documents or the CAROLCO
LETTER, since the date of the Carolco Balance Sheet,

engaged in any activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties (other than LIVE) in
respect of a "takeover proposal" or an "offer" (both
as defined in Section 8.3).

Section 6.j Registration Statement and Proxy
Statement. None of the information to be supplied
by Carolco for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement will (a) in the case of the Registration
Statement, at the time it becomes effective, contain
any statement which, at the time and in the light of
the circumstances under which it is made, is false
or misleading with respect to any material fact, or
which omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not false or misleading, or (b)
in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the time of
the mailing of the Proxy Statement and at the times
of the Stockholder Meetings, contain any statement
which, at the time and in the light of the
circumstances under which it is made, is false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or
which omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not false or misleading. The
Registration Statement will comply (with respect to
Carolco) as to form in all material respects with
the provisions of the Securities Act and the Proxy
Statement will comply (with respect to Carolco) as
to form in all material respects with the provisions
of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Carolco makes no representation or warranty
regarding any information (including financial
information and financial statements) supplied by
LIVE or CAC for inclusion in the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement.

Section 6.k Reorganization. Neither Carolco nor
any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action nor
failed to take any action which action or failure to
take action would jeopardize the qualification of
the Merger as a tax free reorganization under the
Code.

Section 6.l Litigation. Except as set forth in
the CAROLCO LETTER or the Carolco SEC Documents, as
of the date hereof, there is no claim, suit, action
or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of
Carolco, threatened against or affecting Carolco or
any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not covered by
insurance) which (i) could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Carolco (and
Carolco is not aware of any reasonable basis for any
such suit, action or proceeding), or (ii) challenge
the transactions contemplated hereby at law or in
equity or before or by any federal, state, local,
foreign or other governmental department,
commission, board, agency, instrumentality, or
authority; nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity
or arbitrator outstanding against Carolco or any of
its Subsidiaries having, or which, insofar as
reasonably can be foreseen, in the future would
have, any such effect.

Section 6.m Loan Agreements, Customers and
Suppliers.

(i) Neither Carolco nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in violation of or in default under (nor does there
exist any condition which upon the passage of time,
the giving of notice or both would cause such a
violation of or default under) any loan or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license
or any other contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding, to which it is a party or by which it
or any of its properties or assets is bound, except
for violations or defaults that could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Carolco or except as are set forth in the CAROLCO
LETTER. Set forth in the CAROLCO LETTER is a list
of each loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture and other agreement and
instrument pursuant to which any indebtedness of
Carolco or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
indebtedness solely among or between Carolco and/or

amount in excess of $3,000,000 is outstanding or may
be incurred and the respective principal amounts
currently outstanding thereunder.

(ii) Neither Carolco nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in default under (nor does there exist any condition
which upon the passage of time, the giving of notice
or both would cause such a violation of or default
under) any material agreement with any of its
customers or suppliers of products or services which
are of material importance to Carolco or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no such customer or supplier, to
the knowledge of Carolco or any of its Subsidiaries,
is in default under (nor does there exist any
condition which upon the passage of time, the giving
of notice or both would cause such customer or
supplier to be in violation of or default under) any
of such material agreements or except as are set
forth in the CAROLCO LETTER.

Section 6.n Permits. Carolco and each of its
Subsidiaries possess all franchises, permits,
licenses, certificates, approvals or other
authorizations necessary to own or lease and operate
their properties and to conduct their businesses,
except for incidental franchises, permits, licenses,
certificates, approvals and other authorizations
that would be readily obtainable by any qualified
applicant without undue burden in the event of any
lapse, termination, cancellation or forfeiture or
which if not obtained would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Carolco.

Section 6.o Absence of Changes in Carolco Benefit
Plans. Except as disclosed in the Carolco SEC
Documents or the CAROLCO LETTER, since the date of
the most recent audited financial statements
included in the Carolco SEC Documents, there has not
been any adoption or amendment by Carolco or any of
its Subsidiaries of any collective bargaining
agreement or any bonus, pension, profit sharing,
deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock
ownership, stock purchase, stock option, phantom
stock, retirement, vacation, severance, disability,
death benefit, hospitalization, medical fringe
benefit or other plan, arrangement or understanding
(whether or not legally binding) providing benefits
to any current or former employee or director of, or
any other person providing services to, Carolco or
any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Carolco
Benefit Plans") which will have a Material Adverse
Effect on Carolco. Carolco has delivered to LIVE
true, correct and complete copies of all Carolco
Benefit Plans. Each of the Carolco Benefit Plans is
in material compliance with all applicable laws
including ERISA and the Code.

Section 6.p Intellectual Property. Carolco and
its Subsidiaries own, or are licensed or otherwise
have the right to use, all patents, patent rights,
trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade
name rights, service marks, service mark rights,
copyrights and other proprietary intellectual
property rights and computer programs (collectively,
the "Carolco Proprietary Rights") which are material
to the conduct of the business of Carolco and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. No claims are
pending or, to the knowledge of Carolco, threatened
that Carolco or any of its Subsidiaries is
infringing or otherwise adversely affecting the
rights of any person with regard to any Carolco
Proprietary Right, except for such claims or threats
which could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Carolco. To the
knowledge of Carolco, no person is infringing the
rights of Carolco with respect to any Carolco
Proprietary Right that would have a Material Adverse
Effect on Carolco. No lien, encumbrance or
restriction with respect to any Carolco Proprietary
Right has a Material Adverse Effect on Carolco, or
so far as Carolco can now foresee could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Carolco.

Section 6.q Environmental Matters. To the
knowledge of Carolco, Carolco and each of its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws, except for violations of the
Environmental Laws that could not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect on Carolco.

Section 6.r Taxes. Except as set forth in the
CAROLCO LETTER or the Carolco SEC Documents: (a)
each of Carolco and its Subsidiaries has timely
filed all federal, state, local or foreign tax
returns required to be filed by it (except for all
such returns the failure of which timely filing
would, individually or in the aggregate, not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Carolco), and has paid
(or Carolco has paid on its behalf) all taxes shown
as due on the returns in respect of the periods
covered by such returns; (b) there are no tax liens
upon any property or assets of Carolco or any of its
Subsidiaries which would have a Material Adverse
Effect on Carolco, except liens for current taxes
not yet due; (c) neither Carolco nor any of its
Subsidiaries is delinquent in the payment of any
material tax, assessment or governmental charge
which would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Carolco; (d) no deficiencies for any taxes have been
proposed, asserted or assessed against Carolco or
any of its Subsidiaries which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Carolco or its Subsidiaries, and
no requests for waivers of the time to assess any
such taxes are pending; and (e) no audits of the tax
returns of Carolco or any of its Subsidiaries are
currently being conducted by a taxing authority, and
neither Carolco nor its Subsidiaries have received
any notices of pending or proposed audits from a
taxing authority. 

Section 6.s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. To
the best knowledge of the officers of Carolco,
neither Carolco, any Subsidiary of Carolco nor any
director, officer, agent, employee or other person
associated with or acting on behalf of any of them
has (i) used any corporate or other funds for
unlawful contributions, payments, gifts or
entertainment or made any unlawful expenditures
relating to political activity, or made any direct
or indirect unlawful payments to governmental
officials or others or established or maintained any
unlawful or unrecorded funds in violation of Section
30A of the Exchange Act or (ii) accepted or received
any unlawful contributions, payments, gifts or
expenditures. Carolco is in compliance in all
material respects with the provisions of Section
13(b) of the Exchange Act and to the best knowledge
of the officers of Carolco, there is no failure of
compliance with such provisions.

Section 6.t Brokers. No broker, investment
banker or other person, other than Seidler or
Daniels & Associates, the fees and expenses of which
will be paid by Carolco in accordance with Carolco's
written agreement with Seidler and Daniels &
Associates (copies of which have been delivered by
Carolco to LIVE prior to the date hereof), is
entitled to any broker's, finder's or other similar
fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Carolco.

Section 6.u Officers, Directors and Key
Employees. The CAROLCO LETTER sets forth (i) the
name and total compensation of each officer and
director of Carolco; (ii) the name of each officer
and director of any of Carolco's Subsidiaries; (iii)
the name and total compensation of each other
officer, director, employee, consultant, agent or
other representative of Carolco or any of its
Subsidiaries whose current annual rate of
compensation (including bonuses and commissions)
exceeds $150,000; (iv) all wage or salary increases
or bonuses received by the persons identified in
Section 6.21(i) and (iii) ("Significant Carolco
Employees") since December 31, 1993, and any accrual
for or commitment or agreement by Carolco or any of
its Subsidiaries to pay such increases or bonuses;
and (v) a notation with respect to each of such
Significant Carolco Employees, whether they have an
employment agreement with Carolco or any of its
Subsidiaries and, if so, the date and term of such
agreement. Except as set forth in the CAROLCO
LETTER, (x) to the knowledge of Carolco or any of
its Subsidiaries, none of such Significant Carolco
Employees has made a threat to Carolco or any of its
Subsidiaries or to any of their officers or
directors to cancel or otherwise terminate such
Significant Carolco Employee's relationship with
Carolco or any of its Subsidiaries and (y) none of
such Significant Carolco Employees have "change of
control" clauses or agreements with Carolco or any
of its Subsidiaries (or similar clauses or
agreements permitting such Significant Carolco
Employees to terminate their employment relationship
with Carolco or any of its Subsidiaries) that would
be triggered by the Merger which have not been
waived on the date hereof.

Section 6.v State Takeover Statutes. Neither
Section 203 of the DGCL nor any other "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other
state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation applies to the Merger by virtue of
Carolco engaging in the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

Section 6.w Insurance. Carolco and each of its
Subsidiaries have been and are insured by
financially sound and reputable insurers with
respect to their properties and the conduct of their
business in such amounts and against such risks as
are reasonable in relation to their respective
businesses, and each will use its best efforts to
maintain such insurance. Such insurance is in full
force and effect and no notice of cancellation or
termination has been received with respect to any of
said insurance. Except as disclosed in the CAROLCO
LETTER, there are no claims pending thereunder
except where such claim would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Carolco. 

Section 6.x Title to Properties and Related
Matters. Except with respect to the Carolco
Proprietary Rights, Carolco and each of its
Subsidiaries have good and marketable title (or
valid and subsisting leasehold interests) to all of
the personal properties and assets (tangible and
intangible) and the real properties utilized in
their businesses or reflected in the Carolco SEC
Documents or acquired after the date thereof (other
than properties sold or otherwise disposed of in the
ordinary course of business) which are material to
them, free and clear of all title defects, liens,
encumbrances and restrictions, except (i) as
reflected in the Carolco SEC Documents, (ii) to the
extent not described in clause (i), those described
in the CAROLCO LETTER, (iii) to the extent not
described in clause (i), statutory liens not yet due
or delinquent or the validity of which are being
contested or litigated in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which Carolco has set aside on
its books reserves that are adequate with respect
thereto; and (iv) liens, encumbrances, covenants,
rights of way, building or use restrictions,
easements, exceptions, variances, reservations and
other matters or limitations of any kind, if any,
which, when considered together with the liens
described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), do not
have a Material Adverse Effect on Carolco's business
or operations. All properties of Carolco and each
of its Subsidiaries are reflected in the Carolco SEC
Documents in the manner and to the extent required
by generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied. Neither the whole nor any
portion of the leaseholds or any other assets of
Carolco or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
governmental decree or order to be sold or is being
condemned, expropriated or otherwise taken by any
public authority with or without payment of
compensation therefor, nor to the knowledge of
Carolco or any of its Subsidiaries has any such
condemnation, expropriation or taking been proposed,
which would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Carolco and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Section 6.y Accuracy of Carolco Disclosure. 
Neither this Agreement, nor any document or other
paper furnished (or to be furnished pursuant hereto
at the Closing) by or on behalf of Carolco to LIVE
pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, contains or will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made, in
the context in which made, not false or misleading. 
There is no fact that Carolco has not disclosed to
LIVE in writing that has a Material Adverse Effect
on Carolco or so far as Carolco can now foresee will
have a Material Adverse Effect on Carolco or on the
ability of Carolco to perform this Agreement.

under, any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of CAC, true and complete
copies of which as of the date hereof have been
delivered to Carolco.

a breach of any material contract or commitment of
Carolco or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such
breaches (other than of the provisions of this
Agreement) as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Carolco.

(iii) Compliance with Laws. Carolco and each of

thereof would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on Carolco.

(iv) Tax Returns. Carolco and each of its
Subsidiaries shall prepare, file and pay amounts

not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any
action that would, or that could reasonably be
expected to, result in (i) any of the
representations and warranties of Carolco set forth
in this Agreement that are qualified as to

qualified becoming untrue in any material respect,
or (iii) any of the conditions set forth in Article

(vi) Advice of Changes; SEC Filings. Carolco shall
promptly advise LIVE in writing of any change or
event having, or which, insofar as can reasonably be
foreseen, would have, a Material Adverse Effect on
Carolco without regard to whether such change or

promptly advise Chemical in writing of any change or
event or any other information which would
materially impact the Chemical Fairness Opinion,
including material write-downs, litigation or
changes in financial condition or capitalization
without regard to whether such change or event would
be permitted hereunder. Carolco shall promptly
provide LIVE (or its counsel) with copies of all
filings made by Carolco with the SEC or any other
Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 8.c Competing Offers. Either LIVE or
Carolco may accept a competing "takeover proposal"
or "offer" if the Board of Directors of LIVE or
Carolco, as the case may be, declare such "takeover
proposal" or "offer" advisable, in the best interest
of LIVE or Carolco, as the case may be, and that the
terms, in the aggregate, of such "takeover proposal"
or "offer" are better than the terms of the Merger
as provided herein, provided, however, that LIVE or
Carolco, as the case may be, shall pay the costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger in
accordance with Section 9.7 hereof. In the case of
Carolco, "takeover proposal" or "offer" shall mean
any proposal or offer, other than a proposal or
offer by LIVE or any of its affiliates, for a tender
or exchange offer, a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving Carolco or any
Subsidiary of Carolco or any proposal to acquire in
any manner all or a substantial equity interest in,
or all or a substantial portion of the assets of,
Carolco or any of its Subsidiaries other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the
case of LIVE, "takeover proposal" or "offer" shall
mean any proposal or offer, other than a proposal or
offer by Carolco or any of its affiliates, for a
tender or exchange offer, a merger, consolidation or
other business combination involving LIVE or any
Subsidiary of LIVE (other than Strawberries or VCL)
or any proposal to acquire in any manner all or a
substantial equity interest in, or all or a
substantial portion of the assets of, LIVE or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than Strawberries or VCL)
other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Nothing herein shall prevent LIVE from
selling all or any part of its Strawberries or VCL
subsidiaries on terms previously disclosed to
Carolco or otherwise acceptable to Carolco.

Section 8.d Reorganization. During the period
from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Date, unless the other parties hereto
shall otherwise agree in writing, none of LIVE, CAC,
any other Subsidiary of LIVE, Carolco nor any
Subsidiary of Carolco shall knowingly take or fail
to take any action which action or failure to act
would jeopardize qualification of the Merger as a
tax free reorganization under the Code.

Section 8.e Conduct of Business of CAC Pending
the Merger. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Date, CAC shall not
engage in any activities of any nature except as
provided in or contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.f Update of LIVE LETTER and CAROLCO
LETTER. LIVE will update the LIVE LETTER and
Carolco will update the CAROLCO LETTER (the CAROLCO
LETTER and the LIVE LETTER are sometimes referred to
herein collectively as the "Letters" and
individually as a "Letter") from time to time
hereafter until the Closing, including as of the
date of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and as of
the date of the Closing, to the extent any
information disclosed on such Letters requires
updating because of a change in facts or
circumstances, and to the extent any new information
that would have been included in either of such
Letters on the date hereof had such information
existed or been known on the date hereof later comes
to the knowledge of LIVE or Carolco, as the case may
be. The update of such Letters shall not modify or
add additional exceptions to representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein; any
updating of the LIVE LETTER or CAROLCO LETTER which
subsequently makes materially inaccurate as of the
date of this Agreement any representation or
warranty that is qualified as to materiality, or
makes inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement
any representation or warranty that is not qualified
as to materiality, shall be deemed a material breach
of this Agreement by the party whose representation
or warranty was so made inaccurate; and neither
party shall, by any update of its respective Letter,
be relieved from the conditions set forth in
Sections 10.2(a) and 10.2(b) and 10.3(a) and 10.3(b)
concerning the truth and correctness of such
parties' respective representations and warranties
contained herein on and as of the Effective Date. 

Section 8.g Bringdown of Fairness Opinion. LIVE
will request that Chemical confirm the Chemical
Fairness Opinion and Carolco will request that
Seidler confirm the Seidler Fairness Opinion each as
of the day immediately preceding the Effective Date
without any material change in any conclusions or
opinions contained therein.

Option and Stock Appreciation Rights Plan of Carolco
(the "1989 Plan") (the 1986 Plan and the 1989 Plan
are sometimes referred to hereinafter collectively
as the "Carolco Stock Plans"). Each option to
purchase shares of Carolco Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Date pursuant to
the Carolco Stock Plans (a "Plan Option") shall
become and represent an option to purchase that
number of shares of LIVE Common Stock (a "New Stock
Option") as the holder of such Plan Option would
have been entitled to receive by virtue of the
Merger had it exercised such Plan Option immediately
prior to the Effective Date, at an exercise price
per share equal to the exercise price per share of
such Plan Option immediately prior to the Effective
Date multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. After the

9.8, each New Stock Option shall be exercisable upon
the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the related Plan Option prior to the Effective
Date.

Option shall be credited to the applicable successor

New Stock Options or Carolco stock appreciation
rights under the Carolco Stock Plans as assumed by

Effective Date, LIVE may grant LIVE stock options or
LIVE stock appreciation rights only pursuant to a
1994 Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Rights Plan

AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS 
for the regulation, except as otherwise providedby
statute or the Certificate of Incorporation of
Carolco Entertainment Inc.

Article 1
General Provisions

Section 1.1 Principal Executive Office

The principal executive office of the Corporation
shall be located at 8800 Sunset Boulevard, Los
Angeles, California 90069. The Board of Directors
shall have the power to change the principal office
to another location and may fix and locate one or
more subsidiary offices at any place.

Section 1.2 Number of Directors

The affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by a
Board of Directors (the "Board") consisting of not
less than three (3) nor more than twenty-one (21)
directors. Directors need not be Stockholders or
citizens or residents of the United States. The
exact number of directors within the limits
specified shall be twenty-one (21) until changed by
an amendment to these Bylaws duly adopted by the
Board or by the Stockholders.

Section 1.3 Registration of Shares

The Corporation shall recognize each person
registered in its stock ledger as the exclusive
owner and holder of the shares registered in his
name and as the "Stockholder" for all purposes
hereunder with the exclusive rights inter alia to
vote the shares, to receive dividends declared with
respect to the shares, to transfer the shares to
others, and to exercise any other rights of
Stockholders. The Corporation shall have no
obligation to recognize any equitable or other claim
or interest in any shares on the part of any person
or persons other than the registered owner, as set
forth in the stock ledger, whether or not the
Corporation shall have any notice thereof, except as
may otherwise be provided by the laws of the State
of Delaware. "Shares" for purposes hereof, shall
mean shares of the Corporation's stock authorized by
its Certificate of Incorporation and registered in
the stock ledger as issued and outstanding,
including any one or more classes of stock so
authorized, and whether or not such share is deemed
to have voting or other privileges.

Article 2
Shares and Stockholders

Section 2.1 Share Certificates

A. In General

The Corporation shall issue a certificate or
certificates representing shares of its capital
stock. Each certificate so issued shall be signed
by or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman
or Vice Chairman of the Board or the President or a
Vice President and by the Chief Financial Officer,
Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary
or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation and
shall state the name of the record owner thereof and
represent the number of shares registered in
certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on
the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any
officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed
or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer,
transfer agent or registrar before such certificate
is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with
the same effect as if such person were an officer,
transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

B. Form of Certificates

There shall be set forth on the face or back of a
certificate which the Corporation shall issue to
represent a class or series of stock one of the
following:

1. A statement of the powers, designations,
preferences and relative participating, optional or
other special rights of each class of stock or
series thereof and the qualifications, limitations
or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights;
or

2. A summary of the statement described in
Subsection 2.1.B.1 above.

If a security of the Corporation is subject to a
restriction on the transfer or registration thereof,
such restriction shall be noted, in writing,
conspicuously upon the certificate representing the
security.

C. Fractional Share Interests

The Corporation may, but shall not be required to,
issue certificates representing a fraction of a
share and, in this event, the holder thereof shall
have all the rights appurtenant to ownership of that
interest in the Corporation. If the Corporation
elects not to issue certificates representing a
fraction of a share to the persons entitled thereto,
it shall, at its election, either:

1. Arrange for disposition of the fractional
interest by those entitled thereto.

2. Pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a
share as of the time when those entitled to receive
such fractions are determined.

3. Issue scrip or warrants in registered or bearer
form which entitles the holder to receive a full
share upon surrender of such scrip or warrants
aggregating one or more full shares, which scrip or
warrants may, if the Board elects, either become (i)
void if not so surrendered on or before a specified
date, or (ii) subject to such other conditions or
limitations as may be designated by the Board.

Section 2.2 Transfer of Certificates

Where a certificate for shares is presented to the
Corporation or its transfer clerk or transfer agent
with a request to register a transfer of shares, the
Corporation is under a duty to register the
transfer, cancel the certificate presented, and
issue a new certificate if:

A. The certificate is endorsed or the instructions
originated by the appropriate person or persons;

B. Reasonable assurance is given that those
endorsements or instructions are genuine and
effective;

C. The Corporation has no duty to inquire into
adverse claims or has discharged any such duty;

D. Any applicable law relating to the collection
of taxes has been complied with; and

E. The transfer is in fact rightful or is to a
bona fide purchaser.

Section 2.3 Lost Certificates

Where a certificate is alleged to have been lost,
destroyed or stolen, the Corporation shall issue a
new certificate in place of the original if the
owner:

A. So requests, in writing, before the Corporation
has notice that the certificate has been acquired by
a bona fide purchaser; and

B. If so requested by the Board, gives the
Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it
against any claim that may be made against it on
account of the alleged loss, destruction or theft of
such certificate or the issuance of such new
certificate.

Except as above provided, no new certificate for
shares shall be issued in lieu of an old certificate
unless the Corporation is ordered to do so by a
court in a judgment in an action brought in a court
of appropriate jurisdiction.

Section 2.4 Meetings of Stockholders

A. Place of Meetings

Meetings of Stockholders shall be held at any place
within or without the State of Delaware designated
by the Board. In the absence of any such
designation, Stockholders' meetings shall be held at
the principal executive office of the Corporation.
B. Annual Meetings

An annual meeting of the Stockholders of the
Corporation shall be held for the election of
directors on the date and at the time fixed, from
time to time, by the Board. The first annual
meeting shall be held on a date within thirteen (13)
months after the organization of the Corporation and
each subsequent annual meeting shall be held on a
date within thirteen (13) months after the
immediately preceding annual meeting. Any other
proper subject for Stockholder consideration may be
transacted which may be presented at the meeting,
whether or not included in the notice of the
meeting.

C. Special Meetings

Special meetings of the Stockholders may be called
by the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the
President, or by the holders of shares entitled to
cast not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
votes at the meeting. Upon request in writing to
the Chairman of the Board, the President, any Vice
President or the Secretary by any person (other than
the Board) entitled to call a special meeting of
Stockholders, the officer forthwith shall cause
notice to be given to the Stockholders entitled to
vote that a meeting will be held at a time requested
by the person or persons calling the meeting not
less than thirty-five (35) nor more than sixty (60)
days after the receipt of the request. If the
notice is not given within twenty (20) days after
receipt of the request, the persons entitled to call
the meeting may give the notice.

D. Notice of Meetings

1. Except to the extent otherwise provided by
applicable law or unless lapse of time shall be
waived, written notice of any Stockholders' meeting
shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than
sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to
each Stockholder entitled to vote thereat. Each
notice shall state the place, date and hour of the
meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. 
The notice of any meeting may be accompanied by any
additional documents, statements or information
which may be selected by the persons calling the
meeting or which may be prescribed by any applicable
law or regulation.

2. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to
the Stockholder at his address as it appears on the
records of the Corporation. An affidavit of the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the
transfer agent of the Corporation that the notice
has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

E. Adjourned Meetings and Notice Thereof

Any meeting of Stockholders may be adjourned from
time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares
represented either in person or by proxy whether or
not a quorum is present. When a Stockholders'
meeting is adjourned to another time or place,
notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if
the time and place thereof are announced at the
meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the
adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any
business which might have been transacted at the
original meeting. However, if the adjournment is
for more than thirty (30) days or if after the
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting
shall be given to each Stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the meeting.

F. Waiver of Notice

The transactions of any meeting of Stockholders,
however called and noticed, and wherever held, are
as valid as though they had taken place at a meeting
duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum
is present either in person or by proxy, and if,
either before or after the meeting, each of the
persons entitled to vote, not present in person or
by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a
consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval
of the minutes thereof. No Stockholder may object
to any failure to comply with the provisions of this
Section if either (i) at any time before or after
the meeting he exercises a written waiver of notice
or (ii) he attends one meeting in person or by
proxy, except if he attends solely for the express
purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting
to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any
waiver of notice or consent need not specify either
the business to be transacted or the purpose of any
annual or special meeting of Stockholders. All such
waivers, consents and approvals shall be filed with
the corporate records or made a part of the minutes
of the meeting.

G. Quorum/Majority Vote

Except as otherwise provided by the laws of the
State of Delaware, a majority of shares entitled to
vote, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business. If a quorum is present, the affirmative
vote of the majority of the voting shares
represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on
any matter shall be the act of the Stockholders,
unless the vote of a greater number or voting by
classes is required by law or under the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Corporation. The
Stockholders present at a duly called or held
meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to
transact business until adjournment notwithstanding
the withdrawal of enough Stockholders to leave less
than a quorum, provided that any action taken (other
than adjournment) must be approved by at least a
majority of the shares required to constitute a
quorum.

H. Conduct of Meetings

Meetings of Stockholders shall be presided over by
one of the following officers in the following order
by seniority, if present and acting: Chairman of
the Board, Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, the
President or any Vice President selected in the
order of chronological age. The Secretary of the
Corporation or, in his absence, any Assistant
Secretary shall act as Secretary of the meeting. In
lieu of the foregoing persons, the Board may
designate a Chairman and/or Secretary at any meeting
of the Stockholders. All meetings shall be
conducted by reference to Roberts Rules of Order or
other parliamentary system selected by the chairman
of the meeting and not inconsistent with these
Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or any
applicable law.

I. Nominations for Directors

Nominations for the election of directors may be
made at any meeting at which directors are to be
elected by the Board or its designees or by any
Stockholder entitled to vote for directors generally
at that meeting. Nomination may be made by
Stockholders only if written notice thereof is given
to the Secretary of the Corporation at least ten
(10) days in advance of the meeting or two (2) days
after service of notice of the meeting (whichever
shall occur last). Said notice should identify the
person or persons whom the Stockholder wishes to
nominate and give the residential address of the
nominee and the nominee's business qualifications
for such position. The chairman of the meeting may
refuse to acknowledge any nominations not made in
accordance with the foregoing procedure or in
accordance with applicable law.

Section 2.5 Action Without a Meeting

Any action required or permitted to be taken at any
annual or special meeting of Stockholders may be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and
without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed
by the holders of outstanding shares having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be
necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted and shall be delivered to the
Corporation by delivery (by hand or by certified and
registered mail, return receipt requested) to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its
principal place of business, or to the Secretary of
the Corporation. Where the approval of Stockholders
is given without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent, unless the consents of all
Stockholders entitled to vote have been solicited in
writing, the Secretary shall give prompt notice of
the corporate action approved by the Stockholders
without a meeting. Such notice shall be given in
the same manner as notice of Stockholders' meetings. 
All such written consents shall be filed with the
minutes of proceedings of the Stockholders and
actions authorized or taken under such written
consents shall have the same force and effect as
those adopted by vote of the Stockholders at any
annual or special meeting thereof.

Section 2.6 Voting of Shares

A. In General

Except as may otherwise be prescribed by the
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each
share of stock shall entitle the holder thereof to
one vote. In the election of directors, a plurality
of the votes cast shall elect. Any other action
shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast
except where the applicable law in the State of
Delaware prescribes a different percentage of votes
and/or a different exercise of voting power, and
except as may be otherwise prescribed by the
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and
these Bylaws.

B. Secret Voting by Ballot

Elections for directors and voting in other matters
need not be by secret ballot unless any Stockholder
demands voting by secret ballot on the applicable
issue at the meeting and before the voting begins.

C. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders

Shares of capital stock of the Corporation standing
in the name of another Corporation, domestic or
foreign, and entitled to vote may be voted by such
officer, agent or proxy as the by-laws of such other
Corporation may prescribe or, in the absence of such
provision, as the board of directors of such other
Corporation may determine.

Shares of capital stock of the Corporation standing
in the name of a deceased person, a minor, an
incompetent or a Corporation declared bankrupt and
entitled to vote may be voted by an administrator,
executor, guardian, conservator or trustee, as the
case may be, either in person or by proxy, without
transfer of such shares into the name of the
official so voting.

A Stockholder whose shares of capital stock of the
Corporation are pledged shall be entitled to vote
such shares unless on the transfer books of the
Corporation the pledgor has expressly empowered the
pledgee to vote such shares, in which case only the
pledgee, or such pledgee's proxy, may represent such
shares and vote thereon.

Shares of capital stock of the Corporation belonging
to the Corporation, or to another corporation if a
majority of the shares entitled to vote in the
election of directors of such other corporation
shall be held by the Corporation, shall not be voted
at any meeting of Stockholders and shall not be
counted in determining the total number of
outstanding shares for the purpose of determining
whether a quorum is present. Nothing in this
Section 2.6.C shall be construed to limit the right
of the Corporation to vote shares of capital stock
of the Corporation held by it in a fiduciary
capacity.

Section 2.7 Proxies

Every person entitled to vote for directors or any
other matter shall have the right to do so either in
person or by one or more agents authorized by a
written proxy signed by the person and filed with
the Secretary of the Corporation. A proxy shall be
deemed signed if the Stockholder's name is placed on
the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting,
telegraphic transmission, or otherwise) by the
Stockholder or Stockholder's attorney in fact. A
validly executed proxy which does not state that it
is irrevocable shall continue in full force and
effect unless (i) revoked by the person executing
it, before the vote pursuant to that proxy, by a
writing signed by the person and delivered to the
Corporation stating that the proxy is revoked, or by
a subsequent proxy executed by, or attendance at the
meeting and voting in person by the person executing
the proxy; or (ii) written notice of the death or
incapacity of the maker of that proxy is received by
the Corporation before the vote pursuant to that
proxy is counted; provided, however, that no proxy
shall be valid after the expiration of eleven (11)
months from the date of the proxy, unless otherwise
provided in the proxy. The revocability of a proxy
that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall
be governed by the provisions of the law applicable
in the State of Delaware.

Section 2.8 Inspectors of Election

A. Appointment

The Board shall, in advance of any meeting of
Stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors
(individually an "Inspector," and collectively the
"Inspectors") to act at such meeting and make a
written report thereof. The Board may designate one
or more persons as alternate Inspectors to replace
any Inspector who shall fail to act. If no
Inspector or alternate shall be able to act at such
meeting, the person presiding at such meeting shall
appoint one or more other persons to act as
Inspectors thereat. Each Inspector, before entering
upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take
and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
Inspector with strict impartiality and according to
the best of his or her ability.

B. Duties

The Inspectors shall (i) ascertain the number of
shares of capital stock of the Corporation
outstanding and the voting power of each, (ii)
determine the shares of capital stock of the
Corporation represented at such meeting and the
validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all
votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a
reasonable period a record of the disposition of any
challenges made to any determination by the
Inspectors and (v) certify their determination of
the number of such shares represented at such
meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. 
The Inspectors may appoint or retain other persons
or entities to assist them in the performance of
their duties.

The date and time of the opening and the closing of
the polls for each matter upon which the
Stockholders will vote at such meeting shall be
announced at such meeting. No ballots, proxies or
votes, nor any revocations thereof or changes
thereto, shall be accepted by the Inspectors after
the closing of the polls unless the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware upon application
by any Stockholder shall determine otherwise.

In determining the validity and counting of proxies
and ballots, the Inspectors shall be limited to an
examination of the proxies, ballots and the regular
books and records of the Corporation, except that
the Inspectors may consider other reliable
information for the limited purpose of reconciling
proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of
banks, brokers, their nominees or similar persons
which represent more votes than the holder of a
proxy is authorized by a Stockholder of record to
cast or more votes than such Stockholder holds of
record. If the Inspectors consider other reliable
information for the limited purpose permitted
herein, the Inspectors, at the time they make their
certification pursuant to this Section 2.8.B, shall
specify the precise information considered by them,
including the person or persons from whom they
obtained such information, when the information was
obtained, the means by which such information was
obtained and the basis for the Inspectors' belief
that such information is accurate and reliable.

Section 2.9 Record Date

In order that the Corporation may determine the
Stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any
meeting or entitled to express consent to any
corporate action without a meeting or entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights or entitled
to exercise any rights in respect of any other
lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a
record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60)
nor less than ten (10) days prior to the date of
such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days prior to
any such action. If no record date is fixed:

1. The record date for determining Stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
Stockholders shall be at the close of business on
the date next preceding the day on which notice is
given or, if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held.

2. The record date for determining Stockholders
entitled to give consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, when no prior action by
the Board has been taken, shall be the first date on
which a signed written consent setting forth the
action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered
(by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested) to the Corporation's registered
agent in the State of Delaware, its principal place
of business, or to the Secretary.

directors, to serve at the pleasure of the Board. 
The Board may designate one (1) or more directors as

any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of
the committee. In the absence or disqualification
of a member of a committee, the member or members
thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified
from voting, whether a quorum or not, may
unanimously appoint another member of the Board to
act at the meeting in the place of any such absent
or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the
extent provided in the resolution of the Board and
subject to the provisions of the applicable law in
the State of Delaware, shall have and may exercise
all the powers and authority of the Board in the
management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the corporate seal to
be affixed to all papers which may require it, but
neither the Supervisory Committee, the Audit
Committee, nor any other committee shall have the

designations and any of the preferences or rights of
such shares relating to dividends, redemption,
dissolution, any distribution of assets of the
Corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange

The directors shall be elected at each annual
meeting of Stockholders but, if any such annual
meeting is not held or the directors are not elected
thereat, the directors may be elected at any special
meeting of Stockholders held for that purpose. All
directors shall hold office until the expiration of
the term for which elected and until their
respective successors are elected and qualified.

Section 3.4 Vacancies

A vacancy or vacancies in the Board shall be deemed
to exist in case of death, resignation or removal of
any director, or if the Stockholders fail, at any
annual or special meeting of Stockholders at which
any director or directors are elected, to elect to
fill the full authorized number of directorships,
each of which has previously been filled. A newly
created directorship or directorships shall be
deemed to exist if the authorized number of
directors is increased. The Board shall have the
power to declare vacant the office of a director
either if he is declared of unsound mind by order of
court or finally convicted of a felony. Except for
a vacancy created by the removal of a director,
vacancies on the Board may be filled by a majority
of the directors then in office, whether or not less
than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and
each director so elected shall hold office until his
successor is elected at an annual or a special
meeting of the Stockholders. A vacancy on the Board
created by the removal of a director may only be
filled by the vote of a majority of the shares
entitled to vote represented at a duly held meeting
at which a quorum is present, or by the written
consent of a majority of the outstanding shares
entitled to vote. The Stockholders may elect a
director or directors at any time to fill any
vacancy or vacancies not filled by the directors. 
Insofar as a director or directors are elected by a
class or series of stock, vacancies or newly created
directorships are to be filled only by the remaining
director or directors elected by such class or
series or by the vote of a majority of the shares of
such class or series.

Section 3.5 Removal

Subject to the rights of any shares having
preferences over the common stock of the Corporation
as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect
directors under specified circumstances, the entire
Board or any director may be removed from office,
with or without cause, but only by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the combined
voting power of all the then outstanding shares
entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class.

Section 3.6 Resignation

Any director may resign effective upon giving
written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the

Board or the Stockholders shall have the power to
elect a successor to take office when the
resignation is to become effective.

of conference telephone or similar communications

required by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation
or by the provisions of these Bylaws; provided,
however, that these Bylaws hereby authorize the
Board to adopt operating resolutions requiring a

fees and any expenses of establishing a right to
indemnification under this Article 5.

"Losses" means the total amount which the agent
becomes legally obligated to pay in connection with
any proceeding including judgments, fines, amounts
paid in settlement and expenses.

For purposes of this Article 5, references to "other
enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans;
references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes
assessed on a person with respect to any employee
benefit plan; references to "serving at the request
of this Corporation" shall include any service as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves
service by, such director, officer, employee or
agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its
participants or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner he or she
reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee
benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a
manner "not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation" as referred to in this Article 5.

Section 5.2 Third Party Actions

The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to, or otherwise becomes involved in, any proceeding
(other than an action by or in the right of the
Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was
an agent of the Corporation against losses paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him
in connection with such proceeding if he acted in
good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his
conduct was unlawful. The termination of any
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the person did not act in good
faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.

Section 5.3 Actions by or in the Right of the
Corporation

The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to, or otherwise becomes involved in, any proceeding
by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he
is or was an agent of the Corporation against
expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with the defense or settlement of such
proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner
he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation and except
that no indemnification shall be made in respect of
any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person
shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
Corporation unless and only to the extent that the
Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which
such proceeding was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of
the case, such person is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the
Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall
deem proper.

Section 5.4 Successful Defense

To the extent that an agent of the Corporation has
been successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any proceeding referred to in
Sections 5.2 and 5.3, or in defense of any claim,
issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified
against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by
him in connection therewith.

Section 5.5 Determination of Conduct

Any indemnification under Sections 5.2 or 5.3
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the
Corporation only as authorized in the specific case
upon a determination that indemnification of the
agent is proper in the circumstances because he has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Sections 5.2 and 5.3. Such determination shall be
made (1) by the Board of Directors or the
Supervisory Committee by a majority vote of a quorum
consisting of directors who were not parties to such
proceeding or (2) if such quorum is not obtainable
or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested
directors so directs, by independent legal counsel
in a written opinion, or (3) by the Stockholders.

Section 5.6 Payment of Expenses in Advance

Expenses incurred by an agent in connection with a
proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such proceeding
upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such agent to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to
be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in
this Article 5.

Section 5.7 Indemnity Not Exclusive

The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other
provisions of this Article 5, shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which a person
seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses
may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or
otherwise, both as to action in his official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.

Section 5.8 Insurance Indemnification

The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or
was an agent of the Corporation against any
liability asserted against him and incurred by him
in any such capacity, or arising out of his status
as such, whether or not the Corporation would have
the power to indemnify him against such liability
under the provisions of this Article 5 or of
Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

Section 5.9 Heirs, Executors and Administrators

The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article 5
shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to
be an agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a
person.

holds meetings of the Board or Stockholders, or
during any nuclear or atomic disaster, or during the
existence of any catastrophe or other similar
emergency condition, as a result of which a quorum
of the Board or a standing committee thereof cannot
be convened. Said provisions in such event shall
override all other Bylaws of the Corporation in
conflict with any provisions of this Article, and
shall remain operative so long as it remains
impossible or impracticable to continue the business
of the Corporation otherwise, but thereafter shall
be inoperative; provided that all actions taken in
good faith pursuant to such provisions shall
thereafter remain in full force and effect unless
and until revoked by action taken pursuant to the

All directors of the Corporation who are not
available to perform their duties as directors by
reason of physical or mental incapacity or for any
other reason or who are unwilling to perform their
duties or whose whereabouts are unknown shall
automatically cease to be directors, with like
effect as if such persons had resigned as directors,
so long as such unavailability continues.

Section 8.3 Authorized Number of Directors

The authorized number of directors shall be the
number of directors remaining after eliminating
those who have ceased to be directors pursuant to
Section 8.2, or the minimum number required by law,
whichever number is greater.

Section 8.4 Quorum

The number of directors necessary to constitute a
quorum shall be one-third (1/3rd) of the authorized
number of directors as specified in the foregoing
Section, or such other minimum number as, pursuant
to the law or lawful decree then in force, it is
possible for the bylaws of a corporation to specify.

Section 8.5 Creation of Emergency Committee

In the event the number of directors remaining after
eliminating those who have ceased to be directors
pursuant to Section 8.2 is less than the minimum
number of authorized directors required by law, then
until the appointment of additional directors to
make up such required minimum, all the powers and
authorities which the Board could by law delegate,
including all powers and authorities which the Board
could delegate to a committee, shall be
automatically vested in an emergency committee, and
the emergency committee shall thereafter manage the
affairs of the Corporation pursuant to such powers
and authorities and shall have all other powers and
authorities as may by law or lawful decree be
conferred on any person or body of persons during a
period of emergency.

Section 8.6 Constitution of Emergency Committee

The emergency committee shall consist of all the
directors remaining after eliminating those who have
ceased to be directors pursuant to Section 8.2,
provided that such remaining directors are not less
than three (3) in number. In the event such

number, the emergency committee shall consist of
three (3) persons, who shall be the remaining
director or directors and either one (1) or two (2)
officers or employees of the Corporation, as the
remaining director or directors may in writing
designate. If there is no remaining director, the
emergency committee shall consist of the three (3)
most senior officers of the Corporation who are
available to serve, and if and to the extent that
officers are not available, the most senior
employees of the Corporation. Seniority shall be
determined in accordance with any designation of
seniority in the minutes of the proceedings of the
Board, and in the absence of such designation, shall
be determined by rate of remuneration. In the event
that there are no remaining directors and no
officers or employees of the Corporation available,
the emergency committee shall consist of three (3)
persons designated in writing by the Stockholder
owning the largest number of shares of record as of
the date of the last record date.

Section 8.7 Powers of Emergency Committee

The emergency committee, once appointed, shall
govern its own procedures and shall have power to
increase the number of members thereof beyond the
original number, and in the event of a vacancy or
vacancies therein, arising at any time, the
remaining member or members of the emergency
committee shall have the power to fill such vacancy
or vacancies. In the event at any time after its
appointment all members of the emergency committee
shall die or resign or become unavailable to act for
any reason whatsoever, a new emergency committee
shall be appointed in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this Article.

Section 8.8 Directors Becoming Available

Any person who has ceased to be a director pursuant
to the provisions of Section 8.2 and who thereafter
becomes available to serve as a director shall
automatically become a member of the emergency
committee.

Section 8.9 Election of Board

The emergency committee shall, as soon after its
appointment as is practicable, take all requisite
action to secure the election of a Board, and upon
such election all the powers and authorities of the
emergency committee shall cease.

Section 8.10 Termination of Emergency Committee

In the event, after the appointment of an emergency
committee, a sufficient number of persons who ceased
to be directors pursuant to Section 8.2 become
available to serve as directors, so that if they had
not ceased to be directors as aforesaid, there would
be enough directors to constitute the minimum number
of directors required by law, then all such persons
shall automatically be deemed to be reappointed as
directors and the powers and authorities of the
emergency committee shall be at an end.

A. Series C Preferred Stock

1. Series C Dividend Rights

1.1 A. The holder of each share of Series C
Preferred Stock (a "Series C Share") registered as
such in the stock records of the Corporation (a
"Series C Holder") as of the Series C Record Date
(as defined below) shall be entitled to receive,
when, as and if declared by the Corporation's Board
of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof
out of the funds of the Corporation legally
available therefor, on January 1, April 1, July 1
and October 1 of each year (a "Series C Dividend
Payment Date") cumulative dividends per Series C
Share (the "Series C Cash Dividends") in cash at the
Series C Cash Rate (as hereinafter defined) based
upon the Series C Liquidation Preference (as defined
in Paragraph A.2 and as adjusted pursuant to
Paragraph A.1.1.D below) of such Series C Share. To
the extent permitted by applicable law and not
prohibited pursuant to the terms of applicable
credit instruments or senior securities, the Board
of Directors shall declare Series C Cash Dividends
at the Series C Cash Rate for payment on each
Series C Dividend Payment Date (or, if such day is
not a business day, on the next business day
thereafter).

B. A "Series C Quarterly Payment Period" shall
mean each of the three month periods ending on
December 31, March 31, June 30 and September 30 of
each year.

C. The "Series C Cash Rate" shall mean the
quarterly rate of one and one quarter percent (1
1/4%).

D. Series C Dividends shall accrue (whether or not
paid) during each Series C Quarterly Payment Period
from the Series C Dividend Payment Date immediately
preceding such Series C Quarterly Payment Period to
the last day of such Series C Quarterly Payment
Period, provided that, for the first Series C
Quarterly Payment Period, Series C Cash Dividends
shall accrue commencing as of the date of Initial
Issuance (as defined below) of the Series C Shares. 
Series C Cash Dividends shall be calculated on the
basis of a 90 day Series C Quarterly Payment Period
and the actual number of days elapsed. For any
Series C Quarterly Payment Period with respect to
which the Series C Cash Dividend is not fully paid
in cash on the Series C Dividend Payment Date at the
end of such Series C Quarterly Payment Period, such
accrued but unpaid Series C Cash Dividends shall be
added to the Series C Liquidation Preference of the
Series C Shares effective at the beginning of the
Series C Quarterly Payment Period next succeeding
the Series C Quarterly Payment Period as to which
such Series C Cash Dividends were not paid, and
shall thereafter accrue additional Series C Cash
Dividends at the Series C Cash Rate. Any Series C
Cash Dividend payment made on Series C Shares shall
first be credited against the earliest accrued but
unpaid Series C Cash Dividend which has been added
to the Series C Liquidation Preference of the
Series C Shares pursuant to this Paragraph A.1.1.D
and shall thereafter reduce the Series C Liquidation
Preference. With respect to the Series C Shares,
the date of "Initial Issuance" shall mean the
Effective Date (as defined in that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of August 10, 1994 by
and among the Corporation, Carolco Acquisition Corp.
and Carolco Pictures Inc.) of said merger. 

E. Series C Cash Dividends, if and when declared
on each Series C Share, shall to the extent
permitted by applicable law be declared at least
twenty (20) business days prior to the next Series C
Dividend Payment Date for payment on the next
Series C Dividend Payment Date to the Series C
Holders of record on the date determined in such
declaration, which date shall in no event be more
than fifteen (15) business days after the date of
declaration (the "Series C Record Date"). Series C
Cash Dividends shall be payable on each Series C
Dividend Payment Date (or if any such day is not a
business day, the next succeeding business day),
except that Series C Cash Dividends for the period
during which a Series C Redemption (as defined in
Paragraph A.5.1) shall occur shall be payable on
Series C Shares redeemed in accordance with
Paragraph A.5.2 (unless otherwise paid on a Series C
Dividend Payment Date for a Series C Record Date
occurring prior to a Series C Redemption Date (as
defined in Paragraph A.5.2)). The Series C Holder
of any Series C Shares which are the subject of a
conversion pursuant to Paragraph A.4 shall, on the
Series C Conversion Date (as defined in Paragraph
A.4.F), cease to have any rights with respect to any
accrued Series C Cash Dividends on such Series C
Shares which have not been declared and paid on or
before such Series C Conversion Date except to the
extent such accrued but unpaid Series C Cash
Dividends have been added to the Series C
Liquidation Preference of such Shares and except
that in the event a conversion of Series C Shares is
effected after a Series C Redemption Notice (as
defined in Paragraph A.5.2) is delivered by the
Corporation but prior to a Series C Redemption Date,
then, to the extent lawful, the Corporation shall
pay to such Series C Holder an amount in cash equal
to all accrued and unpaid Series C Cash Dividends
from the last Series C Dividend Payment Date until
the date the converting Series C Holder delivered
its notice of conversion pursuant to Paragraph
A.4.F. 

1.2 Until the date no Series C Shares are
outstanding (the "Series C Termination Date"), the
Corporation shall not declare, pay or set aside for
payment any dividend (other than in shares of Junior
Stock (as hereinafter defined)) or other
distribution in respect of its Junior Stock, or call
for redemption, redeem, purchase or otherwise
acquire for any consideration (other than shares of
its Junior Stock) any shares of its Junior Stock,
any warrants, rights, calls or options exercisable
for any shares of Junior Stock unless all dividends
accumulated and unpaid with respect to the Series C
Shares are simultaneously declared and paid. With
respect to the Series C Preferred Stock, "Junior
Stock" means Common Stock (as hereinafter defined),
Series D Preferred Stock or any other series of
preferred stock of the Corporation which ranks
junior to or on a parity with (as determined
pursuant to Paragraph A.6) the Series C Preferred
Stock. "Common Stock" means the common stock, par
value $.01 per share, of the Corporation, and any
share of successor or replacement stock.

1.3 Each Series C Holder shall be entitled to
participate with the holders of Common Stock equally
and ratably (on the basis of the number of shares of
Common Stock such Series C Holder would then own if
it then converted its Series C Shares pursuant to
Paragraph A.4) in any subscription rights or other
similar rights to acquire securities or property of
the Corporation granted to any holder of Common
Stock; provided that any subscription rights or
other similar rights acquired by Series C Holders
shall be excluded for purposes of calculating any
adjustments pursuant to Paragraph A.4.D hereof.

2. Rights on Liquidation and Ranking

2.1 In the event of the liquidation, dissolution,
winding up or sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary ("Liquidation"),
the Series C Holder shall be entitled to receive
with respect to its Series C Shares, after the
satisfaction of all distributions to holders of
other series of preferred stock, if any, which are
required (at the direction of the holder thereof or
otherwise) to be redeemed prior to or in connection
with the consummation of such Liquidation or which
are expressly senior in liquidation preference to
the Series C Shares including any series of
preferred stock which is mandatorily redeemable
(collectively, the "Series C Senior Payments") but
before any distribution is made to or set aside for
the holders of Common Stock or any other series of
preferred stock of the Corporation, if any, which
are not then required to be redeemed or which are
junior in liquidation preference to the Series C
Shares, cash or any other assets of the Corporation
in an amount (or having a fair market value) equal
to $1,000 ("Series C Liquidation Preference") plus
all accrued but unpaid Series C Cash Dividends which
have been added to the Series C Liquidation
Preference of such shares pursuant to Paragraph
A.1.1.D up to the date of the final distribution in
Liquidation. If after the satisfaction of all
Series C Senior Payments the assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to Series C
Holders shall be insufficient to permit the payment
in full of the amount due the Series C Holders
pursuant to this Paragraph A.2, the entire assets of
the Corporation available for distribution to
Series C Holders after the satisfaction of all
Series C Senior Payments shall be distributed pari
passu among the Series C Holders and the holders of
other series of preferred stock which are not junior
in liquidation preferences to the Series C Shares,
if any, in accordance with their respective
liquidation preferences. The fair market value of
any assets of the Corporation and the proportion of
cash and other assets distributed by the Corporation
to the Series C Holders shall be reasonably
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. 
A merger or consolidation of the Corporation with
another corporation or a voluntary sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation
principally in exchange for stock and/or securities
of another corporation (all referred to as a
"Merger") shall not be deemed a Liquidation if such
Merger does not occur as part of a proceeding under
Title 11 of the United States Code or any federal or
state law for the protection of creditors or relief
of debtors.

2.2 With regard to rights to receive distributions
upon Series C Liquidation of the Corporation and
dividends, the Series C Shares shall rank (i) senior
to the Series D Preferred Stock and (ii) senior to
the Common Stock and any other equity securities of
the Corporation that by their terms are not made
senior to or on a parity with the Series C Shares as
to such rights.

3. Voting Rights

3.1 Except as otherwise provided by law and except
as provided in Paragraphs A.3.2 and A.3.3 below,
each Series C Holder shall have the same voting
rights as a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock which such Series C Holder would then own if
it then converted its Series C Shares pursuant to
Paragraph A.4.

3.2 So long as any of the Series C Shares are
outstanding, the Corporation will not, without the
affirmative vote or consent of the Series C Holders
representing at least a majority (unless the consent
or vote of Series C Holders of greater than a
majority is then required by law) of the Series C
Shares at the time outstanding, given in person or
by proxy, either in writing or by a resolution
adopted at a meeting called for the purpose, the
Series C Holders voting or consenting separately as
a class:

A. amend, alter or repeal any of the provisions of
the Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws or
the resolution providing for the issue of the
Series C Shares or pass any stockholder resolution,
including such action effected by merger or similar
transaction in which the Corporation is the
surviving corporation, if such amendment or
resolution would affect adversely the preferences,
special rights or powers of the Series C Shares
except if such action is permitted under the other
provisions of this Paragraph A.3.2;

B. increase or decrease (other than by redemption
or conversion) the total number of authorized
Series C Shares;

C. issue any capital stock which ranks senior or
on a parity with the Series C Shares with respect to
rights to receive distributions upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or with
respect to dividends; 

D. enter into a Merger in which the Corporation is
not the surviving corporation; provided, however,
that the provisions of this subparagraph D shall not
be applicable to any such Merger if the authorized
capital stock of the surviving corporation
immediately after such Merger shall include only
classes or series of stock for which no such consent
or vote would have been required pursuant to
Paragraph A.3.2 if such class or series had been
authorized by the Corporation immediately prior to
such Merger or which have the same rights,
preferences and limitations and authorized amount as
a class or series of stock of the Corporation
authorized (with such consent or vote of the
Series C Shares) prior to such Merger and continuing
as an authorized class or series at the time
thereof.

A Merger of the Corporation, or similar Merger in
which the holders of its capital stock receive all
cash shall not be deemed to adversely affect the
preferences, special rights or powers of the
Series C Shares. Nor shall the authorization or
issuance of the Series D Preferred Stock, nor the
authorization or issuance of any other series of
preferred stock if such other series ranks junior to
the Series C Shares with respect to rights to
receive distributions upon Liquidation of the
Corporation or with respect to dividends be deemed
to adversely affect the preferences, special rights
or powers of the Series C Shares.

3.3 In the event of an issuance by means of a stock
split, reverse split or stock dividend or other
similar event or reclassification of shares of
Common Stock outstanding, the voting rights of the
Series C Shares shall be fairly and equitably (in
the judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) adjusted at the same time and in the
same manner as the adjustment is made in the rights
of the Common Stock in order to maintain the same
voting rights as the Series C Shares on the date of
issuance.

3.4 Copies of all notices sent to the holders of
Common Stock shall be simultaneously sent to each
Series C Holder.

4. Series C Conversion Rights Common Stock

A. Number of Series C Shares. Each Series C Share
shall be convertible, at the option of the Series C
Holder thereof, at any time and from time to time,
into that number of shares of Common Stock obtained
by dividing the Series C Liquidation Preference
(including any Series C Cash Dividends added to the
Series C Liquidation Preference pursuant to
Paragraph A.1.1.D) of such Series C Share by the
"Series C Conversion Price" determined in accordance
with Paragraph A.4.B.

B. Series C Conversion Price. The Series C
Conversion Price shall be $3.045 and shall be
adjusted from time to time pursuant to Paragraph
A.4.D. The Corporation may (but shall have no
obligation to) from time to time temporarily or
permanently reduce the Series C Conversion Price as
it deems appropriate.

C. Series C Conversion and Series C Redemption. 
In case any Series C Share is called for redemption,
the right to convert such Series C Share shall
terminate at the close of business on the Series C
Redemption Date; provided that no default by the
Corporation in the payment of the applicable
Series C Redemption Price (as defined in Paragraph
A.5.1) shall have occurred and be continuing.

D. Adjustment of Series C Conversion Price and
Ratio for Series C Conversion. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the Series C Conversion Price shall
be subject to adjustment from time to time only as
follows:

(a) In case the Corporation shall (1) take a record
of the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of
entitling them to receive a dividend payable in
shares of Common Stock, (2) subdivide (by stock
split, merger, consolidation or otherwise) the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater
number of shares, (3) combine (by reverse stock
split, merger, consolidation or otherwise) the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares or (4) increase or decrease the
number of shares of outstanding Common Stock by
reclassification of its Common Stock or issue any
shares of any other class or series of the
Corporation by reclassification of its Common Stock,
the Series C Conversion Price (then in effect) shall
be adjusted so that each Series C Holder shall
thereafter be entitled upon the conversion of each
Series C Share held by him to receive for such
Series C Share the number of shares of Common Stock
which it would have owned and/or have been entitled
to receive upon the occurrence of an event or record
date described above had the Series C Share been
converted immediately prior to the happening of the
event, the adjustment to the Series C Conversion
Price to become effective immediately after (x) the
record date (in the case of a dividend) or (y) the
day upon which such subdivision or combination shall
become effective.

(b) In case the Corporation shall, by dividend or
otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common
Stock property including securities, but excluding:
(x) any dividend or distribution paid in Common
Stock; (y) any dividend or distribution paid in cash
out of the surplus of the Corporation (provided that
such distribution shall not reduce stockholders'
equity below the sum of the aggregate Series C
Liquidation Preference of the Series C Shares then
outstanding and the aggregate liquidation preference
of all other shares ranking senior or pari passu to
the Series C Shares) or (z) any securities issued or
redeemed pursuant to a shareholders rights plan, the
Series C Conversion Price shall be adjusted by
multiplying (a) the Series C Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to the close of business on
the date fixed for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive the distribution by (b) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the excess of
the Market Price (as defined in Paragraph A.4.J) for
that date over the fair market value on that date
(as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors, whose determination shall be
conclusive) of the property so distributed per share
of Common Stock, and the denominator of which is the
Market Price for that date. The adjustment shall
become effective immediately prior to the opening of
business on the day following the date fixed for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive
the distribution.

(c) In case the Corporation shall sell or issue
shares of Common Stock or rights, options, warrants
or convertible or exchangeable securities containing
the right to subscribe for or purchase shares of
Common Stock, excluding shares of Common Stock
issued or reserved for issuance by the Corporation
in the following situations:

(i) in any transaction described in clause (a) or
(b) above;

(ii) (x) pursuant to any plan providing for the
reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on
securities of the Corporation, and the investment of
additional optional amounts with respect to such
plan, (y) pursuant to any employee benefit plan or
program of the Corporation or (z) to officers,
directors or employees pursuant to an employee stock
option plan approved by the holders of the Common
Stock, in any such case, either (A) at a price per
share not less than 95% of the Market Price per
share of Common Stock, or (B) in an amount of shares
of Common Stock not greater than 5% of the total
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on a
fully diluted basis; and

(iii) upon conversion of the Series C Shares or
Series D Shares, or upon conversion, exercise or
exchange of rights, options, warrants or convertible
or exchangeable securities outstanding or as to
which a binding commitment existed as of the date of
Initial Issuance of the Series C Shares.

and the price per share (determined in the case of
rights, options, warrants or convertible or
exchangeable securities as the quotient of (x) the
aggregate consideration received or receivable by
the Corporation upon the sale and issuance of such
rights, options, warrants or convertible or
exchangeable securities plus the total consideration
payable to the Corporation upon such exercise or
conversion divided by (y) the total number of shares
of Common Stock covered by such rights, options,
warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities)
is lower than the Market Price on the date of such
initial sale and issuance, then the Series C
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
issuance shall upon such issuance be reduced to the
price determined by multiplying such Series C
Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be an amount equal to the sum of (A) the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on a
fully diluted basis immediately prior to such
issuance multiplied by the Market Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance plus (B) the
consideration, if any, received by the Corporation
upon such issuance, and the denominator of which
shall be the product of (A) the Market Price in
effect immediately prior to such issuance and (B)
the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding on a fully diluted basis, immediately
after such issuance.

(d) In case the Corporation shall distribute to the
holders of its Common Stock evidences of its
indebtedness or assets (excluding Series C Cash
Dividends or distributions made out of current or
retained earnings) or rights or warrants to
subscribe other than as referred to in subparagraph
(c) above, then in each such case the number of
shares of Common Stock into which each Series C
Share shall thereafter be convertible shall be
determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Series C Shares was
theretofore convertible by a fraction, of which the
numerator shall be the current Market Price per
share of Common Stock on the date of such
distribution, and of which the denominator shall be
the current Market Price per share of Common Stock,
less the then fair market value (as reasonably
determined by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) of the assets, evidences of
indebtedness, subscription rights or warrants so
distributed (the "Distributed Property") over the
aggregate consideration receivable by the
Corporation, if any, for the Distributed Property,
as applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such
adjustment shall be made whenever any such
distribution is made (unless an adjustment is made
pursuant to subparagraph (a), (b) or (c) above, in
which case such subparagraphs shall apply), but
shall also be effective retroactively as to Series C
Shares converted after the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive
such distribution and before the date such
distribution is made.

(e) No adjustment in the Series C Conversion Price
shall be required unless such adjustment would
require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of
such price; provided that any adjustments which by
reason of this clause (e) are not required to be
made shall be carried forward and taken into account
in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations
shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest
one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be.

E. Series C Conversion Upon Reorganization. In
case the Corporation shall effect a reorganization,
reclassification of its Common Stock (other than a
subdivision or combination described in clause (a)
of Paragraph A.4.D) or Merger, and pursuant to any
such reorganization, reclassification or Merger, any
assets or securities of the Corporation, any
successor or transferee corporation or any affiliate
thereof or cash is received by or distributed to the
holders of Common Stock, then each Series C Holder
shall have the right thereafter to convert each
Series C Share held by such Series C Holder into the
kind and amount of shares or assets, securities or
cash receivable as a result of consummation of such
transaction by a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Series C Share might
have been converted immediately prior to such
transaction and shall have no other conversion
rights nor shall there be any adjustment to the
Series C Conversion Price; in any such event,
effective provision shall be made in the certificate
of incorporation of the successor or transferee
corporation or otherwise, so that the provisions set
forth herein for the protection of the conversion
rights of the Series C Shares shall thereafter be
applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, to any
such other securities, cash and assets deliverable
upon conversion of the Series C Shares or other
convertible stock or securities received by the
Series C Holders in place thereof, and any such
successor or transferee corporation shall expressly
assume the obligation to deliver, upon the exercise
of the conversion privilege, such other securities,
cash or assets as the Series C Holders, or other
convertible stock or securities received by the
Series C Holders in place thereof, shall be entitled
to receive pursuant to the provisions hereof, and to
make provision for the protection of the conversion
right as above provided. In case securities other
than Common Stock, cash or assets shall be issuable,
payable or deliverable by the Corporation upon
conversion as aforesaid, then all references in this
Paragraph A.4.E shall be deemed to apply, so far as
appropriate and as nearly as may be, to such other
securities, cash or assets. This provision shall
similarly apply to successive reorganizations,
reclassifications or Mergers.

F. Series C Conversion Method. Any Series C
Holder may, at any time prior to the close of
business on the Series C Redemption Date for such
Series C Shares, exercise the conversion rights as
to such Series C Shares by delivering to the
Corporation during regular business hours, at the
office of the then transfer agent for the Series C
Shares or at such other place as may be designated
in writing delivered to all Series C Holders by the
Corporation, at least ten (10) business days prior
to the requested date for conversion, a notice
requesting conversion on a specified date and the
certificate for the Series C Shares to be converted,
duly endorsed in blank or for transfer to the
Corporation (if required by it), or accompanied by
separate instruments of transfer satisfactory to the
Corporation, in either case sufficient to transfer
the Series C Shares being converted free of any
adverse claim, and written notice stating the number
of Series C Shares represented by such certificate
that the Series C Holder elects to convert. The
notice shall also state the names and addresses of
the persons to whom certificates for shares of
Common Stock shall be issued, the denominations of
such certificates and reasonable delivery
instructions with respect thereto. A notice failing
to meet the foregoing requirements shall not be
valid or effective for any purpose. (The
Corporation may (but shall have no obligation to)
from time to time waive the requirement of ten (10)
days written notice.) Each conversion shall be
deemed to have been effected immediately on the
close of business on the date specified in such
notice (the "Series C Conversion Date"), and the
person in whose name any certificate for shares of
Common Stock is issuable upon the conversion shall
be deemed to have become the holder of record of the
Common Stock at such time. If the stock transfer
books of the Corporation are closed on the Series C
Conversion Date, the Series C Conversion Date for
purposes of determining record ownership shall be
the next succeeding day on which the stock transfer
books are open (and the conversion shall be deemed
to have been effected immediately prior to the close
of business on that day), but in all cases the
conversion shall be at the Series C Conversion Price
in effect on the Series C Conversion Date specified
in the notice of conversion. As promptly as
practicable after the Series C Conversion Date (but
in any event within 10 business days), the
Corporation shall issue and deliver to such Series C
Holder, at the expense of the Corporation and in
accordance with such Series C Holder's delivery
instructions, a certificate or certificates for the
number of full shares of Common Stock to which such
Series C Holder is entitled and a check or cash with
respect to any fractional interest in a share of
Common Stock as provided in Paragraph A.4.G below. 
Upon conversion of only a portion of the Series C
Shares represented by a certificate surrendered for
conversion, the Corporation shall issue and deliver
to such Series C Holder, at the expense of the
Corporation, a new certificate covering the number
of Series C Shares representing the unconverted
portion of the certificate so surrendered and which
new certificate shall entitle the Series C Holder
thereof to the same rights of the Series C Shares
represented thereby as if the certificate
theretofore covering such unconverted Series C
Shares had not been surrendered for conversion.

G. Fractional Shares of Common Stock. No
fractional shares of Common Stock or scrip shall be
issued upon conversion of Series C Shares. If more
than one Series C Share shall be surrendered for
conversion at any one time by the same Series C
Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of such Series C Shares
shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate
number of Series C Shares so surrendered. Instead
of any fractional shares of Common Stock which
otherwise would be issuable upon conversion of any
Series C Shares, the Corporation shall pay a cash
adjustment in respect of such fractional interest
based upon the Series C Conversion Price in effect
at the close of business on the last business day
prior to the Series C Conversion Date.

H. Taxes. All shares of Common Stock issued upon
conversion of Series C Shares will be validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The
Corporation shall pay any and all documentary stamp
or similar issue or transfer taxes that may be
payable in respect of any issue or delivery of
shares of Common Stock on conversion of Series C
Shares pursuant hereto. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be
payable in respect of any transfer involved in the
issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a
name other than that in which the Series C Shares so
converted were registered, and no such issue or
delivery shall be made unless and until the person
requesting such transfer has paid to the Corporation
the amount of any such tax or has established to the
satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has
been paid or that no such tax is payable.

I. Unauthorized Series C Shares. All certificates
representing Series C Shares surrendered for
conversion or Series C Redemption shall be
appropriately cancelled on the books of the
Corporation and the Series C Shares so converted or
redeemed represented by such certificates shall be
restored to the status of authorized but unissued
Series C Shares.

J. Market Price. For purposes hereof, the term
"Market Price" on any day shall mean the average of
the closing prices (as defined below) per share of
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
("NYSE") if the Common Stock is listed thereon, or,
if not so listed, on the principal national stock
exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed,
or, if not so listed, on the National Association of
Securities Dealers Inc. Automated Quotation System
(the "NASDAQ System"), in each case, for the 20
consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the
date of determination. A "Trading Day" is a
business day in which the principal market on which
the Common Stock is traded is open for trading for
at least four hours. As used herein, the "closing
price" per share of Common Stock for each day shall
be the last reported sales price per share, regular
way on such day, or if there are no sales on such
day, on the immediately preceding day on which such
sales occurred; provided that if at the time of any
computation pursuant to this paragraph the Common
Stock is not then traded on any trading market, the
"Market Price" for the purposes hereof shall be the
fair value as reasonably determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

K. Available Common Stock. The Corporation shall
at all times reserve and keep available out of its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion
of Series C Shares, such number of shares of Common
Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect a conversion of all outstanding Series C
Shares under Paragraph A.4.A, as such number may
from time to time be adjusted pursuant to Paragraph
A.4.D, and if at any time the number of authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding Series C Shares, the Corporation shall
promptly take such corporate action as may, in the
opinion of its counsel and subject to any necessary
approval of its stockholders, be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be
sufficient for such purpose.

L. Notice to Series C Holders. In the event (i)
the Corporation shall declare a dividend or other
distribution on the Common Stock other than regular
cash dividends declared in the ordinary course or
dividends or other distributions payable in Common
Stock, (ii) the Common Stock is subdivided, combined
or reclassified, (iii) of a Merger, or (iv) of a
Liquidation, or (v) the Corporation offers for
subscription pro rata to holders of Common Stock any
additional shares of stock of any class or series or
other rights, then the Corporation shall mail to
each Series C Holder at the Series C Holder's
address as it appears in the stock records of the
Corporation, promptly and in any event at least
15 days prior to the date described in clause (a)
below, a notice stating (a) the date for the
determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to
receive the distribution, subscription rights or the
consideration in the Merger or Liquidation, or (b)
the date of determination as to which shares of
Common Stock will be affected by a subdivision,
combination, reclassification, (c) a brief statement
of the facts requiring such notice, and (d) if
applicable, that the Series C Conversion Price shall
be adjusted in accordance with this Paragraph A.4. 
Upon any adjustment in the Series C Conversion
Price, the Corporation shall mail to each Series C
Holder at the Series C Holder's address as it
appears in the stock records of the Corporation a
notice setting forth the adjusted Series C
Conversion Price and the method of calculation
thereof, provided that, if such address is outside
of the United States, then such notice shall be sent
by facsimile transmission (if such Series C Holder
shall have provided a facsimile number). 

M. Conclusive Determination. Whenever the
Series C Conversion Price is adjusted as herein
provided, the Corporation shall promptly file with
the transfer agent for the Common Stock, a
certificate of a firm of independent public
accountants regularly employed by the Corporation
setting forth the adjusted Series C Conversion
Price, along with a brief statement of the facts
requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing
the adjustment, which certificate shall be
conclusive evidence of the correctness of the
adjustment, absent manifest error.

5. Series C Redemption Rights

5.1 Series C Redemption. The Corporation may, at
its option, at any time after three years from the
date of Initial Issuance of the Series C Shares, and
from time to time thereafter, redeem (a "Series C
Redemption") at the price determined herein ("Series
C Redemption Price"), from funds legally available
therefor, all or any portion of the outstanding
Series C Shares (not thereafter converted at any
time prior to the Series C Redemption Date in
accordance with Paragraph A.4) at the Series C
Redemption Price which shall be the Series C
Liquidation Preference plus all accrued and unpaid
Series C Cash Dividends through the Series C
Redemption Date (including any accrued but unpaid
Series C Cash Dividends added to Series C
Liquidation Preference pursuant to Paragraph
A.1.1.D) only if there has occurred a Series C
Redemption Event (as defined in Paragraph A.5.3) and
only if prior to the giving of the Series C
Redemption Notice (as hereinafter defined) all
Series C Cash Dividends have been paid through the
end of the most recent Series C Quarterly Payment
Period (including accrued but unpaid Series C Cash
Dividends added to Series C Liquidation Preference
pursuant to Paragraph A.1.1.D).

5.2 Notice of Series C Redemption. If the
Corporation elects to redeem any or all Series C
Shares pursuant to a Series C Redemption, the
Corporation shall (a) give written notice of such
Series C Redemption ("Series C Redemption Notice")
to each Series C Holder of Series C Shares to be
redeemed at its address as it appears on the stock
records of the Corporation by deposit thereof in
first class U.S. mail, postage prepaid, and, in the
case of a Series C Holder with an address outside of
the United States, a Series C Redemption Notice
shall be sent by facsimile transmission (if such
Series C Holder shall have provided a facsimile
number) and (b) set aside an amount equal to the
Series C Redemption Price of all Series C Shares
subject to Series C Redemption at that time for the
benefit of all Series C Holders of Series C Shares
subject to Series C Redemption apart from its other
funds, and the Series C Shares then subject to
Series C Redemption and not otherwise converted in
accordance with Paragraph A.4 shall, on the date
which is twenty (20) business days after the deposit
of the Series C Redemption Notice in accordance with
clause (a) of this sentence (the "Series C
Redemption Date"), cease to be outstanding and the
rights of the Series C Holders and owners thereof
shall be limited to payment of the Series C
Redemption Price thereof plus accumulated Series C
Dividends through the Series C Redemption Date in
accordance with the terms hereof. The Corporation
shall mail to each Series C Holder of a Series C
Share tendered for Series C Redemption the Series C
Redemption Price thereof by check within ten (10)
days after the Corporation shall receive at its
principal office a certificate representing the
applicable Series C Share (or an affidavit of lost
certificate and indemnity therefor in a form
prescribed by the Board of Directors) duly endorsed
in blank for transfer to the Corporation (if
required by it), accompanied by instruments of
transfer satisfactory to the Corporation and
sufficient to transfer the Series C Shares being
redeemed free of any adverse claim. Should any
Series C Holder not receive payment of any amounts
due on Series C Redemption of its Series C Shares at
the times prescribed by reason of the Corporation's
failure to give a Series C Redemption Notice at the
times or in the manner prescribed above or to make
payment at the times prescribed above for any reason
other than the Series C Holder's failure to tender
its Series C Shares (or affidavit and indemnity) and
instruments of transfer as provided above, the
Corporation shall pay to the applicable Series C
Holder on demand (x) interest on the sums not paid
when due at an annual rate equal to two percent in
excess of the "Prime Rate" that is then in effect or
announced by Chemical Bank, New York, New York, or
its successor, compounding at the end of each thirty
(30) days, until the applicable Series C Holder is
paid in full and (y) all costs of collection,
including but not limited to attorneys' fees and
costs, whether or not suit or other formal
proceedings are instituted. The Series C Redemption
Price shall (in the discretion of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation) be adjusted to take
into account any stock split or other similar change
in the Series C Shares.

5.3 Series C Redemption Event. A "Series C
Redemption Event" shall occur with respect to any
Series C Share (a) on the tenth day following any
ten (10) consecutive Trading Days on which the
Market Price is equal to or greater than 150% of the
Series C Conversion Price of such Series C Share or
(b) in the event of a merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with another corporation (or other
business entity) or a voluntary sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation
(a "Redemption Event Merger") in which the
consideration to be paid to holders of the Common
Stock in the Redemption Event Merger is either
payable entirely in cash or is property with a fair
market value (as reasonably determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) of not
less than 150% of the Series C Conversion Price of
such Series C Share on the date fixed for purposes
of determining the holders of Common Stock entitled
to receive consideration in the Redemption Event
Merger.

5.4 Selection of Shares. The Corporation shall
select the Series C Shares to be redeemed in any
Series C Redemption in which not all Series C Shares
are required or permitted to be redeemed so that the
Series C Shares of each Series C Holder selected for
Series C Redemption shall bear the same proportion
to the total Series C Shares owned by that Series C
Holder as the proportion of all Series C Shares
selected for Series C Redemption bears to the total
of all then outstanding Series C Shares, but
adjusted as determined by the Board of Directors to
avoid the redemption of fractional Series C Shares. 
Should any Series C Shares allowed to be redeemed
under the terms hereof not be redeemed solely by
reason of limitations imposed by law, the applicable
Series C Shares may be redeemed on the earliest
possible date thereafter that the applicable Series
C Shares may be redeemed to the maximum extent
permitted by law. Except as set forth above, the
Board of Directors shall prescribe the manner in
which any Series C Redemption shall be effected. 
Any monies set aside by the Corporation for the
holders of Series C Shares subject to Series C
Redemption which shall not be claimed at the end of
one (1) year after the first service of the
applicable Series C Redemption Notice shall be
released and repaid to the Corporation but shall be
paid to the Series C Holder of the applicable Series
C Shares so long as submission of its shares occurs
within five (5) years after the first service of the
applicable Series C Redemption Notice.

6. Ranking of Stock of the Corporation

For purposes hereof, any stock of any class or
classes of the Corporation shall be deemed to rank:

A. Prior to the Series C Shares, either as to
dividends or upon liquidation, if the holders of
such class or classes shall be entitled to the
receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable
upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
Corporation, as the case may be, in preference or
priority to the Series C Holders;

B. On a parity with the Series C Shares, either as
to dividends or upon liquidation, whether or not the
dividend rates, dividend payment dates or redemption
or liquidation prices per share or sinking fund
provisions, if any, are different from those of the
Series C Shares, if the holders of such stock shall
be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of
amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the Corporation, as the case may
be, in proportion to their respective dividend rates
or liquidation prices, without preference or
priority, one over the other, as between the holders
of such stock and the Series C Holders; and
C. Junior to the Series C Shares, either as to
dividends or upon liquidation, if such class shall
be Common Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, or if
the Series C Holders shall be entitled to receipt of
dividends or of amounts distributable upon
dissolution, liquidation, winding up of the
Corporation, or upon redemption as the case may be,
in preference or priority to the holders of shares
of such class or classes.

B. Series D Preferred Stock

1. Series D Dividend Rights

1.1 A. The holder of record of each share of
Series D Preferred Stock ("Series D Share") of the
Corporation (a "Series D Holder") as of the Series D
Record Date (as defined below) shall be entitled to
receive, when, as and if declared by the
Corporation's Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee thereof, on January 1, April 1,
July 1 and October 1 of each year (a "Series D
Dividend Payment Date"), at the option of the
Corporation, either:

(a) out of the funds of the Corporation legally
available therefor, cumulative dividends per
Series D Share (the "Series D Cash Dividends") in
cash equal to the "Series D Cash Rate" (as
hereinafter defined) multiplied by the Series D
Liquidation Preference (as defined in Paragraph B.2
and as adjusted pursuant to Paragraph B.1.1.D below)
for each Series D Quarterly Payment Period (as
hereinafter defined) that such Series D Share is
outstanding; or

(b) for any Series D Dividend (as hereinafter
defined) accruing prior to October 20, 1998, to the
extent legally available therefor, cumulative
dividends per Series D Share (the "Series D PIK
Dividends") in additional Series D Shares equal to
the "Series D PIK Rate" (as hereinafter defined)
multiplied by the Series D Liquidation Preference
(and as adjusted pursuant to Paragraph B.1.1.D
below) for each Series D Quarterly Payment Period
that such Series D Share is outstanding.

To the extent permitted by applicable law and not
prohibited pursuant to the terms of applicable
credit instruments, senior securities or the Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board
of Directors shall declare either Series D Cash
Dividends or Series D PIK Dividends (collectively
referred to hereinafter as "Series D Dividends") for
payment on each Series D Dividend Payment Date (or,
if such day is not a business day, on the next
business day thereafter).

B. A "Series D Quarterly Payment Period" shall
mean the three month period ending on December 31,
March 31, June 30 and September 30 of each year.

C. The "Series D Cash Rate" and "Series D PIK
Rate" both shall mean the quarterly dividend rate of
one and one quarter percent (1 1/4%). The Series D
Cash Rate and Series D PIK Rate shall collectively
be referred to as the "Series D Dividend Rate."

D. Series D Dividends shall accrue (whether or not
paid) during each Series D Quarterly Payment Period
from the Series D Dividend Payment Date immediately
preceding such Series D Quarterly Payment Period to
the last day of such Series D Quarterly Payment
Period, provided that, for the first Series D
Quarterly Payment Period, Series D Dividends shall
accrue commencing as of the date of Initial Issuance
(as defined below) of the Series D Shares. Series D
Dividends shall be calculated on the basis of a
90-day Series D Quarterly Payment Period and the
actual number of days elapsed. For any Series D
Quarterly Payment Period with respect to which the
Series D Dividend is not fully paid in cash or in
Series D Shares on the Series D Dividend Payment
Date at the end of such Series D Quarterly Payment
Period, such accrued but unpaid Series D Dividends
shall be added to the Series D Liquidation
Preference of the Series D Shares effective at the
beginning of the Series D Quarterly Payment Period
next succeeding the Series D Quarterly Payment
Period as to which such Series D Dividends were not
paid, and shall thereafter accrue additional
Series D Dividends at the Series D Dividend Rate. 
Any Series D Dividend payment made on Series D
Shares shall be credited against the earliest
accrued but unpaid Series D Dividend which has been
added to the Series D Liquidation Preference of the
Series D Shares pursuant to this Paragraph B.1.1.D
and shall reduce the Series D Liquidation Preference
by the amount of the Series D Dividend paid. With
respect to the Series D Shares, the date of "Initial
Issuance" shall mean October 20, 1993.

1.2 Series D Dividends, if and when declared on
each Series D Share, shall to the extent permitted
by applicable law be declared at least twenty (20)
business days prior to the next Series D Dividend
Payment Date for payment on the next Series D
Dividend Payment Date to the Series D Holders of
record on the date determined in such declaration,
which date shall in no event be more than fifteen
(15) business days after the date of declaration
(the "Series D Record Date"). Series D Dividends
shall be payable on each Series D Dividend Payment
Date (or if any such day is not a business day, the
next succeeding business day), except that Series D
Dividends for the period during which a Series D
Redemption (as defined in Paragraph B.5.1) shall
occur shall be payable on Series D Shares redeemed
in accordance with Paragraph B.5.2 (unless otherwise
paid on a Series D Dividend Payment Date for a
Series D Record Date occurring prior to a Series D
Redemption Date (as defined in Paragraph B.5.2)). 
The Series D Holder of any Series D Shares which are
the subject of a conversion pursuant to Paragraph
B.4 shall, on the Series D Conversion Date (as
defined in Paragraph B.4.F), cease to have any
rights with respect to any accrued Series D
Dividends on such Series D Shares which have not
been declared and paid on or before such Series D
Conversion Date except to the extent such accrued
but unpaid Series D Dividends have been added to the
Series D Liquidation Preference of such Shares and
except that in the event a conversion of Series D
Shares is effected after a Series D Redemption
Notice (as defined in Paragraph B.5.2) is delivered
by the Corporation but prior to a Series D
Redemption Date, then, to the extent lawful, the
Corporation shall pay to such Series D Holder an
amount in cash equal to all accrued and unpaid
Series D Dividends from the last Series D Dividend
Payment Date until the date the converting Series D
Holder delivered its notice of conversion pursuant
to Paragraph B.4.F.

1.3 So long as any Series D Shares are outstanding,
the Corporation shall not declare, pay or set aside
for payment any dividend (other than in shares of
Junior Stock (as hereinafter defined)) or other
distribution in respect of its Junior Stock, or call
for redemption, redeem, purchase or otherwise
acquire for any consideration (other than shares of
its Junior Stock) any shares of its Junior Stock,
any warrants, rights, calls or options exercisable
for any shares of Junior Stock unless all dividends
accumulated and unpaid with respect to the Series D
Shares are simultaneously declared and paid. With
respect to the Series D Preferred Stock, "Junior
Stock" means Common Stock or any other series of
preferred stock of the Corporation which ranks
junior to or on a parity with (as determined
pursuant to Paragraph B.6) the Series D Preferred
Stock. "Common Stock" means the common stock, par
value $.01 per share, of the Corporation, and any
share of successor or replacement stock. 

1.4 Each Series D Holder shall be entitled to
participate with the holders of Common Stock equally
and ratably (on the basis of the number of shares of
Common Stock such Series D Holder would then own if
it then converted its Series D Shares pursuant to
Paragraph B.4) in any subscription rights or other
similar rights to acquire securities or property of
the Corporation granted to any holder of Common
Stock; provided that any subscription rights or
other similar rights acquired by Series D Holders
shall be excluded for purposes of calculating any
adjustments pursuant to Paragraph B.4.D hereof.

2. Rights on Liquidation and Ranking

2.1 In the event of the liquidation, dissolution,
winding up or sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary ("Liquidation"),
the Series D Holder shall be entitled to receive
with respect to such Series D Share, after the
satisfaction of all distributions to holders of
other series of preferred stock, if any, which are
required (at the direction of the holder thereof or
otherwise) to be redeemed prior to or in connection
with the consummation of such Liquidation or which
are expressly senior in liquidation preference to
the Series D Shares including any series of
preferred stock which is mandatorily redeemable
(collectively, the "Series D Senior Payments") but
before any distribution is made to or set aside for
the holders of Common Stock or any other series of
preferred stock of the Corporation, if any, which
are not then required to be redeemed or which are
junior in liquidation preference to the Series D
Shares, cash or any other assets of the Corporation
in an amount (or having a fair market value) equal
to $1,000 ("Series D Liquidation Preference") plus
all accrued but unpaid Series D Dividends which have
been added to the Series D Liquidation Preference of
such shares pursuant to Paragraph B.1.1.D up to the
date of the final distribution in Liquidation. If,
after the satisfaction of all Series D Senior
Payments, the assets of the Corporation available
for distribution to Series D Holders shall be
insufficient to permit the payment in full of the
amount due the Series D Holders pursuant to this
Paragraph B.2, the entire assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to Series D Holders after
the satisfaction of all Series D Senior Payments
shall be distributed pari passu among the Series D
Holders and the holders of other series of preferred
stock which are not junior in liquidation
preferences to the Series D Shares, if any, in
accordance with their respective liquidation
preferences. The fair market value of any assets of
the Corporation and the proportion of cash and other
assets distributed by the Corporation to the
Series D Holders shall be reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors. A merger or
consolidation of the Corporation with another
corporation or a voluntary sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation
principally in exchange for stock and/or securities
of another corporation (all referred to as a
"Merger") shall not be deemed a Liquidation if such
Merger does not occur as part of a proceeding under
Title 11 of the United States Code or any federal or
state law for the protection of creditors or relief
of debtors.

2.2 With regard to rights to receive distributions
upon Liquidation of the Corporation and dividends,
the Series D Shares shall rank (i) junior to the
Series C Preferred Stock, and (ii) senior to the
Common Stock and any other equity securities of the
Corporation that by their terms are not made senior
to or on a parity with the Series D Shares as to
such rights.

3. Voting Rights

3.1 Except as otherwise provided by law and except
as provided in Paragraphs B.3.2 and B.3.1 below,
each Series D Holder shall have the same voting
rights as a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock which such Series D Holder would then own if
it then converted its Series D Shares pursuant to
Paragraph B.4.

3.2 So long as any of the Series D Shares are
outstanding, the Corporation will not, without the
affirmative vote or consent of the Series D Holders
of at least eighty percent (80%) of the Series D
Shares at the time outstanding, given in person or
by proxy, either in writing or by a resolution
adopted at a meeting called for such purpose, with
the Series D Holders voting or consenting separately
as a class:

A. amend, alter or repeal any of the provisions of
the Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws or
the resolution providing for the issue of the
Series D Shares or pass any stockholder resolution,
including such action effected by merger or similar
transaction in which the Corporation is the
surviving corporation, if such amendment or
resolution would affect adversely the preferences,
special rights or powers of the Series D Shares
except if such action is otherwise permitted under
the other provisions of this Paragraph B.3.2;

B. increase or decrease (other than by redemption
or conversion) the total number of authorized
Series D Shares;

C. issue any capital stock (other than Series D
PIK Dividends) which ranks senior to or on a parity
with the Series D Shares with respect to rights to
receive distributions upon liquidation, dissolution,
or winding up of the Corporation or with respect to
dividends;

D. enter into a Merger in which the Corporation is
not the surviving corporation; provided however,
that the provisions of this subparagraph D shall not
be applicable to any such Merger if the authorized
capital stock of the surviving corporation
immediately after such Merger shall include only
classes or series of stock for which no such consent
or vote would have been required pursuant to
Paragraph B.3.2 if such class or series had been
authorized by the Corporation immediately prior to
such Merger or which have the same rights,
preferences and limitations and authorized amount as
a class or series of stock of the Corporation
authorized (with such consent or vote of the
Series D Shares) prior to such Merger and continuing
as an authorized class or series at the time
thereof;

E. take any action, if submitted to the
stockholders, which would result in there being no
Series D Preferred Acceptable Chairman of the Board
of Directors of the Corporation. "Series D
Preferred Acceptable Chairman of the Board" means
Mario F. Kassar ("Kassar") at any time he is serving
as such and any successor chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation who is supported by at
least eighty percent (80%) of the Series D Shares
then outstanding. The holders of at least 80% of
the Series D Shares shall irrebuttably be presumed
to support any successor to such person as chairman
of the Board of Directors of the Corporation unless
persons having the power to vote at least 80% of the
Series D Shares then outstanding shall submit a
written statement to the Secretary of the
Corporation within 10 days after Kassar or a
chairman of the Board supported by holders of at
least 80% of the Series D Shares shall have ceased
to be chairman of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation stating that the Board of Directors has
failed to elect a chairman of the Board acceptable
to such holders.

A Merger of the Corporation, or similar Merger in
which the holders of its capital stock receive all
cash shall not be deemed to adversely affect the
preferences, special rights or powers of the
Series D Shares. Nor shall the authorization or
issuance of any other series of preferred stock if
such other series ranks junior to the Series D
Shares with respect to rights to receive
distributions upon Liquidation of the Corporation or
with respect to dividends be deemed to adversely
affect the preferences, special rights or powers of
the Series D Shares.

3.3 In the event of an issuance by means of a stock
split, reverse split or stock dividend or other
similar event or reclassification of shares of
Common Stock outstanding, the voting rights of the
Series D Shares shall be fairly and equitably (in
the judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) adjusted at the same time and in the
same manner as the adjustment is made in the rights
of the Common Stock in order to maintain the same
voting rights as the Series D Shares had on the date
of issuance.

3.4 Copies of all notices sent to the holders of
Common Stock shall be simultaneously sent to each
Series D Holder.

4. Series D Conversion Rights Common Stock

A. Number of Series D Shares. Each Series D Share
shall be convertible, at the option of the Series D
Holder thereof, at any time and from time to time
into that number of shares of Common Stock, obtained
by dividing the Series D Liquidation Preference
(including any Series D Dividends added to Series D
Liquidation Preference pursuant to Paragraph
B.1.1.D) of such Series D Share by the "Series D
Conversion Price" determined in accordance with
Paragraph B.4.B.

B. Series D Conversion Price. The Series D
Conversion Price shall be [$.60 x Exchange Ratio]
and shall be adjusted from time to time pursuant to
Paragraph B.4.D.

C. Series D Conversion and Series D Redemption. 
In case any Series D Share is called for redemption,
the right to convert such Series D Share shall
terminate at the close of business on the Series D
Redemption Date; provided that no default by the
Corporation in the payment of the applicable
Series D Redemption Price (as defined in Paragraph
B.5.1) shall have occurred and be continuing.

D. Adjustment of Series D Conversion Price and
Ratio for Series D Conversion. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the Series D Conversion Price shall
be subject to adjustment from time to time only as
follows:

(a) In case the Corporation shall (1) take a record
of the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of
entitling them to receive a dividend payable in
shares of Common Stock, (2) subdivide (by stock
split, merger, consolidation or otherwise) the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater
number of shares, (3) combine (by reverse stock
split, merger, consolidation or otherwise) the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares or (4) increase or decrease the
number of shares of outstanding Common Stock by
reclassification of its Common Stock or issue any
shares of another class or series of the Corporation
by reclassification of its Common Stock, the
Series D Conversion Price (then in effect) shall be
adjusted so that each Series D Holder shall
thereafter be entitled upon the conversion of each
Series D Share held by him to receive for such
Series D Share the number of shares of Common Stock
which it would have owned and/or have been entitled
to receive upon the occurrence of an event or record
date described above had the Series D Share been
converted immediately prior to the happening of the
event, the adjustment to the Series D Conversion
Price to become effective immediately after (x) the
record date (in the case of a dividend) or (y) the
day upon which such subdivision or combination shall
become effective.

(b) In case the Corporation shall, by dividend or
otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common
Stock property including securities, but excluding: 
(x) any dividend or distribution paid in Common
Stock; (y) any dividend or distribution paid in cash
out of the surplus of the Corporation (provided that
such distribution shall not reduce stockholders'
equity below the sum of the aggregate Series D
Liquidation Preference of the Series D Shares then
outstanding and the aggregate liquidation preference
of all other shares ranking senior or pari passu to
the Series D Shares), or (z) any securities issued
or redeemed pursuant to a shareholders rights plan,
the Series D Conversion Price shall be adjusted by
multiplying (a) the Series D Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to the close of business on
the date fixed for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive the distribution by (b) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the excess of
the Market Price (as defined in Paragraph B.4.J) for
that date over the fair market value on that date
(as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors, whose determination shall be
conclusive) of the property so distributed per share
of Common Stock, and the denominator of which is the
Market Price for that date. The adjustment shall
become effective immediately prior to the opening of
business on the day following the date fixed for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive
the distribution.

(c) In case the Corporation shall sell or issue
shares of Common Stock or rights, options, warrants
or convertible or exchangeable securities containing
the right to subscribe for or purchase shares of
Common Stock, excluding shares of Common Stock
issued or reserved for issuance by the Corporation
in the following situations:

(i) in any transaction described in clause (a) or
(b) above; 

(ii) (x) pursuant to any plan providing for the
reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on
securities of the Corporation, and the investment of
additional optional amounts with respect to such
plan, (y) pursuant to any employee benefit plan or
program of the Corporation or (z) to officers,
directors or employees pursuant to an employee stock
option plan approved by the holders of the Common
Stock, in any such case, either (A) at a price per
share not less than 95% of the Market Price per
share of Common Stock, or (B) in an amount of shares
of Common Stock not greater than 5% of the total
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on a
fully diluted basis; and

(iii) upon conversion of the Series C Shares or
Series D Shares or upon conversion, exercise or
exchange of rights, options, warrants or convertible
or exchangeable securities outstanding or as to
which a binding commitment existed as of the
Effective Date (as defined in that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of August 10, 1994 by
and among the Corporation, Carolco Acquisition Corp.
and Carolco Pictures, Inc.) of said merger. 

and the price per share (determined in the case of
rights, options, warrants or convertible or
exchangeable securities as the quotient of (x) the
aggregate consideration received or receivable by
the Corporation upon the sale and issuance of such
rights, options, warrants or convertible or
exchangeable securities plus the total consideration
payable to the Corporation upon such exercise or
conversion divided by (y) the total number of shares
of Common Stock covered by such rights, options,
warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities)
is lower than the Market Price on the date of such
initial sale and issuance, then the Series D
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
issuance shall upon such issuance be reduced to the
price determined by multiplying such Series D
Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be an amount equal to the sum of (A) the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on a
fully diluted basis immediately prior to such
issuance multiplied by the Market Price in effect
immediately prior to such issuance plus (B) the
consideration, if any, received by the Corporation
upon such issuance, and the denominator of which
shall be the product of (A) the Market Price in
effect immediately prior to such issuance and
(B) the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding on a fully diluted basis, immediately
after such issuance.

(d) In case the Corporation shall distribute to the
holders of its Common Stock evidences of its
indebtedness or assets (excluding Series D Dividends
or distributions made out of current or retained
earnings) or rights or warrants to subscribe other
than as referred to in subparagraph (c) above, then
in each such case the number of shares of Common
Stock into which each Series D Share shall
thereafter be convertible shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock
into which such Series D Shares was theretofore
convertible by a fraction, of which the numerator
shall be the current Market Price per share of
Common Stock on the date of such distribution, and
of which the denominator shall be the current Market
Price per share of Common Stock, less the excess of
the then fair market value (as reasonably determined
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) of the
assets, evidences of indebtedness, subscription
rights or warrants so distributed (the "Distributed
Property") over the aggregate consideration
receivable by the Corporation, if any, for the
Distributed Property, as applicable to one share of
Common Stock. Such adjustment shall be made
whenever any such distribution is made (unless an
adjustment is made pursuant to subparagraph (a), (b)
or (c) above, in which case such subparagraphs shall
apply), but shall also be effective retroactively as
to Series D Shares converted after the record date
for the determination of stockholders entitled to
receive such distribution and before the date such
distribution is made.

(e) No adjustment in the Series D Conversion Price
shall be required unless such adjustment would
require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of
such price; provided that any adjustments which by
reason of this clause (e) are not required to be
made shall be carried forward and taken into account
in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations
shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest
one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be.

E. Series D Conversion Upon Reorganization. In
case the Corporation shall effect a reorganization,
reclassification of its Common Stock (other than a
subdivision or combination described in clause (a)
of Paragraph B.4.D) or Merger, and pursuant to any
such reorganization, reclassification or Merger, any
assets or securities of the Corporation, any
successor or transferee corporation or any affiliate
thereof or cash is received by or distributed to the
holders of Common Stock, then each Series D Holder
shall have the right thereafter to convert each
Series D Share held by such Series D Holder into the
kind and amount of shares or assets, securities or
cash receivable as a result of consummation of such
transaction by a holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock into which such Series D Share might
have been converted immediately prior to such
transaction and shall have no other conversion
rights nor shall there be any adjustment to the
Series D Conversion Price; in any such event,
effective provision shall be made in the certificate
of incorporation of the successor or transferee
corporation or otherwise, so that the provisions set
forth herein for the protection of the conversion
rights of the Series D Shares shall thereafter be
applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, to any
such other securities, cash and assets deliverable
upon conversion of the Series D Shares or other
convertible stock or securities received by the
Series D Holders in place thereof, and any such
successor or transferee corporation shall expressly
assume the obligation to deliver, upon the exercise
of the conversion privilege, such other securities,
cash or assets as the Series D Holders, or other
convertible stock or securities received by the
Series D Holders in place thereof, shall be entitled
to receive pursuant to the provisions hereof, and to
make provision for the protection of the conversion
right as above provided. In case securities other
than Common Stock, cash or assets shall be issuable,
payable or deliverable by the Corporation upon
conversion as aforesaid, then all references in this
Paragraph B.4.E shall be deemed to apply, so far as
appropriate and as nearly as may be, to such other
securities, cash or assets. This provision shall
similarly apply to successive reorganizations,
reclassifications or Mergers.

F. Series D Conversion Method. Any Series D
Holder may, at any time prior to the close of
business on the Series D Redemption Date for such
Series D Shares, exercise the conversion rights as
to such Series D Shares by delivering to the
Corporation during regular business hours, at the
office of the then transfer agent for the Series D
Shares or at such other place as may be designated
in writing delivered to all Series D Holders by the
Corporation, at least ten (10) business days prior
to the requested date for conversion, a notice
requesting conversion on a specified date and the
certificate for the Series D Shares to be converted,
duly endorsed in blank or for transfer to the
Corporation (if required by it), or accompanied by
separate instruments of transfer satisfactory to the
Corporation, in either case sufficient to transfer
the Series D Shares being converted free of any
adverse claim, and written notice stating the number
of Series D Shares represented by such certificate
that the Series D Holder elects to convert. The
notice shall also state the names and addresses of
the persons to whom certificates for shares of
Common Stock shall be issued, the denominations of
such certificates and reasonable delivery
instructions with respect thereto. A notice failing
to meet the foregoing requirements shall not be
valid or effective for any purpose. (The
Corporation may (but shall have no obligation to)
from time to time waive the requirement of ten (10)
days written notice.) Each conversion shall be
deemed to have been effected immediately on the
close of business on the date specified in such
notice (the "Series D Conversion Date"), and the
person in whose name any certificate for shares of
Common Stock is issuable upon the conversion shall
be deemed to have become the holder of record of the
Common Stock at such time. If the stock transfer
books of the Corporation are closed on the Series D
Conversion Date, the Series D Conversion Date for
purposes of determining record ownership shall be
the next succeeding day in which the stock transfer
books are open (and the conversion shall be deemed
to have been effected immediately prior to the close
of business on that day), but in all cases the
conversion shall be at the Series D Conversion Price
in effect on the Series D Conversion Date specified
in the notice of conversion. As promptly as
practicable after the Series D Conversion Date (but
in any event within ten (10) business days), the
Corporation shall issue and deliver to such Series D
Holder, at the expense of the Corporation and in
accordance with such Series D Holder's delivery
instructions, a certificate or certificates for the
number of full shares of Common Stock to which such
Series D Holder is entitled and a check or cash with
respect to any fractional interest in a share of
Common Stock as provided in Paragraph B.4.G below. 
Upon conversion of only a portion of the Series D
Shares represented by a certificate surrendered for
conversion, the Corporation shall issue and deliver
to such Series D Holder, at the expense of the
Corporation, a new certificate covering the number
of Series D Shares representing the unconverted
portion of the certificate so surrendered and which
new certificate shall entitle the Series D Holder
thereof to the same rights of the Series D Shares
represented thereby as if the certificate
theretofore covering such unconverted Series D
Shares had not been surrendered for conversion.

G. Fractional Shares of Common Stock. No
fractional shares of Common Stock or scrip shall be
issued upon conversion of Series D Shares. If more
than one Series D Share shall be surrendered for
conversion at any one time by the same Series D
Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of such Series D Shares
shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate
number of Series D Shares so surrendered. Instead
of any fractional shares of Common Stock which
otherwise would be issuable upon conversion of any
Series D Shares, the Corporation shall pay a cash
adjustment in respect of such fractional interest
based upon the Series D Conversion Price in effect
at the close of business on the last business day
prior to the Series D Conversion Date.

H. Taxes. All shares of Common Stock issued upon
conversion of Series D Shares will be validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The
Corporation shall pay any and all documentary stamp
or similar issue or transfer taxes that may be
payable in respect of any issue or delivery of
shares of Common Stock on conversion of Series D
Shares pursuant hereto. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be
payable in respect of any transfer involved in the
issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a
name other than that in which the Series D Shares so
converted were registered, and no such issue or
delivery shall be made unless and until the person
requesting such transfer has paid to the Corporation
the amount of any such tax or has established to the
satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has
been paid or that no such tax is payable.

I. Surrendered Series D Shares. All certificates
representing Series D Shares surrendered for
conversion or Series D Redemption shall be
appropriately cancelled on the books of the
Corporation and the Series D Shares so converted or
redeemed represented by such certificates shall be
restored to the status of authorized but unissued
Series D Shares.

J. Market Price. For purposes hereof, the term
"Market Price" on any day shall mean the average of
the closing prices (as defined below) per share of
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
("NYSE") if the Common Stock is listed thereon, or,
if not so listed, on the principal national stock
exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed,
or, if not so listed, on the National Association of
Securities Dealers Inc. Automated Quotation System
(the "NASDAQ System"), in each case, for the 20
consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the
date of determination. A "Trading Day" is a
business day in which the principal market on which
the Common Stock is traded is open for trading for
at least four hours. As used herein, the "closing
price" per share of Common Stock for each day shall
be the last reported sales price per share, regular
way on such day, or if there are no sales on such
day, on the immediately preceding day on which such
sales occurred; provided that if at the time of any
computation pursuant to this paragraph the Common
Stock is not then traded on any trading market, the
"Market Price" for the purposes hereof shall be the
fair value as reasonably determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

K. Available Common Stock. The Corporation shall
at all times reserve and keep available out of its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion
of Series D Shares, such number of shares of Common
Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect a conversion of all outstanding Series D
Shares under Paragraph B.4.A, as such number may
from time to time be adjusted pursuant to Paragraph
B.4.D, and if at any time the number of authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be
sufficient to effect the conversion of all then
outstanding Series D Shares, the Corporation shall
promptly take such corporate action as may, in the
opinion of its counsel and subject to any necessary
approval of its stockholders, be necessary to
increase its authorized but unissued shares of
Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be
sufficient for such purpose.

L. Notice to Series D Holders. In the event
(i) the Corporation shall declare a dividend or
other distribution on the Common Stock other than
regular cash dividends declared in the ordinary
course or dividends or other distributions payable
in Common Stock, (ii) the Common Stock is
subdivided, combined or reclassified, (iii) of a
Merger, or (iv) of a Liquidation, or (v) the
Corporation offers for subscription pro rata to
holders of Common Stock any additional shares of
stock of any class or series or other rights, then
the Corporation shall mail to each Series D Holder
at the Series D Holder's address as it appears in
the stock records of the Corporation promptly and in
any event at least 15 days prior to the date
described in clause (a) below, a notice stating
(a) the date for the determination of holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive the distribution,
subscription rights or the consideration in the
Merger or Liquidation, or (b) the date of
determination as to which shares of Common Stock
will be affected by a subdivision, combination,
reclassification, (c) a brief statement of the facts
requiring such notice, and (d) if applicable, that
the Series D Conversion Price shall be adjusted in
accordance with this Paragraph B.4. Upon any
adjustment in the Series D Conversion Price, the
Corporation shall mail to each Series D Holder at
the Series D Holder's address as it appears in the
stock records of the Corporation a notice setting
forth the adjusted Series D Conversion Price and the
method of calculation thereof, provided that, if
such address is outside of the United States, then
such notice shall be sent by facsimile transmission
(if such Series D Holder shall have provided a
facsimile number).

M. Conclusive Determination. Whenever the
Series D Conversion Price is adjusted as herein
provided, the Corporation shall promptly file with
the transfer agent for the Common Stock, a
certificate of a firm of independent public
accountants regularly employed by the Corporation
setting forth the adjusted Series D Conversion
Price, along with a brief statement of the facts
requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing
the adjustment which certificate shall be conclusive
evidence of the correctness of the adjustment,
absent manifest error.

5. Series D Redemption Rights

5.1 Series D Redemption. The Corporation may, at
its option, at any time after October 20, 2000, and
from time to time thereafter, redeem (a "Series D
Redemption") at the price determined herein
("Series D Redemption Price"), from funds legally
available therefor, all or any portion of the
outstanding Series D Shares (not thereafter
converted at any time prior to the Series D
Redemption Date in accordance with Paragraph B.4) at
the Series D Redemption Price which shall be the
Series D Liquidation Preference plus all accrued but
unpaid Series D Dividends (other than accrued but
unpaid Series D Dividends added to Series D
Liquidation Preference pursuant to Paragraph
B.1.1.D) through the Series D Redemption Date only
if there has occurred a Series D Redemption Event
(as defined in Paragraph B.5.3) and only if prior to
the giving of the Series D Redemption Notice (as
hereinafter defined) all Series D Dividends have
been paid through the end of the most recent
Series D Quarterly Payment Period (including accrued
but unpaid Series D Dividends added to Series D
Liquidation Preference pursuant to Paragraph
B.1.1.D).

5.2 Notice of Series D Redemption. If the
Corporation elects to redeem any or all Series D
Shares pursuant to a Series D Redemption, the
Corporation shall (a) give written notice of such
Series D Redemption within ten (10) days after the
occurrence of the applicable Series D Redemption
Event ("Series D Redemption Notice") to each
Series D Holder of Series D Shares to be redeemed at
its address as it appears on the stock records of
the Corporation by deposit thereof in first class
U.S. mail, postage prepaid, and, in the case of a
Series D Holder with an address outside of the
United States, a Series D Redemption Notice shall be
sent by facsimile transmission (if such Series D
Holder shall have provided a facsimile number), and
(b) set aside an amount equal to the Series D
Redemption Price of all Series D Shares subject to
Series D Redemption at that time for the benefit of
all Series D Holders of Series D Shares subject to
Series D Redemption apart from its other funds, and
the Series D Shares then subject to Series D
Redemption and not otherwise converted in accordance
with Paragraph B.4 shall, on the date which is
twenty (20) business days after the deposit of the
Series D Redemption Notice in accordance with clause
(a) of this sentence (the "Series D Redemption
Date"), cease to be outstanding and the rights of
the Series D Holders and owners thereof shall be
limited to payment of the Series D Redemption Price
thereof plus accumulated Series D Dividends through
the Series D Redemption Date in accordance with the
terms hereof. The Corporation shall mail to each
Series D Holder of a Series D Share tendered for
Series D Redemption the Series D Redemption Price
thereof by check within ten (10) days after the
Corporation shall receive at its principal office a
certificate representing the applicable Series D
Share (or an affidavit of lost certificate and
indemnity therefor in a form prescribed by the Board
of Directors) duly endorsed in blank for transfer to
the Corporation (if required by it), accompanied by
instruments of transfer satisfactory to the
Corporation and sufficient to transfer the Series D
Shares being redeemed free of any adverse claim. 
Should any Series D Holder not receive payment of
any amounts due on Series D Redemption of its
Series D Shares at the times prescribed by reason of
the Corporation's failure to give a Series D
Redemption Notice at the times or in the manner
prescribed above or to make payment at the times
prescribed above for any reason other than the
Series D Holder's failure to tender its Series D
Shares (or affidavit and indemnity) and instruments
of transfer as provided above, the Corporation shall
pay to the applicable Series D Holder on demand
(x) interest on the sums not paid when due at an
annual rate equal to two percent in excess of the
"Prime Rate" that is then in effect or announced by
Chemical Bank, New York, New York, or its successor,
compounding at the end of each thirty (30) days,
until the applicable Series D Holder is paid in full
and (y) all costs of collection, including but not
limited to attorneys' fees and costs, whether or not
suit or other formal proceedings are instituted. 
The Series D Redemption Price shall (in the
discretion of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) be adjusted to take into account any
stock split or other similar change in the Series D
Shares.

5.3 Series D Redemption Event. A "Series D
Redemption Event" shall occur with respect to any
Series D Share (a) on the tenth day following any
ten (10) consecutive Trading Days in which the
Market Price is equal to or greater than 150% of the
Series D Conversion Price of such Series D Share or
(b) in the event of a Redemption Event Merger in
which the consideration to be paid to holders of the
Common Stock in the Redemption Event Merger is
either payable entirely in cash or is property with
a fair market value (as reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation) of not less than 150% of the Series D
Conversion Price of such Series D Share on the date
fixed for purposes of determining the holders of
Common Stock entitled to receive consideration in
the Redemption Event Merger.

5.4 Selection of Shares. The Corporation shall
select the Series D Shares to be redeemed in any
Series D Redemption in which not all Series D Shares
are to be redeemed so that the Series D Shares of
each Series D Holder selected for Series D
Redemption shall bear the same proportion to the
total Series D Shares owned by that Series D Holder
as the proportion of all Series D Shares selected
for Series D Redemption bears to the total of all
then outstanding Series D Shares, but adjusted as
determined by the Board of Directors to avoid the
redemption of fractional Series D Shares. Should
any Series D Shares required to be redeemed under
the terms hereof not be redeemed solely by reason of
limitations imposed by law, the applicable Series D
Shares shall be redeemed on the earliest possible
date thereafter that the applicable Series D Shares
may be redeemed to the maximum extent permitted by
law. Except as set forth above, the Board of
Directors shall prescribe the manner in which any
Series D Redemption shall be effected. Any monies
set aside by the Corporation for the holders of
Series D Shares subject to Series D Redemption which
shall not be claimed at the end of one (1) year
after the first service of the applicable Series D
Redemption Notice shall be released and repaid to
the Corporation but shall be paid to the Series D
Holder of the applicable Series D Shares so long as
submission of its shares occurs within five (5)
years after the first service of the applicable
Series D Redemption Notice.

6. Ranking of Stock of the Corporation

For purposes hereof, any stock of any class or
classes of the Corporation shall be deemed to rank:

A. Prior to the Series D Shares, either as to
dividends or upon liquidation, if the holders of
such class or classes shall be entitled to the
receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable
upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
Corporation, as the case may be, in preference or
priority to the Series D Holders;

B. On a parity with the Series D Shares, either as
to dividends or upon liquidation, whether or not the
dividend rates, dividend payment dates or redemption
or liquidation prices per share or sinking fund
provisions, if any, are different from those of the
Series D Shares, if the holders of such stock shall
be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of
amounts distributable upon dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the Corporation, as the case may
be, in proportion to their respective dividend rates
or liquidation prices, without preference or
priority, one over the other, as between the holders
of such stock and the Series D Holders; and

C. Junior to the Series D Shares, either as to
dividends or upon liquidation, if such class shall
be Common Stock or if the Series D Holders shall be
entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts
distributable upon dissolution, liquidation, winding
up of the Corporation, or upon redemption as the
case may be, in preference or priority to the
holders of shares of such class or classes.

FIFTH:

A. Management Vested in the Board of Directors. 
The management of the business and the conduct of
the affairs of the Corporation shall be vested in
its Board of Directors. In furtherance of and not
in limitation of the powers conferred by statute,
the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to
make, repeal, alter, amend and rescind the Amended
and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation. The number
of directors which shall constitute the whole Board
of Directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner
provided in, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the
Corporation from time to time. The phrase "whole
Board" and the phrase "total number of directors"
shall be deemed to have the same meaning, to wit,
the total number of directors which the Corporation
would have if there were no vacancies. No election
of directors need be by written ballot.

B. Terms of Directors. Each director shall serve
for a term ending on the date of the next annual
meeting following the meeting at which such director
was elected, or such later date as such director's
successor shall have been elected and qualified. 
Advance notice of shareholder nominations for the
election of directors shall be given in the manner
provided in the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the
Corporation.

C. Appointment of New Directors. Except as
otherwise provided, newly created directors
resulting from any increase in the number of
directors and any vacancies on the Board of
Directors resulting from death, resignation,
disqualification, removal or other causes shall be
filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining directors then in office, even though less
than a quorum of the Board of Directors. Any
director elected in accordance with the preceding
sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the
full term of directors in which the new directorship
was created or the vacancy occurred and until such
director's successor shall have been elected and
qualified. No decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten
the term of any incumbent director.

D. Removal of Directors. The entire Board or any
individual director may be removed from office, with
or without cause, by a vote of stockholders holding
a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote at an election of directors.

E. Liability of Directors. A director of the
Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except
for liability (i) for any breach of the director's
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good
faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for
any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit.

SIXTH: Meetings of stockholders may be held
within or without the State of Delaware, as the
Amended and Restated Bylaws may provide. The books
of the Corporation may be kept outside the State of
Delaware at such place or places as may be
designated from time to time by the Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Corporation.

SEVENTH: The Corporation is to have perpetual
existence.

EIGHTH: No holder of any Shares shall be entitled
as of right to subscribe for, purchase, or otherwise
acquire any Shares of any capital stock of the
Corporation which the Corporation proposes to issue
or any rights or options which the Corporation
proposes to grant for the purchase of Shares of any
class of the Corporation or for the purchase of any
Shares, bonds, securities, or obligations of the
Corporation which are convertible into or
exchangeable for, or which carry any rights to
subscribe for, purchase, or otherwise acquire Shares
of any class of capital stock of the Corporation;
and any and all of such Shares, bonds, securities or
obligations of the Corporation, whether now or
hereafter authorized or created, may be issued, or
may be reissued or transferred if the same have been
reacquired and have treasury status, and any and all
of such rights and options may be granted by the
Board of Directors to such persons, firms,
corporations and associations, and for such lawful
consideration, and on such terms, as the Board of
Directors in its discretion may determine, without
first offering the same, or any thereof, to any said
holder.

NINTH: The Corporation shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by Section 145 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the
same may be amended and supplemented, indemnify any
and all persons whom it shall have the power to
indemnify under said section from and against any
and all of the expenses, liabilities or other
matters referred to in or covered by said section,
and the indemnification provided for herein shall
not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
those indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his
official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office, and shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such person.

TENTH: Except as may otherwise be
specifically provided in this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, no provision of this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is
intended by the Corporation to be construed as
limiting, prohibiting, denying, or abrogating any of
the general or specific powers or rights conferred
under the General Corporation Law upon the
Corporation, upon its shareholders, bondholders, and
security holders, and upon its directors, officers,
and other corporate personnel, including, in
particular, the power of the Corporation to furnish
indemnification to directors and officers in the
capacities defined and prescribed by the General
Corporation Law and the defined and prescribed
rights of said persons to indemnification as the
same are conferred by the General Corporation Law.

ELEVENTH: From time to time any of the provisions of
this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed,
and other provisions authorized by the laws of the
State of Delaware at the time in force may be added
or inserted in the manner and at the time prescribed
by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred
upon the shareholders of the Corporation by this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
are granted subject to the provisions of this
Article ELEVENTH.

TWELFTH: The effective time of the original
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, and
the time when the existence of the Corporation
commenced, is March 15, 1988.

Exhibit 9.3(b)

Amendments to LIVE Increasing Rate Notes Indenture

For purposes of this Exhibit 9.3(b) only, the LIVE
Increasing Rate Notes shall be referred to as the
"Notes" and the LIVE Increasing Rate Notes Indenture
shall be referred to as the "Indenture". Other
capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning
ascribed to them in the Indenture, except that
"Effective Date" shall have the meaning ascribed to
it in the Agreement. The Indenture will be amended
as follows:

1. Definitions. The definition of Senior Debt in
the Indenture will be expanded to provide that any
indebtedness which by its terms is stated to be
senior to the Notes will be treated as senior debt;
the definition of the Bank Credit Facilities will be
amended to include Carolco and LHV bank credit
facilities (including guarantees thereof); and
conforming changes will be made.

2. Section 2.12 (Payment of Interest; Interest
Rights Preserved). A technical change will be made
to clarify how interest is paid after a default. 

3. Section 3.02 (Optional Redemption). LIVE will
be allowed to redeem part, as well as all, of the
Notes. 

4. Section 4.05 (Compliance Certificate). An
amendment will be made to conform the requirements
in the Indenture with Carolco's indentures -- only
an Officer's Certificate will be required and no
certificate of LIVE's outside independent certified
public accountants will be required.

5. Section 4.10 (Ownership of Stock of Wholly
Owned Subsidiaries). LIVE is required to maintain
each of its wholly owned subsidiaries as a 100%
subsidiary unless disposed of in full. This
provision will be removed. 

6. Section 4.15 (Limitation on Dividends and Other
Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries). This provision restricts
Subsidiaries from agreeing to limits on the payment
of dividends, making loans or repaying indebtedness
to LIVE except as may be imposed in the Bank Credit
Facilities. This provision will be modified to make
a clear that product acquisition transactions may
also create such restrictions.

7. Section 4.16 (Restrictions on Sale and Issuance
of Restricted Subsidiary Preferred Stock). This
provision restricts LIVE from allowing its
Subsidiaries to issue preferred stock to third
parties unless LIVE could incur debt in like amount. 
This provision will be removed. 

8. Section 4.17 (Restricted Payments and
Investments). The prohibition on Restricted
Payments and Restricted Investments will not apply
if LIVE is not in default. 

9. Section 4.18 (Limitation on Additional
Indebtedness). This provision will removed. 

10. Section 4.20 (Limitation on Creation of Liens). 
This provision will be removed. 

11. Section 4.21 (Company or Subsidiaries May
Consolidate, etc. only on Certain Terms). There
will be no restriction on the ability of
Subsidiaries to merge with each other, liquidate or
take other actions. LIVE will be allowed to merge,
etc., as long as the surviving company assumes the
Notes, LIVE is not in default and no default will be
caused by the merger, and the net worth of the
resulting comparing is no less than the net worth of
LIVE prior to the merger. 

12. Section 4.22 (Rank of Future Debt). This
provision will be removed.

13. Section 4.23 (Consolidated Net Worth). This
provision will be removed. 

14. Section 6.01 (Events of Default). The cross
default provisions in this Indenture will be
conformed to those in Carolco's indentures by
increasing the cross default threshold from $3
million to $5 million, changing the grace periods
and increasing the number of holders required to
notice an Event of Default. 

15. Section 6.02 (Acceleration). The percentage
required to accelerate for a monetary default will
be changed from 25% to 33-1/3%
