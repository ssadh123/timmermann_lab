CORAM HEALTHCARE CORPORATION ANNOUNCES SETTLEMENT

OF OIG INVESTIGATION OF T2 MEDICAL, INC.

NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Sept. 26, 1994 -- Coram
Healthcare Corp. (NYSE: CRH), announced that its T2 Medical, Inc. subsidiary is
settling the two-year investigation conducted by the Office of Inspector
General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the
office of the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, of T2
Medical's financial arrangements with physicians.

T2 Medical, in expressly denying liability, will agree to a civil
order which enjoins it from violating federal anti-kickback and false claims
laws related to Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement. The order further requires T2
Medical to comply with certain standards when providing management or other
services to physicians.

Under the terms of the settlement, T2 Medical will pay the federal
government $500,000 to reimburse the government for the costs of its
investigation and settle its claims. T2 Medical will continue to participate
in the Medicare/Medicaid program. The settlement is subject to court approval.

Commenting on the settlement, James M. Sweeney, Coram's chairman and
chief executive officer, said: "We are extremely pleased that we were able to
enter into this type of settlement and put the OIG investigation behind us. We
sought resolution to avoid the burden and expense of litigation and to
eliminate any taint which the investigation may have put on our efforts to
become the industry leader in the delivery of alternate site healthcare. The
settlement will not affect the way we plan to do business in the future."

Coram was formed as a result of what is believed to be the first
four-way public company merger in history. The merger, completed on July 8,
1994, united T2 Medical, Curaflex Health Services, Medisys Inc., and
HealthInfusion Inc. Coram Healthcare Corp. provides a wide range of alternate
site healthcare delivery services including ambulatory and infusion therapies,
lithotripsy, and institutional pharmacy services.
