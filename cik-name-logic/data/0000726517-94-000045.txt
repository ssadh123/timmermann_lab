PRESS RELEASE

Date for Release: Contact:
November 30, 1994 Joseph L. Boutin
(802)865-1894

Burlington, VT - November 30, 1994 - 

Joseph L. Boutin, President and Chief Executive Officer of

Merchants Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:MBVT), and Chairman of its

subsidiary, The Merchants Trust Company, announced today the

intention of The Merchants Trust Company to protect its trust

customers against losses incurred due to investments in the Piper

Jaffray Institutional Government Income Fund. On November 23,

1994, The Merchants Trust Company sold substantially all its

trust account holdings of that Fund.

"Total returns on long-term fixed income securities for the last

fourteen months have been negative due to the dramatic decline in

the bond market," said Mr. Boutin. "That is the bad news. The

good news is that the Trust Company will absorb the loss

attributable to the Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Income

Fund used as an investment vehicle in our trust accounts. Those

accounts will not lose a single dollar as a result of the Piper

Jaffray investment."

In a letter mailed today to Trust Company clients, Mr. Boutin

reported that The Merchants Trust Company will pay to each

account that was invested in the Piper Jaffray Institutional

Government Income Fund the difference between the total return it

earned from the Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Income

Fund and the total return it would have earned during the period

of its Piper Jaffray investment if the investment had been in the

Federated GNMA Fund instead. The Trust Company previously used

the Federated GNMA Fund. Total return, Mr. Boutin's letter

explained, includes the income earned over time plus or minus any

change in the market value of the underlying investment.

The payments will be made by the Trust Company during the month

of December. The total return on the Federated GNMA Fund for the

period from October 6, 1993 through November 23, 1994 was

approximately -3%. The precise payment for any particular

account will depend on the specific Piper Jaffray Institutional

Government Income Fund transactions in that account.

Mr. Boutin further stated that the exact amount to be paid to

customers was in the process of being calculated, but he

estimated that in the aggregate it would be in the range of $9

million.

Mr. Boutin further stated that funds for these payments will be

supplied by The Merchants Bank, the parent of The Merchants Trust

Company, from available working capital. Mr. Boutin said that

such payments will not reduce the capital of The Merchants Bank

below the amounts required by its regulators. Mr. Boutin also

reported that the ultimate financial effect of these events

cannot yet be determined as The Merchants Trust Company is

assessing its right to reimbursement from third parties and is

engaged in negotiations with its insurers. There is also pending

litigation relating to customers of The Merchants Trust Company.

Boutin said that "The Merchants Trust Company has been privileged

to serve Vermont and Vermonters for more than a century. With

this action, we reaffirm our commitment to put the interests of

our clients and our customers first."
