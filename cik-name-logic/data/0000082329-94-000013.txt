February 15, 1994, Houston, Texas.......... Reading & Bates Corporation
(RB-NYSE) reported net income of $4.7 million ($.05 earnings per share
after preferred stock dividends of $2.1 million) for the year ended
December 31, 1993, compared with net income for the year ended
December 31, 1992 of $3.4 million ($.04 loss per share after $5.3 million
of accretion in redemption price of redeemable stocks). Operating income
for 1993 was $18.3 million on revenues of $183.8 million compared to an
operating loss for 1992 of $7.2 million on revenues of $156.7 million.
The $25.5 million improvement in operating income is primarily attributable
to increased revenues as a result of improved utilization of the drilling
fleet. Utilization for the year ended December 31, 1993 was 85% compared
to 72% for the year ended December 31, 1992. Results for the year ended
December 31, 1992 included $6.8 million of non-recurring income due to a
curtailment gain, which was the result of the Company modifying its
postretirement benefits, and a tax refund which increased interest income 
by $10.6 million and decreased income tax expense by $1.9 million.

For the 4th quarter of 1993, the Company reported a net loss of $.5 million 
($.03 loss per share after preferred stock dividends of $1.2 million) compared
to a net loss of $4.6 million ($.10 loss per share after $.5 million of
accretion in redemption price of redeemable stocks) for the 4th quarter of 1992.
Operating income for the 4th quarter of 1993 was $2.4 million on revenues of
$48.1 million compared to an operating loss for the 4th quarter of 1992 of $2.4
million on revenues of $36.9 million. The $4.8 million improvement in operating
income is primarily attributable to increased revenues as a result of improved
utilization of the drilling fleet. Utilization for the quarter ended December
31, 1993 was 86% compared to 63% for the quarter ended December 31, 1992. 

The Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul B. Loyd, Jr., said
that despite the substantial improvement in operating results for 1993
compared to 1992, current overall industry conditions continue to inhibit
profitability expectations in the near term. However, over the longer term as
supply and demand for the industry comes into better balance, the Company's 
quality fleet should permit a significant improvement in profitability. 
Additionally, the Company expects its continued involvement in floating
production through the Amoco Liuhua project and other opportunities to
contribute to future profitability.
