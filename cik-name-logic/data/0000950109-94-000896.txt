BURLINGTON NORTHERN INC.

$150,000,000

7.40% NOTE DUE MAY 15, 1999

Registered No. 1 CUSIP No. 121897WT5

BURLINGTON NORTHERN INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the 
laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term 
includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred 
to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered 
assigns, the principal sum of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ($150,000,000)
on May 15, 1999, and to pay interest thereon at the rate of 7.40% per annum 
from May 15, 1994, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which 
interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually on May 15 and 
November 15 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing 
November 15, 1994, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for 
payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Stated Maturity of the 
principal of this Note, or any Interest Payment Date, falls on a date that is 
not a Business Day, the principal or interest, as the case may be, payable on 
such date will be payable on the next succeeding Business Day with the same 
force and effect as if paid on such date. The amount of interest payable on 
any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of 
twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly 
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture,
be paid to the person (the "Holder") in whose name this Note (or one or more 
predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on April 30 or 
October 30 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding
such Interest Payment Date (each, a "Regular Record Date"). Any such interest 
not so 
<PAGE>

punctually paid or duly provided for ("Defaulted Interest") will forthwith 
cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either 
be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more predecessor 
Notes) is registered at the close of business on a special record date (the 
"Special Record Date") for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed 
by the Trustee (referred to below), notice whereof shall be given to the 
Holder of this Note not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, 
or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully 
provided in the Indenture.

Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the 
office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose in the Borough of 
Manhattan, The City of New York in such coin or currency of the United States 
of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and
private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the
option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the person entitled
thereto as it appears on the Security Register of the Company or by transfer
to an account maintained by the payee located inside the United States.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company
(herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more
series under an Indenture dated as of February 14, 1992, as it may be
supplemented from time to time (herein called the "Indenture"), between the
Company and The First National Bank of Chicago, as Trustee (herein called the
"Trustee", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture with
respect to the series of Securities partially represented hereby), to which
Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made
for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the
Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be,
authenticated and delivered. This Note is a Global Note representing
$150,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 7.40% Notes due May 15, 1999,
limited in aggregate principal amount to $150,000,000.

This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund. This Note may not be 
redeemed at any time prior to maturity.

If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to the Notes
shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared due
and payable in the manner, with effect and subject to the conditions provided 
in the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the 
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the 
Company and the rights of the Holders of Securities of each series. Such 
amendment may be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and 
the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in 
principal amount of all Outstanding Securities affected thereby. The Indenture
also contains provisions permitting the Holders of at least a majority in 
principal amount of all Outstanding Securities to waive compliance by the 
Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and permitting the Holders of
not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of 
any series, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, to 
waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any 
such consent or waiver shall be conclusive and binding upon the Holder of this
Note and upon all future Holders of

<PAGE>

this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or 
in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not any notation thereof is 
made upon this Note.

Except in the case of a defeasance as provided in the Indenture, no reference 
herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture 
shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and 
unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the 
places, at the respective times, at the rate, and in the coin or currency 
herein prescribed.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire
indebtedness of the Company on this Note and (b) certain restrictive covenants
and the related defaults and Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company
with certain conditions set forth therein.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set 
forth, the transfer of this Note is registerable in the Security Register upon
surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of
the Company in any place where the principal of, and interest on, this Note 
are payable, duly endorsed by or accompanied by written instrument of transfer
in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed 
by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and 
thereupon one or more new Notes of this series, of authorized denominations 
and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated 
transferee or transferees.

This Global Note is exchangeable for Notes in definitive form only if the 
Depository is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depository and a 
successor depository is not appointed by the Company within 90 days. In such 
case, the Company will issue Notes in definitive form in exchange for each 
Global Note. In addition, the Company may at any time determine not to have 
the Notes represented by a Global Note and, in such event, will issue Notes in
definitive form in exchange for each Global Note. In any such instance, an 
owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note will be entitled to have Notes
equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest registered in its name 
and will be entitled to physical delivery of such Notes in definitive form. 
Notes so issued in definitive form will be issued in denominations of $1,000 
and integral multiples thereof and will be issued in registered form only, 
without coupons.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer, but the
Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other 
governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Global Note for registration of transfer, the
Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the
Holder as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Global Note 
is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be 
affected by any notice to the contrary.

Terms used herein and not defined herein which are defined in the Indenture 
shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.

This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
the State of New York.
<PAGE>

This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the
Certificate of Authentication hereon shall have been signed by an authorized 
officer of the Trustee or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Burlington Northern Inc. has caused this instrument to be 
signed by its duly authorized officers, and has caused its corporate seal to 
be affixed or imprinted hereon.

Dated: May 24, 1994
