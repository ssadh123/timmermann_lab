USAIR GROUP REPORTS 1993
------------------------
YEAR-END, FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
--------------------------------

ARLINGTON, VA, Jan. 25, 1994--USAir Group today reported a 1993 net
loss of $393.1 million, including non-recurring charges of $156.2
million, on revenue of $7.1 billion. These results compare positively
with a net loss of $1.2 billion, including non-recurring charges of
$761.7 million, on revenue of $6.7 billion for 1992.

For the fourth quarter, USAir Group reported a net loss of $116.5
million, including non-recurring charges of $60.2 million, on revenue
of $1.8 billion. This compares with a net loss of $254.0 million,
including non-recurring charges of $143.9 million, on revenue of $1.6
billion for the same quarter of 1992.

Full-Year Results
----------------- 

Results for 1993 include $156.2 million in one-time, pre-tax charges,
including the cumulative effect of a retroactive change in the method
of accounting for postemployment benefits (FAS 112) and charges
associated with employee workforce reductions and wage concessions.

Before non-recurring charges, USAir Group's operating profit for the
year 1993 was $23.7 million compared with a $223.1 million operating
loss, before non-recurring charges, for 1992. The pre-tax loss, before
non-recurring charges, was $236.9 million for 1993, which compares with
a pre-tax loss, before non-recurring charges, of $467.2 million in 1992.

Loss per common share before the cumulative effect of FAS 112 and
after preferred stock dividend requirements for 1993 was $7.68 on 55.1
million shares outstanding. This compares with a loss per common share
of $13.88 on 47.0 million shares outstanding in 1992. Before non-
recurring items, the loss per share after preferred stock dividend
requirements for 1993 was $5.64 compared with $11.04 for 1992.

The adoption of FAS 112, which occured in the third quarter of 1993,
resulted in a charge of $43.7 million retroactive to January 1, 1993.

Fourth Quarter Results
----------------------

Results for the fourth quarter of 1993 include $60.2 million in pre-
tax, non-recurring charges which include the write-down of certain
airport facilities and charges associated with employee wage conces-
sions.

PAGE 2: USAIR GROUP REPORTS...
- ------------------------------

For the fourth quarter, USAir Group's operating income, before non-
recurring items, was $13.7 million, which compares with an operating
loss, before non-recurring items, of $45.9 million for the fourth
quarter of 1992. The pre-tax loss for the quarter, before non-recurring
charges, was $56.3 million, which compares with a pre-tax loss, before
non-recurring charges, of $110.1 million in 1992.

Per share loss for the fourth quarter of 1993 was $2.29 versus $5.66
in 1992. Before non-recurring items, the loss per share was $1.27 in
the fourth quarter of 1993 versus $2.61 before non-recurring charges in
the fourth quarter of 1992.

"While we have made substantial progress in reducing our losses for
the year and for the fourth quarter, our financial results remain
unsatisfactory," said USAir Chairman, President and CEO Seth E.
Schofield. 

"To enhance USAir's ability to compete with low-cost, low-fare
airlines, we are taking action to reduce our costs and improve the
productivity of our assets and personnel, including introduction later
this year of a new short-haul service program, which we expect will
permit us to increase capacity and lower unit costs in certain markets
under 500 miles."
