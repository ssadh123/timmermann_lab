Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On December 9, 1994, Petrie Stores Corporation,
a New York corporation ("Petrie"), consummated the sale
(the "Sale") of all of its and its subsidiaries' (the "Subsidiaries")
retail operations to PS Stores Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation formed by an investor group led by E.M.
Warburg, Pincus & Co., Inc. The investor group includes
Verna Gibson, former President of The Limited Stores, a
division of The Limited, Inc., Allan Laufgraben, Vice
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Petrie
prior to the Sale, and Peter A. Left, Vice Chairman,
Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and
Secretary of Petrie prior to the Sale.

The purchase price for the Sale was $190
million in cash plus the assumption of certain
liabilities of Petrie and its subsidiaries. Taking into
effect the approximately $12.5 million in expenses
incurred by Petrie in connection with the consummation of
the Sale, the net purchase price of the retail operations
was approximately $177.5 million. The purchase price was
established through arms' length negotiations following
the solicitation, receipt and consideration of
expressions of interest from certain parties.

The foregoing description of the Sale is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 23,
1994 (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), by and between
Petrie and WP Investors, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("WP Investors"), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the

by and between Petrie and WP Investors ("Amendment No.
1"). The Stock Purchase Agreement was previously filed
as an exhibit to Petrie's Current Report on Form 8-K,
filed August 26, 1994, and is incorporated herein by
reference. Amendment No. 1 was previously filed as an
exhibit to Petrie's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed
November 17, 1994, and is incorporated herein by
reference. A copy of the Press Release, issued December
9, 1994, announcing the consummation of the Sale, is
filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report and is incorporated
herein by reference.

Item 5. Other Events.

As of the close of business on December 16,
1994, $123,156,000 principal amount of Petrie's
outstanding 8% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due
December 15, 2010 (the "Debentures") were converted into
5,565,985 shares of Petrie common stock, par value $1.00
per share ("Petrie Common Stock"). The remaining
$1,844,000 principal amount of Debentures were redeemed
at a redemption price of $1,008 per $1,000 principal
amount of Debentures, together with accrued and unpaid
interest thereon of $39.333 per $1,000 principal amount
of Debentures, from June 15, 1994 to, but not including,
December 12, 1994. As a result of the conversions, the
number of shares of Petrie Common Stock outstanding has
increased to 52,349,103 shares.

A copy of the Notice of Redemption of the
Debentures was previously filed as an exhibit to Petrie's
Current Report on Form 8-K, filed November 17, 1994 and
is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Press
Release, issued December 13, 1994, announcing the
