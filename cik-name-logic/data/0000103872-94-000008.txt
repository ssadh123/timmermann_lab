Item 5. Other Events

On October 10, 1994, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. announced
the NYNEX telephone companies have accepted a directory
assistance system provided by Volt's subsidiary, Volt Delta
Resources, Inc. The system is operational at all New England
sites and most New York sites for which its deployment is
intended. Volt Delta will continue to provide ongoing
maintenance services to both telephone companies.

This was the first installation of a new generation of directory
assistance systems. Other major telephone companies have also
placed orders for Volt Delta systems; these are currently in the
implementation process.

The Company had previously reported a loss related to cost
overruns on the system which was charged to the Company's
earnings in fiscal 1993. As a result, there will be no impact on
fiscal 1994 fourth quarter earnings, although revenue will be
recognized.
