Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking
industry. The significant accounting policies are summarized below.

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Constellation Bancorp (the "holding company") and it's two wholly-owned
subsidiaries (the "Company"), Constellation Bank, N.A. ("Constellation") and
Home Investors Mortgage Corporation ("Home Investors"), and the Constellation
affiliate, WASCO Funding Corp. ("WASCO"). All material intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. On March 16, 1994, the
Company was acquired by CoreStates Financial Corp ("CoreStates"). See Note 2.

The accompanying financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 
1993 have been restated to remove charges of $195,000,000 related to the 
Company's acquisition by CoreStates from the fourth quarter of 1993 as 
previously reported (See Note 2). This restatement was made after discussions
with the Securities and Exchange Commission staff which resulted in these
charges being reflected in the first quarter of 1994, the quarter that the
acquisition was consummated. On a pre-tax basis, the merger-related charges
consisted of a $120.0 million provision for loan losses, a $28.0 million
addition to the OREO reserve, $13.0 million for the writedown of purchased
mortgage servicing rights and related assets, and $34.0 million for expenses
directly attributable to the acquisition. The effects of this restatement on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 1993 are summarized as follows:

</TABLE> 

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make
estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the
date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. In making
such estimates, management must make certain assumptions based on available
information and existing conditions. It is management's responsibility to make
reasonable assumptions when preparing such estimates.

Because events may occur or conditions result that are different from those
assumed to occur or result, actual results could differ significantly from the
results based on such estimates. Events and conditions that could occur or
change and result in changes different than those based on such estimates
include dramatic and unforeseen changes in economic conditions over a short
period of time, conditions in the real estate markets and specific events
affecting specific borrowers or groups of borrowers. These assumptions are
particularly important with respect to the determination of the allowance for
loan losses and the valuation of real estate owned in connection with
foreclosures and in-substance foreclosures. In connection with the
determination of the allowances for loan losses, management generally obtains
independent appraisals for properties.

While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans
and real estate, future additions to the allowance for loan losses or further
writedowns of other real estate owned and loans foreclosed in-substance may be
necessary based on changes in economic conditions in our market area.

Investments

Effective December 31, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities" ("FAS No. 115"). FAS No. 115 established the accounting and
reporting requirements for investments in equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities. All
affected investment securities must be classified as either held-to-maturity,
trading, or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at
amortized cost basis. Trading securities are carried at fair value with
unrealized holding gains and losses reported in the income statement.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized holding
gains and losses reported as a component of shareholders' equity. As a result
of adopting FAS No. 115, securities with an original carrying value of
$132,900,000 were classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 1993 and were
adjusted to their aggregate fair value of $138,200,000. After the related tax
effects, shareholders' equity at December 31, 1993 was increased by $3,487,000
to reflect the adjustment of these securities to fair value.

Held-to-maturity securities are carried at cost adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, both computed on the interest method.
Held-to-maturity securities primarily consist of debt securities. The Company
has both the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until
maturity. Trading account securities are carried at market values. Gains on
trading account securities include both realized and unrealized gains and losses
on the portfolio.

Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading and marketable
equity securities are classified as available-for-sale because they are held for
an indefinite period of time and are not intended to be held to maturity.
Available for sale securities include securities that management intends to use
as part of its overall asset/liability strategy and that may be sold in response
to changes in interest rates and resultant prepayment risk. Available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of
tax, reported as a component of shareholders' equity.

The adjusted cost of a specific certificate sold is the basis for determining
realized securities gains and losses as included in the consolidated statement
of income in "non-interest income".

Interest and dividends on investment securities are recognized as income when
earned.

Loans

Interest on commercial loans is recognized on the daily principal amounts
outstanding. Loan fees are generally considered as adjustments of interest rate
yields and are amortized into interest income on loans over the terms of the
related loans. Interest on installment loans is principally recognized on the
interest method.

Commercial loans are placed on a non-accrual status, generally recognizing
interest as income when received, when, in the opinion of management, the
collectibility of principal or interest becomes doubtful. The deferral or non-
recognition of interest does not constitute forgiveness of the borrower's
obligation. In those cases where collection of principal is in doubt, additions
are made to the allowance for loan losses. When loans are placed on 
non-accrual status, interest receivable thereon which had been previously 
credited to income is reversed. Interest income on these loans is recognized 
only to the extent payments are received. Loans are returned to an accrual 
status when factors indicating doubtful collectibility on a timely basis no 
longer exist and all past due payments are brought current.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions charged to expense and
reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. While management uses available
information to recognize losses on loans and real estate, future additions to
the allowance for loan losses or further writedowns of other real estate owned
and loans foreclosed in-substance may be necessary based on changes in economic
conditions in the company's market area.

In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their
examination process, periodically review the company's allowances for loan
losses on loans and other real estate valuations. Such agencies may require the
company to recognize additions to the allowance or additional writedowns based
on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their
examination.

Trust Income

Trust income is recognized generally on a cash basis in accordance with
customary banking practice. The results of trust operations would not be
materially different if reported on an accrual method. Trust assets held in
fiduciary or agency capacities for customers of the trust division are not
assets of the company and, accordingly, are not included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the
estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Expenditures
for major improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are
expensed as incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions are reflected in current
operations.

Other Real Estate Owned and Loans Foreclosed In-Substance

Other real estate owned ("OREO") is comprised of foreclosed properties where the
Company has actually received title. When a borrower has little or no equity in
a property which is the primary source of repayment of a loan and it is doubtful
that equity will be rebuilt in the foreseeable future, the property is
considered foreclosed in-substance. Both other real estate owned and in-
substance foreclosures are carried at the lower of fair value less estimated
costs to sell as determined by current appraisals or the recorded investment in
the loan on the property. Costs of holding such property are charged to expense
in the current period, except for certain expenses, such as significant property
improvements, which are capitalized to the extent that the carrying value of the
property does not exceed net realizable value. Prior to January 1992, write-
downs on such properties occurring after the initial transfer from the loan
portfolio were recorded as operating expenses. Gains, to the extent allowable,
and losses on the disposition of property were reflected in current operations.
Subsequent to initial establishment of an 0RE0 reserve on December 31, 1991,
write-downs and losses on the disposition of property are charged to the OREO
reserve. The reserve is replenished through an OREO provision reflected in
current operations.

Excess of Cost Over Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired

The excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business
combinations is included in other assets and is amortized on a straight-line
basis over periods ranging from 10 to 15 years.

Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return. State income tax
returns are filed on a separate basis.

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." FAS No. 109 requires a change to the asset and liability method
of income tax accounting from the deferred method of accounting for income taxes
required by Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 11. FAS No. 109
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company's
financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of deferred tax assets and
liabilities is based on the enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income for
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. FAS No. 109 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be
adjusted for the effect of a change in tax rates in the period of enactment.

The Company adopted FAS No. 109 in 1993 without restating prior period 
financial statements. A valuation allowance equal to the tax benefits resulting 
from adoption of FAS 109 was established. Tax benefits have not been recognized 
in the Company's Consolidated Financial statements as it is more likely than 
not that the Company will not be able to currently recognize such benefits 
based upon the Company's lack of recoverable taxes and the uncertainty 
regarding the generation of future taxable income.

Income (Loss) Per Common Share 

Income (loss) per common share was computed by dividing net income (loss) by 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The average shares 
outstanding were 27.197 million, 9.065 million and 8.200 million for the years
ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. 

Shares issuable under stock option plans have not been included in the
calculation of net income (loss) per common share since their effect is either
immaterial or anti-dilutive. exit

Pension Plans

Pension plan costs based on actuarial computation of current and future benefits
for employees are charged to expense and are funded based on the maximum amount
that can be deducted for Federal income tax purposes.

Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company adopted FAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other than Pensions," as of January 1, 1993. FAS No. 106 requires the
accrual, during the service periods of the employees, of the expected cost of
providing health care and other benefits to employees subsequent to their
retirement. Prior to the adoption of FAS No. 106, such costs were recorded on a
cash basis.

Statements of Cash Flows

For purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with
banks. Generally, federal funds are purchased/sold for one-day periods. All
short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

FAS No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires
entities to disclose the fair value information on financial instruments. The
disclosure includes both on and off balance sheet financial instruments. Fair
value estimates are based on quoted market prices, discounting scheduled cash
flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates, or
other methods as appropriate. These estimates are subjective in nature and
involve uncertainties and matters of judgement and as a result cannot be
considered as the actual value of the bank. Changes in assumptions used in
determining fair value of the financial instruments could significantly alter
the estimates.

The following assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair
value of financial instruments;

- 13 -
<PAGE>

Cash and due from banks, and federal funds sold: the carrying amount
approximates fair value.

Securities: For investment securities and investment securities available
for sale, fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. If a
quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted
market prices for similar securities.

Loans: Fair value is estimated for portfolios of loans with similar loan
characteristics. The fair value for certain residential mortgage loans and
consumer loans are based on quoted market prices for securities backed by
similar loans adjusted for difference in loan characteristics. The fair value
for commercial, commercial mortgage and construction type loans is estimated by
discounting cash flows using current interest rates for loans with similar
characteristics. Certain loans have been identified for accelerated resolution
and were valued utilizing estimated liquidation market values of loans with
similar characteristics.

Deposit Liabilities: The fair value of non-interest bearing demand
deposits, savings accounts, NOW accounts, and money market accounts is the same
as the carrying amount reported. The fair value of certificates of deposit is
calculated using the discounted cash flows method. The discount rate used was
the current rate offered by the bank for deposits with similar remaining
maturities.

Commitments to Extend Credit, Standby Letters of Credit and Financial
Guarantees Written: The fair value of commitments is estimated using fees
currently charged for similar agreements, based on the remaining term of the
commitment and the present credit quality rating of the counterparty. The fair
value on the standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written is based
on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on estimated cost to
terminate them or to settle the obligations with the counterparties at the
reporting date.

Other Borrowed Funds: Other borrowed funds which primarily consist of
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase are
short term in nature and their carrying amount approximates fair value.

Reclassification

Reclassifications of prior period amounts are made when necessary to conform to
current year's presentation.

Note 2 Acquisition of the Company

On March 16, 1994, the Company was acquired by CoreStates Financial Corp
("CoreStates") in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests ("the
Acquisition"). For each Company share of common stock outstanding, .4137 of a
share of CoreStates common stock was issued (Exchange Ratio). Constellation
subsequently was merged into CoreStates' New Jersey National Subsidiary. 
Subsequent to the March 16, 1994 consummation of the Acquisition, the Company 
recorded Acquisition related charges in connection with a change in non-
performing asset strategic direction and to conform consumer lending charge-off
policies, and charges for expenses attributable to the Acquisition. The
following summarizes the impact of the Acquisition and the Acquisition related
charges recorded by the Company in the first quarter of 1994. 

Allowance for Loan and Other Real Estate Owned Losses

In connection with a change in strategic direction related to the Acquisition
and to conform the Company's loan, accrual and reserve policies to those of
CoreStates', the Company recorded an addition to the allowance for possible loan
losses of $120,000,000 and an addition to the reserve against other real estate
owned ("OREO") of $28,000,000 in March 1994. The Company currently estimates
that assets with a carrying value of approximately $340,000,000 will be disposed
of within eighteen months from the date of Acquisition. The estimated reserves
against these assets represent approximately 40% of this amount. The conforming
adjustments, mostly related to consumer lending charge-off policies, comprise
approximately $10,500,000 of the aggregate $148,000,000 in provisions. 

- 15 -
<PAGE>

Special Charges

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company recorded a charge in March 1994
of $37,000,000 for expenses directly attributable to the Acquisition, including
severance benefits, employment contracts, leasehold terminations and
professional fees and certain other costs and expenses. In addition, a
$10,000,000 writedown of the Company's purchased mortgage servicing rights was
recorded. The write-down was taken primarily due to accelerated prepayment
assumptions to conform to CoreStates' methodology. 

Stock Option Plans

The Company maintains a 1987 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan (the "1987
Plan"), 1989 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan (the "1989 Plan"), the Stock
Option Plan for Outside Directors of New Brunswick Savings Bank and the 1992
Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right Plan (the "1992 Plan").

Upon consummation of the Acquisition, Company stock options were converted into
options to purchase CoreStates Common Shares on the same terms and conditions as
are in effect immediately prior to the Acquisition, based upon the Exchange
Ratio. Certain Company stock options issued under the 1987 Plan and the stock
options issued under the 1992 Plan that are not otherwise exercisable became
exercisable at the time of the Acquisition pursuant to provisions providing for
immediate exercise upon the occurrence of a change of control, such as the
Acquisition.

Note 3 Restricted Cash Balances

Cash balances reserved to meet regulatory requirements of the Federal Reserve
Bank and balances maintained at other banks for compensating balance
requirements amounted to $32,778,000 and $9,321,000 respectively, at December
31, 1993.

</TABLE>

If the non-accrual and restructured loans had continued to accrue interest in
accordance with their original contract terms, net income, after assuming a 34%
tax rate, would have increased approximately $5,100,000 ($.19 per share),
$6,395,000 ($.71 per share) and $11,035,000 ($1.35 per share) in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively. The total amount of interest income received on these loans
in 1993, 1992 and 1991 amounted to $1,208,000, $1,951,000 and $3,809,000,
respectively. At December 31, 1993, there were no material commitments to lend
additional funds to borrowers whose loans were classified as non-accrual or
restructured. Non-performing asset related expense which amounted to $24.545
million, $18.703 million and $14.979 million for 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, are included within other expenses in the consolidated statements
of income.

Most of the Company's business is with customers located within New Jersey.
A portion of the total loan portfolio is secured by real estate located in a
current weak real estate environment. Commercial real estate loans of $273
million represented 16.4% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 1993,
which includes construction loans of $50 million, or 3.1% of the total loan
portfolio at year-end. The

- 21 -
<PAGE>

principal area of exposure within total commercial real estate loans was in
residential and commercial construction projects. In addition, substantially
all of the other real estate owned and loans foreclosed in-substance are located
in the same region. Accordingly, the ultimate collectibility of the loan
portfolio is susceptible to changes in market conditions in the New Jersey real
estate market.

The Company has had, and expects to have in the future, banking
transactions in the ordinary course of business with directors, officers and
associates on the same terms as those prevailing for comparable transactions
with other borrowers. The aggregate of these loans was $20,823,000 and
$48,855,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. During 1993, new loans
in the amount of $85,692,000 were made to such persons and repayments by such
persons were $113,724,000.

Note 12 Rights Offering - Recapitalization

On December 18, 1992 the company successfully completed a Recapitalization Plan.
The Recapitalization consisted of the sale of 13.3 million shares of common
stock in a Rights Offering to existing shareholders, the sale of 5.5 million
additional shares of common stock to various standby purchasers and the
repayment of $17.5 million in indebtedness for cash. Also, as part of the
Recapitalization, the Company contributed to its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Constellation, as a capital contribution, approximately $47.4 million of the net
proceeds from the sale of such stock and a $10 million subordinated note.

As a result, the company's shareholders' equity increased by approximately
$67.5 million and Constellation's shareholders' equity increased by
approximately $58 million.

Note 13 Income Taxes

In February 1992, the FASB issued FAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." FAS No. 109 calls for a change to the asset and liability method of
income tax accounting from the deferred method of accounting for income taxes
required by Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 11. FAS No. 109
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company's
financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of deferred tax assets and
liabilities is based on the enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income for
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. FAS No. 109 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be
adjusted for the effect of a change in tax rates in the period of enactment.

- 25 -
<PAGE>

As required by FAS No. 109, the Company adopted the pronouncement on January 1,
1993. However, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared as if
the Company retroactively adopted FAS No. 109 as of January 1, 1987.

For 1993, 1992 and 1991, the income tax expense (benefit) includes the
following components:

After the IRS examination of the 1991 net operating loss carryback claim,
Constellation's December 31, 1993 consolidated net operating loss carryforward
for tax return purposes is expected to approximate $33 million. In addition,
Constellation also has general business credit carryforwards of approximately
$1.3 million expiring from 1994 through 2008 and alternative minimum tax
credit carryforwards of approximately $1.2 million having indefinite lives.

Except for the effects of the reversal of net deductible temporary differences,
the Company is not currently aware of any factors which would cause any
significant differences between taxable income and pretax book income in future
years. However, there can be no assurances that there will be no significant
differences in the future between taxable income and pretax book income if
circumstances change (such as, for example, changes in tax laws or the Company's
financial condition or performance). In order to fully realize the deferred tax
asset, the Company will need to generate future taxable income. Management
believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the
benefit of net deductible temporary differences. Management has projected that
the Company will not generate sufficient taxable income to currently utilize the
deferred tax asset. There can be no assurance that the Company will generate
any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings. A valuation
allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been established as a result of
the above. Beginning in 1994, the Company will file a consolidated tax return 
with its parent CoreStates. Future realizability of the deferred tax asset
will be based on the consolidated position of CoreStates.

Note 14 Benefit Plans

Pension Plans

Constellation provides a non-contributory defined benefit plan covering
substantially all employees. Benefits under the plan are based on years of
credited service, employees estimated compensation at retirement and primary
social security benefits. For the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
the pension expense aggregated $232,000, $317,000 and $1,125,000 respectively.

The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts
recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In addition, Constellation has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. This
plan, which is not funded, is designed to supplement the pension plan for key
employees designated by the Board of Directors. The cost of this plan is being
accrued annually and amounted to $194,000, $502,000 and $210,000 in 1993, 1992
and 1991 respectively.

Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to active
and retired employees. Substantially all of the company's employees may become
eligible for retired employees' health and life insurance if they reach
retirement age and satisfy certain service requirements. The company adopted,
on a prospective basis, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (FAS No.
106). Under FAS No. 106 the costs of such benefits are accrued based on
actuarial assumptions from the date of hire to the date the employee is fully
eligible to receive the benefits. Prior to the adoption of FAS No. 106, the
costs of these benefits were expensed as paid.

For measurement purposes, the 1993 health care cost trend rate is projected
to be 15% through 1995, 10% for the next 10 years, and 6% thereafter. The
health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts
reported. To illustrate, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by
1% in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
as of January 1, 1993 by $337,000 (3%) and the aggregate of the service and
interest cost components of net periodic retirement benefit cost for the year
1993 by $24,000 (3%). The weighted average discount rate used in determining
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7%. The change in the
weighted average discount rate from 9% resulted in an increase in the actuarial
present value of the postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $1.1
million.

Incentive Bonus Plans

Management incentive plans have been established with the intention of providing
added incentive to key executives to increase the profits of the company. The
executives and the amount of the awards are subject to limits as set forth in
the plans. Payments to the plans amounted to $787,000, $0 and $28,000 in 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively. In addition to the foregoing, Constellation Bank
awarded discretionary cash bonuses for 1993 performance under the 1993 Incentive
Plan in an additional amount of $250,000.

Certain subsidiaries maintain other incentive plans for certain officers
and employees. There were no payments under these plans for 1993, 1992 and
1991.

Savings and Investment Plan

A savings and investment plan is available to employees of Constellation
Bancorp. Employees can make contributions to the plan by means of payroll
deduction of up to 15% of their compensation. The company provides a matching
contribution of at least 25% of the first 6% of the employees' contributions.
Payments to the plan by the company in 1993, 1992 and 1991 amounted to $187,000,
$267,000 and $679,000, respectively.

Stock Option Plan

The Stock Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan") specifies that a maximum of
400,000 shares of Constellation Bancorp's common stock may be issued to key
employees of the company. The exercise price of all stock options granted under
the Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of such shares on the
date of grant. Options expire ten years from the date of the grant. Stock
appreciation rights maybe added to all or part of any option granted under the
Plan. Any such Right shall permit the participant to receive, upon exercise of
the Right and surrender of the option, an amount, to be paid in cash, shares, or
both, equal in value to the difference between the fair market value of the
shares with respect to which the Right is exercised and the option price of the
shares.

Information with respect to options under the Plan is as follows:

In addition to the above plans, in 1989 the Board of Directors of the company
adopted the 1989 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan (the "1989 Plan"). The 1989
Plan authorizes the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options and
restricted share awards for up to 185,000 shares of common stock, subject to
adjustment in certain events, to such officers and other key employees of the
corporation and its subsidiaries as the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors

- 31 -
<PAGE>

of the company may determine. The company has approved the grant of options to
purchase an aggregate of 75,100 shares of common stock to certain officers and
key employees of Constellation, at an exercise price per share equal to $19.20
(after applying the January 19, 1993 conversion factor). The options will be
exercisable on a cumulative basis in equal installments over a five-year period.
Each such option will have a maximum term of ten years.

The 1989 Plan also provides for the grant of restricted stock awards. Each
such award entitles the recipient to receive a specified number of shares of
common stock, unrestricted title to which is contingent upon the recipient's
continuation of employment with the company or its subsidiaries for a period
specified in the award, which period may not be less than one year nor more than
ten years. In 1989 the company approved the grant of restricted stock awards
for an aggregate of 76,590 shares of common stock at a price per share of $28.85
or $2.210 million to officers and key employees of Constellation. Each such
award will be 20% vested on the first anniversary of the date of grant, will
vest at a rate of 20% on each anniversary thereafter and will become 100% vested
on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.

In 1989, the Board of Directors of the company adopted the Stock Option
Plan for Outside Directors of New Brunswick Savings Bank (the "Directors'
Plan"). The Directors' Plan authorizes the grant of non-qualified stock options
for up to 79,200 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in certain
events, to members of the Board of Directors of New Brunswick Savings Bank other
than directors who also serve as employees of New Brunswick Savings Bank, the
company or any subsidiaries of the company. In 1989 the company approved the
grant of an option to purchase 8,800 shares of common stock to certain non-
employee members of the Board of Directors of New Brunswick Savings Bank. In
1991, New Brunswick Savings Bank was merged with and into Constellation. Four
members of the Board of Directors of New Brunswick Savings Bank continue to
serve as members of the Board of Directors of Constellation and hold options.
The options are exercisable at a price per share of $19.20 (after applying the
January 19, 1993 conversion factor). Each option is exercisable on a cumulative
basis in equal installments over a five-year period. Options will terminate
upon the earlier of five years following the date of grant or ninety (90) days
following the date on which the director ceases to serve in such capacity for
any reason other than death.

In 1992 the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Constellation
Bancorp 1992 Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right Plan (the "Plan). The
purposes of the Plan are to provide special earnings opportunities to key
executives of the Company and its subsidiaries by enabling them to share in
positive changes in the value of the Common Stock of the Company and to enable
the Company to attract and to keep in its employment executives who can
contribute significantly to its long term business interests. Under the Plan,
options covering a maximum of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be granted to
key employees of the Company. Options granted under the Plan may be either
incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options, as the Committee
determines to be in the best interests of the Company at the time of the grant
of options. The Compensation Committee will have authority, in its sole
discretion, to provide that a stock appreciation right shall be added to all or
part of any option granted under the Plan. Any such stock appreciation right
will permit the participant to receive, upon exercise of the stock appreciation
right and surrender of the option, an amount, to be paid in cash, in shares, or
in both cash and shares, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its
discretion, equal in value to the difference between the fair market value of
the shares with respect to which the stock appreciation right is exercised and
the option price of the shares. The option price per share of Common Stock

- 33 -

under each incentive stock option shall be determined by the Compensation
Committee and shall not be less than the fair market value at the time the
option is granted. The option price per share of Common Stock under each non-
qualified stock option shall be determined by the Compensation Committee. Each
option shall be exercisable in whole or in part at such times as the Committee
may determine, but not later than ten years from the date the option is granted.
In the event of a Change in Control, as defined in the Plan, all options shall
become exercisable in full.

On January 19, 1993, the Compensation Committee acted to adjust the option
price of the stock options outstanding prior to November 18, 1992, the record
date for the company's Recapitalization. The Compensation Committee adjusted
the option price of all stock options outstanding prior to November 18, 1992 by
a factor of .6656 to preserve the relative option value of options outstanding
prior to the Recapitalization. The data herein reflects such adjustments.

Impact on Benefit Plans of Acquisition

It is anticipated that the Company's pension and savings and investment 
plans will be merged into those of CoreStates subsequent to the Acquisition. 
Officers and employees of the Company who become or remain regular (full-time)
employees of CoreStates or any of its subsidiaries will be provided employee 
benefits no less favorable than those provided by CoreStates and its 
subsidiaries to their similarly situated officers or employees. In addition, 
any officer or employee of the Company who becomes a participant in any 
employee benefit plan of CoreStates shall be given credit under such plan for 
all prior service with the Company for purposes of eligibility and vesting.

Upon consummation of the Acquisition, each outstanding and unexercised 
option to purchase shares of the Company issued under the Company's stock 
option plans was converted into an option to purchase CoreStates Common Shares
as adjusted based upon the Exchange Ratio.

Note 15 Shareholder Rights Plan

Constellation Bancorp had a Shareholder Rights Plan designed to protect the
shareholders of the company in the event of takeover action that the Board of
Directors believed would deny shareholders the full value of their investment.
The Shareholder Rights Plan did not intend to prevent a takeover of the company
that the Board believed beneficial to the company's shareholders.

Note 16 Regulatory Matters Restated (See Note 1) 

The Federal Reserve Board in the case of bank holding companies such as the
Company, and the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") in the case of national
banks such as Constellation each in general measure capital adequacy by using a
risk-based capital framework and by monitoring compliance with minimum leverage
ratio guidelines. The minimum ratio of total risk-based capital to risk-
weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby
letters of credit) is 8%. At least half of the total capital, or 4%, is to be
comprised of common equity and qualifying perpetual preferred 

- 34 -
<PAGE>

stock, less deductible intangibles ("Tier I capital"). The remainder ("Tier II
capital") may consist of mandatory convertible debt securities, qualifying
subordinated debt, other preferred stock and a portion of the reserve for
possible credit losses up to 1.25% of total calculated assets.

In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage
ratio guidelines for bank holding companies and the OCC has established minimum
leverage ratio guidelines for national banks. These guidelines provide for a
minimum Tier I leverage ratio (Tier I capital to quarterly average total assets
for bank holding companies and period-end assets for national banks less
deductible intangibles) of 3% for bank holding companies and banks that meet
certain criteria, including that they maintain the highest regulatory rating.
All other bank holding companies and banks are required to maintain a leverage
ratio of 3% plus an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points.

The Federal Reserve Board and OCC have adopted changes to its risk-based
and leverage ratio requirements applicable to bank holding companies and state
chartered member banks that require that all intangibles, including core deposit
intangibles, PMSRs and purchased credit card relationships ("PCCRs"), be
deducted from Tier I capital. The changes, however, grandfather identifiable
assets (other than PMSRs and PCCRs) acquired on or before February 19, 1992 and
permit the inclusion of readily marketable PMSRs and PCCRs in Tier I capital to
the extent that (i) PMSRs and PCCRs do not exceed 50% of Tier I capital and (ii)
PCCRs do not exceed 25% of Tier I capital. For such purposes, PMSRs and PCCRs
each would be included in Tier I capital only up to the lessor of (i) 90% of
their fair market value (which must be determined quarterly) and (ii) 100% of
the remaining unamortized book value of such assets.

On August 22, 1991, Constellation entered into the Consent Order with the
OCC and on July 20, 1992, the Company entered into a written Agreement with the
FRBNY. Such consent orders generally indicate a high level of regulatory
concern as to the viability of the institution. The Consent Order and the
Written Agreement had imposed significant and material operating restrictions on
the Company and Constellation and required the Company and Constellation to take
a variety of material remedial steps to restore their financial condition and
results of operations.

The Consent Order resulted from, among other things, the OCCs determination
as indicated in the Consent Order, that certain practices of Constellation were
deemed to be unsafe and unsound.

Constellation submitted a capital plan to the OCC in December 1991. The
plan called for a recapitalization of Constellation via a restructuring of the
outstanding Company debt and the raising of new equity in 1992, which was
successfully completed via a rights offering in December 1992.

- 35 -
<PAGE>

The Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
(FDICIA) required the Federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt
corrective action with respect to depository institutions which do not meet
minimum capital standards and other safety and soundness regulations which have
not been finalized. In response to FDICIA, the FDIC and the OCC have adopted
regulations which establish a scheme for prompt regulatory corrective action
with respect to depository institutions which do not meet minimum capital
requirements. The "prompt corrective action" regulations established five
categories of depository institutions: (1) well-capitalized, (2) adequately
capitalized, (3) undercapitalized, (4) significantly undercapitalized and (5)
critically undercapitalized. Each category relates to the level of capital for
the depository institution. To be considered "adequately capitalized", an
institution must generally have a leverage ratio of at least 4%, a Tier I risk-
based capital ratio of at least 4% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at
least 8%. An institution is deemed to be "critically undercapitalized" if it
has a tangible equity ratio of 2% or less.

Under FDICIA, depository institutions that are "undercapitalized" under
proposed regulations become subject to significant restrictions and are required
to take certain actions to restore their capital levels. An undercapitalized
institution must submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the
appropriate federal banking agency, which plan must be, in the opinion of such
agency, "likely to succeed" in restoring the institution's capital and be
accompanied by a guarantee, subject to certain limitations, of such plan and its
performance by the holding company for such institution. This guarantee would
rank senior to most of the holding company's other obligations in the event of
the holding company's insolvency. A receiver or conservator may be appointed
for an undercapitalized institution if it fails to submit or comply with an
acceptable capital plan, has no reasonable prospect of being adequately
capitalized or otherwise fails to raise sufficient capital.

At December 31, 1993, for regulatory capital purposes both the Company and
Constellation were in compliance with applicable capital requirements. In March
1994, CoreStates made a capital contribution to Constellation Bank of
$80,000,000, subsequent to Constellation Bank's recording $195,000,000 of pre-
tax merger-related charges in connection with the Acquisition.

Note 17 Dividend Restrictions and Liquidation Rights Restated (See Note 1) 

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from Constellation and the
company's other subsidiaries. Other than its equity interest in Constellation,
the company does not have any significant sources of revenue other than
dividends from Constellation. Federal law imposes limitation on the payment of
dividends by national banks such as Constellation. Two different calculations
are performed to measure the amount of dividends that may be paid: a "recent
earnings" test and a "undivided profits" test.

Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid in any calendar
year if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar
year is in excess of the current year's net profits combined of the two
preceding years unless the bank obtains the prior approval of the OCC. Pursuant
to regulations (the "Regulations") adopted in December 1990 by the OCC, "net
profits" is defined as the net income figure reported by a bank in its Reports
of Condition and Income and "retained net profits" is "net profits" less any
common or preferred dividends declared for that reporting period. Under the
recent earnings test, to the extent that a national bank has a loss in any year
the national bank must subtract that loss (as well as any dividend paid) from
earnings during the next two years in determining its capacity to pay dividends.
Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a
bank's undivided profits then on hand, after deducting (i) losses and (ii) bad
debts in excess of the allowance for loan losses. Under the Regulations,
"allowance for loan losses" and "undivided profits" are defined as the amounts
reported as such by a bank in its Reports of Condition and Income; and "bad
debts" is defined to include matured obligations due a bank on which the
interest is past due and unpaid for six months, unless the debts are well-
secured and in the process of collection. Generally, a debt is considered
"matured" when all or part of the principal is due and payable as a result of
demand, arrival of the stated maturity date, or acceleration by contract or by
operation of law. In addition, the Regulations specify that only that portion
of a bank's surplus account that is "earned surplus" (that is, surplus derived
from earnings of prior periods that is in excess of the minimum amount of
surplus required under federal law to be maintained by the bank) may be
transferred to undivided profits for the purpose of paying dividends, provided
that the transfer is approved by the OCC. Under the recent earnings test, as of
December 31, 1993, Constellation could not pay any dividends to the Company
without the prior approval of the OCC. Under the "undivided profits test," as
of December 31, 1993, Constellation could not pay any dividends to the Company.
Constellation had a deficit with respect to its retained net profits of $70.5
million at December 31, 1993. Constellation had a deficit with respect to its
undivided profits of $17.7 million at December 31, 1993. 

- 37 -

<PAGE>

The payment of dividends by the Company and Constellation may also be
affected by other factors, such as the maintenance of adequate capital. For
example, FDICIA generally prohibits an undercapitalized institution from paying
dividends. In addition, if, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory
authority, a bank holding company or a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in
or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the
financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), such
authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist
from such practice. The FRBNY, the OCC and the FDIC have issued policy
statements which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should
generally only pay dividends out of the current operating earnings. 

A liquidation account was established for the benefit of all eligible
account holders of New Brunswick who continue to maintain their deposits in New
Brunswick. The initial liquidation account balance of $58.6 million equaled the
shareholders' equity of New Brunswick as of June 30, 1989. The initial interest
of each account holder was in the same proportion that the balance in his or her
deposit account was to the aggregate balance in the deposit accounts as of the
eligibility record date. New Brunswick may not declare or pay a cash dividend
if the effect thereof will cause its shareholders' equity to be reduced below
the amount required for the liquidation account. The liquidation account is
reduced annually in proportion to the reduction of eligible deposit account
balances. The amount of the liquidation account at December 31, 1993 was $3.0
million.

Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in
the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers.
These financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit, standby
letters of credit and future contracts. These financial instruments involve, to
varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the
amount recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of condition. The
contract or notional amounts of these instruments express the extent of
involvement the company has in each class of financial instruments.

The Company uses the same credit policies and collateral requirements in
making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance
instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers
as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. Since the commitments may expire without
being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent
future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's credit
worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed
necessary by the Company upon

- 38 -
<PAGE>

extension of credit, is based upon management's credit evaluation of the
borrower. Collateral held on these commitments varies. Standby letters of
credit are conditional commitments issued by the company insuring performance or
commercial obligations of a customer to a third party. These commitments
commonly involve real estate transactions. Commercial letters of credit are
irrevocable instruments issued by the company for the benefit of a customer's
supplier to insure payment when the terms and conditions of the letters of
credit are met. Most of the company's lending activity is with customers
located within the State of New Jersey.

Annual rental expense charged to non-interest expense was approximately
$4,761,000, $4,381,000 and $5,233,000 in the years 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

A class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York on June 8, 1990. A first amended and second
amended complaint were filed on August 23, 1990 and April 1, 1992, respectively.
The second amended complaint names as defendants the company, its then banking
subsidiaries, the bank and New Brunswick Savings Bank, and the following present
and former directors and officers: John J. Connolly, C. William Kuhlthau, III,
Frederic K. Becker, Francis V. Bonello, Anne Evans Gibbons, W. Emlen Roosevelt,
Joel D. Siegel, Martin L. Ritter, John A. Brockriede and Robert M. Jackson. The
second amended complaint alleges that the company's reserves for loan losses
were inadequate, and that defendants made misleading positive statements about
the company's financial condition, thus artificially inflating the company's
assets and earnings and the prices of the company's securities during a
purported class period of February 6, 1989 through January 24, 1990. The suit
further alleges that the company's internal credit review and controls were
inadequate. In addition, plaintiffs assert that the Registration Statement,
dated August 11, 1989, issued by the company in connection with its acquisition
of New Brunswick Savings Bank, was false and misleading because it did not
disclose the foregoing conduct. The plaintiffs demand judgment including
unspecified monetary damages and attorneys' fees. On March 3, 1992, the Court
denied defendants' motion to dismiss the first amended complaint. On May 20,
1993, the Court ordered pursuant to stipulation of the parties, the
certification of a class of individuals who purchased company securities between
February 6, 1989 and January 24, 1990. The Board of Directors and management of
the company believe the allegations contained in the second amended complaint to
be lacking in merit and intend to defend this action vigorously. Management
believes that the consolidated financial condition of the company will not be
affected materially by the outcome of this action. However, any adverse outcome
in this action could have a material impact on the results of operations of the
company in any interim or annual period. As permitted by New Jersey law and the
company's Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, the expenses of the
individual defendants are being advanced by the company.

Certain other claims, suits and complaints involving the company and its
subsidiaries arising in the normal course of business have been filed or are
pending. Management is of the opinion that all such matters are either
adequately covered by insurance, are without merit or are of such kind, or
involve such amounts that a liability, if any, from an unfavorable disposition
would not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial position of
the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP
Certified Public Accountants
150 John F. Kennedy Parkway
Short Hills, New Jersey 07078 

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Constellation Bancorp:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of
Constellation Bancorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1993. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Constellation
Bancorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As explained in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, 
Constellation Bancorp adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board's Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, 
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions," No. 
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," and No. 115, "Accounting for Certain 
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," in 1993. 

As discussed in Note 1, the accompanying 1993 consolidated financial statements 
have been restated to remove certain merger - related charges.

RESTATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF
CORESTATES FINANCIAL CORP AND SUBSIDIARIES

(UNAUDITED)

The following unaudited condensed combined financial statements reflect the
restatement for the acquisition of Constellation Bancorp ("Constellation") under
the pooling of interests method of accounting. Under such method of accounting,
the historical book values of the assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity
of Constellation, as reported on its consolidated balance sheet, and modified
for intercompany balances, are carried over onto the consolidated balance sheet
of CoreStates and no goodwill or other intangible assets are created.
CoreStates will include in its Consolidated Statement of Income for the year
ending December 31, 1994 the results of operations of Constellation beginning
January 1, 1994, as modified for intercompany transactions and has combined and
restated as its income for prior periods the reported results of operations of
Constellation for such prior periods, as modified for intercompany transactions.

The accompanying financial statements as of and for the year ended December 
31, 1993 have been restated subsequent to the release of March 31, 1994 
financial statements to reflect merger-related charges of $127.8 million 
after-tax, or $.89 per share, related to the Constellation acquisition in the
first quarter of 1994, rather than in the fourth quarter of 1993 as previously
reported. This restatement was made after discussions with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission staff which resulted in these charges being reflected in the
quarter that the acquisition was consummated. This restatement has no effect on 
CoreStates' financial position as reported for either March 31, 1994 or June 30,
1994. The restatement also has no effect on CoreStates' basic operating results
for 1993 or 1994, excluding the one-time merger-related charges. On a pre-tax 
basis, the merger-related charges consisted of a $120.0 million provision for 
loan losses, a $28.0 million addition to the OREO reserve, $13.0 million for the
writedown of purchased mortgage servicing rights and related assets, and $34.0 
million for expenses directly attributable to the acquisition. 

This restated financial information is based on the adjustments set forth
herein and in the notes to such statements. The restated information has been
prepared using the historical consolidated financial statements of both
CoreStates and Constellation and should be read in conjunction with such
historical financial statements and notes thereto. Certain amounts have been
reclassified for comparative purposes. The restated condensed combined
financial statements do not purport to be indicative of the combined financial
position or results of operations for future periods or indicative of the
results that actually would have been realized had the entitles been combined
during these periods.

The accompanying unaudited restated financial statements reflect an
equivalent per Constellation Common Share value of .4137 CoreStates Common Share
which represents the number of CoreStates Common Shares issued upon consummation
of the Merger on March 16, 1994 in exchange for each Constellation Common Share
outstanding.

Cash dividends per share declared for the periods presented assume that
CoreStates would have declared cash dividends per share equal to the cash

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION
OF CORESTATES FINANCIAL CORP AND SUBSIDIARIES
(UNAUDITED)

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
reflect the proposed merger of CoreStates and Independence Bancorp ("Proposed
Merger")under the application of the pooling of interests method of
accounting. Under this method of accounting, the historical book values of the
assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity of Independence, as reported on
its Consolidated Balance Sheet, will be carried over onto the Consolidated
Balance Sheet of CoreStates and no goodwill or other intangible assets will be
created. CoreStates will include in its Consolidated Statement of Income the
consolidated results of operations of Independence for the entire fiscal year
in which the Proposed Merger is consummated and will combine and restate its
results of operations for prior periods to include the reported consolidated
results of operations of Independence for prior periods. The Pro Forma
Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991
include adjustments which reflect retroactive adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109)
on a combined basis, as of January 1, 1987. See footnote (4) to the Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Statements of Income. The Consolidated Balance Sheet and
Statements of Income of CoreStates reflect the restatement for the March 16,
1994 acquisition of Constellation under the pooling of interests method of
accounting as presented on pages 45-50.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements also reflect
the proposed combination of CoreStates and Germantown Savings Bank ("Proposed
Combination") as if it had become effective on January 1, 1993 for pro forma
statement of income presentation and on December 31, 1993 for pro forma
balance sheet presentation. The Proposed Combination will be accounted for, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as a purchase of
Germantown by CoreStates. Under the purchase method of accounting, all assets
and liabilities of Germantown at December 31, 1993 have been adjusted, net of
income tax effects, to their current fair values and combined with the asset
and liability book values of CoreStates.

This pro forma financial information is based on the estimates and
assumptions set forth in the notes to such statements. The pro forma
adjustments made in connection with the development of the pro forma
information are preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of
developing such pro forma information as necessary to comply with the
disclosure requirements of the Commission. Where applicable, the pro forma
adjustments have been separately tax effected at the following statutory
rates: 1993--35%; and 1992--34%. The pro forma information has been prepared
using the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not purport to
be indicative of the combined financial position or results of operations of
future periods or indicative of the results that actually would have been
realized had the entities been a single entity during these periods.

The Proposed Merger provides for an Exchange Ratio of 1.50 CoreStates Common
Shares for each Independence Common Share. The accompanying unaudited pro
forma financial information reflects an equivalent per Independence Common
Share value at that exchange ratio. The accompanying unaudited pro forma
financial information for 1993 also assumes that 5.391 million CoreStates
Common Shares will be issued in the Proposed Combination.

Pro forma cash dividends declared for the periods presented assume that
CoreStates would have declared cash dividends per share equal to the cash
dividends per share declared by CoreStates prior to December 31, 1993.

(1) Elimination of intercompany deposits, Federal funds transactions and other
intercompany funding.

(2) It is CoreStates' strategy to seek to dispose of certain assets via bulk
sale, individual credit direct negotiation or foreclosure, in an
accelerated manner. CoreStates currently estimates that to conform
Independence's loan, accrual and reserve policies to those of CoreStates,
it will take a $25.0 million addition to Independence's allowance for
possible loan losses and a $4.0 million addition to Independence's reserve
against OREO. Accordingly, pro forma common shareholders' equity has been
reduced by $18.9 million, the after-tax effect of the estimated
provisions. CoreStates currently estimates that the assets related to the
$29.0 million in estimated aggregated provisions will be disposed of
within eighteen months of the Effective Date. The carrying value of these
assets is approximately $120.0 million and the estimated provisions
represent 25% of this amount. 

(3) Reflects charges of approximately $29.7 million, $21.0 million after the
related tax effects, which include expenses directly attributable to the
Merger. 

Deferred taxes receivable at statutory rates totalling $18.830 million
related to the charges of approximately $29.7 million of expenses
directly attributable to the Merger, the $25.0 million addition to
Independence's allowance for possible loan losses and the $4.0 million
reserve against OREO are reflected in other assets. 

(4) Reflects charges of approximately $41.9 million, $27.3 million after the
related tax effects, for expenses directly attributable to the Proposed
Combination including $16.1 million to cash out GSB stock options, $10.0
million to writedown duplicate GSB facilities and systems and $9.0 million
for employee severance. 

(5) Reflects the conversion of 11.522 million outstanding Independence Common
Shares on December 31, 1993 into 17.283 million CoreStates Common Shares.

(6) Reflects the cancellation of 453 thousand Independence Common Shares owned
by CoreStates and 153 thousand Independence Common Shares held as treasury
stock.

(7) Represents the purchase price in the Proposed Combination using the
following assumptions:

a) Shareholders of Germantown will receive, for each of the 4,189,334
Germantown Common Shares, $62 per share payable 55% in equivalent
value CoreStates Common Shares and 45% in cash, for a total purchase
price of $259.7 million.
b) The market value for CoreStates Common Shares, for purposes of
Germantown pro forma calculations, was assumed to be $26.50 per
share.
c) CoreStates Common Shares issued in the Proposed Combination will
equal 5.391 million shares.
d) The cash portion of the purchase price was assumed to be raised
through the issuance of seven-year notes at 7 1/4%.

(8) The following shareholders' equity accounts of Germantown will be
eliminated (in thousands):

(9) Represents the estimated adjustments of Germantown's assets and
liabilities to their fair values (which were determined using information
available at the most recent practicable date), the intangible asset
related to the value of the deposit base acquired, which is estimated to
be approximately $28 million ($43 million including the deferred income tax
effect), and the adjustment of approximately $109 million arising from the
excess of the total purchase price over net assets acquired (i.e. 
goodwill).

FOOTNOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENTS OF INCOME
(UNAUDITED)

(1) The Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income do not reflect the
estimated $25.0 million provision for losses on loans related to
Independence's loan portfolio, the $4.0 million addition to Independence's
reserve against OREO, or charges of approximately $29.7 million directly
attributable to the Merger. Were these expenses reflected in the Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Statement of Income for the year ended December 31,
1993, net income would decrease by approximately $39.9 million, or $0.28 
per share. 

(2) Reflects the elimination of intercompany interest on deposits, long-term
debt, Federal funds transactions and other intercompany funding.

(3) Reflects the adoption of FAS 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions." As permitted under FAS 106, CoreStates
elected to recognize immediately the January 1, 1992 transitional liability
of $128.7 million pre-tax, $84.9 million or $0.71 per share after-tax, as
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first
quarter of 1992.

The impact of FAS 106 on Independence is immaterial.

Germantown adopted FAS 106 effective January 1, 1992 and elected to
recognize immediately a one-time, non-cash charge equal to its January 1,
1992 transitional liability of $3.7 million, $2.4 million after-tax, as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

(4) In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes
("FAS 109"), which superseded FAS 96. Although FAS 109 was not required to
be adopted until the first quarter of 1993, in the first quarter of 1992
CoreStates retroactively adopted FAS 109 as of January 1, 1987.

Independence prospectively adopted FAS 109 on January 1, 1992, recognizing a
cumulative benefit of $4.4 million as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle. However, the pro forma financial information is
prepared as if Independence retroactively adopted FAS 109 as of January 1,
1987. The impact of retroactively applying FAS 109 to Independence has the
following effects on pro forma net income and period-end common
shareholders' equity (in thousands, except per share):

(5) Reflects the impact of the Stock Dividend. CoreStates, Independence and pro
forma earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992
and 1991 were based on weighted average common shares outstanding as
dilution from potentially dilutive common stock equivalents was less than
3% for each period.

(6) Reflects the anticipated impact of the purchase accounting adjustments
(which were determined using information available at the most recent
practicable date) assuming the Proposed Combination was effective on
January 1, 1993. For the purposes of determining the effects on the pro
forma combined condensed statement of income, the following pro forma
adjustments have been made (in thousands):

a) Amortization of the premium on the loan and investment securities
portfolios and certificates of deposit and the related income tax 
effects.

b) Amortization of intangibles including goodwill and deposit base
intangible which was calculated using lives of 15 years and 10 years,
respectively. As required by FAS 109, the provision for income taxes
assumes that the amortization of the deposit base intangible is
deductible for Federal income tax purposes.

c) Interest expense on the seven-year 7 1/4% notes which were assumed 
issued to fund the cash portion of the purchase price.

(7) Effective January 1, 1993, CoreStates adopted FAS 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." CoreStates recognized the January
1, 1993 FAS 112 transitional liability of $20.0 million, $13.0 million
after-tax or $0.10 per share, as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle. The impact of FAS 112 on Independence and Germantown
is immaterial.
