Amendment No. 2

The undersigned hereby amends the following items, financial
statements, exhibits or other portions of its current report on
Form 8-K previously filed with the Commission on September 13, 1994.

Item 2. Acquisition of Assets

The Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 27, 1994 between WLR
Foods, Inc. (the Registrant), Wampler-Longacre, Inc., the Registrant's
wholly-owned subsidiary (Wampler-Longacre) (collectively, Wampler),
Cuddy Farms, Inc. (Cuddy) and Cuddy International Corporation (Cuddy
International) (collectively, the Cuddy Corporations) provided for an
audited schedule of the working capital of Cuddy's Food Division
(Cuddy Foods), and for certain post-closing adjustments that may be
necessary as a result of such audit. Following the completion of such
an audit by the Registrant's independent auditors KPMG Peat Marwick,
Wampler and Cuddy executed a First Amendment to Asset Purchase
Agreement dated October 26, 1994 (the Amendment). Pursuant to the
Amendment, the purchase price of the acquisition was adjusted downward
by $6,300,000, resulting in a final purchase price of $67 million. 
Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, $2,400,000 of the
stock portion of the purchase price was withheld by Wampler pending
the completion of the working capital audit, and consequently will not
be issued. Cuddy has remitted the balance of the post-closing
adjustments to Wampler in cash.

Marshville, North Carolina

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of The Food Division

the related statements of operations, changes in division equity, and

the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Food
Division of Cuddy Farms, Inc. at October 30, 1993 and October 31,
1992, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

breeding and hatching facilities located in North
Carolina, South Carolina, Iowa, Missouri, Ohio,
Virginia and Minnesota. The food division operates
three turkey processing facilities and a feed
manufacturing facility in North Carolina.

B. Basis Of Presentation

The accompanying financial statements include the
accounts of The Food Division of Cuddy Farms, Inc. 
Significant inter-company transactions and balances
have not been eliminated.

Inventory values are determined using the following
policies:

1) Turkey Flocks
Live poultry flocks are valued at the accumulated
flock cost including poult and feed costs.

Processed turkey is valued at the lower of cost,
or market with cost determined on first-in, first-
out basis.

F. Property, Plant And Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. 
Depreciation starts when the asset is placed in
service. For financial reporting purposes,
depreciation expense is generally provided on a
straight-line basis. Estimated useful lives are as
follows:

Category Years

Buildings and land 15 - 40
improvements 3 - 15
Equipment 3 - 5
Trucks and automobiles 5 - 10
Office furniture and 5
fixtures
Leasehold improvements

Analysis of depreciation expense:

1993 1992
------------- ------------
Charged to cost of goods sold $ 2,716,486 $ 2,841,703

Charged to general and
administrative expense 181,127 77,657
-------------- ------------
Total depreciation expense $ 2,897,613 $ 2,919,360
============== ============

Expenditures that result in the enhancement of the
assets involved are capitalized. Maintenance and
repair costs are expensed when incurred. Upon sale or
other disposition, any gain or loss is included in
income.

Equipment leased under capital leases is recorded in
property, plant and equipment, with corresponding
obligations carried in long-term debt. The amount
capitalized is the lower of the present value of
minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the
leased property. Depreciation on capital leases is
recorded on a straight-line basis, generally over the
estimated useful life of the equipment.

G. Non-competition Agreement

Non-competition agreement represents the unamortized
balance of an amount paid to an individual in
connection with the purchase of the operating assets of
Stout Enterprises; the agreement amount is being
amortized over 10 years.

H. Investments

Investments include 50% ownership of Cuddy/Modern
Storage partnership. The Company accounts for
investments under the equity method, in which the
Company's share of net income or loss is directly
reflected in the financial statements and the
investment account is adjusted accordingly. (See also
Note 11).

I. Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary
differences in reporting income and expenses for
financial statement and tax purposes. These
differences arise primarily from the use of accelerated
depreciation and cash basis accounting methods
previously used for tax reporting purposes. Those
differences expected to be recognized in the subsequent
year are reported as a current liability.

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Standard
(SFAS) No. 109 as a method of reporting income taxes. 
SFAS 109 requires that deferred income tax liabilities
be determined using the tax rate expected to be in
effect when the taxes are actually paid. Accordingly,
income tax expense provisions will increase or decrease
in the same period in which a change in the tax rates
is enacted. Previous rules required providing deferred
taxes using rates in effect when the liability was
first recorded, without subsequent adjustment solely
for the tax rate changes. 

J. Cash And Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the
Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.

NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES

The 1986 Tax Reform Act required substantial change to the
tax accounting methods previously adopted by the Company. 
Previous tax regulations permitted family owned farming
businesses to use the cash basis of accounting for income
tax purposes. The Company had consistently followed the
cash basis of accounting for income tax purposes. Current
tax regulations disallow the cash basis of accounting for
certain agriculture companies that previously used the cash
basis of accounting. These corporations are now required to
use the accrual method of accounting for determining taxable
income.

NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES - Continued

In similar accounting changes, the IRS has usually required
the taxpayer to make adjustments, over a period of time, to
report the effect of the accounting change into taxable
income. In such cases the deferred income taxes are
absorbed (timing differences reverse) over the adjustment
period required by the IRS. In the case of family owned
farming corporations there are special provisions. The
amount of the adjustment that would be required as a result
of the change from the cash to the accrual method of
accounting is not required to be reflected in taxable income
unless one of two situations occur. The tax laws refer to
this unrecognized adjustment as a "suspense account". This
suspense account will only have to be recognized as taxable
income if:

1) The corporation ceases to be a family owned farming
corporation, or

2) The gross receipts from farming activities in any year
are less than the gross receipts in the last year (base
year) the corporation was allowed to use the cash basis
of accounting, which will cause a prorata portion of
the suspense account to be recognized in taxable
income. Base year sales for this purpose are
$126,270,839.

As described in Note 13 Cuddy Farms, Inc. sold the assets of
the Food Division to WLR, Inc. on August 29, 1994. As a
result, the gross receipts of Cuddy Farms, Inc. will drop
below the base year sales of $126,270,839. Unused net
operating losses and tax credits will be used to offset the
expected tax liability. Because the gross receipts for
fiscal year 1994 will be greater than the base year sales,
the suspended taxes are not expected to come due until the
end of fiscal year 1995.

The Company has reduced deferred income taxes to the extent
that it has net operating losses and tax credit carryforward
items.

NOTE 9 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company maintains three employee benefit plans, a 401(k)
Plan and Trust, and a Profit Sharing Plan and a non
qualified retirement/survivor benefit plan. Effective
November 1, 1992 the Profit Sharing Plan was merged into the
401(k) Plan. The 401(k) plan provides that certain hourly
and salaried employees may contribute the maximum percent of
gross earnings allowable by the IRS in any plan year. The
Company in turn will match at least 50% of the employees'
contributions up to 3% of compensation. Total contributions
for the 401(K) Plan and Trust above referenced plans for
1993 and 1992 were $193,945 and $170,842, respectively.

A Non-Qualified Retirement/Survivor Benefit Plan was adopted
January 1, 1993. The plan provides that select key
management employees may defer any amount of gross earnings,
subject to IRS regulations, in any plan year. The Company
and the employee enter into a Salary Deferral Agreement and
a Split Dollar Agreement. Under the Deferral Agreement the 
employee elects to defer a certain amount of gross earnings
for a minimum period of 5 years. The Company agrees to
match employee's deferral up to a maximum of 4% of gross
earnings and to credit the account for a defined annual
interest rate throughout the life of the agreement.

Under the Survivor Benefit Plan the employee and the Company
enter into a Split Dollar Agreement whereby the Company
assists the employee in purchasing life insurance utilizing
the combined proceeds of the employee's deferral and the
Company's match. The life insurance policy is assigned to
the Company to assure the recovery of premiums paid by the
Company prior to disbursement to the employee's named
beneficiary.
Total Company contribution for 1993 was $55,356. 

NOTE 10 - CONTINGENCIES

The Company has a co-insurance group hospitalization plan. 
Under the plan the Company is self-insured for $60,000 per
employee. The insurance company will pay all claims over
$60,000 per individual per year not to exceed a lifetime
benefit of $1,000,000 per salaried employee or $250,000 per
hourly employee. No reasonable estimate can be made for
future losses under the co-insurance plan described above.

As of October 30, 1993, the Company had outstanding letters
of credit in the amount of $2,039,657 as collateral on
certain notes payable to an insurance company as described
in Note 5. The Food Division's allocation of this amount is
$1,136,000.

The Company is self insured for its workers' compensation.

FIRST AMENDMENT TO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This First Amending Agreement is made and entered into this

26th day of October, 1994, by and among CUDDY FARMS, INC., a North

Carolina corporation (Cuddy), CUDDY INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, a

corporation incorporated under the laws of Ontario and controlling

shareholders of Cuddy (Cuddy International), WLR FOODS, INC., a

Virginia corporation (WLR Foods), and WAMPLER-LONGACRE, INC., a

Virginia corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of WLR Foods

(Wampler-Longacre) ("WLR Foods" and "Wampler-Longacre" collectively

referred to herein as "Wampler").

RECITALS

A. The parties entered into an asset purchase agreement

(the "Purchase Agreement") dated July 27, 1994 providing for the sale

by Cuddy and the purchase by Wampler of substantially all of the

assets related to the Business and certain additional assets more

particularly described in the Purchase Agreement. The expressions

used in this First Amending Agreement have the meanings ascribed to

them in the Purchase Agreement.

B. Sections 2.1(b) and 2.1(c) of the Purchase Agreement

provide for the determination of certain Post-Closing Adjustments and

for adjustment of the purchase price set forth in Section 2.1(a) of

the Purchase Agreement in accordance therewith. Section 2.1(d) of the

38
<PAGE>

Purchase Agreement provides for the making of any adjusting payments

in respect of the purchase price on the Second Closing Date.

C. Section 5.9 of the Purchase Agreement refers to an

environmental audit and provides for the allocation of cost and

responsibility for any corrective action recommended as a result

thereof.

D. The parties have today agreed to the Post-Closing

Adjustments and have agreed to amend the Purchase Agreement to fix a

new Second Closing Date and clarify the obligations of the parties

with respect to certain liabilities of the Business.

NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the premises and the

mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties

represent and agree as follows:

1. Post-Closing Adjustments

For the purposes of Section 2.1(c)(i) of the Purchase

Agreement, it is agreed that the Closing Date Working Capital is

$33,486,368 as set forth in Schedule 1 and accordingly the purchase

price is decreased by $6,913,632 being the excess of $40,400,000 over

the Closing Date Working Capital. For the purposes of Section

2.1(c)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement, it is agreed that the capital

expenditure program adjustment is $613,632 and that the purchase price

is increased by said amount. The resulting price reduction of

$6,300,000, less the Stock Value of 100,000 shares of WLR Foods common

39
