Item 5. Other Events

As previously reported (see NYNEX Corporation's
("NYNEX") Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 1993), on November 15,
1993, NYNEX and New England Telephone and
Telegraph Company ("New England Telephone")
filed suit in the United States District Court
for the District of Maine seeking an order
declaring that section 533(b) of the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984 is
unconstitutional and permanently enjoining the
United States from enforcing section 533(b)
against NYNEX. Section 533(b) prohibits NYNEX
from providing video programming to subscribers
in areas where New England Telephone or New
York Telephone Company provide service. On
December 8, 1994, the court issued an opinion
and order declaring that section 533(b) is
unconstitutional and stating that it will
enjoin the enforcement of section 533(b)
against NYNEX and its subsidiaries within the
NYNEX service area. The Department of Justice
is expected to appeal.
