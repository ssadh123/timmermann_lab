MCCLATCHY NEWPAPERS REPORTS 24% INCREASE IN EARNINGS

SACRAMENTO, CA, APRIL 19, 1994 -- MCCLATCHY NEWSPAPERS, INC. (NYSE-MNI)
today reported first quarter earnings of $5.9 million or 20 cents per share -- a
record high for McClatchy's first quarter. Earnings were up 23.7% from 1993
earnings of $4.8 million (17 cents).

First quarter 1994 earnings include a one-time pre-tax charge of $768,000
for closing many of the company's Senior Spectrum tabloid newspapers which
served readers over age 55. Excluding this charge, earnings would have been 22
cents per share or 32.3% higher than 1993. Earnings also benefitted from Easter
advertising which occurred principally in the first quarter of 1994 versus the
second quarter of 1993.

Net revenues increased to $108.9 million, up 3.5% from 1993 revenues of
$105.3 million. Advertising revenues were $83.8 million, a gain of 3.6% and
circulation revenues posted a 1.2% increase to $21.2 million.

Operating expenses were held to a 2.7% increase, generally reflecting low
newsprint prices and company-wide cost control programs. Operating income
increased 10.0% to $11.6 million compared to $10.5 million in 1993. Excluding
the Senior Spectrum charge, operating income increased 17.3% over 1993.

Net income also benefitted from higher interest income on investments and
smaller losses from McClatchy's Ponderay newsprint mill joint venture.

Commenting on the quarterly results, Erwin Potts, chief executive officer,
noted that "Advertising revenues and earnings exceeded our expectations even
after factoring in the effect of Easter advertising. In particular, classified
advertising began to improve in February and was strong in March. Our company is
poised to benefit from an economic recovery in Northern California should
business activity continue to pick up. Meanwhile we remain committed to cost
controls to keep expenses in line with revenue expectations."

With headquarters in Sacramento, CA, McClatchy Newspapers is a
communications company with a history dating back to 1857 when James McClatchy
was the founding editor of The Sacramento Bee. Today, McClatchy publishes 12
daily newspapers and eight non-daily newspapers located principally in western
coastal states and South Carolina. The Company, through its subsidiary, The
Newspaper Network, Inc., distributes preprinted advertising inserts to
newspapers throughout the country and is one of six partners in the Ponderay
newsprint mill in Usk, Washington.
