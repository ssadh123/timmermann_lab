FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SAN DIEGO GAS & ELECTRIC BOARD 
NAMES STICKEL AND JONES AS NEW DIRECTORS
SAN DIEGO, Oct. 25, 1994 -- San Diego Gas & Electric's board of
directors yesterday named two new members to the board, bringing
the total number of board members to 10, according to Thomas A.
Page, SDG&E chairman, president and chief executive officer.
The two new members are Thomas C. Stickel, chairman and founder
of American Partners Capital Group, Inc., and William D. Jones,
president, chief executive officer and a director of CityLink
Investment Corporation.
Stickel established American Partners Capital Group, Inc., a
corporation specializing in pension fund-related capital
formation programs, in 1994. Between 1983 and 1992, Stickel was
founder, chairman and chief executive officer of TCS Enterprises,
Inc., the parent company of seven wholly owned business and
financial services companies. Prior to that, Stickel founded and
served as chief executive officer of Bank of Southern California. 

Stickel graduated from San Diego State University in 1971 and
earned a master's degree in public administration from the
University of Southern California in 1976.
Jones joined CityLink Investment Corporation, based in San
Diego, in 1994. CityLink acquires and manages real estate
ventures and commercial businesses in select urban areas.
CityLink is developing an urban village in the Mid-City
community, the first phase being the Mid-City Area Police
Station/Community Center for San Diego.
Prior to the formation of CityLink, Jones had been general
manager/senior asset manager for the Prudential Investment
Corporation until 1993. He joined the Prudential organization in
1989 as investment manager and assistant to the chairman for the
Prudential Realty Group in Newark, New Jersey. Jones served as a
member of the San Diego City Council between 1982 and 1987,
including one year as deputy mayor.
Jones received a bachelor's degree in economics from the
University of San Diego in 1980, and a master's degree in
business administration in 1989 from the Harvard School of
Business Administration.
"These two gentlemen expand the expertise of the SDG&E board to
better reflect the rapidly changing needs of the utility
business," said Page. "It's a pleasure to welcome them to the
board, and we look forward to the benefit of their proven
experience in competitive markets."
