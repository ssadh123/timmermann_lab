NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in Thousands)
(Unaudited)

1. Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Germantown
Savings Bank (Bank) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Morris Holdings, Inc.
and GSB Investment, Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. These unaudited consolidated financial
statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles and include all adjustments which, in the opinion of management,
are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented.

2. Securities Held-To-Maturity:

At March 31, 1994, the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses,
and the approximate market values of held-to-maturity securities are as follows:

At March 31, 1994, the maturity distribution of the amortized cost and the
approximate market values of held-to-maturity securities by contractual maturity
are shown below. Since borrowers may have the right to call or prepay
obligations with or without prepayment penalties, expected maturities will
differ from contractual maturities.

At March 31, 1994, the maturity distribution of the net amortized cost and

During the first quarter of 1994, available-for-sale securities with a
carrying value (market value) of $2,684 were called. The Bank received proceeds
including scheduled payments of $2,609 and recognized net profits of $75 on
these transactions. Also during the quarter, held-to-maturity securities with a

-7-
<PAGE>

cost of $15,346 were called. The Bank received proceeds including amortization
and prepayments of $15,275 and recognized net losses of $71 on these
transactions. The Bank did not sell any available-for-sale securities or held-
to-maturity securities during the first quarter of 1994. During the first
quarter of 1993, corporate and municipal securities with a carrying value of
$18,750 were called. The Bank received proceeds of $19,063 and recognized net
profits of $313 on these calls and scheduled payments. In addition, the Bank
sold its holding of preferred stock. The carrying value of this stock was
$497; the proceeds received were $501; and the profit was $4 on this sale.

4. Loans:

The Bank's construction, direct residential, consumer and commercial
lending activity is generally limited to southeastern Pennsylvania, south and
central New Jersey, Delaware and northeastern Maryland. The Bank's indirect
residential mortgage lending activity includes regions that Management believes
are not experiencing unusual economic problems. These lending activities could
be affected by regional economic problems or a downturn in real estate values.

Included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 1994
is other real estate owned of $1,186.

5. Premises and Equipment:

At March 31, 1994, premises and equipment are as follows:

Bank's securities in 1989. As a result, there is no applicable state tax in
either quarter of 1994 or 1993.

<PAGE>

At March 31, 1994, items that give rise to significant portions of the
Bank's deferred tax asset, calculated at a 35% tax rate, are as follows:

</TABLE> 

8. Earnings per Common Share:

Earnings per common share is based on income divided by the weighted-average
number of shares and equivalent shares outstanding for each of the periods
presented. When the closing price at the end of a period or the average market
price of the common stock for the period, whichever is greater, exceeds the
exercise price of options, the number of shares of common stock is increased by
the number of shares issuable on the exercise of options based on the assumption
that common stock could be purchased with the proceeds from the exercise of
options. At March 31, 1994 and 1993, the weighted-average number of common and
common share equivalents outstanding amounts to 4,434,183 and 4,348,595,
respectively.

9. Stock Option Plan and Program:

During the first quarter of 1994 and 1993, transactions in the Bank's Stock
Option Plan and Program are as follows:

<TABLE>

======= ======

</TABLE> 
10. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk:

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in
the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.
These financial instruments include commitments to originate and/or purchase
residential, consumer and construction loans and standby letters of credit to
guarantee performance of a customer to a third party. Such instruments generally
have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and may require payment of
fees to the Bank. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments
and issuing standby letters of credit as it does for on-balance sheet instru-
ments. However, these instruments are properly not recorded on the Bank's
financial statements. Management believes its diversified loan portfolio is not
dependent upon any particular economic sector.

Since some commitments and letters of credit are expected to expire without
being drawn down, the amounts summarized below at March 31, 1994 and 1993 do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements:

<TABLE> 
<CAPTION> 
March 31,
1994 1993 
-------- --------
<S> <C> <C> 
Commitments to extend credit $74,384 $132,875
Standby letters of credit 211 211

</TABLE> 
11. Conversion:

In April 1987, the Bank completed its conversion from a state-chartered
mutual savings bank to a state-chartered stock savings bank through amendments
to its charter and sale of 4,025,000 shares of $0.10 par value common stock. The
net proceeds of the sale were $36,356.

-9-
<PAGE>

At the time of conversion, the Bank established a liquidation account in
the amount of $23,778 equal to the Bank's total net worth as of December 31,
1986. The liquidation account has been established for a period of 10 years for
the benefit of eligible depositors who continue to maintain their deposit
accounts in the Bank after conversion, subject to downward adjustment. Eligible
depositors would be entitled, in the unlikely event of complete liquidation of
the Bank, to receive liquidating distributions of any assets remaining after
payment of all creditors' claims (including the claims of all depositors at the
time of liquidation), but before any distributions made to the Bank's
shareholders, equal to their proportionate interest at that time in the
liquidation account. Except for the repurchase of stock by the Bank, the
existence of the liquidation account will not restrict the use or application of
such capital.

12. Agreement between GSB and CoreStates Financial Corp:

On March 7, 1994, GSB and CoreStates Financial Corp entered into an
agreement for CoreStates to acquire GSB for a combination of cash and stock.
Assuming approval by regulators and by GSB shareholders, the transaction is
expected to close in the third quarter of 1994, and will be accounted for as a
purchase. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
in contemplation of this proposed acquisition.

13. Other Matters:

The Bank is required to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital. At
March 31, 1994, the Bank's leverage capital ratio is 8.87%, and the Bank's total
risk-based capital ratio is 18.44%.
