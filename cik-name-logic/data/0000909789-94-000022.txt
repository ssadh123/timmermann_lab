CONTACT: W. L. Flaherty RELEASE DATE:
Vice President - Finance July 1, 1994
(513) 841-6675

Gibson Greetings, Inc. (NASDAQ) announced today that it has
determined that its Cleo, Inc. subsidiary overstated its finished
goods inventory at December 31, 1993, resulting in a
corresponding overstatement of net income for the year ended
December 31, 1993. The Company believes that the overstatement
resulted from an allocation of overhead variances in a manner
inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Based on currently available information, the Company believes
that its actual 1993 consolidated net income was approximately
20% less than the $25.8 million ($1.61 per share) previously
reported. The Company and its independent accountants are
continuing to pursue a vigorous investigation of this matter, and
the Company expects to release further information and to restate
its 1993 financial statements based on the results of its
investigation.
