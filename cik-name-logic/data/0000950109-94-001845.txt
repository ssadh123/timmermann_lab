SUN DISTRIBUTORS, L.P. ANNOUNCES THE SALE OF CERTAIN DIVISIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------

PHILADELPHIA, PA (October 5, 1994) -- SUN DISTRIBUTORS, L.P., announced 
today that it has reached agreements to sell its three Electrical Group 
divisions and one of its Maintenance Group divisions, Dorman Products, for a 
total consideration of approximately $73 million. The businesses to be sold 
include American Electric Co. of St. Joseph, MO; Keathley-Patterson Electric Co.
of Little Rock, AR; Philips & Co. of Columbia, MO; and Dorman Products of 
Warsaw, KY. The transactions are subject to compliance with provisions of the 
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

The earnings for the four divisions being sold totalled $7.5 million for
the twelve months ended June 30, 1994, or approximately $.34 per B share. The 
net proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt, and for general Company 
purposes including add-on acquisitions in its core businesses.

The taxable gain from the sale of the four divisions will be 
approximately $29 million, and will be allocated entirely to Class B Interest 
holders of record on the first day of the month within which each transaction is
closed. It is presently anticipated that the sale of the Electrical Group 
resulting in a taxable gain of approximately $6 million will close in December 
1994, and the sale of Dorman Products resulting in a taxable gain of 
approximately $23 million will close in January, 1995. The Partnership will make
a cash tax distribution to such Class B record holders equal to approximately 
35% of the taxable capital gain. The cash distribution will be made in March of 
the year following the year in which the sale occurs.

The Company considered a number of strategic alternatives as part of the
process which led to the decision to sell these divisions. Other alternatives
considered but which were not ultimately pursued, included a sale of the entire
Company; the sale of all of its divisions followed by liquidation; or a
recapitalization and conversion to a corporate structure from the current
partnership form.

The sale of the Electrical Group divisions and Dorman Products brings to
a conclusion the process of considering strategic alternatives. The Company 
believes that the sale of these non-strategic businesses will benefit Sun 
Distributors by strengthening its balance sheet, permitting it to resume its 
acquisition program, and provide increased management focus on its core
businesses.
