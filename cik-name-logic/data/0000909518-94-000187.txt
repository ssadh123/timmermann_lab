NATIONAL INTERGROUP CHANGES NAME TO
FOXMEYER HEALTH CORPORATION,
OUTLINES INNOVATIVE HEALTH CARE STRATEGY

NATIONAL INTERGROUP AND FOXMEYER STOCKHOLDERS APPROVE MERGER

DALLAS, Texas, October 13, 1994 -- National Intergroup, Inc.
(NYSE:NII) and its 80.5% owned subsidiary, FoxMeyer Corporation
(NYSE:FOX), announced that the merger of FoxMeyer into a wholly-owned
subsidiary of National Intergroup was approved by the stockholders of
both National Intergroup and FoxMeyer at their annual meetings on
Wednesday, October 12, 1994. At the National Intergroup annual
meeting, National Intergroup stockholders also approved changing
National Intergroup's name to "FoxMeyer Health Corporation" to more
accurately reflect the company's strategy for growth.

"We clearly see ourselves as more than 'just a wholesaler,'
said Thomas L. Anderson, FoxMeyer Health president and chief operating
officer. "We are committed to becoming a leading health care provider
of products and information-based services throughout North America. 
We will continue to introduce innovations - new systems capabilities,
electronic services, marketing programs, niche businesses, new
distribution capabilities - that we expect to carry FoxMeyer Health
ahead of its competition, in terms of efficiency and quality of
service, over the next few years."

"We believe that this strategic vision - FoxMeyer Health as
an innovative provider of health care services and products - will
guide us in delivering the most value to our retail and
hospital/alternate care customers, as well as to our shareholders,"
Anderson said.

Certificates effecting the merger and the name change have
been filed in Delaware. Trading of shares of FoxMeyer common stock
has ceased. Holders of shares of FoxMeyer Corporation common stock
will be entitled to receive 0.904 shares of FoxMeyer Health
Corporation (formerly named National Intergroup, Inc.) common stock in
exchange for each of their shares of FoxMeyer common stock. Letters
of Transmittal with instructions on how FoxMeyer stockholders can
exchange their

shares will be sent shortly. FoxMeyer will continue as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of FoxMeyer Health Corporation.

On or about November 14, 1994, the trading symbol for shares
of common stock of FoxMeyer Health Corporation (formerly named
National Intergroup) on the New York Stock Exchange will change from
"NII" to "FOX." Until November 14, 1994, shares of common stock of
FoxMeyer Health Corporation will trade under the "NII" symbol.

FoxMeyer Health Corporation reported sales of $5.4 billion
for the year ended March 31, 1994, and is a holding company
principally involved in:

- Health care services, including the distribution of a
full line of pharmaceutical products and health and
beauty aids, as well as providing managed care
services, through its subsidiary, FoxMeyer Corporation;
- And the franchising of general variety stores and the
franchising and operation of crafts stores, together
with the wholesale distribution of products to those
stores, through its 67.2%-owned subsidiary, Ben
Franklin Retail Stores, Inc.

Following its annual meeting of shareholders, the FoxMeyer
Health board of directors announced that it was considering spinning
off a substantial portion of the company's ownership in Ben Franklin
Retail Stores, Inc. through a distribution of a large proportion of
its Ben Franklin stock to FoxMeyer Health shareholders.
