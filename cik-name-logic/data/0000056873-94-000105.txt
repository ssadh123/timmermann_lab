Exhibit 99.2

KROGER 2ND QTR OPER NET PER SHARE:
57 CENTS VS. 27 CENTS

CINCINNATI, Ohio, July 19, 1994 --- The Kroger Co. said today that earnings
before extraordinary charges in the 1994 second quarter rose to $70.0
million, equal to 57 cents per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to
$29.6 million, or 27 cents per share, in the prior year's second quarter.

Operating cash flow -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
LIFO -- increased 9.8 percent to $261.2 million from $237.9 million in the
1993 second quarter.

The Company noted that last year's results included a one-time after tax
special charge of $15 million, or 12 cents per share fully diluted, for the
closing of San Antonio stores in 1993.

After the extraordinary charge from the early retirement of debt, net
earnings in the second quarter totaled $67.3 million, or 55 cents per share
fully diluted, compared to $27.5 million, or 25 cents per share fully
diluted, in last year's second quarter.

Total sales in the quarter increased 1.2 percent to $5.4 billion from $5.3
billion. Identical food store sales increased 1.8 percent.

Kroger's net interest expense in the second quarter declined 20.7 percent
to $75.0 million. Long-term debt at the end of the second quarter was
$3.944 billion, a decrease of $269.4 million from the previous year's
second quarter.

Joseph A. Pichler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said the Company's
performance in the second quarter reflected across-the-board improvements
in operating efficiencies, the favorable impact of technology, and strong
merchandising programs tailored to individual markets.

"In the highly competitive environment of food retailing, Kroger is
succeeding by controlling distribution and logistics costs, and through the
implementation of new technologies," Pichler said. "At the same time, our
localized merchandising strategies are using the full strengths of Kroger's
combination food and drug stores and our strong private brands to maintain
our market leadership position," he added.

During the first half of 1994, Kroger opened, expanded or acquired 33
stores, which is on target with the Company's current plan to expand new
retail square footage by a minimum of approximately 5 to 6 percent annually
in 1994-96.

In the first half, operating cash flow increased 9.4 percent to $498.7
million, and sales increased 2.1 percent to $10.7 billion. Identical food
store sales through the first half were up 2.0 percent over the prior
year's first half. 

Separately, Kroger said it expects to close a new bank credit agreement
later today that will lower costs of borrowing and permit increased capital
expenditures.

outstanding at any time during the period) commencing on the
effective date of such change in the applicable Level and
ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of
the next such change in applicable Level. If the rating
system of either Moody's or S&P shall change, the Parent
Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to
amend the references to specific ratings in this definition to
reflect such changed rating system. If either Moody's or S&P
shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt
obligations, the Parent Borrower and the Lenders shall

agency and to amend the references to specific ratings in this
definition to reflect the ratings used by such substitute

Percentages shall be determined on the basis of the ratings
provided by the other rating agency and the Applicable
Percentage Ratio. The Applicable Percentage for Base Rate
Advances is zero.

drawing or payment under a Letter of Credit, the amount of
such drawing or payment shall become and be deemed to be,

Advance; (B) the aggregate amount of Swing Line Advances of
each Swing Line Bank at any time outstanding may exceed the

Borrower maintains its concentration account with the
Concentration Account Bank and the Concentration Account Bank
is a Lender, the Concentration Account Bank may, if in its
sole discretion it elects to do so, on the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth (including those set forth in
Section 4.01) and such other terms and conditions as may be
acceptable to the Concentration Account Bank, make Advances to
the Parent Borrower to cover Overnight Overdrafts from time to
time during the period from the Closing Date to but excluding
the Termination Date in an aggregate amount not to exceed at
any time outstanding $100,000,000; provided, however, that
immediately after giving effect to each such Advance to cover
an Overnight Overdraft, Facility Usage shall not exceed the
Facility; and provided further that (i) each outstanding
Advance made in respect of an Overnight Overdraft shall be
deemed to utilize the Commitment of each Lender by such
Lender's pro rata portion (based on the Commitments of the
Lenders before giving effect to such Advance) of the amount of
such Advance; (ii) the aggregate amount of Advances made in
respect of Overnight Overdrafts at any time outstanding may
exceed the unused portion of the Commitment of the
Concentration Account Bank; (iii) the principal amount of each
Advance made in respect of an Overnight Overdraft shall be due
and payable on demand of the Concentration Account Bank, but
in no event later than the Termination Date; and (iv) until
paid, each Advance made in respect of an Overnight Overdraft
shall bear interest (A) until delivery by the Concentration
Account Bank to the Lenders of a demand for payment of
participations in such Advance as contemplated below in this
paragraph (d), at any rate of interest agreed upon by the
Parent Borrower and the Concentration Account Bank and
(B) from and after delivery by the Concentration Account Bank
to the Lenders of any such demand for payment, at the rate of
interest applicable to Base Rate Advances. Each Advance made
in respect of an Overnight Overdraft in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this paragraph (d) shall be deemed to
be an Advance for all purposes of this Agreement. Each Lender
other than the Concentration Account Bank shall, forthwith
upon the making of each Advance in respect of an Overnight
Overdraft, be deemed to have committed irrevocably to purchase
from the Concentration Account Bank a participation in such
Advance in an amount equal to the product of (i) a fraction
the numerator of which is the Commitment of such Lender and
the denominator of which is the Facility multiplied by
(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Advance;
provided, however, that none of the other Lenders shall be
required to pay for such participation until demand therefor
by the Concentration Account Bank; and provided further that
no other Lender shall be entitled to receive any repayment
from the Parent Borrower in respect of an Advance resulting
from an Overnight Overdraft until such Lender has paid any
amounts due hereunder to the Concentration Account Bank in
respect of its participation in such Advance.
(e) The Auction Bid Advances. (i) Effective as of the
Closing Date, each Lender that is an Existing Lender that has
made an Existing Auction Bid Advance will be deemed, without
further action on the part of any party, to have made an
Auction Bid Advance to the Parent Borrower under this
Agreement in the amount of such Existing Auction Bid Advance
on the Closing Date, such Auction Bid Advance to (A) have a
remaining term equal to the remaining term of such Existing
Auction Bid Advance on the Closing Date and (B) bear interest
at the interest rate applicable to such Existing Auction Bid
Advance on the Closing Date.

(ii) Each Lender severally agrees that each Borrower may
make additional Auction Bid Borrowings under this
Section 2.01(e)(ii) from time to time on any Business Day
during the period from the Closing Date until the date that is
27 days prior to the Termination Date, in the case of an
Auction Bid Borrowing consisting of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advances, or one day prior to the Termination Date, in the
case of an Auction Bid Borrowing consisting of Fixed Rate
Advances, in the manner set forth below, provided that,
immediately after giving effect to each such Auction Bid
Advance, Facility Usage shall not exceed the Facility:

(A) Any Borrower, either directly or through the
Specified Administrative Agent (as defined in
paragraph (B) below), may request an Auction Bid
Borrowing or Auction Bid Borrowings under this
Section 2.01(e) by delivering to the Paying Agent and
some or all of the Lenders, by telephone, telex or cable,
confirmed immediately in writing or by telecopier, a
notice of an Auction Bid Borrowing or Borrowings (a
"Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing"), in substantially the
form of Exhibit A-2 or in such other form as the
Administrative Agents and such Borrower may agree upon
specifying the date and aggregate amount of the proposed
Auction Bid Borrowing, the maturity date for repayment of
each Auction Bid Advance to be made as part of such
Auction Bid Borrowing (which maturity date may not be
earlier than the date that is 27 days after the date of
such Auction Bid Borrowing in the case of Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances, may not be later than the date
that is 270 days after the date of such Auction Bid
Borrowing in the case of Fixed Rate Advances, and in any
case may not be later than the Termination Date), whether
the Lenders should offer to make Fixed Rate Advances or
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances, the interest payment
date or dates relating thereto and any other terms to be
applicable to such Auction Bid Borrowing, not later than
(1) Noon (New York City time) on the same Business Day as
any proposed Auction Bid Borrowing consisting of Fixed
Rate Advances and (2) 12:00 noon (New York City time) at
least three Business Days, or, if through the Specified
Administrative Agent, 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) at
least four Business Days prior to the date of a proposed
Auction Bid Borrowing consisting of Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate Advances.

(B) Each Lender so notified may, if, in its sole
discretion, it elects to do so, irrevocably offer to make
one or more Auction Bid Advances (which Auction Bid
Advances may, subject to the provisos to the first
sentence to this Section 2.01(e)(ii), have a principal
amount exceeding such Lender's Commitment) to the
Borrower as part of such proposed Auction Bid Borrowing
at a Fixed Rate or Rates or a margin or margins relative
to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, as requested by the
applicable Borrower. Each Lender electing to make such
an offer shall do so by notifying the Borrower or one of
the Administrative Agents, as shall be specified in the
Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing (the "Specified
Administrative Agent"), before such time and date as is
specified in the Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing in
subparagraph (A) above, of the minimum amount and maximum
amount of each Auction Bid Advance that such Lender would
be willing to make as part of such proposed Auction Bid
Borrowing (which amount may exceed such Lender's
Commitment), the Fixed Rate or Rates or margin or margins
relative to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, as requested by
the applicable Borrower, that such Lender would be
willing to accept for such Auction Bid Advance and such
Lender's Applicable Lending Office with respect to such
Auction Bid Advance, provided that, if the Specified
Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender shall,
in its sole discretion, elect to make any such offer, it
shall notify the applicable Borrower of such offer before
15 minutes prior to the Borrower's deadline specified in
paragraph (A) above on the date on which notice of such
election is to be given to such Administrative Agent by
the other Lenders. If any Lender shall elect not to make
such an offer, such Lender shall so notify the Specified
Administrative Agent, before such time as is specified in
the Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing on the date on which
notice of such election is to be given to the Borrower or
the Specified Administrative Agent, as the case may be,
by the other Lenders, and such Lender shall not be
obligated to, and shall not, make any Auction Bid Advance
as part of such Auction Bid Borrowing, provided that the
failure by any Lender to give such notice shall not cause
such Lender to be obligated to make any Auction Bid
Advance as part of such proposed Auction Bid Borrowing.

(C) The applicable Borrower (either directly or
through the Specified Administrative Agent) shall, in
turn, before such time and date as is specified in the
Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing, either

(x) cancel such Auction Bid Borrowing by giving
the Lenders who received notice pursuant to
paragraph (A) above notice to that effect, or

(y) accept one or more of the offers (or
portions of such offers) made by any Lender or
Lenders pursuant to paragraph (B) above, in its sole
discretion, by giving notice to the applicable
Lender or Lenders of the amount of each Auction Bid
Advance to be made by each Lender as part of such
Auction Bid Borrowing, with simultaneous notice
thereof to the Paying Agent, and reject any
remaining offers made by Lenders pursuant to
paragraph (B) above by giving them notice to that
effect.

(D) If the applicable Borrower notifies the Paying
Agent that such Auction Bid Borrowing is canceled
pursuant to paragraph (C)(x) above, the applicable
Borrower or the Specified Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, shall give prompt notice thereof to the
Lenders and such Auction Bid Borrowing shall not be made.

(E) If the applicable Borrower accepts one or more
of the offers (or portions of such offers) made by any
Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (C)(y) above, the
applicable Borrower or the Specified Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, shall in turn promptly notify
each Lender that is to make an Auction Bid Advance as
part of such Auction Bid Borrowing, of the amount of each
Auction Bid Advance to be made by such Lender as part of
such Auction Bid Borrowing.

(iii) Each Lender that is to make an Auction Bid Advance
as part of an Auction Bid Borrowing shall, before 12:00 noon
(New York City time) on the date of such Auction Bid Borrowing
specified in the Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing relating
thereto, make available for the account of its Applicable
Lending Office to the Paying Agent in same day funds, such
Lender's ratable portion of such Auction Bid Borrowing. Upon
fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article IV and after receipt by the Paying Agent of such
funds, the Paying Agent will make such funds available to the
applicable Borrower. Promptly after each Auction Bid
Borrowing, the Paying Agent will notify each Lender of the
amount of the Auction Bid Borrowing, the consequent Auction
Bid Reduction and the dates upon which such Auction Bid
Reduction commenced and will terminate.

(iv) Each Auction Bid Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of not less than $5,000,000. Following the
making of each Auction Bid Borrowing, the Borrowers shall be
in compliance with the limitations set forth in the proviso to
the first sentence of subsection (ii) above.

(v) Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in
this Section 2.01(e), each Borrower may from time to time
borrow under this Section 2.01(e), repay or prepay pursuant to
subsection (vi) below, and reborrow under this
Section 2.01(e).

(vi) The applicable Borrower shall repay to the Paying
Agent for the account of each Lender that has made, or holds
the right to repayment of, an Auction Bid Advance on the
maturity date of each Auction Bid Advance (such maturity date
being that specified by the Borrower for repayment of such
Auction Bid Advance in the related Notice of Auction Bid
Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (ii)(A) above) the
then-unpaid principal amount of such Auction Bid Advance. No
Borrower shall have any right to prepay any principal amount
of any Auction Bid Advance unless, and then only on the terms,
specified by the applicable Borrower for such Auction Bid
Advance in the related Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing
delivered pursuant to subsection (ii)(A) above.

(vii) The applicable Borrower shall pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each Auction Bid Advance from and
including the date of such Auction Bid Advance to but
excluding the date the principal amount of such Auction Bid
Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of interest for such
Auction Bid Advance (including any rate specified for past due
amounts) specified by the Lender making such Auction Bid
Advance in its notice with respect thereto delivered pursuant
to subsection (ii)(B) above, payable on the interest payment
date or dates specified by the Borrower for such Auction Bid
Advance in the related Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing
delivered pursuant to subsection (ii)(A) above.

(f) Auction Bid LOCs. (i) Each Lender severally agrees
that any Lender may issue Auction Bid LOCs for the account of
any Borrower (and, if applicable, one or more of its
Subsidiaries) under this Section 2.01(f) from time to time on
any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until
the date that is 30 days prior to the Termination Date in the
manner set forth below; provided, however, that following the
issuance of each Auction Bid LOC, the maximum aggregate amount
available at such time to be drawn under all Auction Bid LOCs
then outstanding (together with (A) the aggregate undrawn
amount at such time under Existing Letters of Credit, if any,
and (B) the aggregate undrawn amount at such time under
outstanding Letters of Credit) shall not exceed $450,000,000;
and provided further that immediately after giving effect to
each such issuance, Facility Usage shall not exceed the
Facility:

(A) Any Borrower, either directly or through the
Specified Administrative Agent, may request the issuance
of an Auction Bid LOC under this Section 2.01(f) by
delivering to the Paying Agent and some or all the
Lenders, by telecopier, telex or cable, confirmed
immediately in writing, a notice of a Request for Auction
Bid LOC (a "Notice of Request for Auction Bid LOC"), in
substantially the form of Exhibit A-3 or in such other
form as the Administrative Agents and the Parent Borrower
may agree upon, specifying the date and aggregate
principal amount of the proposed Auction Bid LOC, the
maturity date thereof (which maturity date may not be
later than the Termination Date) and any other terms to
be applicable to such Auction Bid LOC.

(B) Each Lender so notified may, if, in its sole
discretion, it elects to do so, irrevocably offer to
issue for the account of the applicable Borrower a
proposed Auction Bid LOC (which Auction Bid LOC may,
subject to the provisos to the first sentence of this
Section 2.01(f), have a principal amount exceeding such
Lender's Commitment) having such fees and other terms
requested by the applicable Borrower as such Lender may
elect, including the names of such other Lenders, if any,
as may be participants in the Auction Bid LOC to be
issued by such Lender. Each Lender electing to make such
an offer shall do so by notifying the applicable Borrower
or the Specified Administrative Agent, as the case may
be, before the time and date specified in the Notice of
Request for Auction Bid LOC of the minimum amount and
maximum amount of Auction Bid LOC that such Lender would
be willing to issue (that amount may exceed such Lender's
Commitment), the fees and terms that such Lender would be
willing to accept with regard to such Auction Bid LOC
(including the letter of credit fee that such Lender
would be willing to accept with regard to such Auction
Bid LOC) and such Lender's Applicable Lending Office with
respect thereto, provided that if the Specified
Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender shall,
in its sole discretion, elect to make any such offer, it
shall notify the applicable Borrower of such offer before
such time as is specified in the Notice of Request for
Auction Bid LOC on the date on which notice of such
election is to be given to such Administrative Agent by
the other Lenders. If any Lender shall elect not to make
such an offer, such Lender shall so notify the applicable
Borrower or the Specified Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, before such time as specified in the Notice
of Request for Auction Bid LOC on the date on which
notice of such election is to be given to the applicable
Borrower or the Specified Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, by the other Lenders, and such Lender shall
not be obligated to, and shall not, issue any Auction Bid
LOC, provided that the failure by any Lender to give such
notice shall not cause such Lender to be obligated to
issue any Auction Bid LOC.

(C) The applicable Borrower shall, in turn, before
such time and date as is specified in the Notice of
Request for Auction Bid LOC, either

(x) cancel the issuance of such Auction Bid LOC
by giving the Lenders who received notice pursuant
to paragraph (A) above notice to that effect or

(y) accept one or more of the offers (or
portions of such offers) made by any Lender pursuant
to paragraph (B) above, in its sole discretion, by
giving notice to the applicable Lender of such
acceptance with simultaneous notice thereof to the
Paying Agent, and reject any remaining offers made
by Lenders pursuant to paragraph (B) above by giving
them notice to that effect.

(D) If the applicable Borrower cancels the issuance
of such Auction Bid LOC pursuant to paragraph (C)(x)
above, the Borrower or the Specified Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, shall give prompt notice
thereof to the Lenders and such Auction Bid LOC shall not
be issued.

(E) If the applicable Borrower accepts one or more
of the offers (or portions of such offers) made by any
Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (C)(y) above, the
Borrower or the Specified Administrative Agent shall in
turn promptly notify each Lender that has made an offer
as described in paragraph (B) above, of the issuance date
and aggregate amount of such Auction Bid LOC and whether
or not any offer or offers (or any portion thereof) made
by such Lender pursuant to paragraph (B) above have been
accepted by the applicable Borrower.

(ii) Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set
forth in Article IV, the applicable Lender will issue such
Auction Bid LOC for the account of the applicable Borrower,
notify the Paying Agent of such issuance and provide the
Paying Agent with copies of all documentation relevant
thereto, including the names and amounts of participations of
other Lenders, if any, that have purchased such participations
in such Auction Bid LOC. Promptly after receiving notice of
the issuance of each Auction Bid LOC, the Paying Agent will
notify each Lender of the amount of the Auction Bid LOC, the
consequent Auction Bid Reduction and the dates upon which such
Auction Bid Reduction commenced and will terminate.

(iii) Following the issuance of each Auction Bid LOC,
the Borrowers shall be in compliance with the limitations set
forth in the provisos to the first sentence of subsection (i)
above.

(iv) Upon each drawing or payment under an Auction Bid
LOC, the amount of such drawing or payment shall become and be
deemed to be, without any further action on the part of any
Person, an Auction Bid Advance by the Lender and by the other
participant Lenders, if any, to the applicable Borrower to the
extent of such Lenders' respective participations that issued
such Auction Bid LOC made on the date of such drawing or
payment for all purposes under this Agreement (but without any
requirement for compliance with the conditions to the making
of Advances contained in Article IV), which Auction Bid
Advance shall be payable on demand of such Lender and shall
bear interest at the rate of interest specified by such Lender
in its notice with respect thereto delivered pursuant to
subsection (i)(B) above until paid in full.

(g) Set Aside of Commitments to Backstop Commercial
Paper. At any time during which the Parent Borrower has
outstanding any Commercial Paper, a portion of the unused
Commitments in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate face
amount of such Commercial Paper outstanding at such time
shall, without further action on the part of any party, be
deemed to be reserved for use as support for the obligations
of the Parent Borrower under such Commercial Paper. The
amount of the Commitments so reserved at any time pursuant to
this Section 2.01(g) is referred to herein as the "Commercial
Paper Set-Aside Amount".

SECTION 2.02. Making the Advances; Issuing the Letters of
Credit. (a) Each Borrowing (other than a Swing Line
Borrowing, an Auction Bid Borrowing, a Borrowing resulting
from a drawing under a Letter of Credit or Auction Bid LOC or
a borrowing resulting from Advances made in respect of
Overnight Overdrafts) consisting of Advances (a "Borrowing")
shall be made on notice (a "Notice of Borrowing"), given by
the applicable Borrower to the Paying Agent not later than
11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on (i) if such Advances are
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances, the third Business Day
prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing or (ii) if such
Advances are Base Rate Advances, the Business Day prior to the
date of the proposed Borrowing. The Paying Agent shall give
to each Appropriate Lender prompt notice thereof by telex,
telecopier or cable, confirmed promptly thereafter in writing. 
Such Notice of Borrowing shall be by telex, telecopier or
cable, in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1 or in such
other form as the Administrative Agents and the Parent
Borrower may agree upon, specifying therein the applicable
Borrower and the requested (A) date of the proposed Borrowing,
(B) Type of Advances comprising the proposed Borrowing,
(C) amount of the proposed Borrowing, (D) Interest Period for
the proposed Borrowing if such Borrowing is comprised of
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances and (E) additional
information set forth in Exhibit A-1, as the case may be. If
the proposed Borrowing is comprised of Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate Advances, the Paying Agent shall promptly notify the
applicable Borrower and each Appropriate Lender of the
applicable interest rate under Section 2.06. Each Appropriate
Lender shall, before 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the
date of the Borrowing, make available for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at the
Paying Agent's address referred to in Section 9.01, or at such
other address and account as shall be designated by the Paying
Agent in writing to the Lenders, in same day funds, such
Lender's ratable portion of the Borrowing. After the Paying
Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the
conditions set forth in Article IV, the Paying Agent will make
such funds available to the applicable Borrower at the Paying
Agent's aforesaid address; provided, however, that upon the
receipt of such funds with respect to any Borrower, the Paying
Agent shall first make a portion of such funds equal to the
aggregate amount of the Swing Line Advances outstanding with
respect to such Borrower on the date of such Borrowing
available to the Swing Line Banks for repayment of such Swing
Line Advances.

(b) Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made on notice,
given not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the
date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing, by the applicable
Borrower to the Paying Agent, which shall give each Swing Line
Bank prompt notice thereof by telephone, telex or telecopier. 
Each such notice of a Swing Line Borrowing (the "Notice of
Swing Line Borrowing") shall be in the form of Exhibit A-4 or
in such other form as the Administrative Agents and the
Borrower may agree upon, and shall be given by telephone,
telex, telecopier or cable and, if by telephone, shall be
confirmed immediately in writing (which may be by telecopier)
and specifying therein the applicable Borrower, the requested
date and amount of such Swing Line Borrowing and the date of
the maturity thereof. Upon the making of any Swing Line
Advance by one or more Swing Line Banks, such Swing Line Banks
shall on the date of the Swing Line Borrowing make the amount
thereof available for the account of its Domestic Lending
Office to the Paying Agent at the Paying Agent's address
referred to in Section 9.01, or at such other address and
account as shall be designated by the Paying Agent in writing
to the Lenders, in same day funds. After the Paying Agent's
receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the conditions
set forth in Article IV, the Paying Agent will make such funds
available to the applicable Borrower at the Paying Agent's
aforesaid address. Each other Lender shall, forthwith upon
the making of each Swing Line Advance, be deemed to have
committed irrevocably to purchase from each Swing Line Bank a
participation in the Swing Line Advance made by each such
Swing Line Bank in an amount equal to the product of (i) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Commitment of such
Lender and the denominator of which is the Facility multiplied
by (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Swing Line
Advance; provided, however, that none of the other Lenders
shall be required to pay for such participation until demand
therefor pursuant to Section 2.17; and provided further that
no other Lender shall be entitled to receive any repayment
from the applicable Borrower in respect of a Swing Line
Advance until such Lender has paid any amounts due hereunder
to the appropriate Swing Line Banks in respect of its
participation in such Swing Line Advance.

(c) Anything in Section 2.02(b) above or Section 2.08 to
the contrary notwithstanding:

(i) if fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely
information to the Paying Agent for determining the
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for any Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advances,

(A) the Paying Agent shall forthwith notify the
Parent Borrower and the Lenders that the interest
rate cannot be determined for such Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances;

(B) each such Advance will automatically, on
the last day of the then existing Interest Period
therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance (or if
such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will
continue as a Base Rate Advance); and

(C) the obligations of the Lenders to make, or
to Convert Advances into, Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be suspended until the Paying Agent
shall notify the Parent Borrower and the Lenders
that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist;

(ii) if, with respect to any Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advances, Lenders required to make at least 51% of such
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances shall notify the Paying
Agent that the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for any Interest
Period for such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances will
not adequately reflect the cost to such Lenders of making
or funding their respective Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advances for such Interest Period, the Paying Agent shall
forthwith so notify the Parent Borrower and the
Appropriate Lenders, whereupon

(A) each such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance
will automatically, on the last day of the
then-existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into
a Base Rate Advance (or, if such Advance is then a
Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate
Advance), and

(B) the obligations of the Appropriate Lenders
to make, or to Convert Advances into, Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until
the Paying Agent shall notify the Parent Borrower
and such Lenders that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist; and

(iii) if any Borrower shall select an Interest Period
of six months or twelve months for any Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances and any Appropriate Lender shall
notify the Paying Agent that the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
for such Interest Period will not adequately reflect the
cost to such Lender of making or funding its Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advance for such Interest Period, the
Paying Agent shall forthwith so notify such Borrower and
the Appropriate Lenders, whereupon

(A) each such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance
will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a
Base Rate Advance (or, if such Advance is then a
Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate
Advance), and

(B) the obligations of the Appropriate Lenders
to make, or to Convert Advances into, Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances having an Interest Period
of six months or twelve months shall be suspended
until the Paying Agent shall notify the Borrower and
such Lenders that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist.

(d) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and
binding on the applicable Borrower and, in respect of any
Borrowing comprised of or including Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advances specified in such Notice of Borrowing, the applicable
Borrower shall indemnify each Appropriate Lender against any
loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender solely as a
result of any failure by such Borrower to borrow on the date
specified in the Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing,
including any loss (including loss of anticipated profits),
cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such
Lender to fund the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance to be made
by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advance, solely as a result of such failure,
is not made on such date. Without prejudice to the survival of
any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this
paragraph shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

(e) Unless the Paying Agent shall have received notice
from an Appropriate Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing
(other than a Swing Line Borrowing or Auction Bid Borrowing)
that such Lender will not make available to the Paying Agent
such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Paying
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion
available to the Paying Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with this Section 2.02 and the Paying Agent may, in
reliance on such assumption, make available to the applicable
Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the
extent such Lender shall not have made available to the Paying
Agent on the date of any Borrowing such Lender's ratable
portion of such Borrowing, such Lender agrees, and the
Borrower agrees, to pay or repay to the Paying Agent forthwith
on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each
day from the date such amount is made available to such
Borrower until the date such amount is paid or repaid to the
Paying Agent, at (in the case of such Lender) the Federal
Funds Rate and (in the case of each Borrower) the Base Rate
plus the Applicable Percentage (provided that such payment at
the Federal Funds Rate or the Base Rate (plus the Applicable
Percentage) with respect to any Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advance shall not affect the status of such Advance as an
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance). If such Lender shall pay
to the Paying Agent such amount, the amount so paid shall
constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement from and including the date of such
Borrowing.

(f) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be
made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its
Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any
Borrowing.

(g) Each Letter of Credit or Auction Bid LOC shall be
issued on reasonable notice from the applicable Borrower to
the Paying Agent specifying the date of issuance (which shall
be a Business Day) and the amount, expiration date,
beneficiary, whether such Letter of Credit is to be a
Specified Letter of Credit and if so, the aggregate principal
amount of Specified Letters of Credit outstanding and other
terms thereof. Upon fulfillment of such conditions as the
Issuing Bank issuing such Letter of Credit or Auction Bid LOC
or the Paying Agent may reasonably require, including the
conditions set forth in Article IV (as though the issuance of
the Letter of Credit or Auction Bid LOC were an Advance), the
Issuing Bank will issue the Letter of Credit in accordance
with its terms. The Paying Agent shall notify the Lenders of
any issuance by an Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit on the
Settlement Date next succeeding the date of such issuance.

SECTION 2.03. Fees. (a) Facility Fees. The Parent
Borrower agrees to pay to the Paying Agent for distribution to
each Lender a facility fee (the "Facility Fee") with respect
to such Lender's Commitment, at a rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Percentage from time to time in effect on the
aggregate amount of such Lender's Commitment, regardless of
usage. The Facility Fees will commence to accrue on the date
of execution of this Agreement and will be payable in arrears
on (i) the Closing Date, (ii) on the third day of each
January, April, July and October and (iii) on the Termination
Date.

(b) Administrative Agents' Fees. The Parent Borrower
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agents the annual
Administrative Agents' fees set forth in the separate letter
from the Administrative Agents to the Parent Borrower dated
June 8, 1994.

(c) Letter of Credit Fees. (i) Upon the issuance,

LOC), a letter of credit fee at the rate agreed upon pursuant
to Section 2.01(f) between the Parent Borrower and the Lender
issuing such Auction Bid LOC on the maximum amount available

determination of such maximum amount to assume the occurrence
of, and compliance with, all conditions for drawing referred
to therein), in each case payable quarterly in arrears on the
third day of each January, April, July and October after the
date of issuance until the date such Auction Bid LOC expires
or terminates in accordance with its terms and on the date of
such expiration or termination.

(e) Transfer Fee; Amendment Fee. (i) Each Borrower
agrees to pay to each Issuing Bank, upon each transfer or
amendment of a Letter of Credit issued for the account of such
Borrower, the normal and customary transfer fee or amendment
fee, as the case may be (or such other fee as such Borrower
and such Issuing Bank may agree upon), charged by such Issuing
Bank upon the transfer or amendment of letters of credit.

(ii) The Parent Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender
that issues an Auction Bid LOC, upon each transfer or

for the account of such Borrower or to presentment to, or to a
payment by, the Issuing Bank thereunder.

SECTION 2.04. Termination or Reduction of Facilities. 
(a) The Commitments shall be automatically terminated on the
Termination Date.

(b) The Parent Borrower shall have the right, upon at
least five Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agents,
to terminate in whole, or reduce ratably in part (in minimum
principal amounts of $10,000,000), the unused portion of the
Facility (such unused portion having been determined after
subtracting the Facility Usage from the Facility).

(c) The Letter of Credit Facility shall not be reduced
until such time as the Facility shall equal such Letter of
Credit Facility, and thereafter shall reduce proportionately
with any reduction in the amount of Facility pursuant to this
Section 2.04.

SECTION 2.05. Repayment of Advances. (a) Advances. 
Each Borrower shall repay to the Paying Agent for the account
of the Lenders the aggregate principal amount of the Advances
(other than Auction Bid Advances) then outstanding with
respect to such Borrower on the Termination Date.

(b) Swing Line Advances. Each Borrower shall repay to
the Paying Agent for the account of the applicable Swing Line
Bank the outstanding principal amount of any Swing Line
Advance made by it with respect to such Borrower (other than a

on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made by each
Lender with respect to such Borrower from the date of such
Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at
the following rates per annum:

(a) Base Rate Advances. During such periods as
such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum
equal at all times to the Base Rate in effect from time
to time plus the Applicable Percentage, payable quarterly
in arrears on the third day of each January, April, July
and October and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall
be Converted into an Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance or
paid in full; provided that commencing on the date and
during the continuance of any Event of Default the
applicable interest rate for all outstanding Base Rate
Advances shall be a rate per annum equal at all times to
2% per annum above the rate otherwise in effect for such
Base Rate Advances pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) from
time to time.

(b) Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such
periods as such Advance is an Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each
Interest Period for such Advance to the Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the
Applicable Percentage, payable on the last day of each
Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a
duration of six months or twelve months, on each day that
occurs during such Interest Period every three months
from the first day of such Interest Period, provided that
commencing on the date and during the continuance of any
Event of Default the applicable interest rate for all
outstanding Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be a
rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above
the rate otherwise in effect for such Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate Advances pursuant to this Section 2.06(b).

SECTION 2.07. Interest Rate Determination. (a) Each
Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the Paying Agent timely
information for the purpose of determining each Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate. If any one or more of the Reference Banks
shall not furnish such timely information to the Paying Agent
for the purpose of determining any such interest rate (but at
least two Reference Banks shall have furnished such
information), the Paying Agent shall determine such interest
rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the
remaining Reference Banks.

(b) The Paying Agent shall give prompt notice to the
applicable Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders of the
applicable interest rate determined by the Paying Agent for
purposes of Section 2.06(a) or (b), and the applicable rate,
if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of
determining the applicable interest rate under
Section 2.06(b).

(c) If any Borrower shall fail to select the duration of
any Interest Period for any Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances
with respect to such Borrower in accordance with the
provisions contained in the definition of the term "Interest
Period" in Section 1.01, the Paying Agent will forthwith so
notify such Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest
Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances (or, if such
Advances are then Base Rate Advances, will continue as Base
Rate Advances).

SECTION 2.08. Conversion of Advances. (a) Each Borrower
may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Paying Agent
not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the third
Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion, and
subject to the provisions of Sections 2.02(d), 2.06, 2.07,
2.08(d) and 2.10(d), Convert all or any Advances (except Swing
Line Advances, Advances made in respect of Overnight
Overdrafts and Auction Bid Advances) with respect to such
Borrower of one Type into Advances of the other Type;
provided, however, that (i) except as provided in
Section 2.10(d), any Conversion of any Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made on, and
only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances and (ii) no Borrower may Convert any
Base Rate Advances into Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances
unless such Base Rate Advances are in an aggregate amount not
less than $10,000,000. Each such notice of a Conversion
shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify
(i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Type and aggregate
amount of Advances to be Converted and (iii) if such
Conversion is into Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
duration of the Interest Period for such Advances.

(b) Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and
binding on the applicable Borrower and, in respect of any
notice of Conversion to Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
applicable Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any
loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender solely as a
result of any failure to Convert on the date specified in such
notice, including any loss (including loss of anticipated
profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by such Lender to fund the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Conversion
when such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance, solely as a result
of such failure, is not made on such date. Without prejudice
to the survival of any other provision of this Agreement, the
provisions of this paragraph shall survive any termination of
this Agreement

(c) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances with respect to
such Borrower having the same Interest Period shall be
reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than
$10,000,000, such Advances shall automatically Convert into
Base Rate Advances.

(d) Upon the occurrence of any Default and so long as
such Default shall continue, the right of the Borrowers to
Convert any Advance into an Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance
shall be suspended.

SECTION 2.09. Prepayments. (a) Optional Prepayment. 
Each Borrower may, upon at least three Business Days' notice
in the case of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances, and upon at
least one Business Day's notice in the case of Base Rate
Advances, to the Paying Agent stating the proposed date and
aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, (and if such
notice is given the applicable Borrower shall) prepay the
outstanding principal amounts of the Advances in whole or
ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of
such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid and all fees,
costs and expenses otherwise payable by the applicable
Borrower under the Advance Documents with respect to the
principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that:

(i) each prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.09(a)
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less
than $1,000,000;

(ii) in the case of any such prepayment of an
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance, such prepayment shall
either be made on the last day of an Interest Period for
such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance or shall be made
together with the payment of all amounts required
pursuant to Section 9.05(c); and

(iii) prepayments of Swing Line Advances may be made
upon notice given the same day as such prepayment on or
prior to 12:00 noon so long as the Swing Line Advance
shall have remained outstanding for at least one Business
Day.

(b) Mandatory Prepayments. (i) If any Lender
shall for any reason fail to pay the Settlement Amount payable
by it on a Settlement Date, on demand by the Administrative
Agents the Borrowers shall forthwith prepay the Advances in an
amount equal to such Settlement Amount, and the Paying Agent
shall apply such prepayment in the same manner as is specified
in the second sentence of Section 2.17.

(ii) The Borrowers shall, on each Business Day,
prepay Advances comprising part of the same Borrowings or, if
no Advances are then outstanding, shall deposit cash in the
Cash Collateral Account, in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the amount by which (A) the Facility Usage exceeds
(B) the Facility.

(iii) The Borrowers shall, on each Business Day,
pay to the Paying Agent for deposit in the Cash Collateral
Account an amount sufficient to cause the aggregate amount on
deposit in such Account to equal the amount by which the
aggregate maximum amount available to be drawn under Letters
of Credit then outstanding (assuming compliance with all
conditions to drawing) exceeds the Letter of Credit Facility
on such Business Day.

(iv) All prepayments by any Borrower under this
subsection (b) shall be made together with accrued interest to
the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid
and shall be applied first against the Advances with respect
to such Borrower to be prepaid under the Facility that are
Base Rate Advances and thereafter against the Advances with
respect to such Borrower to be prepaid under the Facility that
are Eurodollar Advances having Interest Periods ending as
close as possible to the date of such Prepayment.

SECTION 2.10. Increased Costs; Illegality. (a) If, due
to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than
any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve
requirements included in the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Reserve
Percentage) in or change in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or
request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any
increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or
making, funding or maintaining Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advances, then the Parent Borrower shall from time to time,
upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agents), pay to the Paying Agent for the
account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate
as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the
Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agents by such Lender,
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

(b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any
law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central
bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having
the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender
or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount
of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of
such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other
commitments of this type or of the Letters of Credit or
Auction Bid LOCs (or similar contingent obligations), then,
upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agents), the Parent Borrower shall pay to the
Paying Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time
as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender in the light of such circumstances, to
the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such
increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such
Lender's commitment to lend hereunder or to the issuance or
maintenance of the Letters of Credit or Auction Bid LOCs. A
certificate as to such amounts, submitted to the Parent
Borrower and the Administrative Agents by such Lender, shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.

(c) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any
change in or change in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or
request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any
increase in the cost to any Issuing Bank or any Lender of
agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit or Auction Bid LOCs or any participation therein, then
the Parent Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by
such Issuing Bank or Lender (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agents), pay to the Paying Agent for the
account of such Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may
be, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Issuing
Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, for such increased
cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost,
submitted to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agents
by such Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it
unlawful, as determined by any Lender, or any central bank or
other Governmental Authority shall assert that it is unlawful,
for such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform
its obligations hereunder to make Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, then, on notice thereof
and demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrower through the
Administrative Agent, (i) the obligation of such Lender to
make Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances and to Convert Advances
into Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances shall terminate and
(ii) each Borrower shall forthwith Convert all Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender then outstanding into
Base Rate Advances in accordance with Section 2.08, except
that such Conversion may occur, notwithstanding Section 2.08,
other than on the last day of the respective Interest Periods
for such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances, if the applicable
Borrower has paid all amounts payable under Section 9.05(c).

SECTION 2.11. Payments and Computations. (a) Each
Borrower shall make each payment hereunder without set-off or
counterclaim not later than Noon (New York City time) on the
day when due in U.S. dollars to the Paying Agent at
641 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10043, in same day
funds. The Paying Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be
distributed (i) like funds relating to the payment of
principal, interest, letter of credit fees payable pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(ii) or Facility Fees ratably (other than
amounts payable (A) to a Swing Line Bank in respect of any
Swing Line Advance made by it, (B) to the Concentration
Account Bank in respect of Advances made in respect of
Overnight Overdrafts prior to settlement pursuant to
Section 2.17, (C) to a Lender in respect of any Auction Bid
Advance or Auction Bid LOC or (D) pursuant to
Sections 2.03(b), 2.03(c), 2.03(d)(i), 2.03(e), 2.03(f), 2.10,
2.13, 2.17 or 9.05) to the Appropriate Lenders for the account
of their Applicable Lending Offices and (ii) like funds
relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any
Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable
Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

(b) Each Borrower hereby authorizes (i) each Issuing
Bank on behalf of each Lender, if and to the extent payment
owed to such Lender is not made by such Borrower to the Paying
Agent when due hereunder, to charge from time to time against
any or all of such Borrower's accounts with such Issuing Bank
any amount so due and (ii) each Lender, if and to the extent
payment is not made when due hereunder, to charge from time to
time against any or all of such Borrower's accounts with such
Lender any amount so due to such Lender prior to any sharing
under Section 2.12. Nothing contained in this subsection (b)
shall impair the obligations of any Lender under Section 2.12,
the rights of the Administrative Agents, the Collateral Agent,
the Paying Agent or any Lender under Section 9.06 or any other
rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that
the Administrative Agents, the Collateral Agent, the Paying
Agent or such Lender may have.

(c) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate,
the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, any Fixed Rate or the Federal
Funds Rate, of letter of credit fees payable pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(ii) or 2.03(d)(ii) and of Facility Fees shall
be made by the Paying Agent on the basis of a year of 360
days, in each case for the actual number of days (including
the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the
period for which such interest or fees are payable; provided,
however, that all computations of interest based on the Base
Rate when the Base Rate is determined by reference to
paragraph (a) of the definition thereof shall be made by the
Paying Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as
applicable, in each case for the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring
in the period for which such interest is payable. Each
determination by the Paying Agent of an interest rate or fee
hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

(d) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be
due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension
of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided,
however, that if such extension would cause payment of
interest on or principal of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances
to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment
shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

(e) Unless the Paying Agent shall have received notice
from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is
due to the Appropriate Lenders hereunder that such Borrower
will not make such payment in full, the Paying Agent may
assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the
Paying Agent on such date and the Paying Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each
Appropriate Lender on such due date an amount equal to the
amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the
applicable Borrower shall not have so made such payment in
full to the Paying Agent, each Appropriate Lender shall repay
to the Paying Agent forthwith on demand such amount
distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for
each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the
Paying Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

SECTION 2.12. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender
shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary,
through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on
account of the Advances made by it (other than pursuant to
Sections 2.03(b), 2.03(c), 2.03(d), 2.03(e), 2.03(f), 2.10,
2.13, 2.17 or 9.05 and other than amounts payable to a Swing
Line Bank in respect of any Swing Line Advance made by it, to
the Concentration Account Bank in respect of Advances made in
respect of Overnight Overdrafts prior to settlement pursuant
to Section 2.17 or to a Lender in respect of an Auction Bid
Advance) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account
of the Advances obtained by all the Appropriate Lenders, such
Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Appropriate
Lenders such participations in the Advances made by the other
Appropriate Lenders as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with
each of them; provided, however, that, if all or any portion
of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Appropriate Lender
shall be rescinded and each such other Lender shall repay to
the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such
recovery together with an amount equal to such other Lender's
ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount
of such Lender's required repayment to (b) the total amount so
recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other
amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of
the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any
Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.12 may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct
creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.13. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by each
Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be
made, in accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of and
without deduction for any and all current or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto (including interest,
additions to tax, and penalties thereon) imposed by the United
States of America or any political subdivision thereof (or, in
the event that the Borrower assigns any of its rights or
obligations or any interest hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, by any foreign country and its political
subdivisions in which the assignee is incorporated or is
resident), excluding, in the case of each Lender, the
Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent and each Administrative
Agent, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and
franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the
laws of which such Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent,
the Paying Agent or such Lender (as the case may be) is
organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the
case of each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by its net
income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction
of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities
being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Borrower
shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in
respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender, the
Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent or either Administrative
Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.13) such Lender, the Collateral Agent,
the Paying Agent or such Administrative Agent (as the case may
be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall
make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the
full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or
other authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any current
or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any
payment made hereunder or under any other Loan Document or
from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise
with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document
(hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c) Each Borrower will indemnify each Lender, the
Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent and each Administrative
Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including
any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section 2.13) paid by such Lender,
the Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent or such Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including
interest, expenses, additions to tax, and penalties) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes
or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Payments
under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from
the date such Lender, the Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent
or such Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes
written demand therefor. However, in the case of any Taxes
not required by law to be deducted by the applicable Borrower
from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender,
the Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent or either
Administrative Agent, payment under this indemnification must
be made by such Borrower only if such written demand has been
made within 60 days from the date on which such Lender, the
Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent or such Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, makes payment of the Taxes to the
relevant taxing authority.

(d) Within 30 days after the reasonable request therefor
by the Paying Agent in connection with any payment of Taxes or
Other Taxes, each Borrower will furnish to the Paying Agent,
at its address referred to in, or determined pursuant to,
Section 9.01, the original or a certified copy of an official
receipt from the jurisdiction to which payment is made
evidencing payment thereof or, if unavailable, a certificate
from such Borrower's treasurer or responsible officer that
states that such payment has been made and that sets forth the
date and amount of such payment.

(e) Prior to or on the Closing Date in the case of each
Lender that is a Lender on the Closing Date, and on the date
of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a
Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time
thereafter if reasonably requested by the Parent Borrower or
the Paying Agent, each Lender organized under the laws of a
foreign jurisdiction that is exempt from United States Federal
withholding tax, or that is subject to such tax at a reduced
rate under an applicable treaty, with respect to payments
under this Agreement has provided or is herewith providing the
Parent Borrower or the Paying Agent with an Internal Revenue
Form 4224 or Form 1001 or other certificate or document
required under United States law to establish entitlement to
such exemption or reduced rate. Such form, certificate or
document will be provided by each such Lender from time to
time after the Closing Date as reasonably requested by the
Parent Borrower or the Paying Agent. A determination of
whether a Lender is exempt from United States Federal
withholding tax or is subject to such tax at a reduced rate
shall be within the reasonable judgment of the Lender.

(f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and
obligations of the Borrowers contained in this Section 2.13
shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest
hereunder.

SECTION 2.14. Evidence of Debt Under This Agreement.
(a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of
the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing
to such Lender from time to time, including the amount of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from
time to time hereunder.

(b) The Register maintained by the Paying Agent pursuant
to Section 9.04(d) shall include a control account, and a
subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken
together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each
Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such
Borrowing and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the
terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable from each
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iv) the amount of any
sum received by the Paying Agent from each Borrower hereunder
and each Appropriate Lender's share thereof.

(c) The entries made in the Register shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.15. Obligations Absolute. The obligations of
each Borrower under this Agreement in respect of any Letter of
Credit or Auction Bid LOC and under any other agreement or
instrument relating to any Letter of Credit or Auction Bid LOC
shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
such other agreement or instrument under all circumstances,
including to the extent permitted by law, the following
circumstances:

(a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or Auction Bid LOC or any other
agreement or instrument relating thereto (collectively,
the "Letter of Credit Documents") or any Loan Document;

(b) any change in the time, manner or place of
payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the
obligations of such Borrower in respect of any Letter of
Credit or Auction Bid LOC or any other amendment or
waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of
the Letter of Credit Documents or any other Loan
Document;

(c) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any
collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or
consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of
the obligations of such Borrower in respect of any Letter
of Credit or Auction Bid LOC;

(d) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or
other right that such Borrower may have at any time
against any beneficiary or any transferee of a Letter of
Credit or Auction Bid LOC (or any Persons for whom any
such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting),
any of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent or any other Person,
whether in connection with any Loan Document, the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
unrelated transaction;

(e) any statement or any other document presented
under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or
Auction Bid LOC or other Loan Document proving to be
forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any
respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect;

(f) payment in good faith by an Issuing Bank under a
Letter of Credit or by a Lender under an Auction Bid LOC

other than the payment in full of all obligations
hereunder in respect of any Letter of Credit or Auction
Bid LOC or any agreement or instrument relating to any
Letter of Credit or Auction Bid LOC, whether or not

constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of,
such Borrower.

SECTION 2.16. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the
Advances shall be used by each Borrower to finance the working
capital needs of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and for
other general corporate purposes of each Borrower (including
repayment of advances outstanding under, and other amounts due
in respect of, the Existing Credit Agreement).

SECTION 2.17. Special Adjustments of Advances. The
Paying Agent will notify the Lenders of the aggregate amount
of Advances (other than Auction Bid Advances) outstanding upon
the occurrence of a Default and at such times and at such
frequencies as the Paying Agent or any Swing Line Bank,
Concentration Account Bank or Issuing Bank in their sole
discretion may determine, but in any event not less frequently
than weekly (the date of each such notice by the Paying Agent
being a "Settlement Date"). Upon receipt of any such notice,
such Swing Line Bank, Concentration Account Bank or Issuing
Bank or each of the other Lenders, as the case may be, will
forthwith unconditionally pay to the Paying Agent (for
distribution by the Paying Agent to such Swing Line Bank,
Concentration Account Bank or Issuing Bank or each of the
other Lenders, as the case may be) such amount (a "Settlement
Amount"), if any, as is necessary to cause the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Advances (other than Auction
Bid Advances) to be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the amounts of their Commitments. Upon each
payment and distribution pursuant to the preceding sentence,
each Lender will be deemed from the date of such payment and
distribution for all purposes under the Loan Documents
(including in respect of interest accruing from such date on
the principal amount of such Advances) to have outstanding
Advances owed to it in the amount of its ratable share of such
Advances as aforesaid.

releases (in each case as defined in CERCLA) of Hazardous
Materials by the Parent Borrower or any of its

the best knowledge of the Parent Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries, there have been no such releases or
threatened releases on, upon, under or into any real
property in the vicinity of any of their respective
facilities or operations that, through soil, surface

hearing or notice of violation, study or investigation,
based on or related to the manufacture, processing,
distribution, use, generation, treatment, storage,

Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.18. Security Documents. (a) The Security
Agreement, upon execution and delivery by the parties thereto,
will create in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the ratable
benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable
security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the

Pledged Stock, and proceeds thereof, and when financing state-

ments in appropriate form are filed in the offices specified
on Schedule 3.18(a), the Lien created under the Security

Loan Parties in such Collateral and the proceeds thereof, in
each case prior and superior in right to any other Person.

(b) The Trademark Security Agreement, upon execution and
delivery by the parties thereto, will create in favor of the

SECTION 3.19. Labor Matters. There are no strikes, lock-

outs or slowdowns against the Parent Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent
Borrower threatened, except where such strikes, lockouts or
slowdowns could not reasonably be expected to, individually or

hours worked by and payment made to employees of the Parent
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries have not been in violation
of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable
Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such
matters, where such violations could reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material

give rise to a right of termination or right of renegotiation
on the part of any union under any collective bargaining
agreement to which the Parent Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Parent Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries is bound.

rights of its Subsidiaries to sell, franchise or license under
such brand names then being used may be transferred in
connection with any sale of assets or stock of the related

"Base Capital Expenditure Amount") for any Fiscal Year ("Base
Capital Expenditures") in the aggregate with respect to the
Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries (utilization of the Base
Capital Expenditure Amount to be determined for any Fiscal
Year by applying the amount of Base Capital Expenditures
actually made in such Fiscal Year first to the amount
available pursuant to the proviso below and then to the Base
Capital Expenditure Amount for such Fiscal Year); provided,
however, that if in any Fiscal Year the Base Capital
Expenditure Amount exceeds the amount of Base Capital
Expenditures actually made by the Parent Borrower and its
Subsidiaries in such Fiscal Year, the Parent Borrower and its
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to make additional Capital
Expenditures in the next succeeding Fiscal Year equal to 45%
of the amount of such excess. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Base Capital Expenditures" shall, with respect to
Fiscal Year 1994, be deemed to include any Capital
Expenditures (other than Real Estate Capital Expenditures)
that were made by the Parent Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries between January 2, 1994, and the Closing Date.

(b) In addition to the Capital Expenditures that can
be made pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the Parent Borrower
and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to make Capital
Expenditures in an amount not to exceed $200,000,000 for any
Fiscal Year ("Real Estate Capital Expenditures") in the
aggregate with respect to the Parent Borrower and its
Subsidiaries to the extent that such additional Capital
Expenditures are made in connection with (i) the acquisition
or development of real property (and related fixtures and
personal property) on which the Parent Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries intends to open new stores or other facilities
related to the Parent Borrower's primary business, (ii) the
purchase of real property (and related fixtures and personal
property) currently being leased by the Parent Borrower or its
Subsidiaries or (iii) the acquisition or development of real
property (and related fixtures and personal property)
permitting the expansion of existing stores or other
facilities related to the Parent Borrower's line of primary
business. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Real
Estate Capital Expenditures" shall, with respect to Fiscal
Year 1994, be deemed to include any Capital Expenditures that
were made by the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
between January 2, 1994, and the Closing Date in connection
with activities of the type described in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) of the immediately preceding sentence.

(c) In addition to the Capital Expenditures that
can be made pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the
Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to
make additional Capital Expenditures in any Fiscal Year
("Additional Capital Expenditures") in an aggregate amount
with respect to the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries equal
to a percentage of Consolidated Free Cash Flow for the
immediately preceding Fiscal Year, such percentage with
respect to any Fiscal Year to be equal to (a) 100% in the
event that the Parent Borrower's Consolidated ratio of Net
Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA for the immediately
preceding Fiscal Year is 3.0 to 1 or lower, (b) 75% in the
event that the Parent Borrower's Consolidated Ratio of Net
Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA for the immediately
preceding Fiscal Year is 3.5 to 1 or lower and (c) 50% in the
event that the Parent Borrower's Consolidated Ratio of Net
Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA for the immediately
preceding Fiscal Year is lower than the amount set forth below
with respect to such preceding Fiscal Year:

Preceding Ratio of Net Total Debt To Consolidated EBITDA for
Fiscal Year Immediately Preceding Fiscal Year 

1994 4.30 to 1.00
1995 4.20 to 1.00
1996 4.10 to 1.00

such Fiscal Year may be carried forward to, and made in, the
two succeeding Fiscal Years.

has provided written notice of any such Reportable Event

basis of such Reportable Event or Reportable Events or

and be continuing, (ii) the Borrowers shall have given notice
of prepayment in whole under Section 2.09 of all Advances or

Termination Date shall have occurred or (iv) if at any time,
as a result of prepayments pursuant to Section 2.09, the
Termination Date shall be a date not more than 30 days
following the expiration of any Letter of Credit, then, upon
the occurrence of any of the events described in clauses (i)
through (iv) above, the Administrative Agents may, and upon
the request of any Issuing Bank or of the Majority Lenders
shall, whether in addition to the taking by the Administrative
Agents of any of the actions described in Article VIII or
otherwise, make demand upon the Borrowers to, and forthwith
upon such demand the Borrowers will, pay to the Collateral
Agent for its benefit and the ratable benefit of the Lenders
in same day funds at the Collateral Agent's office designated
in such demand, for deposit in a special cash collateral
account (the "Letter of Credit Collateral Account") to be
maintained in the name of the Collateral Agent and under the
sole dominion and control of the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Collateral Agent and the ratable benefit of the
Lenders at such place as shall be designated by the Collateral
Agent, an amount equal to the amount of the Letter of Credit
Obligations.

(b) Each Borrower hereby pledges and assigns to the
Collateral Agent for its benefit and the ratable benefit of
the Lenders, and grants to the Collateral Agent for its
benefit and the ratable benefit of the Lenders a lien on and a
security interest in, the following collateral (the "Letter of
Credit Collateral"):

(i) the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, all
cash deposited therein, and all certificates and
instruments, if any, from time to time representing or
evidencing the Letter of Credit Collateral Account;

(ii) all Eligible Securities (as defined below) from
time to time held by the Collateral Agent and all
certificates and instruments from time to time
representing or evidencing Eligible Securities;

(iii) all notes, certificates of deposit and other
instruments from time to time hereafter delivered to or
otherwise possessed by the Collateral Agent for or on
behalf of the Borrower in substitution for or in respect
of any or all of the then existing Letter of Credit
Collateral;

(iv) all interest, dividends, cash, instruments and
other property from time to time received, receivable or
otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange for
any or all of the then existing Letter of Credit
Collateral; and

(v) to the extent not covered by clauses (i) through
(iv) above, all proceeds of any or all of the foregoing
Letter of Credit Collateral.

The lien and security interest granted hereby secures the
payment of all obligations of each Borrower now or hereafter
existing hereunder and under any other Loan Document.

(c) Each Borrower hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent
to apply, from time to time after funds are deposited in the
Letter of Credit Collateral Account, funds then held in the
Letter of Credit Collateral Account to the payment of any
amounts, in such order as the Collateral Agent may elect, as
shall have become or shall become due and payable by the
Borrowers to the Lenders in respect of the Letters of Credit.

(d) Neither the Borrowers nor any Person claiming or
acting on behalf of or through the Borrowers shall have any
right to withdraw any of the funds held in the Letter of
Credit Collateral Account, except as provided in Section
7.02(h); provided, however, that as long as no Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, and to the extent that there
is an amount in excess of $1,000,000 in the Letter of Credit
Collateral Account at the end of any Business Day after taking
into account applications of funds, if any, from the Letter of
Credit Collateral Account made pursuant to Section 7.02(c),
the Collateral Agent will, at the written request of the
Parent Borrower, from time to time invest amounts on deposit
in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account in such instruments
described in clause (b), (c) or (d) of the definition of the
term "Permitted Investments" in Section 1.01 as the Parent
Borrower may select and the Collateral Agent may approve (the
"Eligible Securities"); provided further that in order to
provide the Collateral Agent with a perfected security
interest therein, each investment in Eligible Securities shall
be evidenced by negotiable certificates or instruments, of
which the Collateral Agent shall take physical possession. If
the Parent Borrower shall have the right to have amounts on
deposit in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account invested by
the Collateral Agent, but shall have failed to request the
Collateral Agent to invest such amounts, the Collateral Agent
will endeavor to invest such amounts in such Eligible
Securities as the Collateral Agent shall select. Any interest
received by the Collateral Agent in respect of Eligible
Securities shall be credited against the Letter of Credit
Obligations. Non-interest proceeds from Eligible Securities
that are not invested or reinvested in Eligible Securities as
provided above shall be deposited and held in cash in the
Letter of Credit Collateral Account under the sole dominion
and control of the Collateral Agent.

(e) The Borrowers agree that they will not (i) sell or
otherwise dispose of any interest in the Letter of Credit
Collateral or (ii) create or permit to exist any lien,
security interest or other charge or encumbrance upon or with
respect to any of the Letter of Credit Collateral, except for
the security interest created by this Section 7.02.

(f) If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing:

(i) The Collateral Agent may, in its sole
discretion, without notice to the Borrowers except as
required by law and at any time from time to time,
charge, set off and otherwise apply all or any part of
first, the Letter of Credit Obligations and second, the
obligations of the Borrowers now or hereafter existing
under any of the Loan Documents, against the Letter of
Credit Collateral Account or any part thereof, in such
order as the Collateral Agent shall elect. The
Collateral Agent agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers
after any such set-off and application made by the
Collateral Agent, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application. The rights of the Collateral Agent under
this Section 7.02(f) are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including other rights of set-off) that the
Collateral Agent may have.

(ii) The Collateral Agent may also exercise, in its
sole discretion, in respect of the Letter of Credit
Collateral Account, in addition to the other rights and
remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to
it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party upon
default under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in
the State of New York at that time, and the Collateral
Agent may, without notice except as specified below, 
sell the Letter of Credit Collateral or any part thereof
in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any
of the Collateral Agent's offices or elsewhere, for 
cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such 
other terms as the Collateral Agent may deem commercial-
ly reasonable. The Borrowers agree that, to the extent 
notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten 
days' notice to the Parent Borrower of the time and 
place of any public sale or the time after which any 
private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable 
notification. The Collateral Agent shall not be 
obligated to make any sale of Letter of Credit Col-
lateral or any part thereof, regardless of notice of 
sale having been given. The Collateral Agent may 
adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by 
announcement at the time and fixed therefor, and such 
sale may, without further notice, be made at the time 
and place to which it was so adjourned.

(iii) Any cash held in the Letter of Credit
Collateral Account, and all cash proceeds received by 
the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, 
collection from or other realization upon all or any 
part of the Letter of Credit Collateral Account may, in 
the discretion of the Collateral Agent, then or at any 
time thereafter be applied (after payment of any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 9.05) in whole or in part by
the Collateral Agent for the ratable benefit of the
Lenders against all or any part of the obligations of 
the Borrowers now or hereafter existing under any of 
the Loan Documents in such order as the Collateral 
Agent may elect. 

(g) The Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have
exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of
the Letter of Credit Collateral if the Letter of Credit
Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that
which the Collateral Agent accords its own property, it being
understood that the Collateral Agent shall not have any
responsibility or liability (i) for ascertaining or taking
action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges,
maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Eligible
Securities, whether or not the Collateral Agent has or is
deemed to have knowledge of such matters, (ii) for taking any
necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with
respect to the Letter of Credit Collateral, (iii) for the
collection of any proceeds from Eligible Securities, (iv) by
reason of any invalidity, lack of value or uncollectability of
any of the payments received by the Collateral Agent from
obligors with respect to Eligible Securities, or (v) for any
loss resulting from investments made pursuant to
Section 7.02(d), except to the extent such loss was
attributable to the Collateral Agent's gross negligence or
wilful misconduct in complying with Section 7.02(d), or
(vi) in connection with any investments made pursuant to
Section 7.02(d) without a written request from the Parent
Borrower, or any failure by the Collateral Agent to make any
such investment.

(h) Any surplus of the funds held in the Letter of
Credit Collateral Account and remaining after payment in full
of all of the Obligations of the Borrowers under the
Facility and under any other Loan Document after the
Termination Date shall be paid to the Parent Borrower or to
whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

Bank, as the case may be, and each Agent and its Affiliates
and each Issuing Banks and its Affiliates may accept deposits

Issuing Bank, on demand, in the amount of such Lender's pro

incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by such Agent or such
Issuing Bank, including fees, disbursements and other charges
of counsel and compensation of agents paid for services
rendered on behalf of the Lenders, that shall not have been
reimbursed by the Loan Parties and (b) to indemnify and hold
harmless each Agent and each Issuing Bank and any of their

bursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it in its capacity
as an Agent or a Issuing Bank, as the case may be, or any of
them in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by
it or any of them under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, to the extent the same shall not have been reim-

bursed by the Loan Parties, provided that no Lender shall be
liable to any Agent or any Issuing Bank for any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of
such Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees or agents.

Line Banks or any Issuing Bank and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agents, any other Lender, any Swing
Line Banks or any Issuing Bank and based on such documents and

would have been payable thereunder to such Lender had such
Lender not sold such participation) and (iv) the Parent

Borrower, the Administrative Agents, the Swing Line Banks or
the Issuing Banks, provided that no such assignment shall
release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such Bank for such Lender as a party hereto. In

Lender, duly execute and deliver to the assigning Lender a
promissory note or notes evidencing the Advances made to the 
Borrowers, by the assigning Lender hereunder.

of Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 9.05, as well as to any Fees
accrued for its account under Section 2.03 and not yet paid.

(j) In the event that:

(i) any Lender shall have refused (and shall not
have retracted such refusal) to make available any
Advance on its part to be made available hereunder, other
than solely as a result of the failure of any condition
set forth in Article IV to be satisfied (such condition
not having been effectively waived in accordance with the
terms hereof);

(ii) any Lender shall have notified either the
Administrative Agents or the Parent Borrower (and shall
not have retracted such notification) that it does not

condition not having been effectively waived in
accordance with the terms hereof);

(iii) (A) a receiver, trustee, conservator or other
custodian shall have been appointed with respect to any

hereby agrees, to use commercially reasonable efforts to
transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with and
subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.03(b)) all
the interests, rights and obligations of such Lender to an
assignee; provided, however, that (1) no such assignment shall
conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any
Governmental Authority and (2) the Parent Borrower or such
assignee, as the case may be, shall pay to such Lender in same
day funds on the date of such assignment the principal of and
interest accrued on the date of payment on the Advances made
by such Lender hereunder and all other amounts accrued for
such Lender's account or owed to it hereunder or (B) to
replace such Lender with one or more assignees, provided, in
the case of this clause (B), (1) that the Lender being
replaced has been paid in full for all Advances made by such
Lender and all other amounts accrued or due to such Lender
hereunder, (2) that the full amount of the Commitments remains
unchanged and (3) that the percentage of the total Commitments
allocated to the Lenders (other than any replaced Lenders)
remains unchanged unless prior written consent from such
Lenders has been obtained, and provided, further, in either of

SECTION 9.06. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby
authorized, in addition to any other right or remedy that any
Lender may have by operation of law or otherwise, at any time
and from time to time, without notice to any Borrower (any
such notice being expressly waived by each Borrower), to
exercise its banker's lien or right of setoff and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness
at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of any Loan Party against any of and all the
obligations of any Borrower now or hereafter existing under
this Agreement and other Loan Documents held by such Lender,
irrespective of whether such Lender shall have made any demand
under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and although
such obligations may be unmatured.

SECTION 9.07. Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

SECTION 9.08. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay
on the part of the Administrative Agents, the Issuing Banks,
the Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent, the Swing Line Banks
or any Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuation of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agents, the Issuing Banks, the Collateral
Agent, the Paying Agent, the Swing Line Banks and the Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they
would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any
departure by the Loan Parties therefrom shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b)
below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
No notice or demand on the Loan Parties in any case shall
entitle the Loan Parties to any other or further notice or
demand in similar or other circumstances.

(b) Neither this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived,
amended or modified except (i) in the case of this Agreement,
pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by the Borrowers and the Majority Lenders, (ii) in the case of
either Guarantee Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or
agreements in writing entered into by the Guarantors party
thereto and the Collateral Agent and consented to by the
Majority Lenders, (iii) in the case of any of the Security
Documents, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the parties thereto and consented to by the
Majority Lenders or (iv) in the case of a Letter of Credit,
pursuant to an agreement or agreements entered into by the
applicable Borrower and the Issuing Banks; provided, however,
that no such agreement shall (A) change the principal amount
of any Advance or Letter of Credit Obligation, extend the
final scheduled maturity of any Advance, extend the scheduled
date for payment (but not prepayments) of principal of or
interest on any Advance, forgive any such payment or any part
thereof or reduce the rate of interest on any Advance, in each
case without the prior written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (B) increase the amount or extend the termination
date of the Commitment of any Lender or reduce or extend the
date for payment of the Fees of any Lender, in each case
without the prior written consent of such Lender, (C) amend or
modify the provisions of this Section 9.08(b) or the defini-

tion of the term "Majority Lenders" without the prior written
consent of each Lender, (D) release Collateral in excess of
an aggregate amount of $300,000,000 (it being understood that
the Parent Borrower shall be permitted to direct the release
of up to $10,000,000 (determined by the Fair Market Value of
the Collateral) of Collateral in each Fiscal Year without the
consent of the Lenders), except as expressly permitted by the
Security Documents or this Agreement or (E) release Dillon
Companies, Inc. as a Subsidiary Guarantor (other than as
expressly provided in the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement),
without the prior written consent of each Lender; and provided
further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or other-

wise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agents,
the Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent, the Swing Line Banks
or the Issuing Banks hereunder without the prior written con-

sent of the Administrative Agents, the Collateral Agent, the
Paying Agent, the Swing Line Banks or the Issuing Banks,
respectively.

SECTION 9.09. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the applicable
interest rate, together with all fees and charges that are
treated as interest under applicable law (collectively, the
"Charges"), as provided for herein or in any other document
executed in connection herewith, or otherwise contracted for,
charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender or any
Swing Line Bank, shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the
"Maximum Rate") that may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by such Lender or such Swing Line Bank in
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable
to such Lender or such Swing Line Banks hereunder, together
with all Charges payable to such Lender or such Swing Line
Banks, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.

SECTION 9.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and the letter referred to in
Section 2.03(b) constitute the entire contract between the
parties relative to the subject matter hereof. Any previous
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof is superseded by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Nothing in this Agreement or in the other Loan
Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon
any party other than the parties hereto and thereto any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 9.11. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of
any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or
in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other
parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this
Section 9.11.

SECTION 9.12. Severability. In the event any one or more
of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other
Loan Document should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties
shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid
provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.

SECTION 9.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall
constitute an original but all of which when taken together
shall constitute but one contract, and shall become effective
as provided in Section 9.03.

SECTION 9.14. Headings. Article and Section headings and
the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of
reference only, are not part of this Agreement and are not to
affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration
in interpreting, this Agreement.

SECTION 9.15. Confidentiality. Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by the Parent Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent and each Lender
hereby agree to keep all Proprietary Information (as defined
below) confidential and not to disclose or reveal any
Proprietary Information to any Person other than the
Administrative Agent's, the Collateral Agent's, the Paying
Agent's or such Lender's directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates and agents and to actual or potential assignees and
participants, and then only on a confidential basis; provided,
however, that the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent,
the Paying Agent or any Lender may disclose Proprietary
Information (a) as required by law, rule, regulation or
judicial process or in connection with any litigation or other
proceeding relating to this Agreement (provided that the
applicable Person shall give the Parent Borrower notice of
such disclosure on the same day on which it determines such
disclosure to be necessary and in any event prior to such
disclosure), (b) to its attorneys and accountants or (c) as
requested or required by any state, or Federal or foreign
authority or examiner regulating banks or banking. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Proprietary Information"
shall include all information about the Parent Borrower or any
of its Affiliates that has been furnished by the Parent
Borrower or any of its Affiliates, whether furnished before or
after the Closing Date, and regardless of the manner in which
it is furnishes; provided, however, that Proprietary
Information does not include information that (i) is or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a
result of a disclosure by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent or any Lender not permitted
by this Agreement, (ii) was available to the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent or any Lender on
a nonconfidential basis prior to its disclosure by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent
or such Lender by the Parent Borrower or any of its Affiliates
or (iii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a Person other than the Parent
Borrower or its Affiliates who, to the best knowledge of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent
or such Lender, as the case may be, is not otherwise bound by
a confidentiality agreement with the Parent Borrower or any of
its Affiliates, or is not otherwise prohibited from
transmitting the information to the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent or such Lender.

SECTION 9.16. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process. (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof, in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted
by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any
Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents against
any Loan Party or its properties in the courts of any juris-

diction.

(b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this agreement or the other Loan Documents
in any New York State or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

(c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in
Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right
of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by law.

SECTION 9.17. Release of Collateral. (a) Upon the
occurrence of any sale, transfer or disposition of assets
permitted by, and consummated in accordance with, the
provisions of this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall
release from the lien of the Collateral Documents the assets
so sold, transferred or otherwise disposed.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document to the contrary, so long as no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
security interests in all the Collateral under all the
Collateral Documents shall be released, the provisions of
Section 7.02 shall cease to be operative (and any Collateral
held pursuant thereto shall be released) and the Collateral
Documents shall be terminated (and each of the Lenders
(x) hereby consents to such release and termination and
(y) hereby authorizes the execution and delivery by the
Administrative Agents and the Collateral Agent of the
documents and instruments and the delivery of the Collateral
in the possession of the Collateral Agent, in each case as
contemplated by paragraph (c) below) upon the request of the
Parent Borrower if, at the time of such request, either

(i) the Senior Debt Ratings are (A) BBB- or better
in the case of S&P or (B) Baa3 or better in the case of
Moody's (provided, however, that the Parent Borrower
shall not be entitled to request the release of all the
Collateral pursuant to this clause (i) if, at the time
such request would otherwise be made, there shall be in
effect a Senior Debt Rating of (x) BB or lower in the
case of S&P or (y) Ba2 or lower in the case of Moody's
(the condition set forth in this clause (i) being
referred to herein as the "Investment Grade Rating
Condition")) or

(ii) the Consolidated Ratio of Net Total Debt to
Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Fiscal
Quarter is 3.0 to 1.0 or lower.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Parent Borrower shall not be entitled to request the release of all 
the Collateral pursuant to this paragraph (b) unless, simultaneously with 
the release of the security interests in all the Collateral as contemplated by 
this paragraph (b), all security interests in all the Collateral for the 
benefit of the Senior Secured Notes are release

(c) In connection with the above-described release and
termination, the Collateral Agent shall deliver to the Parent
Borrower any Collateral in the Collateral Agent's possession
and the Administrative Agents and the Collateral Agent shall
execute and deliver, at the Parent Borrower's expense, all
documents and instruments as the Parent Borrower or any other
Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence such release and
termination. Any such execution and delivery of such
documents or instruments shall be without recourse to the
Administrative Agents and the Collateral Agent. Nothing in
this Section 9.17 shall be construed to affect the provisions
of Section 6.01.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agents, the Collateral Agent, the Paying Agent,
the Issuing Banks, the Swing Line Banks and the Lenders have
caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective
authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.
