Purchaser and the subsequent assignment and transfer
pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement:

(i) Characteristics of Receivables. 
Each Receivable (a) shall have been originated in
the United States of America by a Dealer for the
retail sale of a Financed Vehicle in the ordinary
course of such Dealer's business, shall have been
fully and properly executed by the parties thereto,
shall have been purchased by the Seller from such
Dealer under an existing dealer agreement with the
Seller, shall have been validly assigned by such
Dealer to the Seller, (b) shall have created or
shall create a valid, subsisting, and enforceable
first priority security interest in favor of the
Seller in the Financed Vehicle, which security
interest shall be assignable by the Seller to the
Purchaser, (c) shall contain customary and enforce-
able provisions such that the rights and remedies of
the holder thereof shall be adequate for realization
against the collateral of the benefits of the secu-
rity, (d) shall provide for level monthly payments
(provided that the payment in the first or last
month in the life of the Receivable may be minimally
different from the level payment) that fully amor-
tize the Amount Financed by maturity and yield
interest at the Annual Percentage Rate, and (e)
shall provide for, in the event that such contract
is prepaid, a prepayment that fully pays the Princi-
pal Balance.

(ii) Schedule of Receivables. The
information set forth in Exhibit B to this Agreement
shall be true and correct in all material respects
as of the opening of business on the Cut-Off Date,
and no selection procedures believed to be adverse
to the Certificateholders shall have been utilized
in selecting the Receivables from those receivables
which meet the criteria contained herein. The
computer tape regarding the Receivables made avail-
able to the Purchaser and its assigns is true and
correct in all respects.

(iii) Compliance with Law. Each
Receivable and the sale of the Financed Vehicle
shall have complied at the time it was originated or
made and at the execution of this Agreement shall
comply in all material respects with all require-
ments of applicable federal, State, and local laws,
and regulations thereunder, including, without
limitation, usury laws, the Federal Truth-in-Lending
Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, the Federal Reserve
Board's Regulations B and Z, and State adaptations
of the National Consumer Act and of the Uniform
Consumer Credit Code, and other consumer credit laws
and equal credit opportunity and disclosure laws.

(iv) Binding Obligation. Each Re-
ceivable shall represent the genuine, legal, valid,
and binding payment obligation in writing of the
Obligor, enforceable by the holder thereof in accor-
dance with its terms subject to the effect of bank-
ruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally.

(v) No Government Obligor. None of
the Receivables shall be due from the United States
of America or any State or from any agency, depart-
ment, or instrumentality of the United States of
America or any State.

(vi) Security Interest in Financed
Vehicle. Immediately prior to the sale, assignment,
and transfer thereof, each Receivable shall be
secured by a validly perfected first security inter-
est in the Financed Vehicle in favor of the Seller
as secured party or all necessary and appropriate
actions shall have been commenced that would result
in the valid perfection of a first security interest
in the Financed Vehicle in favor of the Seller as
secured party.

(vii) Receivables in Force. No Re-
ceivable shall have been satisfied, subordinated, or
rescinded, nor shall any Financed Vehicle have been
released from the lien granted by the related Re-
ceivable in whole or in part.

(viii) No Waiver. No provision of a
Receivable shall have been waived.

(ix) No Defenses. No right of re-
scission, setoff, counterclaim, or defense shall
have been asserted or threatened with respect to any
Receivable.

(x) No Liens. To the best of the
Seller's knowledge, no liens or claims shall have
been filed for work, labor, or materials relating to
a Financed Vehicle that shall be liens prior to, or
equal or coordinate with, the security interest in
the Financed Vehicle granted by the Receivable.

(xi) No Default. Except for payment
defaults continuing for a period of not more than
thirty days as of the Cut-Off Date, no default,
breach, violation, or event permitting acceleration
under the terms of any Receivable shall have oc-
curred; and no continuing condition that with notice
or the lapse of time would constitute a default,
breach, violation, or event permitting acceleration
under the terms of any Receivable shall have arisen;
and the Seller shall not waive any of the foregoing.

(xii) Insurance. The Seller, in
accordance with its customary procedures, shall have
determined that the Obligor has obtained or agreed
to obtain physical damage insurance covering the
Financed Vehicle.

(xiii) Title. It is the intention
of the Seller that the transfer and assignment
herein contemplated constitute a sale of the Receiv-
ables from the Seller to the Purchaser and that the
beneficial interest in and title to the Receivables
not be part of the Seller's estate in the event of
the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against
the Seller under any bankruptcy law. No Receivable
has been sold, transferred, assigned, or pledged by
the Seller to any Person other than the Purchaser. 
Immediately prior to the transfer and assignment
herein contemplated, the Seller had good and market-
able title to each Receivable free and clear of all
Liens, encumbrances, security interests, and rights
of others and, immediately upon the transfer there-
of, the Purchaser shall have good and marketable
title to each Receivable, free and clear of all
Liens, encumbrances, security interests, and rights
of others; and the transfer has been perfected under
the UCC.

(xiv) Valid Assignment. No Receiv-
able shall have been originated in, or shall be
subject to the laws of, any jurisdiction under which
the sale, transfer, and assignment of such Receiv-
able under this Agreement shall be unlawful, void,
or voidable. The Seller has not entered into any
agreement with any account debtor that prohibits,
restricts or conditions the Assignment of any por-
tion of the Receivables.

(xv) All Filings Made. All filings
(including, without limitation, UCC filings) neces-
sary in any jurisdiction to give the Purchaser a
first perfected ownership interest in the Receiv-
ables shall have been made.

(xvi) One Original. There shall be
only one original executed copy of each Receivable.

(xvii) New and Used Vehicles. Ap-
proximately 87% of the aggregate Principal Balance
of the Receivables, constituting 82% of the Receiv-
ables, as of the Cutoff Date, represent vehicles
financed at new vehicle rates, and the remainder of
the Receivables represent vehicles financed at used
vehicle rates;

(xviii) Origination. Each Receiv-
able shall have an origination date on or after
January 1, 1993;

(xix) Maturity of Receivables. Each
Receivable shall have an original maturity of not
greater than 60 months;

(xx) Minimum Annual Percentage Rate. 
Each Receivable shall have an Annual Percentage Rate
equal to or greater than 7.5%;

(xxi) Scheduled Payments. Each Re-
ceivable shall have a first Scheduled Payment due on
or prior to May 31, 1994 and no Receivable shall
have a payment that is more than 30 days overdue as
of the Cut-Off Date;

(xxii) Location of Receivable Files. 
The Receivable Files shall be kept at one or more of
the locations listed in Schedule A hereto; and

(xxiii) No Extensions. The number
of Scheduled Payments shall not have been extended
on any Receivable on or before the Cut-Off Date.

(xxiv) Other Data. The numerical
data relating to the characteristics of the Receiv-
ables contained in the Prospectus is true and cor-
rect in all material respects.

(xxv) Chattel Paper. Each Receiv-
able constitutes "chattel paper" as defined in the
UCC.

(xxvi) No Simple Interest Receiv-
ables. None of the Receivables are Simple Interest
Receivables.

(xxvii) Agreement. The representa-
tions and warranties in this Agreement shall be
true.

Receivable, shall indicate clearly that such Receivable
has been sold and is owned by the Purchaser.

and its agents at any time during normal business hours
to inspect, audit, and make copies of and abstracts from

sance, or bad faith of the Seller in the performance of
its duties under the Agreement or by reason of reckless
disregard of the Seller's obligations and duties under
the Agreement.

(e) The Seller shall defend, indemnify,

The Receivables

Section 12.1 Representations and Warranties of
Seller. The Seller makes the following representations
and warranties as to the Receivables on which the Trustee
relies in accepting the Receivables in trust and execut-
ing and authenticating the Certificates. Such represen-
tations and warranties speak as of the execution and
delivery of the Agreement, but shall survive the sale,
transfer, and assignment of the Receivables to the Trust-
ee and, if applicable, any subsequent assignment or
transfer pursuant to Article XV:

(i) Characteristics of Receiv-
ables. Each Receivable (a) shall have been
originated in the United States of America by a
Dealer for the retail sale of a Financed Vehi-
cle in the ordinary course of such Dealer's
business, shall have been fully and properly
executed by the parties thereto, shall have
been purchased by the Seller from Ford Motor
Credit Company, which in turn shall have pur-
chased such Receivables from such Dealer under
an existing dealer agreement with Ford Motor
Credit Company, and shall have been validly
assigned by such Dealer to Ford Motor Credit
Company, which in turn shall have been validly
assigned by Ford Motor Credit Company to the
Seller in accordance with its terms, (b) shall
have created or shall create a valid, subsist-
ing, and enforceable first priority security
interest in favor of Ford Motor Credit Company
in the Financed Vehicle, which security inter-
est has been assigned by Ford Motor Credit
Company to the Seller, which in turn shall be
assignable by the Seller to the Trustee, (c)
shall contain customary and enforceable provi-
sions such that the rights and remedies of the
holder thereof shall be adequate for realiza-
tion against the collateral of the benefits of
the security, (d) shall provide for level
monthly payments (provided that the payment in
the first or last month in the life of the
Receivable may be minimally different from the
level payment) that fully amortize the Amount
Financed by maturity and yield interest at the
Annual Percentage Rate, and (e) shall provide
for, in the event that such contract is pre-
paid, a prepayment that fully pays the Princi-
pal Balance.

(ii) Schedule of Receivables. 
The information set forth in Schedule A to the
Agreement shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the opening of business
on the Cutoff Date, and no selection procedures
believed to be adverse to the Certificatehold-
ers shall have been utilized in selecting the
Receivables.

(iii) Compliance with Law. Each
Receivable and the sale of the Financed Vehicle
shall have complied at the time it was origi-
nated or made and at the execution of the
Agreement shall comply in all material respects
with all requirements of applicable federal,
State, and local laws, and regulations thereun-
der, including, without limitation, usury laws,
the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Report-
ing Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, the Federal Reserve
Board's Regulations B and Z, and State adapta-
tions of the National Consumer Act and of the
Uniform Consumer Credit Code, and other consum-
er credit laws and equal credit opportunity and
disclosure laws.

(iv) Binding Obligation. Each
Receivable shall represent the genuine, legal,
valid, and binding payment obligation in writ-
ing of the Obligor, enforceable by the holder
thereof in accordance with its terms subject to
the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorgani-
zation, or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

(v) No Government Obligor. 
None of the Receivables shall be due from the
United States of America or any State or from
any agency, department, or instrumentality of
the United States of America or any State.

(vi) Security Interest in Fi-
nanced Vehicle. Immediately prior to the sale,
assignment, and transfer thereof, each Receiv-
able shall be secured by a validly perfected
first security interest in the Financed Vehicle
in favor of Ford Motor Credit Company as se-
cured party or all necessary and appropriate
actions shall have been commenced that would
result in the valid perfection of a first secu-
rity interest in the Financed Vehicle in favor
of Ford Motor Credit Company as secured party.

(vii) Receivables in Force. No
Receivable shall have been satisfied, subordi-
nated, or rescinded, nor shall any Financed
Vehicle have been released from the lien grant-
ed by the related Receivable in whole or in
part.

(viii) No Waiver. No provision of
a Receivable shall have been waived.

(ix) No Defenses. No right of
rescission, setoff, counterclaim, or defense
shall have been asserted or threatened with
respect to any Receivable.

(x) No Liens. To the best of
the Seller's knowledge, no liens or claims
shall have been filed for work, labor, or mate-
rials relating to a Financed Vehicle that shall
be liens prior to, or equal or coordinate with,
the security interest in the Financed Vehicle
granted by the Receivable.

(xi) No Default. Except for
payment defaults continuing for a period of not
more than thirty days as of the Cutoff Date, no
default, breach, violation, or event permitting
acceleration under the terms of any Receivable
shall have occurred; and no continuing condi-
tion that with notice or the lapse of time
would constitute a default, breach, violation,
or event permitting acceleration under the
terms of any Receivable shall have arisen; and
the Seller shall not waive any of the forego-
ing.

(xii) Insurance. Ford Motor
Credit Company, in accordance with its custom-
ary procedures, shall have determined that the
Obligor has obtained or agreed to obtain physi-
cal damage insurance covering the Financed
Vehicle.

(xiii) Title. It is the intention
of the Seller that the transfer and assignment
herein contemplated constitute a sale of the
Receivables from the Seller to the Trust and
that the beneficial interest in and title to
the Receivables not be part of the Seller's
estate in the event of the filing of a bank-
ruptcy petition by or against the Seller under
any bankruptcy law. No Receivable has been
sold, transferred, assigned, or pledged by the
Seller to any Person other than the Trustee. 
Immediately prior to the transfer and assign-
ment herein contemplated, the Seller had good
and marketable title to each Receivable free
and clear of all Liens, encumbrances, security
interests, and rights of others and, immediate-
ly upon the transfer thereof, the Trustee for
the benefit of the Certificateholders shall
have good and marketable title to each Receiv-
able, free and clear of all Liens, encumbranc-
es, security interests, and rights of others;
and the transfer has been perfected under the
UCC.

(xiv) Valid Assignment. No Receivable
shall have been originated in, or
shall be subject to the laws of, any jurisdic-
tion under which the sale, transfer, and as-
signment of such Receivable under the Agreement
or pursuant to transfers of the Certificates
shall be unlawful, void, or voidable. The
Seller has not entered into any agreement with
any account debtor that prohibits, restricts or
conditions the assignment of any portion of the
Receivables.

(xv) All Filings Made. All
filings (including, without limitation, UCC
filings) necessary in any jurisdiction to give
the Trustee a first perfected ownership inter-
est in the Receivables shall have been made.

xvi) Chattel Paper. Each Receivable
constitutes "chattel paper" as defined
in the UCC.

(xvii) No Simple Interest Receivables.
None of the Receivables are Simple
Interest Receivables.

(xviii) One Original. There shall
be only one original executed copy of each
Receivable.

(xix) Agreement. The representa-
tions and warranties in the Agreement shall be
true.

Section 12.2 Repurchase Upon Breach. The
Seller, the Servicer, or the Trustee, as the case may be,
shall inform the other parties to the Agreement and Ford
Motor Credit Company promptly, in writing, upon the
discovery of any breach of the Seller's representations
and warranties pursuant to Section 12.1. Unless the
breach shall have been cured by the last day of the
second Collection Period following the discovery, the
Trustee shall enforce the obligation of the Seller under
the Purchase Agreement, and, if necessary, the Seller
shall enforce the obligation of Ford Motor Credit Company
under the Purchase Agreement, to repurchase any Receiv-
able materially and adversely affected by the breach as
of such last day (or, at the Seller's option, the last
day of the first Collection Period following the discov-
ery). In consideration of the purchase of the Receiv-
able, the Seller shall remit the Purchase Amount, in the
manner specified in Section 14.5. The sole remedy of the
Trustee, the Trust, or the Certificateholders with re-
spect to a breach of the Seller's representations and
warranties pursuant to Section 12.1 shall be to require
the Seller to repurchase Receivables pursuant to this
Section 12.2 or to enforce the obligation of Ford Motor
Credit Company to the Seller to repurchase such Receiv-
ables pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

Section 12.3 Custody of Receivable Files. To
assure uniform quality in servicing the Receivables and
to reduce administrative costs, the Trustee, upon the
execution and delivery of the Agreement, hereby revocably
appoints the Servicer, and the Servicer hereby accepts
such appointment, to act as the agent of the Trustee as
custodian of the following documents or instruments which
are hereby constructively delivered to the Trustee with
respect to each Receivable:

(i) The original of the Receivable.

(ii) The original credit application
fully executed by the Obligor or a photocopy
thereof.

(iii) The original certificate of
title or such documents that the Servicer or
Ford Motor Credit Company shall keep on file,
in accordance with its customary procedures,
evidencing the security interest of Ford Motor
Credit Company in the Financed Vehicle.

(iv) Any and all other documents
that the Servicer or the Seller shall keep on
file, in accordance with its customary proce-
dures, relating to a Receivable, an Obligor, or
a Financed Vehicle.

The Servicer shall provide an Officer's Certif-
icate to the Trustee confirming that the Servicer has
received on behalf of the Trustee all the documents and
instruments necessary for the Servicer to act as the
agent of the Trustee for the purposes set forth in this
Section, including the documents referred to herein, and
the Trustee is hereby authorized to rely on such
Officer's Certificate.

Section 12.4 Duties of Servicer as Custodian.

(a) Safekeeping. The Servicer shall hold
the Receivable Files on behalf of the Trustee for the use
and benefit of all present and future Certificateholders,
and maintain such accurate and complete accounts, re-
cords, and computer systems pertaining to each Receivable
File as shall enable the Trustee to comply with these
Standard Terms and Conditions of Agreement. In perform-
ing its duties as custodian the Servicer shall act with
reasonable care, using that degree of skill and attention
that the Servicer exercises with respect to the receiv-
able files relating to all comparable automotive receiv-
ables that the Servicer services for itself or others. 
In accordance with its customary practices with respect
to its retail installment sale contracts, the Servicer
shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, periodic audits
of the Receivable Files held by it under the Agreement,
and of the related accounts, records, and computer sys-
tems, in such a manner as shall enable the Trustee to
verify the accuracy of the Servicer's record keeping. 
The Servicer shall promptly report to the Trustee any
failure on its part to hold the Receivable Files and
maintain its accounts, records, and computer systems as
herein provided and promptly take appropriate action to
remedy any such failure. Nothing herein shall be deemed
to require an initial review or any periodic review by
the Trustee of the Receivable Files.

(b) Maintenance of and Access to Records. 
The Servicer shall maintain each Receivable File at one
of its offices specified in Schedule B to the Agreement,
or at such other office as shall be specified to the
Trustee by written notice not later than 90 days after
any change in location. The Servicer shall make avail-
able to the Trustee or its duly authorized representa-
tives, attorneys, or auditors a list of locations of the
Receivable Files, the Receivable Files, and the related
accounts, records, and computer systems maintained by the
Servicer at such times as the Trustee shall instruct.

Section 12.5 Instructions; Authority to Act. 
All instructions from the Trustee shall be in writing and
signed by a Trust Officer, and the Servicer shall be
deemed to have received proper instructions with respect
to the Receivable Files upon its receipt of such written
instructions.

Section 12.6 Custodian's Indemnification. The
Servicer as custodian shall indemnify the Trustee for any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, compensatory
damages, payments, costs, or expenses of any kind whatso-
ever that may be imposed on, incurred, or asserted
against the Trustee as the result of any improper act or
omission in any way relating to the maintenance and
custody by the Servicer as custodian of the Receivable
Files; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be
liable for any portion of any such amount resulting from
the willful misfeasance, bad faith, or negligence of the
Trustee.

Section 12.7 Effective Period and Termination. 
The Servicer's appointment as custodian shall become
effective as of the Cutoff Date and shall continue in
full force and effect until terminated pursuant to this
Section 12.7. If Ford Motor Credit Company shall resign
as Servicer in accordance with the provisions of the
Agreement or if all of the rights and obligations of the
Servicer shall have been terminated under Section 19.01,
the appointment of the Servicer as custodian shall be
terminated by the Trustee, or by the Holders of Class A
Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the Class A
Certificate Balance, in the same manner as the Trustee or
such Holders may terminate the rights and obligations of
the Servicer under Section 19.1. As soon as practicable
after any termination of such appointment, the Servicer
shall deliver the Receivable Files and the related ac-
counts and records maintained by the Servicer to the
Trustee or the Trustee's agent at such place or places as
the Trustee may reasonably designate.

Administration and Servicing of Receivables

Section 13.1 Duties of Servicer. The Servicer
shall manage, service, administer, and make collections
on the Receivables with reasonable care, using that
degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises
with respect to all comparable receivables that it ser-
vices for itself or others. The Servicer's duties shall
include collection and posting of all payments, respond-
ing to inquiries of Obligors on such Receivables, inves-
tigating delinquencies, sending payment coupons to
Obligors, reporting tax information to Obligors, account-
ing for collections, furnishing monthly and annual state-
ments to the Trustee with respect to distributions, and
making Advances pursuant to Section 14.4. The Servicer
shall follow its customary standards, policies, and
procedures in performing its duties as Servicer. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer is
authorized and empowered by the Trustee to execute and
deliver, on behalf of itself, the Trust, the Certificate-
holders, or the Trustee or any of them, any and all
instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or partial
or full release or discharge, and all other comparable
instruments, with respect to such Receivables or to the
Financed Vehicles securing such Receivables. If the
Servicer shall commence a legal proceeding to enforce a
Receivable, the Trustee (in the case of a Receivable
other than a Purchased Receivable) shall thereupon be
deemed to have automatically assigned, solely for the
purpose of collection, such Receivable to the Servicer. 
If in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding it shall
be held that the Servicer may not enforce a Receivable on
the ground that it shall not be a real party in interest
or a holder entitled to enforce the Receivable, the
Trustee shall, at the Servicer's expense and direction,
take steps to enforce the Receivable, including bringing
suit in its name or the name of the Certificateholders. 
The Trustee shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of
attorney and other documents reasonably necessary or
appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its
servicing and administrative duties hereunder. The
Servicer, at its expense, shall obtain on behalf of the
Trust all licenses, if any, required by the laws of any
jurisdiction to be held by the Trust in connection with
ownership of the Receivables, and shall make all filings
and pay all fees as may be required in connection there-
with during the term hereof.

Section 13.2 Collection of Receivable Pay-
ments. The Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to
collect all payments called for under the terms and
provisions of such Receivables as and when the same shall
become due and shall follow such collection procedures as
it follows with respect to all comparable receivables
that it services for itself or others. The Servicer may
grant extensions, rebates, or adjustments on a Receiv-
able, which shall not, for the purposes of the Agreement
(other than Section 13.6 hereof), modify the original due
dates and amounts of the Scheduled Payments. The
Servicer may in its discretion waive any late payment
charge or any other fees that may be collected in the
ordinary course of servicing a Receivable.

Section 13.3 Realization Upon Receivables. On
behalf of the Trust, the Servicer shall use reasonable
efforts, consistent with its customary servicing proce-
dures, to repossess or otherwise convert the ownership of
the Financed Vehicle securing any Receivable as to which
the Servicer shall have determined eventual payment in
full is unlikely. The Servicer shall follow such custom-
ary and usual practices and procedures as it shall deem
necessary or advisable in its servicing of comparable
receivables, which may include reasonable efforts to
realize upon any Dealer Recourse and selling the Financed
Vehicle at public or private sale. The foregoing shall
be subject to the provision that, in any case in which
the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the
Servicer shall not expend funds in connection with the
repair or the repossession of such Financed Vehicle
unless it shall determine in its discretion that such
repair and/or repossession will increase the Liquidation
Proceeds by an amount greater than the amount of such
expenses.

Section 13.4 [Reserved]

Section 13.5 Maintenance of Security Interests
in Financed Vehicles. The Servicer shall, in accordance
with its customary servicing procedures, take such steps
as are necessary to maintain perfection of the security
interest created by each Receivable in the related Fi-
nanced Vehicle. The Trustee hereby authorizes the
Servicer to take such steps as are necessary to re-per-
fect such security interest on behalf of the Trust in the
event of the relocation of a Financed Vehicle or for any
other reason.

Section 13.6 Covenants of Servicer. The
Servicer shall not release the Financed Vehicle securing
each such Receivable from the security interest granted
by such Receivable in whole or in part except in the
event of payment in full by or on behalf of the Obligor
thereunder or repossession, nor shall the Servicer impair
the rights of the Certificateholders in the Receivables,
nor shall the Servicer change the Annual Percentage Rate
with respect to any Receivable, nor shall the Servicer
modify the number or amount of Scheduled Payments under a
Receivable.

Section 13.7 Purchase of Receivables Upon
Breach. (a) The Servicer or the Trustee shall inform
the other party promptly, in writing, upon the discovery
of any breach pursuant to Section 13.2, 13.5 or 13.6. 
Unless the breach shall have been cured by the last day
of the second Collection Period following such discovery
(or, at the Servicer's election, the last day of the
first following Collection Period), the Servicer shall
purchase any Receivable materially and adversely affected
by such breach as determined by the Trustee (which shall
include any Receivable as to which a breach of Section
13.06 has occurred). In consideration of the purchase of
such Receivable, the Servicer shall remit the Purchase
Amount in the manner specified in Section 14.05. For
purposes of this Section 13.7, the Purchase Amount shall
consist in part of a release by the Servicer of all
rights of reimbursement with respect to Outstanding
Advances on the Receivable. The sole remedy of the
Trustee, the Trust, or the Certificateholders with re-
spect to a breach pursuant to Section 13.2, 13.5 or 13.6
shall be to require the Servicer to purchase Receivables
pursuant to this Section 13.7.

(b) In the event that the Obligor with
respect to a Receivable shall have been declared bankrupt
and at such time or thereafter the Servicer's records
relating to such Receivable shall record that the period-
ic payment thereon has been reduced at or since such
declaration and that such Receivable has been extended
beyond December 31, 1998, the Servicer shall pay an
amount equal to the amount of a prepayment which would
cause such a reduction in the amount of the new periodic
payment over the remainder of the original scheduled life
of the Receivable.

Section 13.8 Servicer Fee. The Servicer shall
be entitled to any interest earned on the amounts depos-
ited in the Collection Account and the Payahead Account
during such Collection Period plus all late fees, prepay-
ment charges (including, in the case of a Receivable that
provides for payments according to the "Rule of 78's" and
that is prepaid in full, the difference between the
Principal Balance of such Receivable (plus accrued inter-
est to the date of prepayment) and the principal balance
of such Receivable computed according to the "Rule of
78's"), and other administrative fees and expenses or
similar charges allowed by applicable law with respect to
Receivabs during such Collection Period (the "Supplemen-
tal Servicing Fee"). The Servicer also shall be entitled
to the Servicing Fee, as provided herein.

Section 13.9 Servicer's Certificate. (a) On
or about the tenth day of each calendar month (except for
------------, 1994 in which case on or prior to
------------, 1994), the Servicer shall deliver to the
Trustee (with a copy to each of the rating agencies
requested to provide a rating on the Class A Certifi-
cates) a Servicer's Certificate containing all informa-
tion necessary to make the distributions pursuant to
Section 14.6 (including, if required, withdrawals from or
deposits to the Payahead Account and Advances by the
Servicer pursuant to Section 14.4) for the Collection
Period preceding the date of such Servicer's Certificate,
and all information necessary for the Trustee to send
statements to Certificateholders pursuant to Section
14.9. Receivables purchased or to be purchased by the
Servicer or the Seller shall be identified by the
Servicer by the Seller's account number with respect to
such Receivable (as specified in Schedule A of the Agree-
ment).

(b) On or about the fifth (but in no
event later than the tenth (except for ------------, 1994
in which case on or prior to ------------, 1994)) calen-
dar day of each calendar month, the Servicer shall deliv-
er to the underwriter(s) of the Class A Certificates the
Class A Certificate Factor as of the close of business on
the Distribution Date occurring in that month.

Section 13.10 Annual Statement as to Compli-
ance; Notice of Default. (a) The Servicer shall deliver

during the preceding 12-month (or shorter) period and of
its performance under the Agreement has been made under
such officer's supervision and (ii) to the best of such
officer's knowledge, based on such review, the Servicer
has fulfilled all its obligations under the Agreement
throughout such year, or, if there has been a default in
the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each
such default known to such officer and the nature and

firm of independent certified public accountants, who may
also render other services to the Servicer or to the
Seller or to Ford Motor Credit Company, to deliver to the

dar year a report addressed to the Board of Directors of

made in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, (2) included tests relating to automotive
loans serviced for others in accordance with the require-
ments of the Uniform Single Audit Program for Mortgage

such Program are applicable to the servicing obligations
set forth in the Agreement, and (3) except as described

holder shall be required by applicable statutes or regu-
lations to review such documentation. Access shall be

offices of the Servicer. Nothing in this Section shall
affect the obligation of the Servicer to observe any

Distributions; Subordination Spread Account;
Statements to Certificateholders

Section 14.1 Accounts. (a) The Servicer
shall establish the Collection Account and the Certifi-
cate Account in the name of the Trustee for the benefit
of the Certificateholders, and shall establish the
Payahead Account in the name of the Trustee on behalf of
the Obligors. The Collection Account and the Payahead
Account shall be segregated trust accounts initially
established with the Trustee and maintained with the
Trustee so long as (i) the deposits of the Trustee have
the Required Deposit Rating or (ii) the Collection Ac-
count and the Payahead Account are maintained in the
Corporate Trust Department of the Trustee; provided,
however, that all amounts held in the Collection Account
and the Payahead Account shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable laws, rules, and regulations, be invested
as directed by the Servicer by the bank or trust company
then maintaining the accounts in interest-bearing time
deposits of such bank or trust company (provided that
such investments shall have the Required Deposit Rating)
that mature not later than the Distribution Date for the
Collection Period to which such amounts relate and any
such time deposits so acquired shall be held until matu-
rity and provided, further that if the Servicer is re-
quired to remit collections daily to the Collection
Account pursuant to Section 14.2 then such remittances,
and any remittances to the Payahead Account, shall be
invested at the written direction of the Servicer as to
specific investments in investments rated A-1+ by Stan-
dard & Poor's Ratings Group and P-1 by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or in other investments as may be permitted
by each of such rating agencies, in each case maturing on
the Distribution Date next succeeding the date of invest-
ment. Such written direction shall certify that any such
investment is authorized by this Section. The Certifi-
cate Account shall be a segregated trust account estab-
lished and maintained with the Trustee, and the amounts
in such account shall not be invested. Should the short-
term unsecured debt obligations of the Trustee no longer
have the Required Deposit Rating then, unless the Collec-
tion Account and the Payahead Account are maintained in
the Corporate Trust Department of the Trustee, the
Servicer shall as soon as is reasonably practical, with
the Trustee's assistance as necessary, cause the Collec-
tion Account and the Payahead Account (i) to be moved to
a bank or trust company, the short-term unsecured debt
obligations of which shall have the Required Deposit
Rating or (ii) to be moved to the Corporate Trust Depart-
ment of the Trustee.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions
of clause (a) above and of the third paragraph of Section
14.6(a), for so long as (i) Ford Motor Credit Company is
the Servicer, (ii) the rating of Ford Motor Credit
Company's short-term unsecured debt is at least P-1 by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and is at least A-1 by
Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and (iii) no Event of De-
fault shall have occurred (each, a "Monthly Remittance
Condition"), Payaheads need not be remitted to and depos-
ited in the Payahead Account but instead may be remitted
to and held by the Servicer. So long as such conditions
are met, the Servicer shall not be required to segregate
or otherwise hold separate any Payaheads remitted to the
Servicer as aforesaid but shall be required to remit
Payaheads to the Certificate Account in accordance with
Section 14.6(a)(ii). At any time as such conditions are
not met, the Servicer shall deposit in the Payahead
Account the amount of any Payaheads then held or received
by it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Monthly
Remittance Condition is not satisfied the Servicer may
utilize, with respect to Payaheads, an alternative remit-
tance schedule (which may include the remittance schedule
utilized by the Servicer before the Monthly Remittance
Condition became unsatisfied), if the Servicer provides
to the Trustee written confirmation from each rating
agency which has an outstanding rating on the Class A
Certificates and was requested by the Seller or an affil-
iate to rate the Class A Certificates that such alterna-
tive remittance schedule will not result in the downgrad-
ing or withdrawal by such rating agencies of the ratings
then assigned to the Class A Certificates. The Trustee
shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any event or
circumstance under clause (iii) of the first sentence of
this Section 14.1(b) that would require remittance of the
Payaheads to the Payahead Account unless the Trustee has
received notice of such event or circumstance from the
Seller or the Servicer in an Officer's Certificate or
from the Holders of Class A Certificates evidencing not
less than 25% of the Class A Certificate Balance or
unless a Trustee Officer in the Corporate Trust Office
with knowledge hereof and familiarity herewith has actual
knowledge of such event or circumstance.

Section 14.2 Collections. The Servicer shall
remit daily to the Collection Account (i) all payments by
or on behalf of the Obligors (including Payaheads on the
Receivables but excluding Purchased Receivables) and (ii)
all Liquidation Proceeds, both as collected during the
Collection Period. Ford Motor Credit Company, so long as
it is acting as the Servicer, may make remittances of
collections on a less frequent basis than that specified
in the immediately preceding sentence. It is understood
that such less frequent remittances may be made only on
the specific terms and conditions set forth below in this
Section 14.2 and only for so long as such terms and
conditions are fulfilled. Accordingly, notwithstanding
the provisions of the first sentence of this Section
14.2, the Servicer shall remit collections received
during a Collection Period to the Collection Account in
immediately available funds on the related Distribution
Date but only for so long as each Monthly Remittance
Condition is satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a Monthly Remittance Condition is not satisfied the
Servicer may utilize an alternative remittance schedule
(which may include the remittance schedule utilized by
the Servicer before the Monthly Remittance Condition
became unsatisfied), if the Servicer provides to the
Trustee written confirmation from each rating agency
which has an outstanding rating on the Class A Certifi-
cates and was requested by the Seller or an affiliate to
rate the Class A Certificates that such alternative
remittance schedule will not result in the downgrading or
withdrawal by such rating agencies of the ratings then
assigned to the Class A Certificates. The Trustee shall
not be deemed to have knowledge of any event or circum-
stance under clause (iii) of the definition of Monthly
Remittance Condition that would require daily remittance
by the Servicer to the Collection Account unless the
Trustee has received notice of such event or circumstance
from the Seller or the Servicer in an Officer's Certifi-
cate or from the Holders of Class A Certificates evidenc-
ing not less than 25% of the Class A Certificate Balance
or a Trustee Officer in the Corporate Trust Office with
knowledge hereof or familiarity herewith has actual
knowledge of such event or circumstance. For purposes of
this Article XIV the phrase "payments by or on behalf of
Obligors" shall mean payments made by Persons other than
the Servicer or by other means.

Section 14.3 Application of Collections. For
the purposes of this Agreement, as of the close of busi-
ness on the last day of each Collection Period, all
collections for the Collection Period with respect to
each Receivable (other than a Purchased Receivable) shall
be applied by the Servicer as follows:

Payments by or on behalf of the Obligor
which are not late fees, prepayment charges, or
other administrative fees and expenses, or
similar charges, applied in accordance with
Section 13.8 shall be applied first to reduce
Outstanding Advances made with respect to such
Receivable, as described in Section 14.4(a)
below. Next, any excess shall be applied to
the Scheduled Payment with respect to such
Receivable. Finally, any remaining excess
(except partial prepayments which cause a re-
duction in the Obligor's periodic payment to
below the Scheduled Payment as of the Cutoff
Date) shall be added to the Payahead Balance,
and shall be applied to prepay the Receivable,
but only if the sum of such excess and the
previous Payahead Balance shall be sufficient
to prepay the Receivable in full. Otherwise,
any remaining excess payments shall constitute
a Payahead, and shall increase the Payahead
Balance.

Section 14.4 Advances. (a) As of the close
of business on the last day of each Collection Period, if
the payments by or on behalf of the Obligor on a Receiv-
able (other than a Purchased Receivable) after applica-
tion under 14.3 shall be less than the Scheduled Payment,
whether as a result of any extension granted to the
Obligor or otherwise, the Payahead Balance, if any, with
respect to such Receivables shall be applied by the
Servicer to the extent of the shortfall, and such
Payahead Balance shall be reduced accordingly. Next,
subject to the following sentence, the Servicer shall
make an Advance of any remaining shortfall. The Servicer
will be obligated to make an Advance in respect of a
Receivable only to the extent that the Servicer, in its
sole discretion, shall determine that the Advance shall
be recoverable from subsequent collections or recoveries
on any Receivable. With respect to each Receivable, the
Advance shall increase Outstanding Advances. Outstanding
Advances shall be reduced by subsequent payments by or on
behalf of the Obligor, collections of Liquidation Pro-
ceeds and payments of the Purchase Amount.

If the Servicer shall determine that
an Outstanding Advance with respect to any Receivable
shall not be recoverable, the Servicer shall be reim-
bursed from any collections made on other Receivables in
the Trust, and Outstanding Advances with respect to such
Receivable shall be reduced accordingly.

(b) In the event that an Obligor
shall prepay a Receivable in full, if the related con-
tract did not require such Obligor to pay a full month's
interest, for the month of prepayment, at the Annual
Percentage Rate, the Servicer shall make an
unreimbursable advance of the amount of such interest.

Section 14.5 Additional Deposits. The
Servicer shall deposit in the Collection Account the
aggregate Advances pursuant to Section 14.4(a) and the
aggregate advances pursuant to Section 14.4(b). To the
extent that the Servicer fails to make an advance pursu-
ant to Section 14.4(b) on the date required, the Class A
Agent shall withdraw such amount from the Subordination
Spread Account and deposit such amount in the Collection
Account. The Servicer and the Seller shall deposit in
the Collection Account the aggregate Purchase Amount with
respect to Purchased Receivables and the Servicer shall
deposit therein all amounts to be paid under Sections
21.2 and 13.7(b). All such deposits with respect to a
Collection Period shall be made, in immediately available
funds, on the Distribution Date related to such Collec-
tion Period.

Section 14.6 Distributions.

(a) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee
shall cause to be made the following transfers and
distributions in the amounts set forth in the Servicer's
Certificate for such Distribution Date:

(i) From the Collection Account
to the Certificate Account, in immediately
available funds, the entire amount then on
deposit in the Collection Account; provided,
however, that in the event that the Servicer is
required to make deposits to the Collection
Account on a daily basis pursuant to Section
14.2, the amount of the funds transferred from
the Collection Account to the Certificate Ac-
count will include only those funds that were
deposited in the Collection Account for the
Collection Period related to such Distribution
Date.

(ii) From the Payahead Account,
or from the Servicer in the event the provi-
sions of Section 14.1(b) above are applicable,
to the Certificate Account, in immediately
available funds, (x) the portion of Payaheads
constituting Scheduled Payments or prepayments
in full, required by Sections 14.3 and 14.4(a),
and (y) the Payahead Balance, if any, relating
to any Purchased Receivable.

(iii) From the Certificate Ac-
count to the Payahead Account, or to the
Servicer in the event the provisions of Sec-
tions 14.1(b) above are applicable, in immedi-
ately available funds, the aggregate Payaheads
required by Section 14.3 for the Collection
Period related to such Distribution Date. 

(iv) From the Certificate Ac-
count to the Servicer, in immediately available
funds, repayment of Outstanding Advances pursu-
ant to Section 14.4(a).

(b) Prior to each Distribution Date, the
Servicer shall on each Determination Date calculate the
Total Available Amount, the Available Interest, the
Available Principal, the Class A Distributable Amount and
the Class B Distributable Amount and, based on the Total
Available Amount and the other distributions to be made
on such Distribution Date, determine the amount distrib-
utable to Certificateholders of each Class.

(c) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee
(based on the information contained in the Servicer's
Certificate delivered on the related Determination Date
pursuant to Section 13.09) shall, subject to subsection
(d) hereof, make the following distributions in the
following order of priority:

(i) first, to the Servicer,
from the Available Interest, the Servicer Fee
and all unpaid Servicer Fees from prior Collec-
tion Periods; 

(ii) second, to the Class A
Certificateholders:

(A) from the Class A Percentage
of the Available Interest (except as
provided in the proviso to subsection (d)(i)
below) (as such Available Interest has been re-
duced by Servicer Fee payments), an amount
equal to the sum of the Class A Interest Dis-
tributable Amount and any outstanding Class A
Interest Carryover Shortfall as of the close of
the preceding Distribution Date (plus interest
<PAGE>
on such Class A Interest Carryover Shortfall at
the Pass-Through Rate from such preceding Dis-
tribution Date through the current Distribution
Date, to the extent permitted by law);

(B) from the Class A Percentage
of the Available Principal, an amount
equal to the sum of the Class A Principal Dis-
tributable Amount and any outstanding Class A
Principal Carryover Shortfall as of the close
of the preceding Distribution Date;

(iii) third, to the Class B Certificateholders
subject to Section 14.7(d) below:

(A) from the Available
Interest (as such Available Interest has been
reduced by payments pursuant to clauses (i) and
(ii) above), an amount equal to the sum of the
Class B Interest Distributable Amount and any
outstanding Class B Interest Carryover Short-
fall as of the close of the preceding Distribu-
tion Date; and

(B) from the Class B Percentage
of the Available Principal, an amount
equal to the sum of the Class B Principal Dis-
tributable Amount and any outstanding Class B
Principal Carryover Shortfall as of the close
of the preceding Distribution Date;

provided, however, that amounts otherwise distributable
to the Class B Certificateholders shall instead be depos-
ited by the Trustee in the Subordination Spread Account
to the extent provided in Section 14.7(c) hereof to cover
any Subordination Spread Account deficiency resulting
from payments on such Distribution Date from the Subordi-
nation Spread Account pursuant to Section 14.6(d) or
otherwise.

(d) The rights of the Class B Certifi-
cateholders to receive distributions in respect of the
Class B Certificates shall be and hereby are subordinated
to the rights of the Class A Certificateholders to re-
ceive distributions in respect of the Class A Certifi-
cates and the rights of the Servicer to receive the
Servicing Fee (and any accrued and unpaid Servicer Fees
from prior Collection Periods) in the event of delinquen-
cy or defaults on the Receivables. Such subordination
shall be effected as follows, and all payments shall be
effected pursuant to clause (i) below prior to any pay-
ments pursuant to clause (ii):

<PAGE>
(i) If the Class A Percentage
of the Available Interest (as such Available
Interest has been reduced by Servicer Fee pay-
ments) is less than the sum of the Class A
Interest Distributable Amount and any Class A
Interest Carryover Shortfall (including inter-
est on such Shortfall as provided in paragraph
(c)(ii)(A) above) from the preceding Distribu-
tion Date, the Class A Certificateholders shall
be entitled to receive distributions in respect
of such deficiency first, from the Class B
Percentage of the Available Interest; second,
if such amounts are insufficient, from amounts
on deposit in the Subordination Spread Account;
and third, if such amounts are insufficient,
from the Class B Percentage of the Available
Principal; provided, however, that if the
amount required to be advanced by the Servicer
pursuant to Section 14.4(b) for the Collection
Period shall not have been advanced by the
Servicer, the resulting shortfall shall be
allocated pro rata among the Class A Certifi-
cates and the Class B Certificates and any such
shortfall with respect of the Class A Certifi-
cates (and any Class A Carryover Shortfalls
attributable thereto) shall be paid only from
amounts that are or become available in the
Subordination Spread Account after giving ef-
fect to any deposit thereto on such day. Upon
either the written instructions of the Servicer
or the written instructions of the Trustee
(based solely on the information contained in
the Servicer's Certificate delivered on the
related Determination Date pursuant to Section
13.9), the Class A Agent shall release from the
amounts available in the Subordination Spread
Account the amounts required pursuant to Sec-
tion 14.6(c)(ii) above and distribute such
amounts to the Trustee.

(ii) If the Class A Percentage
of the Available Principal is less than the sum
of the Class A Principal Distributable Amount
and any Class A Principal Carryover Shortfall
from the preceding Distribution Date, the Class
A Certificateholders shall be entitled to re-
ceive distributions in respect of such defi-
ciency first, from the Class B Percentage of
the Available Principal; second, if such
amounts are insufficient, from amounts on de-
posit in the Subordination Spread Account; and
third, if such amounts are insufficient, from
the Class B Percentage of the Available Inter-
est. Upon either the written instructions of
the Servicer or the written instructions of the
Trustee (based solely on the information con-
tained in the Servicer's Certificate delivered
on the related Determination Date pursuant to
Section 13.9), the Class A Agent shall release
from the amounts available in the Subordination
Spread Account the amounts required pursuant to
Section 14.6(c)(ii) above and distribute such
amounts to the Trustee.

(e) Subject to Section 21.1 respecting
the final payment upon retirement of each Certificate,
the Servicer shall on each Distribution Date instruct the
Trustee to distribute to each Certificateholder of any
Class of record on the preceding Record Date either by
wire transfer, in immediately available funds to the
account of such holder at a bank or other entity having
appropriate facilities therefor, if such Certificatehold-
er is the Seller or a Clearing Agency and shall have
provided to the Servicer appropriate instructions prior
to such Distribution Date, or, if not, by check mailed to
such Certificateholder (such check to be mailed as soon
as reasonably practicable on or after such Distribution
Date) at the address of such holder appearing in the
Certificate Register, the amounts to be distributed to
such Certificateholder pursuant to such holder's Certifi-
cates.

Section 14.7 Subordination; Subordination
Spread Account; Priority of Distributions.

(a) (i) In order to effectuate the
subordination provided for herein, there shall be estab-
lished and maintained with the Class A Agent a separate
trust account (the "Subordination Spread Account") to
include the money and other property deposited and held
therein pursuant to this subsection 14.7(a)(i) and sub-
section 14.7(a)(ii). On the date of issuance of the
Certificates, the Seller shall deposit the Subordination
Initial Deposit, if any, into the Subordination Spread
Account. The Subordination Spread Account shall not be
part of the Trust. Each of the Class A Certificatehold-
ers, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns
(including, but not limited to, any future Holder of a
Class A Certificate) hereby appoints Chemical Bank,
acting in its capacity as agent for the purposes of this
Section 14.7 and not as Trustee, with respect to the
Subordination Spread Account and the Subordination Spread
Account Property (the "Class A Agent"), and the Class A
Agent hereby accepts such appointment.

(ii) In order to provide for the prompt payment
to the Class A Certificateholders and the
Servicer, in accordance with subsections 14.6(c)
and 14.6(d), to give effect to the subordination
provided for herein, and to assure availability of
the amounts maintained in the Subordination Spread
Account:

(A) The Seller, as initial
holder of the Class B Certificates, hereby
sells, conveys, and transfers to the Class A
Agent and its successors and assigns, the Sub-
ordination Initial Deposit and all proceeds
thereof, subject, however, to the limitations
set forth below, and solely for the purpose of
providing for payment of the Class A Distribut-
able Amount provided for in Section 14.6 and
this Section; and

(B) The Seller, as initial
holder of the Class B Certificates, on behalf
of itself and its successors and assigns hereby
sells, conveys, and transfers to the Class A
Agent, all its right, title, and interest in
and to the Subordination Spread Account, sub-
ject, however, to the limitations set forth
below, and all proceeds of the foregoing, in-
cluding, without limitation, all other amounts
and investments held from time to time in the
Subordination Spread Account (whether in the
form of deposit accounts, Physical Property,
book-entry securities, uncertificated securi-
ties, or otherwise) subject, however, to the
limitations set forth below, and solely for the
purpose of providing for payment of the Class A
Distributable Amount provided for in Section
14.06 and this Section;

(all of the foregoing, subject to the limitations set
forth below, the "Subordination Spread Account Proper-
ty"), to have and to hold all the aforesaid property,
rights and privileges unto the Class A Agent, its succes-
sors and assigns, in trust for the uses and purposes, and
subject to the terms and provisions, set forth in this
Section 14.7. The Class A Agent hereby acknowledges such
transfer and accepts the trust hereunder and shall hold
and distribute the Subordination Spread Account Property
in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Section 14.7.

(i) The trust established pursuant
to this Section 14.7 shall not under any
circumstances be deemed to be part of or other-
wise includable in the Trust.

(b) On each Distribution Date, if the
amount of the Subordination Spread Account (after giving
effect to all payments to be made from such Account
pursuant to Section 14.6(d) on such Date) is less than
the Specified Subordination Spread Account Balance for
such Distribution Date, the Servicer shall instruct the
Trustee, after payment of any amounts required to be
distributed to Class A Certificateholders and the
Servicer, to withhold from amounts otherwise distribut-
able to the Class B Certificateholders and not otherwise
distributed to Class A Certificateholders or the Servicer
and deposit in the Subordination Spread Account all such
amounts, or such lesser amounts as are sufficient to
restore the amount in the Subordination Spread Account to
the Specified Subordination Spread Account Balance. For
purposes of calculating the Class B Certificate Balance,
any amounts so deposited will be deemed to have been paid
to the Class B Certificateholders. Subject to Section
14.7(d), if the amount of the Subordination Spread Ac-
count (after taking into account any withdrawals there-
from pursuant to Section 14.7(e)) is greater than the
Specified Subordination Spread Account Balance for such
Distribution Date, the Class A Agent shall upon the
written instruction of the Servicer release to the Trust-
ee and, the Trustee at the instruction of the Servicer,
shall distribute the amount of the excess to the Class B
Certificateholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with
their ownership of the Class B Certificates. Amounts
properly distributed to the Class B Certificateholders
pursuant to this Section 14.7(c), either directly from
the Certificate Account without deposit in the Subordina-
tion Spread Account or from the Subordination Spread
Account, shall be deemed released from the trust estab-
lished by this Section 14.7, and Class B Certificate-
holders shall in no event thereafter be required to
refund any such distributed amounts.

(c) (i) Amounts held in the Subordination
Spread Account shall be invested in the manner
specified in Section 14.1(a), in accordance with written
instructions from the holders of Class B Certificates
evidencing not less than 51% of the Class B Certificate
Balance or their designee, and such investments shall not
be sold or disposed of prior to their maturity. All such
investments shall be made in the name of the Class A
Agent or its nominee and all income and gain realized
thereon shall be solely for the benefit of the Class B
Certificateholders and shall be payable by the Class A
Agent to the Class B Certificateholders on each Distribu-
tion Date.

(ii) With respect to the Subordination
Spread Account Property, the Class B
Certificateholders and the Class A Agent agree
that:

(A) Any Subordination Spread Account
Property that is held in deposit
accounts shall be held solely in the name of
the Class A Agent at one or more depository
institutions having the Required Deposit Rat-
ing. Each such Deposit Account shall be sub-
ject to the exclusive custody and control of
the Class A Agent, and the Class A Agent shall
have sole signature authority with respect
thereto.

(B) Any Subordination Spread Account
Property that constitutes Physical
Property shall be delivered to the Class A
Agent in accordance with paragraph (a) of the
definition of "Delivery" and shall be held,
pending maturity or disposition, solely by the
Class A Agent or a financial intermediary (as
such term is defined in Section 8-313(4) of the
UCC) acting solely for the Class A Agent.

(C) Any Subordination Spread Account
Property that is a book-entry
security held through the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem pursuant to federal book-entry regulations
shall be delivered in accordance with paragraph
(b) of the definition of "Delivery" and shall
be maintained by the Class A Agent, pending
maturity or disposition, through continued
book-entry registration of such Subordination
Spread Account Property as described in such
paragraph.

(D) Any Subordination Spread Account
Property that is an "uncertificated
security" under Article VIII of
the UCC and that is not governed by clause (C)
above shall be delivered to the Class A Agent
in accordance with paragraph (c) of the defini-
tion of "Delivery" and shall be maintained by
the Class A Agent, pending maturity or disposi-
tion, through continued registration of the
Class A Agent's (or its nominee's) ownership of
such security.

(E) Property of a type which is not 
capable of being delivered to the
Class A Agent in accordance with the definition
of "Delivery" shall not constitute Subordina-
tion Spread Account Property.

Effective upon Delivery of any Subordination
Spread Account Property in the form of Physical Property,
book-entry securities, or uncertificated securities, the
Class A Agent shall be deemed to have represented that it
has purchased such Subordination Spread Account Property
for value, in good faith, and without notice of any
adverse claim thereto.

(iii) Investment earnings attributable
to the Subordination Spread Account
Property and proceeds therefrom shall be held
by the Class A Agent for the benefit of the
Class B Certificateholders. Investment earn-
ings attributable to the Subordination Spread
Account Property shall not be available to
satisfy the subordination provisions of this
Agreement and shall not otherwise be subject to
any claims or rights of the Class A Certifi-
cateholders or the Servicer. The Class A Agent
shall cause all investment earnings attribut-
able to the Subordination Spread Account to be
distributed on each Distribution Date to the
Class B Certificateholders. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Subordination Spread Account
may contain at any time uninvested cash in an
amount not to exceed the maximum amount insured
by the FDIC without giving rise to any obliga-
tion to withdraw such cash from the Subordina-
tion Spread Account. Realized losses, if any,
on investment of the Subordination Spread Ac-
count Property shall be charged first against
undistributed investment earnings attributable
to the Subordination Spread Account Property
and then against the Subordination Spread Ac-
count Property.

(iv) The Class A Agent
shall not enter into any subordination or
intercreditor agreement with respect to the
Subordination Spread Account Property.

(d) If the Servicer pursuant to Section
14.4 determines on any Determination Date that it is
required to make an Advance and does not do so from its
own funds, the Servicer shall promptly instruct the Class
A Agent in writing to withdraw funds, in an amount speci-
fied by the Servicer, from the Subordination Spread
Account and deposit them in the Certificate Account
maintained with the Trustee to cover any shortfall. Such
payment shall be deemed to have been made by the Servicer
pursuant to Section 14.4 for purposes of making distri-
butions pursuant to this Agreement, but shall not other-
wise satisfy the Servicer's obligation to deliver the
amount of the Advances to the Class A Agent, and the
Servicer shall within two Business Days replace any funds
in the Subordination Spread Account so used.

(e) Upon termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 21.2, any amounts on deposit in
the Subordination Spread Account shall be paid to the
then holders of the Class B Certificates.

Section 14.8 Net Deposits. For so long as (i)
Ford Motor Credit Company shall be the Servicer, (ii) the
Servicer shall be entitled pursuant to Section 14.2 to
remit collections on a monthly rather than daily basis,
and (iii) the Servicer shall be entitled pursuant to
Section 14.1(b) to retain Payaheads rather than deposit
them in the Payahead Account, Ford Motor Credit Company
(in whatever capacity) may make the remittances pursuant
to Sections 14.2 and 14.5 above, net of amounts to be
distributed to Ford Motor Credit Company (in whatever
capacity) pursuant to Section 14.6(c). Nonetheless, the
Servicer shall account for all of the above described
remittances and distributions except for the Supplemental
Servicing Fee in the Servicer's Certificate as if the
amounts were deposited and/or transferred separately.

Section 14.9 Statements to Class A Certifi-
cateholders. On each Distribution Date, the Trustee
shall include with each distribution to each Class A
Certificateholder, a statement (which statement shall
also be provided to each rating agency then rating the
Class A Certificates) based on information in the
Servicer's Certificate furnished pursuant to Section
13.9, setting forth for the Collection Period relating to
such Distribution Date the following information:

(i) the amount of such distri-
bution allocable to principal;

(ii) the amount of such distri-
bution allocable to interest;

(iii) the Pool Balance as of the
close of business on the last day of the pre-
ceding Collection Period;

(iv) the amount of the Servicing
Fee paid to the Servicer with respect to the
related Collection Period and the Class A
Certificateholder's Class A Percentage of the
Servicing Fee and the amount of any unpaid
Servicing Fees and the change in such amount
from that of the prior Distribution Date;

(v) the amount of the Class A
Principal and Interest Carryover Shortfalls, if
any, on such Distribution Date and the change
in the Class A Principal and Interest Carryover
Shortfalls from the preceding Distribution
Date;

<PAGE>
(vi) the Class A Certificate
Factor and Class B Certificate Balance as of
such Distribution Date;

(vii) the amount otherwise dis-
tributable to the Class B Certificateholders
that is distributed to Class A Certificatehold-
ers on such Distribution Date;

(viii) the balance of the Subordi-
nation Spread Account on such Distribution
Date, after giving effect to distributions made
on such Distribution Date and the change in
such balance from the preceding Distribution
Date;

(ix) the aggregate Payahead
Balance and the change in such balance from the
preceding Distribution Date; and

(x) the amount of Advances on
such Distribution Date.

Each amount set forth pursuant to subclauses (i), (ii),
(iv) or (v) above shall be expressed as a dollar amount
per $1,000 of original principal balance of a Class A
Certificate.

Within the prescribed period of time for tax
reporting purposes after the end of each calendar year
during the term of the Agreement, the Trustee shall mail,
to each Person who at any time during such calendar year
shall have been a holder of a Class A Certificate, a
statement containing the sum of the amounts set forth in
clauses (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) and such other informa-
tion, if any, as the Servicer determines is necessary to
ascertain the Class A Certificateholder's share of the
gross income and deductions of the Trust (exclusive of
the Supplemental Servicing Fee), for such calendar year
or, in the event such Person shall have been a holder of
a Class A Certificate during a portion of such calendar
year, for the applicable portion of such year, for the
purposes of such Certificateholder's preparation of
federal income tax returns.

Certificates shall be issued in denominations of $1,000;
the Class B Certificates shall be issued in denominations
of $100,000 or in any amount in excess thereof each in
fully registered form and integral multiples thereof;
provided, however, that one Class A Certificate and one

when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized
to sign on behalf of the Trust, shall be valid and bind-
ing obligations of the Trust, notwithstanding that such
individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so
authorized prior to the authentication and delivery of
such Certificates or did not hold such offices at the
date of such Certificates.

Section 16.2 Authentication of Certificates. 
The Trustee shall cause the Certificates to be executed
on behalf of the Trust, authenticated, and delivered to
or upon the written order of the Seller, signed by its
chairman of the board, its president, or any vice presi-
dent, without further corporate action by the Seller, in
authorized denominations, pursuant to the Agreement. No
Certificate shall entitle its holder to any benefit under
the Agreement, or shall be valid for any purpose, unless
there shall appear on such Certificate a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form set forth in
Exhibit A or Exhibit B hereto executed by the Trustee by
manual signature; such authentication shall constitute
conclusive evidence that such Certificate shall have been
duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Certifi-
cates shall be dated the date of their authentication.

Section 16.3 Registration of Transfer and
Exchange of Certificates. The Certificate Registrar
shall keep or cause to be kept, at the office or agency
maintained pursuant to Section 16.7, a Certificate Regis-
ter in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as
it may prescribe, the Trustee shall provide for the
registration of Certificates and of transfers and ex-
changes of Certificates as herein provided. The Trustee
shall be the initial Certificate Registrar.

The Class B Certificates shall initially be
retained by the Seller. No transfer of a Class B Certif-
icate shall be made unless the registration requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any appli-
cable State securities laws are complied with, or such
transfer is exempt from the registration requirements
under said Act and laws. In the event that a transfer is
to be made in reliance upon an exemption from said Act or
laws, the Class B Certificateholder desiring to effect
such transfer and such Certificateholder's prospective
transferee must each certify in writing to the Seller and
the Trustee the facts surrounding such transfer and
provide both the Seller and the Trustee with a written
Opinion of Counsel in form and substance satisfactory to
the Seller and the Trustee that such transfer may be made
pursuant to an exemption from said Act or laws, which
Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Seller
or the Trustee. Neither the Seller nor the Trustee is
under an obligation to register the Class B Certificates
under said Act or any other securities law.

No transfer of a Class B Certificate shall be
made unless the Class B Certificateholder desiring to
effect such transfer shall have given each rating agency
requested by the Seller or an affiliate to rate the Class
A Certificates and which then has an outstanding rating
thereon, the Seller and the Trustee prior written notice
of such proposed transfer, and such rating agencies shall
have notified such Class B Certificateholder, the Seller
and the Trustee, in writing, that such proposed transfer
will not result in the qualification, downgrading or
withdrawal of the rating then assigned to the Class A
Certificates by such rating agencies.

In addition to the restrictions on transfer of
Class B Certificates set forth in the two immediately
preceding paragraphs, no transfer of a Class B Certifi-
cate shall be made unless prior to such transfer the
Holder of such Class B Certificate delivers to the Seller
and the Trustee either a ruling of the Internal Revenue
Service or an Opinion of Counsel, which shall be indepen-
dent outside counsel, satisfactory to the Trustee and
each rating agency requested by the Seller or an affili-
ate to rate the Class A Certificates and which has an
outstanding rating thereon in either case to the effect
that the proposed transfer (x) will not result in the
arrangement contemplated by this Agreement being treated
as an association taxable as a corporation under either
(I) the Code, as from time to time in force or (II) the
tax laws of the State of New York and (y) will not have
any adverse effect on the Federal income taxation of the
Trust or the Class A Certificateholders. The Class B
Certificate shall not be transferred separately from the
right to receive all amounts in the Subordination Spread
Account, unless the ruling of the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice or the Opinion of Counsel referred to in the preced-
ing sentence would permit such transfer.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of
any Certificate at the Corporate Trust Office, the Trust-
ee shall execute, authenticate, and deliver, in the name
of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more
new Certificates in authorized denominations of a like
aggregate amount dated the date of authentication by the
Trustee. At the option of a Holder, Certificates may be
exchanged for other Certificates of authorized denomina-
tions of a like aggregate amount upon surrender of the
Certificates to be exchanged at the Corporate Trust
Office.

Every Certificate presented or surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied
by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory
to the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly execut-
ed by the holder or his attorney duly authorized in
writing. Each Certificate surrendered for registration
of transfer and exchange shall be cancelled and subse-
quently disposed of by the Trustee.

No service charge shall be made for any regis-
tration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the
Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

Section 16.4 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost, or
Stolen Certificates. If (a) any mutilated Certificate
shall be surrendered to the Certificate Registrar, or if
the Certificate Registrar shall receive evidence to its
satisfaction of the destruction, loss, or theft of any
Certificate and (b) there shall be delivered to the
Certificate Registrar and the Trustee such security or
indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them
harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Certif-
icate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser,
the Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for
or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost, or
stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like tenor and
denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new
Certificate under this Section 16.4, the Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any dupli-
cate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 16.4
shall constitute conclusive evidence of ownership in the
Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost,
stolen, or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any
time.

Section 16.5 Persons Deemed Owners. The
Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person
in whose name any Certificate shall be registered as the
owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving
distributions pursuant to Section 14.6 and for all other
purposes whatsoever, and neither the Trustee nor the
Certificate Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the
contrary.

Section 16.6 Access to List of Certificate-
holders' Names and Addresses. The Trustee shall furnish
or cause to be furnished to the Servicer, within 15 days
after receipt by the Trustee of a request therefor from
the Servicer in writing, a list, in such form as the
Servicer may reasonably require, of the names and ad-
dresses of the Certificateholders as of the most recent
Record Date. If three or more Certificateholders, or one
or more Holders of Class A Certificates aggregating not
less than 25% of the Class A Certificate Balance, apply
in writing to the Trustee, and such application states
that the applicants desire to communicate with other
Certificateholders of such Class with respect to their
rights under the Agreement or under the Certificates and
such application shall be accompanied by a copy of the
communication that such applicants propose to transmit,
then the Trustee shall, within five Business Days after
the receipt for such application, request from the Clear-
ing Agency and make available to such Certificateholders
access during normal business hours to the current list
of Certificateholders. Each Holder, by receiving and
holding a Certificate, shall be deemed to have agreed to
hold neither the Servicer nor the Trustee accountable by
reason of the disclosure of its name and address, regard-
less of the source from which such information was de-
rived.

Section 16.7 Maintenance of Office or Agency. 
The Trustee shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York, an office or offices or agency or
agencies where Certificates may be surrendered for regis-
tration of transfer or exchange and where notices and
demands to or upon the Trustee in respect of the Certifi-
cates and the Agreement may be served. The Trustee
initially designates the Corporate Trust Office as speci-
fied in the Agreement as its office for such purposes. 
The Trustee shall give prompt written notice to the
Servicer and to Certificateholders of any change in the
location of the Certificate Register or any such office
or agency.

Section 16.8 Book-Entry Certificates. The
Class A Certificates, upon original issuance, (except for
the Residual Certificate) will be issued in the form of
typewritten Certificates representing the Book-Entry
Certificates, to be delivered to The Depository Trust
Company, the initial Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf
of, the Seller. The Class A Certificates delivered to
The Depository Trust Company shall initially be regis-
tered on the Certificate Register in the name of CEDE &
Co., the nominee of the initial Clearing Agency, and no
Certificate Owner will receive a definitive certificate
representing such Certificate Owner's interest in the
Class A Certificates, except as provided in Section
16.10. Unless and until definitive, fully registered
Class A Certificates (the "Definitive Certificates") have
been issued to Certificate Owners pursuant to Section
16.10:

(i) the provisions of this
Section 16.8 shall be in full force and effect;

(ii) the Seller, the Servicer,
the Certificate Registrar, and the Trustee may
deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes
(including the making of distributions on the
Class A Certificates) as the authorized repre-
sentative of the Certificate Owners;

(iii) to the extent that the
provisions of this Section 16.8 conflict with
any other provisions of this Agreement, the
provisions of this Section 16.8 shall control;

(iv) the rights of Certificate
Owners shall be exercised only through the
Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those
established by law and agreements between such
Certificate Owners and the Clearing Agency
and/or the Clearing Agency Participants. Pur-
suant to the Depository Agreement, unless and
until Definitive Certificates are issued pursu-
ant to Section 16.10, the initial Clearing
Agency will make book-entry transfers among the
Clearing Agency Participants and receive and
transmit distributions of principal and inter-
est on the Class A Certificates to such Clear-
ing Agency Participants; and

(v) whenever this Agreement
requires or permits actions to be taken based
upon instructions or directions of Holders of
Class A Certificates evidencing a specified
percentage of the Class A Certificate Balance
the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to repre-
sent such percentage only to the extent that it
has received instructions to such effect from
Certificate Owners and/or Clearing Agency Par-
ticipants owning or representing, respectively,
such required percentage of the beneficial
interest in Class A Certificates and has deliv-
ered such instructions to the Trustee.

Section 16.9 Notices to Clearing Agency. 
Whenever notice or other communication to the Class A
Certificateholders is required under this Agreement,
other than to the Holder of the Residual Certificate,
unless and until Definitive Certificates shall have been
issued to Certificate Owners pursuant to Section 16.10,
the Trustee and the Servicer shall give all such notices
and communications specified herein to be given to Hold-
ers of the Class A Certificates to the Clearing Agency.

Section 16.10 Definitive Certificates. If
(i)(A) the Seller advises the Trustee in writing that the
Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to properly
discharge its responsibilities under the Depository
Agreement, and (B) the Trustee or the Seller is unable to
locate a qualified successor, (ii) the Seller at its
option, advises the Trustee in writing that it elects to
terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing
Agency, or (iii) after the occurrence of an Event of
Default, Certificate Owners representing beneficial
interests aggregating not less than 51% of the Class A
Certificate Balance advise the Trustee and the Clearing
Agency through the Clearing Agency Participants in writ-
ing that the continuation of a book-entry system through
the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best interests of
the Certificate Owners, then the Trustee shall notify the
Clearing Agency and request that the Clearing Agency
notify all Certificate Owners of the occurrence of any
such event and of the availability of Definitive Certifi-
cates to Certificate Owners requesting the same and that
the Record Date for any Distribution Date subsequent to
the issuance of Definitive Certificates will be the last
day of the Collection Period immediately preceding the
month in which such Distribution Date occurs. Prior to
the issuance of Definitive Certificates, the Trustee
shall provide written notice to The First Boston Corpora-
tion, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and
Salomon Brothers Inc that, upon the issuance of Defini-
tive Certificates, the Record Date for any Distribution
Date will be the last day of the Collection Period imme-
diately preceding the month in which such Distribution
Date occurs. Upon surrender to the Trustee of the Class
A Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by
registration instructions from the Clearing Agency for
registration, the Trustee shall issue the Definitive
Certificates and deliver such Definitive Certificates in
accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. 
Neither the Seller, the Certificate Registrar nor the
Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such
instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the
issuance of Definitive Certificates, the Trustee shall
recognize the Holders of the Definitive Certificates as
Certificateholders hereunder. The Trustee shall not be
liable if the Trustee or the Seller is unable to locate a
qualified successor Clearing Agency.

corporation or by-laws of the Seller, or any
indenture, agreement, or other instrument to

and reciting the details of such filings, or (B) stating
that, in the opinion of such Counsel, no such action
shall be necessary to preserve and protect such interest. 
The Seller shall provide notice of any merger, consolida-
tion, or succession pursuant to this Section 17.3 to each
rating agency then providing a rating for the Certifi-
cates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the execution of the foregoing agreement or assumption
and compliance with clauses (x) or (y) above shall be
conditions to the consummation of the transactions re-
ferred to in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) above.

and Others. The Seller and any director or officer or
employee or agent of the Seller may rely in good faith on
the advice of counsel or on any document of any kind,
prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person

shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prose-
cute, or defend any legal action that shall not be inci-
dental to its obligations under the Agreement, and that
in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liabili-
ty.

Section 17.5 Seller May Own Certificates. The
Seller and any Person controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with the Seller may in its individu-
al or any other capacity become the owner or pledgee of
Certificates with the same rights as it would have if it

otherwise provided in the definition of "Certificatehold-
er" specified in Section 11.1 and except as otherwise
specifically provided herein. Certificates so owned by
or pledged to the Seller or such controlling or commonly
controlled Person shall have an equal and proportionate
benefit under the provisions of the Agreement, without
preference, priority, or distinction as among all of the
Certificates.

In addition to the foregoing indemnities, if

ment, such Servicer shall be deemed to be the Servicer

Motor Credit Company (or any successor thereto pursuant
to Section 18.3) as Servicer, with respect to the period

survive the termination of such Person as Servicer or a
resignation by such Person as Servicer as well as the

able fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of litiga-
tion. If the Servicer shall have made any indemnity
payments pursuant to this Section and the recipient

Section 18.3 Merger or Consolidation of, or
Assumption of the Obligations of, Servicer. Any Person
(i) into which the Servicer may be merged or consolidat-
ed, (ii) resulting from any merger, conversion, or con-
solidation to which the Servicer shall be a party, or
(iii) succeeding to the business of the Servicer, or so
long as Ford Motor Credit Company acts as Servicer, any
corporation more than 50% of the voting stock of which is
owned directly or indirectly by Ford Motor Company, which
corporation in any of the foregoing cases executes an
agreement of assumption to perform every obligation of
the Servicer under this Agreement, will be the successor
to the Servicer under this Agreement without the execu-
tion or filing of any paper or any further act on the
part of any of the parties to this Agreement; provided,
however, that (x) the Servicer shall have delivered to
the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel each stating that such consolidation, merger or
succession and such agreement of assumption comply with
this Section 18.3 and that all conditions precedent
provided for in the Agreement relating to such transac-
tion have been complied with and (y) the Servicer shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel

such Counsel, no such action shall be necessary to pre-
serve and protect such interest. The Servicer shall

pursuant to this Section 18.3 to each rating agency then
providing a rating for the Certificates. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the execution of the
foregoing agreement or assumption and compliance with
clauses (x) or (y) above shall be conditions to the
consummation of the transactions referred to in clauses
(i), (ii), or (iii) above.

Section 18.4 Limitation on Liability of
Servicer and Others. Neither the Servicer nor any of the
directors or officers or employees or agents of the
Servicer shall be under any liability to the Trust or the
Certificateholders, except as provided under the Agree-
ment, for any action taken or for refraining from the
taking of any action pursuant to the Agreement or for
errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provi-
sion shall not protect the Servicer or any such person
against any liability that would otherwise be imposed by
reason of willful misfeasance or bad faith in the perfor-
mance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of
obligations and duties under the Agreement, or by reason
of negligence in the performance of its duties under the
Agreement (except for errors in judgment). The Servicer
and any director, officer or employee or agent of the
Servicer may rely in good faith on any Opinion of Counsel
or on any Officer's Certificate or certificate of audi-
tors believed to be genuine and to have been signed by
the proper party in respect of any matters arising under
this Agreement.

Except as provided in the Agreement, the
Servicer shall not be under any obligation to appear in,
prosecute, or defend any legal action that shall not be
incidental to its duties to service the Receivables in
accordance with the Agreement, and that in its opinion
may involve it in any expense or liability; provided,
however, that the Servicer may undertake any reasonable
action that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect
of the Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties
to the Agreement and the interests of the Certificate-
holders under the Agreement. In such event, the legal
expenses and costs of such action and any liability
resulting therefrom shall be expenses, costs, and liabil-
ities of the Servicer.

Section 18.5 Delegation of Duties. So long as
Ford Motor Credit Company acts as Servicer, the Servicer
may at any time without notice or consent delegate sub-
stantially all its duties under this Agreement to any
corporation more than 50% of the voting stock of which is
owned, directly or indirectly, by Ford Motor Company. 
The Servicer may at any time perform specific duties as
servicer under the Agreement through sub-contractors;
provided that no such delegation or subcontracting shall
relieve the Servicer of its responsibilities with respect
to such duties as to which the Servicer shall remain
primarily responsible with respect thereto.

Default

Section 19.1 Events of Default. If any one of
the following events ("Events of Default") shall occur
and be continuing:

(i) Any failure by the Servicer
to deliver to the Trustee for distribution to
Certificateholders or deposit in the Subordina-
tion Spread Account any proceeds or payment
required to be so delivered under the terms of
the Certificates and the Agreement that shall
continue unremedied for a period of three Busi-
ness Days after written notice of such failure
is received by the Servicer from the Trustee or
after discovery of such failure by an officer
of the Servicer; or 

(ii) Failure on the part of the
Servicer or the Seller duly to observe or to
perform in any material respect any other cove-
nants or agreements of the Servicer or the
Seller (as the case may be) set forth in the
Certificates or in the Agreement, which failure
shall (a) materially and adversely affect the
rights of Certificateholders and (b) continue
unremedied for a period of 90 days after the
date on which written notice of such failure,
requiring the same to be remedied, shall have
been given (1) to the Servicer or the Seller
(as the case may be), by the Trustee, or (2) to
the Servicer or the Seller (as the case may
be), and to the Trustee by the Holders of Class
A Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of
the Class A Certificate Balance; or

(iii) The entry of a decree or
order by a court or agency or supervisory au-
thority having jurisdiction in the premises for
the appointment of a conservator, receiver, or
liquidator for the Servicer in any insolvency,
readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and
liabilities, or similar proceedings, or for the
winding up or liquidation of its respective
affairs, and the continuance of any such decree
or order unstayed and in effect for a period of
90 consecutive days; or 

(iv) The consent by the Servicer
to the appointment of a conservator or receiver
or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment
of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities,
or similar proceedings of or relating to the
Servicer of or relating to substantially all of
its property; or the Servicer shall admit in
writing its inability to pay its debts general-
ly as they become due, file a petition to take
advantage of any applicable insolvency or reor-
ganization statute, make an assignment for the
benefit of its creditors, or voluntarily sus-
pend payment of its obligations;

then, and in each and every case, so long as an Event of
Default shall not have been remedied, either the Trustee,
or the Holders of the Class A Certificates evidencing not
less than 51% of the Class A Certificate Balance, by
notice then given in writing to the Servicer (and to the
Trustee if given by the Certificateholders) (with a copy
to each rating agency requested to provide a rating on
the Certificates) may terminate all of the rights and
obligations of the Servicer under the Agreement. On or
after the receipt by the Servicer of such written notice,
all authority and power of the Servicer under the Agree-
ment, whether with respect to the Certificates or the
Receivables or otherwise, shall, without further action,
pass to and be vested in the Trustee or such successor
Servicer as may be appointed under Section 19.2; and,
without limitation, the Trustee is hereby authorized and
empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the prede-
cessor Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any
and all documents and other instruments, and to do or
accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appro-
priate to effect the purposes of such notice of termina-
tion, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement of
the Receivables and related documents, or otherwise. 

The predecessor Servicer shall cooperate with
the successor Servicer and the Trustee in effecting the
termination of the responsibilities and rights of the
predecessor Servicer under the Agreement, including the
transfer to the successor Servicer for administration by
it of all cash amounts that shall at the time be held by
the predecessor Servicer for deposit, or shall thereafter
be received with respect to a Receivable and the delivery
of the Receivable Files, and the related accounts and re-
cords maintained by the Servicer. All reasonable costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in
connection with transferring the Receivable Files to the
successor Servicer and amending the Agreement to reflect
such succession as Servicer pursuant to this Section 19.1
shall be paid by the predecessor Servicer upon presenta-
tion of reasonable documentation of such costs and ex-
penses.

<PAGE>
Section 19.2 Appointment of Successor. 

(a) Upon the Servicer's receipt of notice of termination
pursuant to Section 19.1 or the Servicer's resignation in
accordance with the terms of the Agreement, the predeces-
sor Servicer shall continue to perform its functions as
Servicer under the Agreement, in the case of termination,
only until the date specified in such termination notice
or, if no such date is specified in a notice of termina-
tion, until receipt of such notice and, in the case of
resignation, until the later of (x) the date 45 days from
the delivery to the Trustee of written notice of such
resignation (or written confirmation of such notice) in
accordance with the terms of the Agreement and (y) the
date upon which the predecessor Servicer shall become un-
able to act as Servicer, as specified in the notice of
resignation and accompanying Opinion of Counsel. In the
event of the Servicer's resignation or termination here-
under, the Trustee shall appoint a successor Servicer,
and the successor Servicer shall accept its appointment
by a written assumption in form acceptable to the Trust-
ee. In the event that a successor Servicer has not been
appointed at the time when the predecessor Servicer has
ceased to act as Servicer in accordance with this Section
19.2, the Trustee without further action shall automati-
cally be appointed the successor Servicer. Notwith-
standing the above, the Trustee shall, if it shall be le-
gally unable so to act, appoint, or petition a court of
competent jurisdiction to appoint, any established insti-
tution, having a net worth of not less than $100,000,000
and whose regular business shall include the servicing of
automotive receivables, as the successor to the Servicer
under the Agreement.

(b) Upon appointment, the successor
Servicer shall be the successor in all respects to the
predecessor Servicer and shall be subject to all the
responsibilities, duties, and liabilities arising there-
after relating thereto placed on the predecessor
Servicer, and shall be entitled to the Servicer Fees and
all of the rights granted to the predecessor Servicer, by
the terms and provisions of the Agreement.

(c) In connection with such appointment,
the Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensa-
tion of such successor Servicer out of payments on Re-
ceivables as it and such successor Servicer shall agree;
provided, however, that no such compensation shall be in
excess of that permitted the predecessor Servicer under
the Agreement. The Trustee and such successor Servicer
shall take such action, consistent with the Agreement, as
shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.

Section 19.3 Repayment of Advances. If the
identity of the Servicer shall change, the predecessor
Servicer shall be entitled to receive to the extent of
available funds reimbursement for Outstanding Advances
pursuant to Section 14.3 and 14.4, in the manner speci-
fied in Section 14.6, with respect to all Advances made
by the predecessor Servicer.

Section 19.4 Notification to Certificatehold-
ers. Upon any termination of, or appointment of a suc-
cessor to, the Servicer pursuant to this Article XIX, the
Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to
Certificateholders at their respective addresses appear-
ing in the Certificate Register and to each of the rating
agencies then rating the Certificates.

Section 19.5 Waiver of Past Defaults. The
Holders of Class A Certificates evidencing not less than
51% of the Class A Certificate Balance may, on behalf of
all Holders of Certificates, waive any default by the
Servicer in the performance of its obligations hereunder
and its consequences, except a default in making any
required deposits to or payments from the Collection
Account or the Certificate Account in accordance with the
Agreement. Upon any such waiver of a past default, such
default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default
arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied
for every purpose of the Agreement. No such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any
right consequent thereon.

ARTICLE XX

The Trustee

Section 20.1 Duties of Trustee. The Trustee,
both prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and
after an Event of Default shall have been cured or
waived, shall undertake to perform such duties as are
specifically set forth in the Agreement. If an Event of
Default shall have occurred and shall not have been cured
or waived and, in the case of an Event of Default de-
scribed in Section 19.1, the Trustee has received notice
of such Event of Default pursuant to Section 13.10(b),
the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers
vested in it by the Agreement, and shall use the same
degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent
person would exercise or use under the circumstances in
the conduct of his own affairs; provided, however, that
if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the Servicer
pursuant to Section 19.2, the Trustee in performing such
duties shall use the degree of skill and attention cus-
tomarily exercised by a servicer with respect to automo-
bile receivables that it services for itself or others.

The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions,
certificates, statements, opinions, reports, documents,
orders, or other instruments furnished to the Trustee
that shall be specifically required to be furnished
pursuant to any provision of the Agreement, shall examine
them to determine whether they conform to the require-
ments of the Agreement.

The Trustee shall take and maintain custody of
the Schedule of Receivables included as an exhibit to the
Agreement and shall retain all Servicer's Certificates
identifying Receivables that become Purchased Receiv-
ables.

No provision of the Agreement shall be con-
strued to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own
negligent action, its own negligent failure to act (other
than errors in judgment), or its own bad faith; provided,
however, that:

(i) Prior to the occurrence of
an Event of Default, and after the curing or
waiving of all such Events of Default that may
have occurred, the duties and obligations of
the Trustee shall be determined solely by the
express provisions of the Agreement, the Trust-
ee shall not be liable except for the perfor-
mance of such duties and obligations as shall
be specifically set forth in the Agreement, no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read
into the Agreement against the Trustee and, in
the absence of bad faith on the part of the
Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely on
the truth of the statements and the correctness
of the opinions expressed upon any certificates
or opinions furnished to the Trustee and con-
forming to the requirements of the Agreement;

(ii) The Trustee shall not be
liable for an error of judgment made in good
faith by a Trustee Officer, unless it shall be
proved that the Trustee shall have been negli-
gent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

(iii) The Trustee shall not be
liable with respect to any action taken, suf-
fered, or omitted to be taken in good faith in
accordance with the Agreement or at the direc-
tion of the Holders of Class A Certificates
evidencing not less than 25% of the Class A
Certificate Balance relating to the time, meth-
od, and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee, or exer-
cising any trust or power conferred upon the
Trustee, under the Agreement;

(iv) The Trustee shall not be
charged with knowledge of any failure by the
Servicer to comply with the obligations of the
Servicer referred to in Section 19.1, or of any
failure by the Seller to comply with the obli-
gations of the Seller referred to in Section
19.1, unless a Trustee Officer assigned to the
Trustee's Corporate Trust Department obtains
actual knowledge of such failure (it being
understood that knowledge of the Servicer or
the Servicer as custodian, in its capacity as
agent for the Trustee, is not attributable to
the Trustee) or the Trustee receives written
notice of such failure from the Servicer or the
Seller, as the case may be, or the Holders of
Class A Certificates evidencing not less than
25% of the Class A Certificate Balance; and

(v) Without limiting the gener-
ality of this Section or Section 20.4, the
Trustee shall have no duty (i) to see to any
recording, filing, or depositing of the Agree-
ment, any agreement referred to therein, or any
financing statement or continuation statement
evidencing a security interest in the Receiv-
ables or the Financed Vehicles, or to see to
the maintenance of any such recording, filing,
or depositing or to any rerecording, refiling
or redepositing of any thereof, (ii) to see to
any insurance of the Financed Vehicles or
Obligors or to effect or maintain any such
insurance, (iii) to see to the payment or dis-
charge of any tax, assessment, or other govern-
mental charge or any Lien or encumbrance of any
kind owing with respect to, assessed or levied
against, any part of the Trust, (iv) to confirm
or verify the contents of any reports or cer-
tificates of the Servicer delivered to the
Trustee pursuant to the Agreement believed by
the Trustee to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or
parties, or (v) to inspect the Financed Vehi-
cles at any time or ascertain or inquire as to
the performance or observance of any of the
Seller's or the Servicer's representations,
warranties, or covenants or the Servicer's
duties and obligations as Servicer and as cus-
todian of the Receivable Files under the Agree-
ment.

The Trustee shall not be required to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability
in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in
the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there
shall be reasonable ground for believing that the repay-
ment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such
risk or liability shall not be reasonably assured to it,
and none of the provisions contained in the Agreement
shall in any event require the Trustee to perform, or be
responsible for the manner of performance of, any of the
obligations of the Servicer under the Agreement except
during such time, if any, as the Trustee shall be the
successor to, and be vested with the rights, duties,
powers, and privileges of, the Servicer in accordance
with the terms of the Agreement.

Section 20.2 Trustee's Certificate. Upon request
of the Seller or Servicer, on or as soon as practicable
after each Distribution Date on which Receivables
shall be assigned to the Seller or the Servicer, as
applicable, pursuant to Section 20.3, the Trustee shall
execute a Trustee's Certificate (in the form of Exhibit
D-1 or D-2, as applicable), based on the information con-
tained in the Servicer's Certificate for the related
Collection Period, amounts deposited to the Certificate
Account and notices received pursuant to the Agreement,
identifying the Receivables repurchased by the Seller
pursuant to Section 12.2 or purchased by the Servicer
pursuant to Section 13.7 or 21.2 during such Collection
Period, and shall deliver such Trustee's Certificate,
accompanied by a copy of the Servicer's Certificate for
such Collection Period to the Seller or the Servicer, as
the case may be. The Trustee's Certificate submitted
with respect to such Distribution Date shall operate, as
of such Distribution Date, as an assignment, without
recourse, representation, or warranty, to the Seller or
the Servicer, as the case may be, of all the Trustee's
right, title, and interest in and to such repurchased
Receivable, and all security and documents relating
thereto, such assignment being an assignment outright and
not for security.

Section 20.3 Trustee's Assignment of Purchased
Receivables. With respect to all Receivables repurchased
by the Seller pursuant to Section 12.2 or purchased by
the Servicer pursuant to Section 13.7 or 21.2, the Trust-
ee shall by a Trustee's Certificate (in the form of
Exhibit D-1 or D-2, as applicable) assign, without re-
course, representation, or warranty, to the Seller or the
Servicer (as the case may be) all the Trustee's right,
title, and interest in and to such Receivables, and all
security and documents relating thereto.

Section 20.4 Certain Matters Affecting Trustee.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 20.1:

(i) The Trustee may rely and
shall be protected in acting or refraining from
acting upon any resolution, Officer's Certifi-
cate, Servicer's Certificate, certificate of
auditors, or any other certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
consent, order, appraisal, bond, or other paper
or document believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper
party or parties.

(ii) The Trustee may consult
with counsel and any Opinion of Counsel shall
be full and complete authorization and protec-
tion in respect of any action taken or suffered
or omitted by it under the Agreement in good
faith and in accordance with such Opinion of
Counsel.

(iii) The Trustee shall be under
no obligation to exercise any of the rights or
powers vested in it by the Agreement, or to
institute, conduct, or defend any litigation
under the Agreement or in relation to the
Agreement, at the request, order, or direction
of any of the Certificateholders pursuant to
the provisions of the Agreement, unless such
Certificateholders shall have offered to the
Trustee reasonable security or indemnity
against the costs, expenses, and liabilities
that may be incurred therein or thereby; noth-
ing contained in the Agreement, however, shall
relieve the Trustee of the obligations, upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default (that
shall not have been cured or waived), to exer-
cise such of the rights and powers vested in it
by the Agreement, and to use the same degree of
care and skill in their exercise as a prudent
man would exercise or use under the circum-
stances in the conduct of his own affairs.

(iv) The Trustee shall not be
liable for any action taken, suffered or omit-
ted by it in good faith and reasonably believed
by it to be authorized or within the discretion
or rights or powers conferred upon it by the
Agreement.

(v) Prior to the occurrence of
an Event of Default and after the curing or
waiving of all Events of Default that may have
occurred, the Trustee shall not be bound to
make any investigation into the facts of mat-
ters stated in any resolution, certificate,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
request, consent, order, approval, bond, or
other paper or document, unless requested in
writing so to do by Holders of Class A Certif-
icates evidencing not less than 25% of the -
Class A Certificate Balance; provided, however,
that if the payment within a reasonable time to
the Trustee of the costs, expenses, or liabili-
ties likely to be incurred by it in the making
of such investigation shall be, in the opinion
of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the
Trustee by the security afforded to it by the
terms of the Agreement, the Trustee may require
reasonable indemnity against such cost, ex-
pense, or liability as a condition to so pro-
ceeding. The reasonable expense of every such
examination shall be paid by the Servicer or,
if paid by the Trustee, shall be reimbursed by
the Servicer upon demand. Nothing in this
clause (v) shall affect the obligation of the
Servicer to observe any applicable law prohib-
iting disclosure of information regarding the
Obligors.

(vi) The Trustee may execute any
of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform
any duties under the Agreement either directly
or by or through agents or attorneys or a cus-
todian. The Trustee shall not be responsible
for any misconduct or negligence of any such
agent or custodian appointed with due care by
it hereunder or of the Servicer in its capacity
as Servicer or custodian.

(vii) Subsequent to the sale of
the Receivables by the Seller to the Trustee,
the Trustee shall have no duty of independent
inquiry, except as may be required by Section
20.1, and the Trustee may rely upon the repre-
sentations and warranties and covenants of the
Seller and the Servicer contained in the Agree-
ment with respect to the Receivables and the
Receivable Files.

Section 20.5 Trustee Not Liable for Certifi-
cates or Receivables. The recitals contained herein and
in the Certificates (other than the certificate of au-
thentication on the Certificates) shall be taken as the
statements of the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may
be, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the
correctness thereof. The Trustee shall make no represen-
tations as to the validity or sufficiency of the Agree-
ment or of the Certificates (other than the certificate
of authentication on the Certificates), or of any Receiv-
able or related document. The Trustee shall at no time
have any responsibility or liability for or with respect
to the legality, validity, and enforceability of any
security interest in any Financed Vehicle or any Receiv-
able, or the perfection and priority of such a security
interest or the maintenance of any such perfection and
priority, or for or with respect to the efficacy of the
Trust or its ability to generate the payments to be
distributed to Certificateholders under the Agreement,
including, without limitation: the existence, condition,
location, and ownership of any Financed Vehicle; the
review of any Receivable File therefor; the existence and
enforceability of any physical damage insurance thereon;
the existence and contents of any Receivable or any
Receivable File or any computer or other record thereof;
the validity of the assignment of any Receivable to the
Trust or of any intervening assignment; the completeness
of any Receivable or any Receivable File; the performance
or enforcement of any Receivable; the compliance by the
Seller or the Servicer with any warranty or representa-
tion made under the Agreement or in any related document
and the accuracy of any such warranty or representation
prior to the Trustee's receipt of notice or other discov-
ery of any noncompliance therewith or any breach thereof;
any investment of monies by the Servicer or any loss
resulting therefrom (it being understood that the Trustee
shall remain responsible for any Trust property that it
may hold); the acts or omissions of the Seller, the
Servicer, or any Obligor; an action of the Servicer taken
in the name of the Trustee; or any action by the Trustee
taken at the instruction of the Servicer; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not relieve the Trustee
of its obligation to perform its duties under the Agree-
ment. Except with respect to a claim based on the fail-
ure of the Trustee to perform its duties under the Agree-
ment or based on the Trustee's negligence or willful
misconduct, no recourse shall be had for any claim based
on any provision of the Agreement, the Certificates, or
any Receivable or assignment thereof against the Trustee
in its individual capacity, the Trustee shall not have
any personal obligation, liability, or duty whatsoever to
any Certificateholder or any other Person with respect to
any such claim, and any such claim shall be asserted
solely against the Trust or any indemnitor who shall
furnish indemnity as provided in the Agreement. The
Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or applica-
tion by the Seller of any of the Certificates or of the
proceeds of such Certificates, or for the use or applica-
tion of any funds paid to the Servicer in respect of the
Receivables. Any obligation of the Trustee to give any
notice or statement to any rating agency hereunder shall
constitute only a best efforts obligation and such notice
or statement shall be so provided only as a matter of
courtesy and accommodation, the Trustee having no liabil-
ity to any rating agency or any other Person for any
failure to so provide such notice or statement. The
Trustee may rely on the accuracy of such certification
until it receives from the Seller an Officer's Certifi-
cate superseding such certification.

Section 20.6 Trustee May Own Certificates. 
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may
become the owner or pledgee of Certificates and may deal
with the Seller and the Servicer in banking transactions
with the same rights as it would have if it were not
Trustee.

Section 20.7 Trustee's Fees and Expenses. The
Servicer shall pay to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall
be entitled to, reasonable compensation (which shall not
be limited by any provision of law in regard to the
compensation of a trustee of an express trust) for all
services rendered by it in the execution of the trusts
created by the Agreement and in the exercise and perfor-
mance of any of the Trustee's powers and duties under the
Agreement, and the Servicer, shall pay or reimburse the
Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements, and advances (including the reasonable
compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its
counsel and of all persons not regularly in its employ)
incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any
provisions of the Agreement except any such expense,
disbursement, or advance as may be attributable to its
willful misfeasance, negligence, or bad faith, and the
Servicer shall indemnify the Trustee for, and hold it
harmless against any loss, liability, or expense incurred
without willful misfeasance, negligence, or bad faith on
its part, arising out of or in connection with the accep-
tance or administration of the Trust, including the costs
and expenses of defending itself against any claim or
liability in connection with the exercise or performance
of any of its powers or duties under the Agreement. 
Additionally, the Seller, pursuant to Section 17.2, and
the Servicer, pursuant to Section 18.2, respectively,
shall indemnify the Trustee with respect to certain
matters, and Certificateholders, pursuant to Section
20.04 shall, upon the circumstances therein set forth,
indemnify the Trustee under certain circumstances. The
provisions of this Section 20.7 shall survive the termi-
nation of this Agreement.

Section 20.8 Indemnity of Trustee and Class A
Agent. The Trustee shall be indemnified by the Servicer
and held harmless against any loss, liability, fee,
disbursement, or expense (including any compensation or
expense referred to in Section 20.7) arising out of or
incurred in connection with the acceptance or performance
of the trusts and duties contained in the Agreement to
the extent that (i) the Trustee shall not be entitled to
indemnity for such loss, liability, fee, disbursement, or
expense by the Seller pursuant to Section 17.2 or Section
20.7, the Servicer pursuant to Section 18.2, or the
Certificateholders pursuant to Section 20.4; (ii) such
loss, liability, fee, disbursement, or expense shall not
have been incurred by reason of the Trustee's willful
misfeasance, bad faith, or negligence (except for errors
in judgment); and (iii) such loss, liability, fee, dis-
bursement, or expense shall not have been incurred by
reason of the Trustee's breach of its representations and
warranties pursuant to Section 20.14. The Class A Agent
shall be indemnified by the Servicer and held harmless
against any loss, liability, fee, disbursement, or ex-
pense arising out of or incurred in connection with the
acceptance or performance of its duties contained in the
Agreement except to the extent that such loss, liability,
fee, disbursement, or expense shall have been incurred by
reason of the Class A Agent's willful misfeasance or
gross negligence; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Class A Agent shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 20.8 with re-
spect to any actions of the Class A Agent taken in accor-
dance with the written instructions of the Servicer or of
the Trustee pursuant to Sections 14.7(d)(i) or
14.7(d)(ii).

Section 20.9 Eligibility Requirements for
Trustee. The Trustee under the Agreement shall at all
times be a corporation having an office in the same state
as the location of the Corporate Trust Office as speci-
fied in the Agreement; organized and doing business under
the laws of such state or the United States of America;
authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust
powers; and having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examina-
tion by federal or state authorities. If such corpora-
tion shall publish reports of condition at least annual-
ly, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the afore-
said supervising or examining authority, then for the
purpose of this Section 20.9, the combined capital and
surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most
recent report of condition so published. In case at any
time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 20.9, the Trustee
shall resign immediately in the manner and with the
effect specified in Section 20.10.

Section 20.10 Resignation or Removal of Trustee.
The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged
from the trusts hereby created by giving written notice
thereof to the Servicer. Upon receiving such notice of
resignation, the Servicer shall promptly appoint a suc-
cessor Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one
copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the re-
signing Trustee and one copy to the successor Trustee. 
If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed and
have accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving
of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee.

If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section
20.9 and shall fail to resign after written request
therefor by the Servicer, or if at any time the Trustee
shall be legally unable to act, or shall be adjudged
bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the trustee or of
its property shall be appointed, or any public officer
shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its
property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,
conservation, or liquidation, then the Servicer may
remove the Trustee. If it shall remove the Trustee under
the authority of the immediately preceding sentence, the
Servicer shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee by
written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed
and one copy to the successor Trustee and shall promptly
pay all fees owed to the outgoing Trustee.

Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and
appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to any of the
provisions of this Section 20.10 shall not become effec-
tive until acceptance of appointment by the successor
Trustee pursuant to Section 20.11 and payment of all fees
and expenses owed and any other amounts due hereunder to
the outgoing Trustee. The Servicer shall provide notice
of such resignation or removal of the Trustee to each of
the rating agencies then rating the Certificates.

Section 20.11 Successor Trustee. Any Successor
Trustee appointed pursuant to Section 20.10 shall
execute, acknowledge, and deliver to the Servicer and to
its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment under the Agreement, and thereupon the resig-
nation or removal of the predecessor Trustee shall become
effective and such successor Trustee, without any further
act, deed, or conveyance, shall become fully vested with
all the rights, powers, duties, and obligations of its
predecessor under the Agreement, with like effect as if
originally named as Trustee. The predecessor Trustee
shall upon payment of its fees and expenses and any other
amounts due it hereunder deliver to the successor Trustee
all documents and statements and monies held by it under
the Agreement; and the Servicer and the predecessor
Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do
such other things as may reasonably be required for fully
and certainly vesting and confirming in the successor
Trustee all such rights, powers, duties, and obligations.

No successor Trustee shall accept appointment
as provided in this Section 20.11 unless at the time of
such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be eligible
pursuant to Section 20.9.

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor
Trustee pursuant to this Section 20.11, the Servicer
shall mail notice of the successor of such Trustee under
the Agreement to all Holders of Certificates at their ad-
dresses as shown in the Certificate Register. If the
Servicer shall fail to mail such notice within 10 days
after acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee,
the successor Trustee shall cause such notice to be
mailed at the expense of the Servicer.

Section 20.12 Merger or Consolidation of
Trustee. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be
merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated,
or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion,
or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party,
or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all
of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be
the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such
corporation shall be eligible pursuant to Section 20.9,
without the execution or filing of any instrument or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto;
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

Section 20.13 Appointment of Co-Trustee or
Separate Trustee. Notwithstanding any other provisions
of the Agreement, at any time, for the purpose of meeting
any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any
part of the Trust or any Financed Vehicle may at the time
be located, the Servicer and the Trustee acting jointly
shall have the power and shall execute and deliver all
instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by
the Trustee to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Trust-
ee, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or
any part of the Trust, and to vest in such Person, in
such capacity and for the benefit of the Certificatehold-
ers, such title to the Trust, or any part thereof, and,
subject to the other provisions of this Section 20.13,
such powers, duties, obligations, rights, and trusts as
the Servicer and the Trustee may consider necessary or
desirable. If the Servicer shall not have joined in such
appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a
request so to do, or in the case an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee alone
shall have the power to make such appointment. No co-
trustee or separate trustee under the Agreement shall be
required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor
trustee pursuant to Section 20.9 and no notice of a
successor trustee pursuant to Section 20.11 and no notice
to Certificateholders of the appointment of any co-trust-
ee or separate trustee shall be required pursuant to
Section 20.11.

Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to
the extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject
to the following provisions and conditions:

(i) All rights, powers, duties,
and obligations conferred or imposed upon the
Trustee shall be conferred upon and exercised
or performed by the Trustee and such separate
trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being under-
stood that such separate trustee or co-trustee
is not authorized to act separately without the
Trustee joining in such act), except to the
extent that under any law of any jurisdiction
in which any particular act or acts are to be
performed (whether as Trustee under the Agree-
ment or as successor to the Servicer under the
Agreement), the Trustee shall be incompetent or
unqualified to perform such act or acts, in
which event such rights, powers, duties, and
obligations (including the holding of title to
the Trust or any portion thereof in any such
jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed
singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee,
but solely at the direction of the Trustee;

(ii) No trustee under the Agree-
ment shall be personally liable by reason of
any act or omission of any other trustee under
the Agreement; 

(iii) The Servicer and the Trustee
acting jointly may at any time accept the
resignation of or remove any separate trustee
or co-trustee; and

(iv) All duties owed hereunder
to the Trustee by the Servicer shall be deemed
to be owed to each separate trustee and
co-trustee.

Any notice, request, or other writing given to
the Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of
the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as effective-
ly as if given to each of them. Every instrument ap-
pointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer
to the Agreement and the conditions of this Article XX. 
Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance
of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates
or property specified in its instrument of appointment,
either jointly with the Trustee or separately, as may be
provided therein, subject to all the provisions of the
Agreement, specifically including every provision of the
Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the
liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee. 
Each such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee and
a copy thereof given to the Servicer.

Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any
time appoint the Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact
with full power and authority, to the extent not prohib-
ited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of
the Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any
separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapa-
ble of acting, resign, or be removed, all of its estates,
properties, rights, remedies, and trusts shall vest in
and be exercised by the Trustee, to the extent permitted
by law, without the appointment of a new or successor
trustee.

Section 20.14 Representations and Warranties
of Trustee. The Trustee shall make the following repre-
sentations and warranties on which the Seller and Certif-
icateholders shall rely:

<PAGE>
(i) The Trustee is a New York
corporation duly organized, validly existing,
and in good standing under the laws of the
State of New York.

(ii) The Trustee has full corpo-
rate power, authority, and legal right to exe-
cute, deliver, and perform the Agreement, and

rize the execution, delivery, and performance

(iii) The Agreement shall have
been duly executed and delivered by the Trust-
ee.

Section 20.15 Tax Returns. The Servicer shall
prepare or shall cause to be prepared any tax returns
required to be filed by the Trust and shall remit such
returns to the Trustee for signature at least five days
before such returns are due to be filed. The Trustee,
upon request, will furnish the Servicer with all such
information known to the Trustee as may be reasonably
required in connection with the preparation of all tax
returns of the Trust, and shall, upon request, execute
such returns.

Section 20.16 Trustee May Enforce Claims
Without Possession of Certificates. All rights of action
and claims under this Agreement or the Certificates may
be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Certificates or the production
thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such
proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in
its own name as trustee. Any recovery of judgment shall,
after provision for the payment of the reasonable compen-
sation, expenses, disbursements, and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable
benefit of the Certificateholders in respect of which
such judgment has been obtained.

Section 20.17 Suits for Enforcement. If an
Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the
Trustee, in its discretion may, subject to the provisions
of Section 20.01, proceed to protect and enforce its
rights and the rights of the Certificateholders under
this Agreement by a suit, action, or proceeding in equity
or at law or otherwise, whether for the specific perfor-
mance of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or in aid of the execution of any power granted
in this Agreement or for the enforcement of any other
legal, equitable, or other remedy as the Trustee, being
<PAGE>
advised by counsel, shall deem most effectual to protect
and enforce any of the rights of the Trustee or the
Certificateholders.

Section 20.18 Rights of Certificateholders to
Direct Trustee. Holders of Class A Certificates evidenc-
ing not less than 51% of the Class A Certificate Balance
shall have the right to direct the time, method, and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy avail-
able to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Trustee; provided, however, that, sub-
ject to Section 20.1, the Trustee shall have the right to
decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee being
advised by counsel determines that the action so directed
may not lawfully be taken, or if the Trustee in good
faith shall, by a Trustee Officer, determine that the
proceedings so directed would be illegal or subject it to
personal liability or be unduly prejudicial to the rights
of Certificateholders not parties to such direction; and
provided further that nothing in this Agreement shall
impair the right of the Trustee to take any action deemed
proper by the Trustee and which is not inconsistent with
such direction by the Certificateholders.

Section 21.1 Termination of the Trust. The
respective obligations and responsibilities of the Sell-
er, the Servicer, and the Trustee created hereby and the
Trust created by the Agreement shall terminate upon (i)
the purchase as of the last day of any Collection Period
by the Servicer at its option, pursuant to Section 21.2,
of the corpus of the Trust and the subsequent distribu-
tion to Certificateholders pursuant to Section 14.6 of
the amount required to be deposited pursuant to Section
21.2 or (ii) the payment to Certificateholders of all
amounts required to be paid to them pursuant to the
Agreement and the disposition of all property held as

the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last
survivor of the descendants of Hurley David Smith, cur-
rently residing in Clarkston, Michigan, living on the
date of the Agreement. The Servicer shall promptly
notify the Trustee of any prospective termination pursu-
ant to this Section 21.1.

surrender their Certificates to the Trustee for payment
of the final distribution and cancellation, shall be
given promptly by the Trustee by letter to Certificate-
holders mailed not earlier than the 15th day and not
later than the 25th day of the month next preceding the
specified Distribution Date stating (A) the Distribution
Date upon which final payment of the Certificates shall
be made upon presentation and surrender of the Certifi-
cates at the office of the Trustee therein designated,

such Distribution Date is not applicable, payments being
made only upon presentation and surrender of the Certifi-
cates at the office of the Trustee therein specified. 
The Trustee shall give such notice to the Certificate
Registrar (if other than the Trustee) at the time such
notice is given to Certificateholders. Upon presentation
and surrender of the Certificates, the Trustee shall

Trustee may take appropriate steps, or may appoint an
agent to take appropriate steps, to contact the remaining
Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certifi-
cates, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the

Miscellaneous Provisions

Section 22.1 Amendment. The Agreement may be
amended by the Seller, the Servicer, the Trustee and the
Class A Agent, without the consent of any of the Certifi-
cateholders, to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supple-
ment any provisions in the Agreement, or to add any other
provisions with respect to matters or questions arising
under the Agreement that shall not be inconsistent with
the provisions of the Agreement; provided, however, that
such action shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion of
Counsel, adversely affect in any material respect the
interests of any Certificateholder. The Agreement also
may be amended by the Seller, the Servicer, the Trustee
and the Class A Agent, without the consent of any of the
Certificateholders, to provide for the transfer of the
Class B Certificates; provided, however, that the condi-
tions specified in the third and fourth paragraphs of
Section 16.3 shall be satisfied prior to such transfer;
provided, further, that such amendment shall not change
the timing of or the amount of any distributions that the
Class A Certificateholders are entitled to receive here-
under. 

The Agreement may also be amended from time to
time by the Seller, the Servicer, the Trustee and the
Class A Agent with the consent of the Holders of Class A
Certificates and Class B Certificates, each voting as a
Class (which consent of any Holder of a Certificate given
pursuant to this Section or pursuant to any other provi-
sion of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on
such Holder and on all future Holders of such Certificate
and of any Certificate issued upon the transfer thereof
or in exchange thereof or in lieu thereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon the Certificate),
evidencing not less than 51% of the Class A Certificate
Balance and Class B Certificate Balance, respectively,
for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing
in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the
Agreement, or of modifying in any manner the rights of
the Holders of Certificates; provided, however, that no
such amendment shall (a) increase or reduce in any manner
the amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of,
collections of payments on Receivables or distributions
that shall be required to be made on any Certificate or
change the Pass Through Rate or the Specified Subordinat-
ed Spread Account Balance or (b) reduce the aforesaid
percentage required to consent to any such amendment,
without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates
then outstanding.

Prior to the execution of any such amendment or
consent, the Servicer will provide and the Trustee shall
distribute written notification of the substance of such
amendment or consent to each of the rating agencies then
rating the Certificates.

Promptly after the execution of any such amend-
ment or consent, the Trustee shall furnish written noti-
fication of the substance of such amendment or consent to
each Certificateholder.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of
Certificateholders pursuant to this Section 22.1 to
approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or
consent, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall
approve the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining
such consents (and any other consents of Certificatehold-
ers provided for in this Agreement) and of evidencing the
authorization of the execution thereof by Certificate-
holders shall be subject to such reasonable requirements
as the Trustee may prescribe, including the establishment
of record dates pursuant to paragraph number 2 of the
Depository Agreement.

Prior to the execution of any amendment to the
Agreement, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and
rely upon an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execu-
tion of such amendment is authorized or permitted by the
Agreement and the Opinion of Counsel referred to in
Section 22.2(i)(1). The Trustee may, but shall not be
obligated to, enter into any such amendment which affects
the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the
Agreement or otherwise.

Section 22.2 Protection of Title to Trust.

(a) The Seller shall execute and file
such financing statements and cause to be executed and
filed such continuation statements, all in such manner
and in such places as may be required by law fully to
preserve, maintain, and protect the interest of the
Certificateholders and the Trustee in the Receivables and
in the proceeds thereof. The Seller shall deliver (or
cause to be delivered) to the Trustee file-stamped copies
of, or filing receipts for, any document filed as provid-
ed above, as soon as available following such filing.

(b) Neither the Seller nor the Servicer
shall change its name, identity, or corporate structure
in any manner that would, could, or might make any fi-
nancing statement or continuation statement filed by the
Seller in accordance with paragraph (a) above seriously
misleading within the meaning of Section 9-402(7) of the
UCC,
unless it shall have given the Trustee at least five
days' prior written notice thereof and shall have prompt-
ly filed appropriate amendments to all previously filed
financing statements or continuation statements.

(c) The Seller and the Servicer shall
give the Trustee at least 60 days' prior written notice
of any relocation of its principal executive office if,
as a result of such relocation, the applicable provisions
of the UCC would require the filing of any amendment of
any previously filed financing or continuation statement
or of any new financing statement and shall promptly file
any such amendment. The Servicer shall at all times
maintain each office from which it shall service Receiv-
ables, and its principal executive office, within the
United States of America.

(d) The Servicer shall maintain accounts
and records as to each Receivable accurately and in
sufficient detail to permit (i) the reader thereof to
know at any time the status of such Receivable, including
payments and recoveries made and payments owing (and the
nature of each) and (ii) reconciliation between payments
or recoveries on (or with respect to) each Receivable and
the amounts from time to time deposited in the Certifi-
cate Account and Payahead Account in respect of such
Receivable.

(e) The Servicer shall maintain its
computer systems so that, from and after the time of sale
under the Agreement of the Receivables to the Trust, the
Servicer's master computer records (including any back-up
archives) that refer to a Receivable shall indicate
clearly the interest of the particular grantor trust in
such Receivable and that such Receivable is owned by the
Trust. Indication of the Trust's ownership of a Receiv-
able shall be deleted from or modified on the Servicer's
computer systems when, and only when, the Receivable
shall have been paid in full or repurchased.

(f) If at any time the Seller or the
Servicer shall propose to sell, grant a security interest
in, or otherwise transfer any interest in automotive
receivables to any prospective purchaser, lender, or
other transferee, the Servicer shall give to such pro-
spective purchaser, lender, or other transferee computer
tapes, records, or print-outs (including any restored
from back-up archives) that, if they shall refer in any
manner whatsoever to any Receivable, shall indicate
clearly that such Receivable has been sold and is owned
by the Trust.

(g) The Servicer shall permit the Trustee
and its agents at any time during normal business hours
to inspect, audit, and make copies of and abstracts from
the Servicer's records regarding any Receivable.

(h) Upon request, the Servicer shall
furnish to the Trustee, within twenty Business Days, a
list of all Receivables (by contract number and name of
Obligor) then held as part of the Trust, together with a
reconciliation of such list to the Schedule of Receiv-
ables and to each of the Servicer's Certificates fur-
nished before such request indicating removal of Receiv-
ables from the Trust.

(i) The Servicer shall deliver to the
Trustee:

(1) promptly after the
execution and delivery of the Agreement and of
each amendment thereto, an Opinion of Counsel
either (A) stating that, in the opinion of such
Counsel, all financing statements and continua-
tion statements have been executed and filed
that are necessary fully to preserve and pro-
tect the interest of the Trustee in the Receiv-
ables, and reciting the details of such filings
or referring to prior Opinions of Counsel in
which such details are given, or (B) stating
that, in the opinion of such Counsel, no such
action shall be necessary to preserve and pro-
tect such interest; and

(2) within 90 days after
the beginning of each calendar year beginning
with the first calendar year beginning more
than three months after the Cutoff Date, an
Opinion of Counsel, dated as of a date during
such 90-day period, either (A) stating that, in
the opinion of such Counsel, all financing
statements and continuation statements have
been executed and filed that are necessary
fully to preserve and protect the interest of
the Trustee in the Receivables, and reciting
the details of such filings or referring to
prior Opinions of Counsel in which such details
are given, or (B) stating that, in the opinion
of such Counsel, no such action shall be neces-
sary to preserve and protect such interest.

Each Opinion of Counsel referred to in clause
(i)(1) or (i)(2) above shall specify any action necessary
(as of the date of such opinion) to be taken in the
following year to preserve and protect such interest.

(j) The Seller shall, to the extent
required by applicable law, cause the Certificates to be
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to Section 12(b) or Section 12(g) of the Securi-
ties Exchange Act of 1934 within the time periods speci-
fied in such sections.

(k) For the purpose of facilitating the

Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which counterparts shall be deemed to be an
original, and all of which counterparts shall constitute
but one and the same instrument.

Section 22.3 Limitation on Rights of Certifi-
cateholders. The death or incapacity of any Certificate-
holder shall not operate to terminate the Agreement or
the Trust, nor entitle such Certificateholder's legal
representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to
take any action or commence any proceeding in any court
for a partition or winding up of the Trust, nor otherwise
affect the rights, obligations, and liabilities of the
parties to the Agreement or any of them.

No Certificateholder shall have any right to
vote (except as provided in Section 22.1 or 19.5) or in
any manner otherwise control the operation and management

Agreement, nor shall anything in the Agreement set forth,
or contained in the terms of the Certificates, be con-
strued so as to constitute the Certificateholders from
time to time as partners or members of an association;
nor shall any Certificateholder be under any liability to
any third person by reason of any action taken pursuant
to any provision of the Agreement.

No Certificateholder shall have any right by
virtue or by availing itself of any provisions of the
Agreement to institute any suit, action, or proceeding in
equity or at law upon or under or with respect to the
Agreement, unless such Holder previously shall have given
to the Trustee a written notice of default and of the
continuance thereof, and unless also (i) the default
arises from the Seller's or the Servicer's failure to
remit payments when due hereunder, or (ii) the Holders of
Class A Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the
Class A Certificate Balance shall have made written
request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit
or proceeding in its own name as Trustee under the Agree-
ment and shall have offered to the Trustee such reason-
able indemnity as it may require against the costs,
expenses, and liabilities to be incurred therein or
thereby, and the Trustee, for 30 days after its receipt
of such notice, request, and offer of indemnity, shall
have neglected or refused to institute any such action,
suit or proceeding and during such 30-day period no
request or waiver inconsistent with such written request
has been given to the Trustee pursuant to this Section or
Section 19.5; no one or more Holders of Certificates
shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue or
by availing itself or themselves of any provisions of the
Agreement to affect, disturb, or prejudice the rights of
the Holders of any other of the Certificates, or to
obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to
any other such Holder, or to enforce any right, under the

fully-paid, fractional undivided interest in the Ford Credit
1994-A Grantor Trust (the "Trust") formed by Ford Credit Auto

vicing Agreement dated as of May 1, 1994 (the "Agreement"),
among the Seller, the Ford Motor Credit Company, as Servicer
(the "Servicer"), and Chemical Bank, as Trustee (the "Trust-
ee") and as Class A Agent, a summary of certain of the perti-
nent provisions of which is set forth below. To the extent
not otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used
herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement. 
This Certificate is one of the duly authorized Certificates
designated as "6.35% Asset Backed Certificates, Class A"
(herein called the "Class A Certificates"). Also issued
under the Agreement are Certificates designated as "6.35%
Asset Backed Certificates, Class B" (the "Class B Certifi-
cates"). The Class B Certificates and the Class A Certifi-
cates are hereinafter collectively called the "Certificates." 
The aggregate undivided interest in the Trust evidenced by
all Class A Certificates is 93%. This Class A Certificate is

conditions of the Agreement, to which Agreement the holder of
this Class A Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof

accounts and the proceeds thereof, property (including the
right to receive Liquidation Proceeds) securing the Receiv-
ables and held by the Trustee, proceeds from claims on physi-
cal damage, credit life and disability insurance policies
covering vehicles financed thereby and the obligors thereun-
der, certain other items financed by the obligors, certain

ately preceding the month in which such Distribution Date

fractional undivided interest in the lesser of (a) the sum of
the Class A Distributable Amount and any outstanding Class A
Interest Carryover Shortfall (plus interest on such Class A
Interest Carryover Shortfall at the Pass-through Rate from

bution Date, to the extent permitted by law and, with respect
to the Class A Interest Distributable Amount only, to the
extent provided in the Agreement) and any Class A Principal
Carryover Shortfall and (b) the sum of (i) the Total Avail-
able Amount (but with respect to the Class A Interest Dis-
tributable Amount only to the extent provided in the Agree-
ment) and (ii) amounts available in the Subordination Spread

Certificateholder of record in the Certificate Register
without the presentation or surrender of this Class A Certif-
icate or the making of any notation hereon except that with

tions will be made in the form of immediately available
funds. Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement and
notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this

[Reverse of Certificate]

The Certificates do not represent an obligation
of, or an interest in, the Seller, the Servicer, the
Trustee or any affiliate of any of them. The Certifi-
cates are limited in right of payment to certain collec-
tions and recoveries respecting the Receivables, all as
more specifically set forth in the Agreement. A copy of
the Agreement may be examined during normal business
hours at the principal office of the Seller, and at such
other places, if any, designated by the Seller, by any
Certificateholder upon request.

The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions
therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modifica-
tion of the rights and obligations of the Seller and the
rights of the Certificateholders under the Agreement at
any time by the Seller and the Trustee with the consent
of the Holders of Class A Certificates and Class B Cer-
tificates, each voting as a Class, evidencing not less
than 51% of the Class A Certificate Balance and Class B
Certificate Balance, respectively. Any such consent by
the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and
binding on such Holder and on all future Holders of this
Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the trans-
fer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof
whether or not notation of such consent is made upon this
Certificate. The Agreement also permits the amendment
thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

As provided in the Agreement and subject to cer-
tain limitations set forth therein, the transfer of this
Certificate is registrable in the Certificate Registrar
upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of
transfer at the offices or agencies maintained by the
Trustee in its capacity as Certificate Registrar, or by
any successor Certificate Registrar, in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trust-
ee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the
holder hereof or such holder's attorney duly authorized
in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of
authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate
interest in the Trust will be issued to the designated
transferee.

The Class A Certificates are issuable only as
registered Certificates without coupons in denominations
of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof; however, one
Certificate may be issued in a denomination equal to the
residual amount. As provided in the Agreement and sub-
ject to certain limitations therein set forth, Certifi-
cates are exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized
denominations evidencing the same aggregate denomination,
as requested by the holder surrendering the same. No
service charge will be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange, but the Trustee may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental
charges payable in connection therewith.

The Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, and any
agent of the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may
treat the person in whose name this Class A Certificate
is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and
neither the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, nor any
such agent shall be affected by any notice to the con-
trary.

The obligations and responsibilities created by
the Agreement and the Trust created thereby shall termi-
nate upon the payment to Certificateholders of all
amounts required to be paid to them pursuant to the
Agreement and the disposition of all property held as
part of the Trust. The Servicer of the Receivables may
at its option purchase the corpus of the Trust at a price
specified in the Agreement, and such purchase of the
Receivables and other property of the Trust will effect
early retirement of the Certificates; however, such right
of purchase is exercisable only as of the last day of any
Collection Period as of which the Pool Balance is less
than 10% of the original aggregate principal balance of
the Receivables.

The recitals contained herein (other than the
certificate of authentication herein) shall be taken as
the statements of the Seller or the Servicer, as the case
may be, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the
correctness thereof. The Trustee makes no representa-
tions as to the validity or sufficiency of this Certifi-
cate (other than the certificate of authentication here-
in), or of any Receivable or related document.

Registrar, or by any successor Certificate Registrar, in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the holder
hereof or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and
thereupon one or more new Certificates of authorized
denominations evidencing the same aggregate interest in the Trust
will be issued to the designated transferee.

The Class B Certificates are issuable only as registered
Certificates without coupons in denominations of $100,000 and
integral multiples thereof; however, one Certificate may be
issued in a denomination equal to the residual amount. As
provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering
the same. No service charge will be made for any such
registration of transfer or exchange, but the Trustee may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental
charges payable in connection therewith.

The Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, and any agent of
the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may treat the person in
whose name this Class B Certificate is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, and neither the Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar, nor any such agent shall be affected by any notice to
the contrary.

The obligations and responsibilities created by the
Agreement and the Trust created thereby shall terminate upon the
payment to Certificateholders of all amounts required to be paid
to them pursuant to the Agreement and the disposition of all
property held as part of the Trust. The Servicer of the
Receivables may at its option purchase the corpus of the Trust at
a price specified in the Agreement, and such purchase of the
Receivables and other property of the Trust will effect early
retirement of the Certificates; however, such right of purchase
is exercisable only as of the last day of any Collection Period
as of which the Pool Balance is less than 10% of the original
aggregate principal balance of the Receivables.

The recitals contained herein (other than the certificate
of authentication herein) shall be taken as the statements of the
Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, and the Trustee
assumes no responsibility for the correctness thereof. The
Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or
sufficiency of this Certificate (other than the certificate of
authentication herein), or of any Receivable or related document.
