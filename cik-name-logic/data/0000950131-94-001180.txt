ATTACHMENT A

CHICAGO, July 13, 1994 -- First Chicago Corporation today reported second 
quarter net income of $168.7 million, up slightly from $168.5 million in the 
second quarter of 1993. Return on common stockholders' equity was 16.5 percent.
On a fully diluted basis, earnings per share were $1.67 in the second 
quarter, compared to $1.72 a year-ago. Earnings for the first quarter of 1994 
were $193.8 million, or $2.00 per share.
For the first six months of 1994, net income was $362.5 million, or $3.67 
per share, and return on common stockholders' equity was 18.3 percent.

SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

. Total managed credit card receivables grew to $11.0 billion at June 30, up
22 percent from a year ago. Receivables were $10.4 billion at March 31.
During the second quarter, $1 billion of receivables were sold in a
securitization transaction, bringing the total securitized portfolio to
$5.6 billion at quarter-end.

. Combined trading profits were $37 million -- substantially improved from
the loss in the first quarter of 1994, although down from record gains a
year ago.

. The Corporation received Brazilian bonds as part of the debt restructuring
that was completed during the second quarter. This added $32 million to 
pre-tax earnings, including $14 million in interest income representing the
market value of interest bonds, and $18 million in market value of
principal bonds over the recorded carrying amounts that was treated as a
loan loss recovery.

. The provision for credit losses declined to $43 million. Reserve building
for growth in the credit card portfolio was offset by a negative commercial
provision, principally reflecting the Brazilian debt restructuring.

. Accelerated asset disposition activities resulted in net gains of $22 
million.
<PAGE>

. Credit quality continued to improve during the quarter. Nonperforming
assets were $181 million -- a decrease of $99 million, or 35 percent, from
March 31. About $50 million of the decrease in nonperforming assets were
related to the receipt of Brazilian bonds. The nonperforming asset ratio
was 0.8 percent, one of the lowest among major U.S. banks.

. The Corporation's 10% Preferred Stock, Series D, was redeemed on July 1 at
a 3 percent premium over the $150 million par value. This resulted in
additional preferred dividends of $4.5 million that reduced earnings per
share by 5 cents.

. Capital ratios continued to exceed the regulatory guidelines for "well-
capitalized" status by a wide margin. At June 30, the estimated Tier 1 
risk-adjusted capital ratio was 8.8 percent, and the total risk-adjusted 
ratio was approximately 13.7 percent.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $339 million. Net 
interest margin was 2.69 percent for the quarter, and average earning assets 
were $50.5 billion.
Adjusted for the effects of credit card securitization and the activities 
of First Chicago Capital Markets, Inc., net interest margin was 3.93 percent. 
This was up from 3.58 percent in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a more 
favorable mix of earning assets. The adjusted margin in the first quarter of 
1994 was also 3.93 percent.
Interest income from the Brazilian debt restructuring added 12 basis points
to the adjusted margin in the second quarter of 1994.
<PAGE>

NONINTEREST INCOME

Total noninterest income was $429 million for the second quarter. Combined 
trading activities generated profits of $37 million, compared to a loss of $25 
million in the first quarter and record profits of $92 million a year ago.
Credit card fee revenues were $194 million for the quarter. When adjusted 
for the impact of securitization, these revenues climbed 15 percent from a year 
ago.
Equity securities gains were $4 million, including $2 million in the 
venture capital portfolio, down substantially from equity securities gains of 
$79 million a year ago and $134 million in the first quarter. The net loss 
attributable to the venture capital business -- revenues less the portfolio's 
cost-to-carry and other expenses -- was $4 million, or $0.06 per share, compared
with net income of $0.20 per share in the year-ago quarter and $0.73 in the 
first quarter of 1994.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Noninterest expense was $461 million for the quarter, essentially flat with
the second quarter of 1993, when a $12 million charge was included for 
accelerated amortization of certain intangibles.

CREDIT QUALITY

The provision for credit losses was $43 million in the second quarter. This
included $57 million for the consumer portfolios -- up from $43 million in the 
first quarter due to credit card growth -- and a negative provision of $14 
million for commercial credits.
The Corporation's allowance for credit losses was $681 million at June 30, 
representing 454 percent of nonperforming loans at quarter-end. Of the total 
allowance, $502 million was related to commercial exposure and $179 million to 
the consumer portfolios.
Net charge-offs in the second quarter were $34 million. Consumer net 
charge-offs, mainly in the credit card portfolio, were $43 million. The net 
charge-off rate for credit card receivables was 3.8 percent, relatively steady 
compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier and 3.6 percent in the first quarter.
Net recoveries in the commercial portfolio totaled $9 million, including 
the $18 million recovery from the Brazilian debt restructuring.
