United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.
(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)

AMENDMENT NO. 2

The undersigned registrant hereby amends its Current Report on Form 8-K

the three months ended March 31, 1994, the balance sheet as of March 31, 1994,
and the related Notes to Pro Forma Balance Sheet and Notes to Pro Forma
Statements of Operations. Subsequent to the filing of the original Form 8-K
dated May 26, 1994, and to the filing of Form 8-K/A, Amendment No. 1, the Trust
filed an 8-K dated May 17, 1994 to report the purchase of an apartment community

NOTES TO PRO FORMA BALANCE SHEET
MARCH 31, 1994
(UNAUDITED)
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying pro forma balance sheet assumes the completion, as of
March 31, 1994, of (i) the sale of 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an
assumed price of $14.25 per share (the "Offering"), (ii) the proposed
acquisition of 25 apartment communities (the "Portfolio Acquisition"), (iii) the
acquisition of five apartment communities purchased in 1994 (previously reported
on Forms 8-K dated April 15, 1994 and May 17, 1994), (iv) the borrowing of
$93,069,000 and the issuance of 605,109 shares of Common Stock to the seller of
the Portfolio Acquisition at an assumed price of $13.70 per share (assumed
market price of $14.25 per share net of an agreed discount of $.55 per share)
necessary to fund a portion of the Portfolio Acquisition. In management's
opinion, all significant adjustments necessary to reflect these transactions
have been made. The pro forma balance sheet should be read in conjunction with
the Trust's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1993
and its unaudited financial statements for the first quarter ended March 31,
1994.
The unaudited pro forma balance sheet is not necessarily indicative of what
the Trust's financial position would have been if the Offering and related
acquisitions had been consummated as of March 31, 1994, nor does it purport to
be indicative of the Trust's financial position in future periods.
2. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PRO FORMA BALANCE SHEET
(A) Represents the Trust's historical balance sheet contained in the
Trust's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1994.
(B) Represents the initial purchase price of $161,950,000 for the 25
properties proposed to be acquired in the Portfolio Acquisition plus estimated
closing costs of $1,047,000.
(C) Represents the assumption of two mortgage loans encumbering two
properties included in the Portfolio Acquisition as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

PROPERTY NAME AMOUNT RATE
<S> <C> <C>
Harris Pond Apartments................................................... $5,200,000 8.75%
Royal Oaks Apartments.................................................... 6,500,000 8.50
</TABLE>

(D) Represents assumed additional borrowings of $35,283,000 necessary to
fund a portion of the Portfolio Acquisition.
(E) Represents the issuance of 8,000,000 shares in the Offering and the
issuance of 605,109 shares to the seller of the Portfolio Acquisition.
(F) Represents the net proceeds from the Offering and the value of the
consideration received for the shares issued to the seller of the Portfolio
Acquisition attributable to additional paid-in capital. In determining net
proceeds from the Offering, underwriting discounts and other offering costs
equal to 5.5% of gross proceeds, or $6,276,000, have been assumed.
(G) Represents the aggregate purchase price of $46,086,000 of three
apartment communities purchased on April 8, 1994, April 14, 1994, and May 17,
1994 as previously reported on Forms 8-K dated April 15, 1994 and May 17, 1994.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS
FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 1994 AND
THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993
(UNAUDITED)
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying pro forma statements of operations assume the completion
of (i) the sale of 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an assumed price of
$14.25 per share (the "Offering"), (ii) the proposed acquisition of 25 apartment
communities (the "Portfolio Acquisition"), (iii) the issuance of 605,109 shares
of Common Stock to the seller of the Portfolio Acquisition at an assumed price
of $13.70 per share (assumed market price of $14.25 per share net of an agreed
discount of $.55 per share), (iv) the acquisition of five apartment communities
purchased in 1994 previously reported on Forms 8-K dated April 15, 1994 and May
17, 1994, and (v) the acquisition of eleven apartment communities previously
reported on Form 8-K dated December 31, 1993, at the beginning of each period
presented. In addition, such pro forma statements of operations also assume that
$23,640,000 of 7 year senior unsecured notes are outstanding for approximately 8
months for the year ended December 31, 1993 and 2 months for the first quarter
of 1994. In management's opinion, all significant adjustments necessary to
reflect these transactions have been made. The pro forma statements of
operations should be read in conjunction with the Trust's audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 1993 and its unaudited financial
statements for the three months ended March 31, 1994.
The unaudited pro forma statements of operations are not necessarily
indicative of what the Trust's results would have been for the three months
ended March 31, 1994 and the year ended December 31, 1993 if the Offering and
related acquisitions had been consummated at the beginning of each period
presented, nor do they purport to be indicative of the results of operations or
financial position in future periods.
2. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS
(A) Represents the Trust's historical statements of operations contained in
its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 1994 and
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993.
(B) Represents actual rental income and related operating expenses of the
proposed Portfolio Acquisition, as reported on Form 8-K dated May 26, 1994.
(C) Represents rental income and related operating expenses of five
apartment acquisitions, as previously reported on Forms 8-K dated April 15, 1994
and May 17, 1994.
(D) Reflects the net adjustments required to allow for a full year of
rental income and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 1993, for
the Trust's acquisitions reported on Form 8-K during 1993.
(E) Reflects the net decrease in property management fees for the Portfolio
Acquisition and the Trust's 1993 and 1994 acquisitions. The Trust internally
manages its apartment properties at a cost of approximately 3% of rental income.
(F) Reflects the net decrease in insurance expense to reflect that the
Trust insures its apartments for approximately $107 per unit less than the
historical insurance expense of the Portfolio Acquisition.
(G) Represents the net adjustments to depreciation expense as outlined in
the table below. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Buildings have been depreciated
over 35 years and other improvements over 15 years based upon an assumed
allocation of the estimated initial cost of the Portfolio Acquisition.

(I) Reflects the additional interest expense associated with the increase
in bank lines of credit and the assumption of tax-exempt bonds on one of the
1994 property acquisitions and of two mortgage notes assumed to have been
incurred by the Trust to purchase (i) the Portfolio Acquisition at interest
rates and maturities which are currently available to the Trust, (ii) the 1994
apartment acquisitions through May 17, 1994 at interest rates under the Trust's
bank lines of credit on the date of purchase, and (iii) the 1993 apartment
acquisitions made by the Trust at interest rates and maturities that were
