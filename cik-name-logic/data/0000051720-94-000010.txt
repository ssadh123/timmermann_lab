ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

Interstate Power Company filed an Iowa electric rate increase
application in August 1993. The rate application requested a
12.35% return on common equity and an annual revenue increase of
$11.5 million. An interim increase of $11.0 million became
effective October 28, 1993.

The Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) issued an Order on June 3, 1994. 
The IUB order granted a 11.0% return on common equity and an annual
revenue increase of $7.4 million. 

Through May 1994, the Company has collected $2.0 million in excess
of the IUB Order. The overcollection will be offset against second
quarter 1994 income. 

The Company and other interested parties have until June 23, 1994
to request a rehearing of the IUB Order.
