FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

COMPAQ REPORTS RECORD SALES OF $2.5 BILLION IN SECOND QUARTER

Earnings Per Share Up 95 Percent

HOUSTON, July 20, 1994 -- Compaq Computer Corporation (NYSE:CPQ)
today announced record sales of $2.5 billion for the second
quarter ended June 30, 1994, a 53 percent increase over the $1.63
billion reported in the same period of 1993.

Earnings per share for the second quarter rose to $.78 from $.40
in last year's second quarter, an increase of 95 percent.*

"The growing worldwide acceptance of the Compaq brand has helped
propel the Company to another record sales quarter," said Eckhard
Pfeiffer, president and chief executive officer, Compaq Computer
Corporation. "In our drive for marketshare leadership, Compaq
shipped a record number of computers during the second quarter as
our products continued to represent the best value for customers
worldwide."

"Compaq anticipates growing demand in the second half of the
year. We will continue our expansion activities to satisfy this
demand," said Pfeiffer. "Our challenge will be to manage
effectively manufacturing and distribution processes, inventory
and product transitions to meet market opportunities."

Second Quarter Highlights

During the second quarter Compaq introduced and began shipping a
record number of products ranging from high-performance notebook
computers to rack-mounted servers.

At the end of June Compaq introduced the high-performance Rack-
Mountable ProLiant family of servers, vertically packaged in
highly serviceable modular rack cabinets, that address MIS
managers' needs for consolidation and manageability previously
only available with mission-critical minicomputer and mainframe
systems.

The network-ready, flagship Deskpro XL, introduced in April to
replace the Deskpro/M family, is Compaq's most flexible and
powerful desktop PC. This family features incomparable
upgradability, performance and compatibility.

Compaq also began volume shipments of the LTE Elite high-
performance notebook in June. This five-model family features the
industry's first built-in AC adapter in a full-function notebook,
four display technologies and the lightest total carrying weight
(including AC adapter, power cord and trackball) of any power
notebook. And the Contura Aero, Compaq's smallest, lightest and
most affordable notebook PC, led the subnotebook category in
sales and marketshare in the first half of the year.

During the second quarter, Compaq also made important
announcements with key industry partners. Compaq and PictureTel
announced a five-year strategic alliance for the design and
manufacture of standards-based personal conferencing products,
expected to result in products available worldwide in 1995.
Also, Microsoft and Compaq announced the two companies are
developing video servers that will enable individuals to receive
cost-effective, interactive multimedia video, audio and data on
private and public networks.

In July, Compaq and Oracle announced the formation of the Compaq
Business Unit at Oracle and the Compaq/Oracle Alliance. The unit
and alliance were established in order to deliver more reliable,
higher performance and easier to manage integrated database
server platforms.
