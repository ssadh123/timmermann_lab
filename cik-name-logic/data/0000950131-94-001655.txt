Reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Terra Industries
Inc. on August 10, 1994. There is hereby added to such Form 8-K an Item 2 and
an Item 7 as follows:

ITEM 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
------------------------------------ 

On October 20, 1994, Terra Industries Inc. ("Terra" or the "Company")
acquired Agricultural Minerals and Chemicals Inc. ("AMCI") and consummated
certain concurrent transactions. The Company previously announced, on August 9,
1994, that it had signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire AMCI from its
shareholders who include Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II and
Transammonia, Inc. for $400 million, subject to an adjustment relating to AMCI's
working capital. AMCI's estimated working capital at closing exceeded $86
million and, as a result, AMCI paid such excess (approximately $100 million)
to the benefit of the former AMCI shareholders at closing. Concurrent with the
acquisition of AMCI, Terra completed the public offering of its 9,700,000 Common
Shares, the proceeds of which were used to finance, in part, such acquisition.
In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries, including the former AMCI
subsidiaries, concurrently borrowed funds for the acquisition, the retirement of
certain indebtedness and the payment of certain related fees and expenses under
a new credit agreement entered into with certain lenders and with Citibank, N.A.
as agent.

The Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended, (File No. 33-
52493) relating to the public offering of its Common Shares, was declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 13, 1994. The
acquisition of AMCI and various concurrent transactions, including without
limitation those described above, were consummated on the terms described in
such Registration Statement. The Company's final prospectus filed on October 14,
1994 in connection with such Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended,
(File No. 33-52493) is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
--------------------------------- 

(a) Historical Financial Statements of AMCI are incorporated herein by
reference to pages F-21 to F-41 of the Company's final prospectus filed on
October 14, 1994 in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3, as
amended, (File No. 33-52493).

(b) Unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are incorporated herein
by reference to pages 20 to 25 of the Company's final prospectus filed on
October 14, 1994 in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3, as
amended, (File No. 33-52493).
