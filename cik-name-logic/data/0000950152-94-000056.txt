Reference is made to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated

The Company expects to report a fourth quarter 1993 net loss in the
range of approximately $52 to $67 million, or $1.00 to $1.30 per share,
compared to a net loss of $193 million, or $3.77 per share (including
restructuring and reorganization charges of $61 million, or $1.18 per share,
and a loss from discontinued operations of $41 million, or $.80 per share) for
the same period last year.

For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company expects to report a
net loss in the range of $43 to $58 million, or $.82 to $1.12 per share,

restructuring and reorganization charges of $61 million, or $1.18 per share,
and a loss from discontinued operations of $62 million, or $1.20 per share)
reported in 1992. Based on the expected range of results above, earnings before
