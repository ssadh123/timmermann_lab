GREYHOUND FINANCIAL CORPORATION

ANNOUNCES 1993 RESULTS FOR THE

FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR TO DATE

PHOENIX, Arizona, January 21, 1994 -- Greyhound Financial Corporation (the

"company") today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended

December 31, 1993.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 1993 was $10.8 million compared to

$10.5 million for the fourth quarter of 1992. The fourth quarter of 1993

included $1.0 million ($0.6 million after-tax) of interest on a loan from

its parent, GFC Financial Corporation ('GFCFC"), of the proceeds received on

the sale of GFCFC's discontinued operation ("Verex"). Additionally, $0.9

million ($0.6 million after-tax) of general and administrative expenses that

would have been allocated to Verex were absorbed by GFC. Excluding these

amounts, net income for the fourth quarter of 1993 would have been $12.0

million, an improvement of 14% over the fourth quarter of 1992.

Net income for the year 1993 was $36.4 million compared to $36.8

million in 1992. The 1993 results included a $4.9 million adjustment in the

third quarter for deferred taxes applicable to leveraged leases and $1.6

million (pre-tax) of expenses previously allocated to Verex. Excluding

these amounts, net income for 1993 was $42.3 million, an increase of 15%

over 1992.

The $4.9 million third quarter adjustment to income taxes represents

the effects of recent increases in federal and state income tax rates as

they apply to deferred income taxes generated by the company's leveraged

lease portfolio. In addition, income taxes for the fourth quarter of 1992

were reduced by $3.1 million representing tax adjustments related to the

refinancing of the company's debt upon spin-off from The Dial Corp in March

1992.

Sam Eichenfield, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company,

said that "1993 was an outstanding year for the company because it had a

record year, both in terms of operating earnings, before the one-time tax

adjustment, and in new business volume, which reached $1 billion.

Additionally, funds employed grew by 15% with margins and the quality of

assets continuing to meet or exceed expectations." Nonaccruing assets,

including those in the European portfolio, declined as a percentage of funds

employed to 3.6% at year end 1993 from 4.0% at year end 1992.

Eichenfield went on to say that he was pleased with the significant

goals that the company achieved in 1993. "With capital potentially

available to the company arising from the successful sale of Verex by the

company's parent, along with the acquisition of the Asset Based Finance

operations, the start up of the Consumer Rediscount business and the pending

purchase of Ambassador Factors, we have enhanced our foundation for the

future. With these endeavors, the company is positioned to expand its

financial service operations into three new niche-businesses."

As announced on November 29, 1993, GFCFC and Fleet Financial Group,

Inc. reached an agreement in principle for the company to acquire Fleet

Financial's factoring and asset-based lending subsidiary, Fleet Factors

Corp., operating under the trade name Ambassador Factors.

Interest earned from financing transactions, increased to $64.6 million

for the fourth quarter of 1993 from $59.6 million for the fourth quarter of

1992 and to $248.7 million for the year 1993 from $240.8 million in 1992.

These increases primarily were driven by the growth in funds employed,

partially offset by the runoff of high yielding assets in the European

portfolio and the effects of foreign exchange gains and other items recorded

in 1992.

Interest margins earned increased by 18% to $32.2 million (after

adjusting for the $1.0 million interest charge) in the fourth quarter of

1993 from $27.3 million for the fourth quarter of 1992 and by 17% to $122.5

million for 1993 from $104.7 million in 1992. These margins were helped

significantly by more favorable debt costs in 1993 when compared to 1992

(approximately a 1.0% reduction in the aggregate cost of debt). Also

contributing to the improved margins were the growth of the portfolio and

higher prepayment fees.

Provisions for possible credit losses were lower in 1993 primarily due

to lower write-offs. Reserve coverage (reserves for possible credit losses

divided by nonaccruing assets) still remains strong at approximately 63% of

nonaccruing assets and five times 1993 write-offs of $12.6 million.

Also contributing to the improved results were higher gains on sale of

assets in 1993, both for the fourth quarter and the year, primarily due to

the amount and type of assets sold.

Selling, administrative and other operating expenses were higher by

15%, both for the quarter and year ended December 31, 1993, due to the

addition of the Asset Based Finance operations (purchased in February 1993),

expenses that would have been charged to Verex and legal expenses incurred

in connection with certain problem accounts.

Income taxes, excluding the $4.9 million adjustment, were higher in

1993 and more in the range of an ongoing effective tax rate for the company,

both for the fourth quarter and the year.

Greyhound Financial Corporation is a major domestic commercial finance

company that provides secured financing of selected commercial and real

estate activities.
