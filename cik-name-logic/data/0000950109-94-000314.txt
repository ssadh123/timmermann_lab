ITEM 5 OTHER EVENTS.
------------

Effective January 1, 1994, Valley Bancorp., Inc., a Pennsylvania 
corporation and bank holding company ("Valley"), was merged with and into 
Dauphin Deposit Corporation ("Dauphin"), under the Articles of Incorporation 
of Dauphin and under the title of "Dauphin Deposit Corporation". A Current 
Report on Form 8-K disclosing the acquisition was filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission on January 5, 1994.

The acquisition was accounted for by Dauphin as a pooling of
interests. This method of accounting for business combinations is designed to
present as a single interest two or more common stockholder interests that
previously were independent. One of the required criteria for pooling of
interests accounting is that the parties to the business combination must
share mutually in the combined risks and rights of the transaction. In order
to satisfy this risk sharing criteria of pooling of interests accounting,
Securities and Exchange Commission Accounting Series Release 135 provides that
the risk sharing will have occurred if no affiliate of either party to the
merger transaction sells or otherwise disposes of any common stock received in
the transaction until such time as financial results covering at least 30 days
of post-merger combined operations have been published.

In order to satisfy the risk sharing criteria, and thereby allow 
affiliates of either party to the transaction to sell or otherwise dispose of 
Dauphin common stock acquired in the merger, provided that such sale or 
disposition complies with SEC Rules 145 and 144 regarding resales of common 
stock acquired in a business combination, Dauphin hereby publishes its 
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income for the 30 day
periods ended January 31, 1994 and January 31, 1993, respectively. These 
unaudited financial statements are attached to this Current Report as 
Exhibits 99(a) and 99(b) and by this reference incorporated herein. Such 
financial statements reflect the required 30 days of post-merger combined 
operations as required by SEC Accounting Series Release 135.
