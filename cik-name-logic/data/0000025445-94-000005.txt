In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and
the related consolidated statements of income, of changes in
stockholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Burks Pumps, Inc.

their operations and their cash flows for the year in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Organization

Burks Pumps, Inc. (the Company or Burks), a Delaware
corporation, is 93% owned by Harbour Group Investments, L.P.
(HGI, L.P.), a Missouri limited partnership. The remaining
7% of outstanding stock is held by members of Burks and HGI,
L.P. management. The Company is engaged in the manufacture
and sale of specialty industrial systems pumps, wastewater
pumping equipment, pumps for military applications and
engineered cleaning equipment, and centrifugal pumps.

As more fully described in Note 3, on September 30, 1992 the
Company sold its Water Systems Division. Concurrent with the
sale, the Company acquired the net assets of Barnes Pumps Canada,
Inc. (BPC).

As more fully described in Note 4, on November 22, 1991, the
Company acquired substantially all of the net assets of AMW
Industries, Inc. (AMW).

The Company operates manufacturing facilities in Decatur,
Illinois; Piqua, Ohio, and Bramalea, Canada, and formerly in
Conway, Arkansas.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

The significant accounting policies followed by Burks are
described below and are in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles:

Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Barnes Pumps, Inc. and
Barnes Pumps Canada, Inc. Results of operations for AMW and
Barnes Pumps Canada, Inc. have been included since their
respective dates of acquisition. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated. Results of
discontinued operations have been presented separately as
described in Note 3.

Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of the Company's products is recognized
upon shipment to the customer. Costs and related expenses to
manufacture the Company's products are recorded as costs of sales
when the related revenue is recognized.

Cash and cash equivalents
For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, the
Company considers all highly liquid investments with 
original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. A book cash overdraft on the Company's
disbursement account in the amount of $314,058 at December
31, 1992 is included in accounts payable.

BURKS PUMPS, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Page 2

Concentrations of credit risk
The Company sells its products to a wide range of industries in
which its pumps are utilized. In addition, most of the Company's
business activity is with customers located within North America. 
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers
and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains
reserves for potential credit losses and historically such losses
have been within management's expectations. At December 31,
1992, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit
risk.

Inventories
Inventories, which include the cost of materials, direct labor
and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost,
determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for
substantially all inventories, or market.

If the FIFO method (which approximates replacement cost) had been
used in determining cost for all inventories, inventories would
have been approximately the same at December 31, 1992 due to a
LIFO reserve of $520,496 being less than the reserves for excess
and obsolete inventories used in determining replacement cost. 
Obsolete or unsalable inventories are reflected at their
estimated realizable values.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets which range from 3 to 31.5 years. 
Properties held under capital leases are recorded at the present
value of the non-cancelable lease payments over the term of the
lease and are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the
estimated useful lives of the assets.

Expenditures for repairs, maintenance and renewals are charged to
income as incurred. Expenditures which improve an asset or
extend its estimated useful life are capitalized. When
properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost
and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
any gain or loss is included in income.

Intangible assets
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net
assets acquired in a business combination (goodwill) is
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 
years. Amortization charged to income for the year ended
December 31, 1992 was $315,036. Accumulated amortization at
December 31, 1992 was $1,397,089.

Costs incurred in obtaining intellectual property rights
(principally engineering drawings) have been deferred and are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. 

BURKS PUMPS, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Page 3

Amortization charged to income for the year ended
December 31, 1992 was $42,956. Accumulated amortization at
December 31, 1992 was $118,143.

Costs incurred in connection with non-competition agreements have
been deferred and are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over the lives of the agreements. Amortization charged to income
for the year ended December 31, 1992 was $516,000. Accumulated
amortization at December 31, 1992 was $1,429,000.

Other assets
Costs incurred in obtaining financing have been deferred and are
being amortized over the life of the related obligation. 
Amortization charged to income for the year ended December 31,
1992 was $80,000. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1992
was $167,500.

Income taxes
The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return which
includes its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The provision for income
taxes is based on consolidated income and expenses of the Company
for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes are
provided for timing differences between financial and income tax
reporting. 

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," which establishes financial
accounting and reporting standards for income taxes that result
from an enterprise's activities during the current and preceding
years. It requires an asset and liability approach for financial
accounting and reporting for income taxes. This statement will
be adopted by the Company for its year ending December 31, 1993;
management has estimated the cumulative effect of adoption of the
new statement on the Company at January 1, 1993 to be a charge of
approximately $200,000.

Foreign currency translation
The accounts of Barnes Pumps Canada, Inc., are measured using the
Canadian dollar as the functional currency. Assets and
liabilities of the Canadian operations are translated into United
States dollars at period-end exchange rates. Operating results
are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the
year. Net unrealized gains or losses on translation of foreign
currency financial statements are recorded in stockholders'
equity, as a cumulative translation adjustment, and will be
included in income only upon sale or liquidation of underlying
assets.

Earnings per share information
Given the historical organization and capital structure of the
Company, earnings per share information is not considered
meaningful or relevant and has not been presented in the

<PAGE>
BURKS PUMPS, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Page 4

accompanying consolidated financial statements or the notes
thereto.

Other postemployment benefits
In December 1990, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employer's Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (OPEB)," which
establishes financial and reporting standards for OPEB
liabilities. It requires companies to record on an accrual basis
the costs of OPEB liabilities, such as health care costs. This
statement will be effective for the Company for its year ending
December 31, 1995. Management has estimated that the new
statement will result in an additional obligation of
approximately $1 million. Management has not determined whether
the obligation will be recognized in the year in which the
statement is adopted or whether it will be amortized on a
straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of
active plan participants, not to exceed twenty years.

In November 1992, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits," which establishes accounting standards
for employers who provide benefits to former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement. This statement
will be effective for the Company for its year ending December
31, 1995. Management does not anticipate that adoption of the
new statement will have a significant effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

3. Sale of Water Systems Division

On September 30, 1992 the Company sold its Water Systems Division
for a preliminary sale price of $6,787,778, which approximated
the historical carrying value of the assets sold. The loss on
sale of discontinued operations
represents income tax expense of $118,195, related primarily
to differences between the book and tax bases of the
inventory sold. In connection with the sale, the Company
received $350,000 related to a non-competition agreement
which was accounted for as a deferred credit to be amortized
to income over the three year life of the agreement.

The 1992 consolidated statement of income disaggregates sales and
expenses of discontinued operations from captions applicable to
continuing operations. The net loss from discontinued operations
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 1992 includes
the write-off of the net book value of certain intangible assets
related to the Water Systems Division which no longer have value
to the Company.

Water Systems Division for the nine-month period ended

Provision for income taxes 170,045

</TABLE>

Concurrent with the sale of the Water Systems Division, the
Company acquired certain net assets, principally inventory, of
Barnes Pumps Canada, Inc., a firm engaged in the manufacture and
sale of wastewater pumps in Canada, for a purchase price of
$594,247. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and
the purchase price approximated the fair value of the assets
acquired. The pro forma effects of this acquisition on the
Company's results of operations and financial position for 1992
are not material.

4. Acquisition of AMW Industries, Inc.

On November 22, 1991, the Company acquired the net assets of
AMW for a purchase price of $8,797,957. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase and was financed through the
Company's existing debt agreements, as amended. The purchase
price was preliminarily assigned to the net assets acquired
based on their estimated fair value at the date of
acquisition. The purchase price allocation was finalized in
1992. Such finalization reflects the industrial pump line
relocation and consolidation expenses ofapproximately
$2,000,000. In connection with finalizing the AMW purchase
price allocation, the fixed assets retained by Burks were
written up to their estimated fair value as of the date of
acquisition, with the remaining excess purchase price of
$1,215,000 reflected as goodwill. In addition, included in
the purchase price and in connection with the acquisition,
the Company paid $225,000 related to a non-competition
agreement.

-----------
$22,530,055
=========== 
On April 2, 1990, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit and
Term Loan Agreement (the Agreement) with a bank. On November 21,
1991, the Company amended the Agreement to provide for the
acquisition of AMW. The amendment increased the remaining term
loan from $2.575 million at November 21, 1991, to $5 million and
increased quarterly principal payments from $300,000 to $500,000. 
Borrowings available under the revolving credit facility increased
from $14 million to $14.5 million. In addition, the amendment
adjusted the covenants included in the original Agreement. During
1992, the $5 million term loan was repaid with proceeds from the
sale of the Water Systems Division.

The Agreement, as amended, contains restrictive covenants relating
to working capital, debt to tangible net worth, interest expense,
capital expenditures, cash dividends, incurrence of additional
indebtedness and sale of assets and prohibits any guaranty,
endorsement or contingent liability with respect to the obligation
or liability of any other person. The Company was in compliance
with these restrictive covenants at December 31, 1992, or waivers
have been obtained for all covenants for which the Company was not
in compliance. The Agreement requires neither a commitment fee nor
compensating account balance. Borrowings under the Agreement are
secured by property, plant and equipment, inventories and
receivables.

On August 1, 1990 the Company entered into a Note Agreement (Note
Agreement) with an insurance company which replaced the previous
note agreement. The Note Agreement with the insurance company for
the senior subordinated notes contains covenants which are less
restrictive than the Agreement. On November 21, 1991, the Note
Agreement was amended to provide for the acquisition of AMW. The
amendment adjusted the repayment terms and covenants included in
the original Note Agreement. The Company was in compliance with
these covenants at December 31, 1992, or waivers have been obtained
for all covenants for which the Company was not in compliance. As
more fully described in Note 10, the insurance company was granted
warrants under the Note Agreement to purchase 13,303 shares of the
Company's outstanding common stock.

The Company has renegotiated certain of the covenants in its
financing agreements in order to reflect the sale of the Water
Systems Division.

6. Lease obligations

The Company leases its Anaheim, California facility under a non-
cancelable lease which provides for payment by the Company of
property taxes and insurance. The lease has a five-year renewal
option at the end of the lease term (1995). The Company does not
presently utilize the facility for manufacturing operations, and is
subleasing the facility. Payments to be received under such
subleases approximate lease payments made by the Company.

The Company leases certain of its machinery and equipment under
non-cancelable lease agreements. These agreements extend for a
seven-year term. The Company also leases its computer system and
related software under a non-cancelable lease with a five-year
term. The leases are reflected in the financial statements as
capitalized leases in accordance with the requirements of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, "Accounting for Leases."

elect to enter into a written salary deferral agreement under which
a portion their salary, ranging from 0-15%, subject to aggregate
limits required under the Internal Revenue Code, may be contributed
to the plan. The Company may match a part of the employee's
contribution up to a maximum Company contribution of 5% of the
employee's salary, and all plan administrative expenses are borne
by the Company. During the year ended December 31, 1992 plan
expenses, including administrative costs and employer
contributions, were $296,223.

in a diversified portfolio that primarily consists of equity and
debt securities. The method of valuation used to calculate the
costs of the plan for pension benefits is the unit credit actuarial
cost method. Death and disability benefits are valued under the
one-year term actuarial cost method.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Page 12

The warrants expire December 1, 1997 and none have been
exercised as of December 31, 1992. The warrants allow the
insurance company to require the Company to purchase the
warrants at any time between September 30, 1992 (the date of the
sale of the Water Systems Division) and December 1, 1997 at a
specified formula price. At the date of issuance, the warrants
were determined to be equity warrants; however, no amount was
assigned thereto as their value was estimated to be nominal. 
The estimated put value of the warrants has increased from a
nominal amount at December 31, 1991 to $2,186,636 at
December 31, 1992. The warrants have been accreted to their
estimated put value through charges to retained earnings and
additional paid-in capital of $1,279,054 and $907,582,
respectively.
