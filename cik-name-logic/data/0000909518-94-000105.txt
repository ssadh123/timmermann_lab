FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
---------------------

JPS TEXTILE GROUP SIGNS DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL
----------------------------------------------------
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS AND SYNTHETIC INDUSTRIAL FABRICS
----------------------------------------------------
BUSINESSES TO FOAMEX INTERNATIONAL
----------------------------------

GREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA, May 26, 1994 -- JPS Textile Group, Inc.
announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell its
automotive products and synthetic industrial fabrics businesses to JPS
Automotive Products Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Foamex
International Inc. (NASDAQ: FMXI), for a purchase price of
approximately $272 million (which includes approximately $8 million in
assumed long-term debt).

Consummation of the transaction with Foamex and JPS Automotive is
contingent upon, among other things, the obtaining of certain
necessary third party consents and approvals and the securing of
financing by Foamex.

As part of the transaction with Foamex, JPS Automotive Products Corp.
has filed an amendment to its registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of $180 million
aggregate principal amount of senior notes, the net proceeds of which
will be used to finance a portion of the purchase price.

JPS Textile Group intends to utilize the net proceeds after taxes from
the sale of these businesses to retire indebtedness in accordance with
the terms of its indentures and credit agreements.

JPS Textile Group, Inc. is one of the largest diversified domestic
manufacturers of textile and textile related products, principally for
the apparel fabric, industrial and home fashion markets.
