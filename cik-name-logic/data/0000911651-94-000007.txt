Item 5 - Other Events

On February 28, 1994, HUBCO, Inc. ("HUBCO") and Statewide
Savings Bank, S.L.A. ("Statewide"), announced that they have
received the approval of the State of New Jersey Department of
Banking for the stock conversion of Statewide and its acquisition
by HUBCO. The parties also announced that they have entered into
an agreement to extend the date at which either party may terminate
the acquisition agreement to June 30, 1994, from March 31, 1994, in
order to accommodate a delay in the review of the transaction by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC").
HUBCO and Statewide previously announced that they had entered
into an acquisition agreement pursuant to which HUBCO would acquire
Statewide in a merger conversion. As part of the merger
conversion, Statewide depositors would be offered the right to buy
stock in HUBCO. HUBCO stock will be offered first to depositors of
Statewide, then to HUBCO's shareholders and finally in a community
offering, if necessary. HUBCO is required to sell an amount of
stock equal to Statewide's pro forma appraised value, which is
currently estimated to be $35 million. The price of the stock to
Statewide's depositors and HUBCO's shareholders is expected to be
$18.00 per share, a discount from the current market price of HUBCO
stock.
Consummation of the merger conversion transaction is subject
to the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and the
approval of the depositors of Statewide at a meeting of its
members.
On February 8, 1994, the FDIC announced a new interim rule
governing stock conversions of state-chartered savings banks. The
adoption of this new rule has resulted in a delay by the FDIC in
its approval process. Because of this delay, the parties agreed to
extend the potential termination date of the acquisition agreement
to June 30, 1994. The acquisition requires the approval of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York which is also pending.
HUBCO, Inc., with assets of $1.04 billion, is the bank holding
company for Hudson United Bank which presently operates 37 branches
in Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Morris and Passaic Counties.
Statewide, headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey, is a
mutual savings and loan association with $520 million in assets and
13 offices serving Bergen, Hudson and Union Counties.
