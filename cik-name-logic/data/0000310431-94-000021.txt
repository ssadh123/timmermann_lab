IND-359

Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBI
Industries, Inc., announced today that it anticipates its third
quarter results will show lower than anticipated operating income
from domestic contracting operations in light of the continuing
slow pace of capital expenditures for new or replacement vessels
for the refining, chemical, and pulp and paper industries. Third
quarter operating earnings in CBI's contracting services segment
will also be negatively affected by costs associated with an
overseas project which has recently encountered technical chal-
lenges in meeting design tolerances. The impact of these mat-
ters, which the company estimates to be approximately $0.20 to
$0.25 per share, is expected to be absorbed in the third quarter. 
CBI's other operating subsidiaries are achieving favorable re-
sults, and should meet both third and fourth quarter expecta-
tions.
