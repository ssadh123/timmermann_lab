SUN MICROSYSTEMS REPORTS PRELIMINARY THIRD QUARTER UNIT AND
REVENUE GROWTH ESTIMATES

MOUNTAIN VIEW, California -- March 31, 1994 -- Sun Microsystems, Inc.,
(NASDAQ:SUNW) today announced that preliminary revenue estimates for the quarter
ended March 27, 1994, range between $1.17 and $1.20 billion, compared with $1.14
billion in the third fiscal quarter a year ago. There was a corresponding
increase in unit shipments from the prior level of 64 thousand.

Michael E. Lehman, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, said, "While
our business in Japan was strong during the quarter, we believe US revenue
growth was to some extent affected by this week's product introductions as some
customers elected to wait for the new products. Bookings were slightly above
revenues during the quarter."

Sun will be reporting earnings for the quarter on April 12.
