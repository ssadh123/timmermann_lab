REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors
Kraft General Foods, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying combined statement of assets and liabilities
of Birds Eye Frozen Foods, comprised of certain assets, liabilities and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Kraft General Foods, Inc., as of December 25, 1993,
and the related combined statements of earnings and cash flows for the fiscal
year ended December 25, 1993. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the combined assets and liabilities of Birds Eye Frozen
Foods as of December 25, 1993, and the combined results of its operations and
cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 25, 1993, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

___________

1. Organization and Operations

The accompanying combined financial statements include the accounts of
Birds Eye Frozen Foods, a division of The All American Gourmet Company
(AAG), which, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kraft General
Foods, Inc. (KGF), and Birds Eye de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of KGF, (collectively, "Birds Eye").

Birds Eye is a producer and domestic marketer of frozen vegetable and
fruit products. Birds Eye provides retailers with a broad line of
more than 80 frozen vegetables and fruit items, including several
value-added lines (sauced vegetables and specialty vegetable
mixtures).

Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") dated
October 30, 1993, entered into by and between KGF and AAG
(collectively "the Sellers") and Dean Foods Company (the "Buyer"), the
Sellers agreed to sell substantially all of the assets of Birds Eye to
the Buyer. In addition to cash consideration paid, the Buyer agreed
to assume certain liabilities of Birds Eye. The closing date of the
Agreement was December 27, 1993 (the "Closing Date"). The combined
financial statements were prepared as of and for the fiscal year ended
December 25, 1993, which coincides with the Seller's year-end.

2. Basis of Presentation

The accompanying combined financial statements include substantially
all assets, liabilities, operating results, and cash flows of Birds
Eye, as defined above. General Foods Corporation and Birds Eye were
acquired by Philip Morris Companies, Inc. ("Philip Morris") in 1985.
The accounts of Birds Eye reflect the allocation of the Philip Morris
purchase price. In 1989, General Foods Corporation was merged into
KGF.

KGF provides a centralized cash management function; accordingly
substantially all of Birds Eye's cash disbursement and collections are
settled through Combined Company Equity on a daily basis. All net
charges from KGF and other affiliates for various services as well as
payments for such net charges are settled through Combined Company
Equity. Intercompany transactions and Combined Company Equity are
noninterest-bearing and are not subject to stated repayment terms.
These transactions are considered the equivalent of cash transactions
for purposes of the combined statement of cash flows.

2. Basis of Presentation, continued

Birds Eye's results of operations have historically been included in
the consolidated income tax returns of KGF. KGF has no tax sharing
agreement, formal or informal, for allocating income taxes to specific
operating units. The combined financial statements reflect an income
tax provision based on applying an effective income tax rate of 39% to
Birds Eye's domestic pre-tax earnings as well as the local tax
provision of Birds Eye de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., which was separately
computed to comply with the Agreement.

Under the terms of the Agreement, certain Birds Eye employees will
become employees of the Buyer, which will operate the new Birds Eye
business. Obligations arising out of employee benefit plans, except
for benefits pursuant to postretirement plans other than pensions,
accrued prior to the Closing Date as well as claims and causes of
action related to KGF's actions or omissions that occurred prior to
the Closing Date have been retained by KGF. Therefore, no accruals
have been made for these items as of December 25, 1993. See Notes 5
and 6 for a discussion of postretirement benefits other than pensions
and pension liabilities.

The Agreement also stipulates that KGF will retain all liability for
any environmental conditions identified as in existence prior to the
closing and KGF will indemnify the Buyer for all liabilities, claims
or damages related to such conditions. The accompanying combined
financial statements include no accruals for such liabilities.

KGF and certain affiliates provide Birds Eye with various services,
including legal, research and development, sales support, finance,
accounting, insurance, marketing, medical benefits, and purchasing
services. The assessments to Birds Eye for such services were
approximately $5.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 25,
1993. The amounts assessed are based on historical or actual usage of
services relative to the usage of the other participating companies
within the consolidated KGF group. Management believes that the
allocation methodology used is reasonable. These assessments were
included in various accounts on Birds Eye's combined statement of
earnings.

The historical operating results of Birds Eye presented in these
combined financial statements may not be indicative of the results
following completion of the Birds Eye transaction with the Buyer.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost includes
materials, labor, production overhead, and certain distribution and
storage costs. The first-in, first-out (FIFO) method is used to cost
finished goods. Raw material is costed using the average cost method.

Depreciation:
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is
recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives,
principally 10 to 40 years for buildings and building equipment and 3
to 20 years for machinery and equipment.

Advertising and Sales Promotion:
Advertising and sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred.

Postretirement Benefit Other Than Pensions:
Birds Eye accounts for its postretirement benefits other than pensions
pursuant to SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions." See Note 5.

Foreign Currency Translation:
Since the operations of Birds Eye de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. are directly
and integrally linked to Birds Eye's U.S. operations, those financial
statements were remeasured as if the functional currency was the U.S.
dollar. The remeasurement of their local currencies into U.S. dollars
creates translation adjustments which are included in net earnings.

Trade Incentives:
Trade incentive expense has been recorded as a reduction of sales to
arrive at net sales presented in the combined statement of earnings.

</TABLE>

5. Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

Pursuant to the Agreement, KGF will retain the liability for all
postretirement welfare benefits other than pensions for all retired
and former employees as of the Closing Date, and for employees who
will become employees of the Buyer to the extent that such benefits
would have been vested under KGF's plans as of the Closing Date, had
such transferred employees retired from KGF on the Closing Date.

Birds Eye provided health care and other benefits to substantially all
retired employees, their covered dependents and beneficiaries.
Generally, employees who have rendered 10 years of service are
eligible for these benefits.

Postretirement health care cost included in determining net earnings
for the fiscal year ended December 25, 1993 was approximately
$472,000. This expense represents an allocation of the service cost
component of the KGF Plan's total service cost. The allocation is
based on the ratio of the number of eligible Birds Eye employees to
the total number of eligible employees for the KGF plans.

It is not practicable to separate Birds Eye's share of the accumulated
postretirement benefits obligation under KGF's postretirement plans.

6. Pension Plans

Pursuant to the Agreement, KGF will retain the liability for all
pension benefits accrued under KGF's pension plans for employees who
will become employees of the Buyer.

Substantially all of Birds Eye's employees participated in defined
benefit pension plans sponsored by KGF. The plans provided for
retirement benefits for salaried employees based generally on years of
service and compensation during the last years of employment.
Retirement benefits for hourly employees generally were a flat dollar
amount for each year of service.

Birds Eye recognized pension expense of approximately $204,000 for the
fiscal year ended December 25, 1993. This expense represents an
allocation of the service cost components of the KGF Plan's total
service cost. The allocation is based on the ratio of the number of
eligible Birds Eye employees to the total number of eligible employees
for the KGF Plans.

It is not practicable to separate Birds Eye's share of the accumulated
benefits obligation or projected benefit obligation under KGF's
pension plans.

Dean Foods Company and Birds Eye
Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information

The pro forma condensed combined financial information give effect on a
purchase accounting basis to the acquisition by Dean Foods Company (the
"Company") of Birds Eye Frozen Vegetable Business from the All-American
Gourmet Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kraft General Foods, Inc. and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Kraft General Foods, Inc. (collectively "Birds
Eye").

The pro forma condensed combined balance sheet assumes that the acquisition
occurred on November 28, 1993, whereas the pro forma condensed combined
statements of operations assume that the acquisition occurred on June 1, 1992.
The pro forma condensed combined statements assume that all of the purchase
price was financed under the Company's existing bank short-term credit lines.

The Company reports on a fiscal basis ending on the last Sunday in May, whereas
Birds Eye has reported on a calendar basis. For purposes of preparing the
pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, the historic Birds Eye
columns represent the actual results for the same periods as for the Company.

The pro forma adjustments are based on preliminary assumptions of the
allocation of the purchase price and are subject to substantial revision once
appraisals, evaluations and other studies of the fair value of the Birds Eye
assets and liabilities are completed. Actual purchase accounting adjustments
may differ from the pro forma adjustments presented herein.

The pro forma condensed combined statements are not necessarily indicative of
the results that actually would have occurred if the acquisitions had been in
effect since the assumed dates, nor are the statements indicative of future
combined financial position or earnings. The Company's future financial
statements will reflect the acquisition of Birds Eye as of December 27, 1993.

The pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in its Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended May 30, 1993, and Current Report on Form 10-Q for the
six months ended November 28, 1993 and the condensed combined financial
statements of Birds Eye included in this Form 8-K/A on pages 2 through 10.

Dean Foods Company and Birds Eye
Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Combined 
Balance Sheet
at November 28, 1993

(Unaudited)

The Company's balance sheet as of November 28, 1993 has been combined with the
Birds Eye Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of December 25, 1993. Until
December 25, 1993, Birds Eye Frozen Foods was a division of the All-American 
Gourmet Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kraft General Foods, Inc., and 
separate statements of assets and liabilities were not maintained. 

The following is a summary of the adjustments reflected in the pro forma
condensed combined balance sheet (in thousands):

(a) The purchase price, exclusive of related fees and expenses, of $140
million has been reflected as a short-term obligation, although the Company
has the ability to renew or extend the obligations for more than one year.
The Company currently has not refinanced such borrowings due to the
favorable short-term interest rate environment, although a refinancing may
occur in the future.

(b) Adjustment of historic values of certain acquired assets and
liabilities to estimated fair values, elimination of certain accounts as
required by generally accepted accounting principles, and other items
related to the acquisition.

(c) Elimination of Birds Eye company equity.

The following is a summary of the adjustments reflected in the pro forma
condensed combined statement of operations (in thousands):

(a) Earnings effect of adjustments of assets and liabilities
to estimated fair values, including goodwill over 40 years.

(b) Additional interest expense of $2,380 based on borrowings of $140 
million at a rate of 3.4% which was the weighted average interest
rate for borrowings under short-term lines of credit of Dean Foods 
Company for the six months ended November 28, 1993. For every 1% 
change in the assumed interest rate, there would be a corresponding 
effect of approximately $407 on pro forma combined net earnings 
(after-tax).

(c) Recognition of income tax effects of the historic Birds Eye results and
the adjustments described above based on the effective tax rate of Dean
Foods Company.

estimate fair values, including goodwill over 40 years.

(b) Additional interest expense of $4,900 based on borrowings of
