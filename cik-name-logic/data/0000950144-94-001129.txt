BNF BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The preceding consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of BNF BANCORP, INC. ("BNF"), formerly BANCFIRST Corporation, and
its wholly-owned subsidiary, BANKFIRST, a federal savings bank,
(collectively "the Bank").

2. The preceding consolidated financial statements at March 31, 1994
and for the quarters and six month periods ended March 31, 1994 and
1993 have been prepared in accordance with instructions pursuant to
Form 10-Q Quarterly Report. The consolidated financial statements
are unaudited but, in the opinion of Management, reflect all
accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the
Bank's financial position and results of its operations and its cash
flows at the dates and for the periods indicated. All such
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of
operations for the quarter and six month period ended March 31, 1994
are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the
entire fiscal year of 1994.

3. Earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares
plus equivalent shares outstanding. The dilutive effect of shares
issuable under stock options is immaterial.

4. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") Number 114,
Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan and SFAS Number
115, Accounting for Certain Investment in Debt and Equity
Securities, were issued in May, 1993. SFAS No. 114 addresses the
accounting by creditors for impairment of certain loans and applies
to all loans that are restructured in a troubled debt restructuring.
It requires that impaired loans be measured based on the present
value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's effective
interest rate. This Statement applies to financial statements for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. The Bank has not
yet decided if it will elect early adoption of this Statement, and
Management cannot estimate the effects of adoption on the financial
statements. SFAS No. 115 addresses the accounting and reporting for
investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair
values and for all investments in debt securities. Those
investments are to be classified in three categories with each
having a specified accounting method as to carrying value and
recognition of unrealized gains and losses. The Bank adopted this
Statement for fiscal year beginning October 1, 1993. As a result of
this adoption, certain investment securities and mortgage-backed
securities classified as available for sale are carried at market
value, and $481,000 of unrealized depreciation, net of related
income tax effect, on securities available for sale is shown as a
component of stockholders' equity at March 31, 1994. Prior to this
adoption, at September 30, 1993, certain investment securities and
mortgage-backed securities classified as held for sale were stated
at the lower of cost or market.

5. On January 28, 1994, BNF and Union Planters Corporation ("UPC"),
Memphis, Tennessee, announced the signing of a definitive agreement
for UPC to acquire BNF with an exchange of 1.078 shares of UPC
common stock for each share of BNF common stock. The transaction is
subject to regulatory approval and the approval of BNF shareholders.

6. On April 18, 1994, the Bank and BANKALABAMA, Huntsville, Alabama,
announced the signing of an agreement for the Bank to acquire
BANKALABAMA's Beltline Road, Decatur, Alabama branch which consists
of approximately $600,000 in deposits and approximately $200,000 in
loans receivable as well as approximately $107,000 in fixed assets.
This transaction is subject to regulatory approval.
