ITEM 2. DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On December 30, 1993, Allied Products Corporation ("Allied") sold
substantially all the assets and liabilities of its White-New Idea Farm
Equipment Division to AGCO Corporation, a Delaware corporation, ("AGCO") for
$53,480,636 paid in cash. The sale became effective as of December 31, 1993.
The purchase price was calculated as 110% of the net book value of the
purchased assets as of November 30, 1993 (net book value being calculated as
the book value (net of accumulated depreciation and other valuation reserves)
of the purchased assets less the assumed liabilities). The purchase price is
subject to a post-closing adjustment based upon a closing date balance sheet
to be provided by Allied to AGCO. The purchased assets include all inventory,
tooling, machinery and equipment, real property leases, intellectual property,
receivables and contract rights that are used primarily in, or that arise from,
the conduct of the White-New Idea Farm Equipment Division business.

Real estate used in connection with the White-New Idea business
(specifically, the plants located in Coldwater, Ohio and Kewanee, Illinois) is
being leased by Allied to AGCO. AGCO has options to purchase the Coldwater
and Kewanee real estate at a later time pursuant to two Contracts for the
Purchase and Sale of Real Property dated as of November 8, 1993 by and between
AGCO Corporation and Allied Products Corporation.

Allied used a substantial portion of the proceeds of the sale of
White-New Idea to retire senior secured debt.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of income (loss)
for the year ended December 31, 1992 and nine months ended September 30, 1993
give effect to the disposition of the White-New Idea Farm Equipment division
of Allied Products Corporation to AGCO Corporation of Norcross, Georgia. The
sale, which closed as of December 31, 1993, involves most of the division's
assets, including accounts receivable, inventories and machinery and
equipment involved in the operation of the business. Subject to certain
contingencies, the sale also includes the division's owned plant facilities
in Coldwater, Ohio and Kewanee, Illinois. This portion of the agreement is
expected to close within the next several months. Under the agreement, AGCO
also assumes certain liabilities related to the White-New Idea division.
Under the terms of the agreement, the selling price is equal to 110% of the
net book value of the assets sold less liabilities assumed.

On December 30, 1993, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately
$53,500,000 (based upon the November 30, 1993 balance sheet excluding plant
facilities described above) from AGCO Corporation. Additional cash proceeds
related to the sale of the plant facilities described above and final
determination of other account balances as of December 31, 1993 should be
received within several months. A significant portion of the proceeds
received were used to retire all of the Company's remaining senior secured
debt. Additional debt was retired with the remaining portion of the receipts.

The pro forma information is based upon the historical financial statements
of the Company giving effect to the disposition described above and
adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma
financial statements. The effect of the gain from the transaction described
above has not been included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma
consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 1992
and nine months ended September 30, 1993. The attached unaudited pro forma
consolidated balance sheet gives effect to the disposition described above.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements have been prepared
by the management of the Company and may not be indicative of the results
that actually would have occurred if the disposition had occurred on the
particular dates noted on each pro forma consolidated financial statement.
The pro forma consoldiated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the related notes contained elsewhere herein.

Explanation of pro forma adjustments:

(1). To eliminate sales associated with the White-New Idea Farm
Equipment division disposed of as noted in the
introduction. This reduction was offset in part by increased
sales resulting from certain product sales which were historically
recorded as intercompany sales.

(2). To eliminate cost of sales related to the sales adjustment
above. In addition, the amortization of a deferred credit
associated with the acquisition of this business by the Company in
1984 was eliminated.

(3). To eliminate selling and administrative expenses associated with the
White-New Idea Farm Equipment division disposed of as noted in
the introduction.

(4). To record a reduction in interest expense associated with the
utilization of proceeds received from the disposition used to
reduce outstanding debt. Interest rates used in the computation
of the reduction in interest expense approximated the actual rates
in effect on the debt retired for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1992. A variance in interest rates used of 1/8 percent
would have the effect of increasing or decreasing the pro forma
combined loss by $72.

(5). To eliminate other (income) expense associated with the White-New
Idea Farm Equipment division disposed of as noted in the
introduction.

(6). To eliminate state income taxes associated with the White-New
Idea Farm Equipment division disposed of as noted in the
introduction.

2.2.2.1 CALCULATION. The Adjustment shall be calculated and finally
determined on the date that the Purchase Price is finally determined after the

<PAGE>

12.4 MISCELLANEOUS. All statements of fact contained in this Agreement

discovers or of which notice is received after the Closing and which might give
rise to a claim by Buyer or Seller against the other under Sections 12.2 or 12.3
hereof, stating the nature, basis and amount thereof. In case of any claim by a
third party, any suit, any claim by any governmental body, or any legal,
administrative arbitration proceeding ("Third Party Claim") with respect to
which Seller or Buyer may have liability under the indemnity agreements
contained in Sections 12.2 and 12.3 hereof, the party which may have such
liability to the other shall be entitled to participate therein, and to the
extent desired, to assume the defense thereof, and after notice from Seller or
Buyer of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the assuming party will
not be liable to the other for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by the other in connection with the defense thereof, unless the assuming party
does not actually assume the defense thereof following notice of such election.
Buyer or Seller shall make available to the other and its attorneys and
accountants, at all reasonable times, all books and records relating to such
suit, claims or proceeding, and Buyer and Seller will render to each other such
assistance as may reasonably be required of each in order to insure proper and
adequate defense of any such Third Party Claim. If the indemnifying party shall
not notify the indemnified party of the indemnifying party's election to defend
any Third Party Claim (and, in the case of litigated Third Party Claims,
actually assume the defense of such Third Party Claim), the indemnified party
may defend against such Third Party Claim in such manner as it may deem

-55-

<PAGE>

appropriate and if the indemnified party shall desire to settle such Third Party
Claims, it shall give the indemnifying party prior written notice of the
proposed settlement. Within 10 days following receipt by the indemnifying party
of such written notice, the indemnifying party shall notify the indemnified
party whether or not it consents to such settlement (which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld). If the indemnifying party elects to defend any Third
Party Claim, and has actually assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall not settle the Third Party Claim without the written
consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld) and the indemnifying party shall not in the defense of any such Third
Party Claim consent to the entry of any judgment against or affecting the
indemnified party (other than a judgment of dismissal on the merits and without
costs or involving only the payment of money) except with the written consent of
the indemnified party (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld) or
enter into any settlement, except one involving only the payment of money,
unless with the written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall
not unreasonably be withheld).

solicit, divert or hire, or attempt to solicit, divert or hire, any employees of
Buyer, whether acquired pursuant to Section 8.5.1 hereof or otherwise.

13.3 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Seller acknowledges that the restrictions
contained in this Section 13 are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of the Buyer and its affiliates, and that any violations of
any provision of this Section 13 will result in irreparable injury to Buyer and
its affiliates and that, therefore, Buyer and its affiliates shall be entitled
to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in any court of competent

benefits arising from such violation, which rights shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other rights or remedies to which the Buyer or its affiliates
