____________

On May 19, 1994, the Porter County Superior Court,
Porter County, Indiana, handed down a decision, holding that
certain sections of the Indiana riverboat gaming legislation,
previously passed by the Indiana legislature, were
unconstitutional under the Indiana constitution. The gaming
legislation required all counties, except Lake County, Indiana,
to approve gaming in county referendums. In Lake County, the
county in which East Chicago, Gary and Hammond are located, the
legislature permitted the aforementioned cities to approve gaming
in city referendums. The court determined that the legislation
provided for different approval processes for various Indiana
jurisdictions, thus favoring certain jurisdictions and amounting
to "special legislation" in violation of Article IV Section 23 of
the Indiana constitution. The Porter County Superior Court
ordered the Indiana Gaming Commission to cease all activity,
except background investigations, in the processing of licensing
riverboats until such time as the legislature cures the
constitutional defects in the legislation, until further order of
the Porter County Superior Court, or until the further order of
the Indiana Supreme Court. The May 19, 1994 decision has been
appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court.
