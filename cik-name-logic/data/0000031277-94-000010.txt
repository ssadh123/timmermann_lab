Consolidated Financial Statements

September 30, 1993 and 1992 (unaudited)

December 31, 1992 and 1991

Report of Management

The enclosed financial statements have been prepared by the management of 
Westinghouse Electric Corporation in support of the January 31, 1994, purchase 
by Eaton Corporation of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities 
of the Distribution and Control Business Unit of Westinghouse Electric 
Corporation. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial 
statements and other financial information and for ascertaining that the data 
fairly reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of 
the Distribution and Control Business Unit.

The financial statements present the financial results of those operating 
units of the Distribution and Control Business Unit that were included in the 
January 31, 1994, sale to Eaton Corporation. Operations that were historically 
part of the Distribution and Control Business Unit but were not included in 
the sale, principally EMAIL-Westinghouse Pty. Ltd., an Australian operation, 
and Westinghouse Asia Controls Corporation, a Philippean operation, are not 
included in these financial statements.

The financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances, and necessarily 
include amounts that are based on best estimates and judgements with 
appropriate consideration given to materiality. Historically, Westinghouse 
Electric Corporation has not prepared general purpose financial statements for 
operating units. The preparation of these general purpose financial statements 
included the use of "carve-out" accounting procedures wherein certain 
expenses, and associated accrued liabilities, historically incurred at the 
parent company level of Westinghouse Electric Corporation on behalf of its 
operating units, have been identified and pushed-down or allocated as 
appropriate to fairly reflect the financial results of the Distribution and 
Control Business Unit for the periods shown.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Westinghouse Electric Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related 
consolidated statements of income and cash flows present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of the Distribution and Control 
Business Unit (DCBU), an organizational unit of Westinghouse Electric 
Corporation (Westinghouse), at December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the results of 
their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are 
the responsibility of Westinghouse's management; our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We 
conducted our audits of the statements in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, 
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that 
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note 2 to these financial statements, DCBU adopted Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for 
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and SFAS No. 109, "Accounting 
for Income Taxes," in 1992. DCBU is an organizational unit of Westinghouse 
and, as disclosed in Note 3 to the accompanying financial statements, has 
engaged in various transactions and relationships with other Westinghouse 
entities.

Notes to the Financial Statements

Note 1: Basis of Presentation

Effective January 31, 1994, Eaton Corporation (Eaton) acquired certain assets 
and assumed certain liabilities of the Distribution and Control Business Unit 
(DCBU) of Westinghouse Electric Corporation under a Purchase Agreement dated 
August 10, 1993 (the Agreement). Operations that were historically part of 
DCBU but were not included in the Agreement are not included in these 
financial statements. For purposes of these financial statements, DCBU relates 
only to those operations which are included as part of the Agreement.

DCBU was an organizational unit of Westinghouse Electric Corporation and its 
majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively 
Westinghouse). Westinghouse Electric Corporation (WELCO or the parent company) 
is incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Its subsidiaries and 
affiliates are incorporated or registered in other jurisdictions in the U.S. 
and a number of other countries. DCBU is not a distinct legal entity.

DCBU manufactures, distributes and sells a broad range of industrial and 
commercial electrical equipment to markets worldwide. Organizationally, DCBU 
includes divisions of WELCO; divisions of Westinghouse de Puerto Rico; 
divisions of Westinghouse Canada, Inc.; Challenger Electrical Equipment 
Corporation (Challenger); Ottermill, Ltd.; Westinghouse de Venezuela S.A.; 
Westinghouse do Brazil S.A.; Equipos Westinghouse S.A. de C.V.; and other 
subsidiaries and affiliates.

The Securities and Exchange Commission, in Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 55 
(SAB 55), requires that historical financial statements of a subsidiary, 
division, or lesser business component of another entity include certain 
expenses incurred by the parent on its behalf. These expenses include officer 
and employee salaries, rent or depreciation, advertising, accounting and legal 
services, other selling, general and administrative expenses and other such 
expenses. These financial statements include such adjustments.

Historically, DCBU's results of domestic operations have been included in the 
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of Westinghouse. DCBU's results 
of operations in Puerto Rico and certain operations in Canada were also 
included with other Westinghouse operations in tax returns in those 
jurisdictions. For operations that do not pay their own income tax, 
Westinghouse internally allocates income tax expense at the statutory rate 
after adjustment for state income taxes, Puerto Rican tax exemptions, and 
several other items. The income tax expense and other tax related information 
in these statements has been calculated as if DCBU had not been eligible to be 
included in the consolidated tax returns of Westinghouse. The calculation of 
tax provisions and deferred taxes necessarily required certain assumptions, 
allocations and estimates which management believes are reasonable to 
accurately reflect the tax reporting for DCBU as a stand-alone taxpayer.

These consolidated financial statements include the historical financial 
position, results of operations, and cash flows of DCBU previously included in 
the Westinghouse consolidated financial statements. These consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared by Westinghouse management in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include such 
estimates and adjustments as deemed necessary to present fairly the 
consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of DCBU 
for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991. 

In the opinion of the management of Westinghouse, the unaudited consolidated 
financial statements for the nine month periods ended September 30, 1993 and 
1992, include all material adjustments necessary to present fairly DCBU's 
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for those periods. 
Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of the nine 
month periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire years.

DCBU receives certain services and participates in certain centralized 
Westinghouse activities, the allocated costs of which are included in these 
financial statements. See note 3.

Note 2: Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DCBU after 
elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions other than those with 
other units of Westinghouse as described in note 3. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Sales are recorded primarily as products are shipped and services are 
rendered.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets are amortized under the 
straight-line method over their useful lives, which are estimated to 
approximate 40 years.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

DCBU considers all investment securities with a maturity of three months or 
less when acquired to be cash equivalents. See note 3.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates 
actual cost on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Inventoried 
costs include direct material, direct labor, and certain overheads. See note 
9.

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Plant and equipment assets are recorded at cost and depreciated generally 
under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures 
for additions and improvements are capitalized, and costs for repairs and 
maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. DCBU limits capitalization 
of newly acquired assets to those assets with cost in excess of $500. See note 
11.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

Estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of sale of the warranted 
product. The warranty costs are estimated and accrued based on historical 
warranty costs incurred on the revenue earned on the sale of the product.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

It is the policy of DCBU to expense or capitalize, as appropriate, 
environmental expenditures that relate to current operations. Expenditures 
that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and which do 
not contribute to current or future revenue generation are expensed. DCBU 
accrues reserves when environmental assessments or remedial efforts are 
probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such reserves are adjusted 
if necessary based upon the completion of a formal study and the information 
obtained thereby. See note 17.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Results of foreign operations, other than those located in countries with 
highly inflationary economies, are translated into U.S. dollars using average 
exchange rates during the period, while assets and liabilities are translated 
into U.S. dollars using current rates. The resulting translation adjustments 
are recorded as deferred foreign currency translation adjustments in total 
investment. Currency gains and losses resulting from translation of operations 
in highly inflationary economies and all gains and losses resulting from 
foreign currency transactions are determined using a combination of current 
and historical rates and are reported as foreign currency transactions in 
other income. DCBU operations in Venezuela, Brazil and Mexico are translated 
under the highly inflationary approach.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

Effective January 1, 1992, DCBU adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits 
Other Than Pensions," on the immediate recognition basis. This statement 
requires that the cost of certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits 
for eligible retirees and dependents be recognized in the financial statements 
during the employees' service with DCBU. DCBU's previous practice was to 
expense these costs as incurred. See note 5.

In 1992, DCBU adopted SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial 
Instruments." This statement is an extension of SFAS No. 105, "Disclosures of 
Information about Financial Instruments with Concentrations of Credit Risks," 
adopted in a prior year, and requires the disclosure of the fair value of 
certain financial instruments. See note 19.

In 1992, DCBU adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," 
retroactively to 1990. See note 7.

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" which requires 
employers to adopt accrual accounting for workers' compensation, salary 
continuation, medical and life insurance continuation, severance benefits and 
disability benefits provided former or inactive employees after employment but 
before retirement. The statement is effective beginning in 1994 and requires 
immediate recognition as a cumulative effect adjustment for the change in 
accounting for postemployment benefits. DCBU plans to adopt SFAS No. 112 in 
1994. DCBU is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 
112 and estimates its pre-tax effect to be between $9.0 million and $11.0 
million.

Note 3: Related-Party Transactions

DCBU purchases products from and sells products to other Westinghouse 
operations. DCBU also purchases certain services from Westinghouse, including 
liability, property and workers' compensation insurance. These transactions 
are discussed in further detail below.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

DCBU utilizes the Westinghouse centralized cash management services in North 
America and several foreign countries. Under such service arrangements, 
accounts receivable are collected and cash is invested centrally. 
Additionally, disbursing operations are funded centrally on demand. As a 
result, DCBU carries little cash but receives charges and credits against 
parent company investment for cash used and collected through a central 
clearinghouse arrangement.

INTERCOMPANY PURCHASES

DCBU purchases products and services from other Westinghouse operations. For 
intercompany purchases in the U.S., DCBU uses the central clearinghouse 
arrangement through which intercompany transactions are settled at the 
transfer date.

Accounts payable to related parties represents payable balances for purchases 
from units of Westinghouse that do not participate in the central 
clearinghouse arrangement. 

INTERCOMPANY SALES AND RECEIVABLES

DCBU sells products to Westinghouse Electric Supply Company (WESCO) and 
various other Westinghouse operations on a commercial basis. DCBU receives 
credit through the central clearinghouse for sales to WESCO when products are 
shipped. Therefore, there are no intercompany receivables for domestic WESCO 
sales in these financial statements because such transactions are accounted 
for on an immediate settlement basis.

In 1992 and 1991, intercompany sales included $336.5 million and $347.0 
million to WESCO.

DCBU sales to WESCO have historically been governed on a commercial basis by 
internal Westinghouse interunit arrangements. Westinghouse has entered into a 
distributor agreement with Eaton which allows for the purchase and resale of 
certain DCBU products by WESCO. The terms and conditions of the distributor 
agreement permit DCBU products to be sold to WESCO on a commercial basis for 
an initial five year period, subject to specified termination provisions. 
Westinghouse has announced its intention to sell WESCO. Westinghouse intends 
that any buyer of WESCO would assume the obligations of Westinghouse under the 
terms and conditions of the distributor agreement.

Accounts receivable from related parties represents the accounts receivable 
from sales to units of Westinghouse that do not participate in the central 
clearinghouse arrangement. None of the allowance for doubtful accounts balance 
relates to these receivables. 

CORPORATE SERVICES

DCBU uses, and is charged directly for, certain services that Westinghouse 
provides to its business units. These services include telephone services, 
information systems support, certain accounting functions, legal services, 
environmental affairs and benefit administration. DCBU also purchases other 
Westinghouse internally-provided services as required. These services include 
printing, freight forwarding, warranty and repair services, productivity and 
quality consulting, recruiting and administrative support for Caribbean 
activities.

Westinghouse centrally develops, negotiates and administers DCBU's insurance 
programs. The insurance includes a broad all-risk coverage for real and 
personal property and third-party liability coverage, and employer's liability 
coverage, automobile liability, general product liability and other standard 
liability coverage. Westinghouse also maintains a program of self-insurance 
for workers' compensation in the U.S. A portion of the cost of this program is 
charged to DCBU based on claims history.

The Westinghouse Science and Technology Center (STC) provides support to DCBU 
relating to new product development. STC is the Westinghouse corporate central 
research and development organization. DCBU is charged for all such research 
and development costs as they are incurred as immediate settlement 
transactions through the Westinghouse central clearinghouse.

All of the charges described above are included as costs of DCBU's operations 
in these financial statements. Such charges by Westinghouse to DCBU are based 
on either a direct cost pass through or a percentage allocation of total costs 
for the service provided. Where percentage allocations are used, such 
allocations are based on DCBU's percent utilization compared to that of all 
Westinghouse organizations. These costs have been allocated to DCBU on a basis 
that management believes is reasonable. However, management believes that it 
is possible that the terms of these transactions may differ from those that 
would result from transactions among unrelated parties. The charges to DCBU 
for the above services were $39.5 million and $37.7 million in 1992 and 1991 
respectively. 

In addition, Westinghouse also allocates a certain portion of its corporate 
expenses to each business unit. These allocated costs include Westinghouse 
executive management and corporate overhead; benefit costs associated with 
retired and divested business employees; corporate-related pension charges; 
audit, tax and treasury services; and other support and executive functions. 
DCBU's domestic credit and collection activities are administered centrally by 
the Westinghouse treasury group, and the cost of this service is included in 
the corporate-allocated cost.

Corporate expenses are allocated to DCBU based primarily on payroll dollars. 
Such allocations are not necessarily indicative of actual results and it is 
not practical for management to estimate the level of expenses that might have 
been incurred had DCBU operated as a separate stand-alone entity. The 
following table presents the costs charged to DCBU for such expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 1992 1991
---- ----
Credit and collection $ 2.5 $ 2.5

All other allocated
services and costs $13.4 $14.2

OTHER SERVICES

DCBU's sales forces sell the products of certain other Westinghouse divisions, 
including Westinghouse Motor Co., Engineering & Repair Services, Specialty 
Products and WESCO. For performing such services, DCBU receives a commission 
that is offset against selling expenses. For the years ended December 31, 1992 
and 1991, these commissions totalled $6.7 million and $6.0 million, 
respectively.

INTEREST

DCBU receives a charge from Westinghouse for the carrying cost of parent 
company investment in the form of interest expense. The charge is based on 
DCBU's average total investment and is adjusted annually. DCBU's allocated 
interest expense was $23.1 million and $20.1 million in 1992 and 1991. The 
effective annual percentage rate for interest expense was approximately 10 
percent in both years. For purposes of these financial statements, interest 
paid is assumed to equal interest expense.

Note 4: Pensions

Westinghouse sponsors various pension arrangements covering substantially all 
domestic and foreign DCBU employees. Most plan benefits are based on either 
years of service and compensation levels at the time of retirement, a formula 
based on career earnings or a final average compensation amount. Pension 
benefits are paid from trusts funded by contributions from employees and 
Westinghouse. The pension funding policy is consistent with the funding 
requirements of U.S. federal and other government laws and regulations. Plan 
assets consist primarily of listed stocks, fixed income securities and real 
estate investments.

DCBU's pension arrangements include both single-employer and multiemployer 
plans as defined in SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions." DCBU's 
single-employer plans consist of the pension plans of Challenger (Challenger 
plans) and are discussed below. For purposes of these financial statements, 
DCBU's multiemployer plans include the Westinghouse Pension Plan, Westinghouse 
Executive Pension Plan, Westinghouse Canada Inc. Pension Plan for Hourly 
Employees, Westinghouse Canada Inc. Consolidated Pension Plan for Salaried 
Employees, and Westinghouse Pension Plan for Operations in Puerto Rico 
(multiemployer plans). All of these plans are defined benefit plans and are 
sponsored by Westinghouse. They include various domestic and foreign employees 
of DCBU as well as other domestic and foreign employees of Westinghouse. For 
multiemployer plans, employers are required to recognize as net pension 
expense total contributions for the period. For 1992 and 1991, DCBU's pension 
expense for multiemployer plans was $10.1 million and $9.8 million, 
respectively. There were no contributions due and unpaid at December 31, 1992 
and 1991.

Net periodic pension cost for 1992 and 1991, and the funding status at 
December 31, 1992 and 1991, for the Challenger plans are as follows:

For the Challenger plans in both periods, an 8.5 percent discount rate and a 7 
percent rate of increase in future compensation levels, for the plans to which 
such increase applies, were used in determining the actuarial present value of 
the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on 
plan assets was 9.5 percent.

For financial reporting purposes, a pension plan is considered underfunded 
when the fair value of the plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit 
obligation. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, a minimum pension liability must 
be recognized for the sum of the underfunded amount plus any prepaid 
contributions. In recognizing such a liability, an intangible asset, limited 
to the sum of the prior service cost not yet recognized and the unrecognized 
transition obligation, is usually recorded. Any liability amount to be 
recognized in excess of the intangible asset limit should be charged to 
equity. At December 31, 1992 and 1991, for the underfunded Challenger plans, 
additional minimum pension liabilities of $.5 million and $.3 million, 
respectively, were recognized for the difference between the underfunded 
accumulated benefit obligations of $.6 million and $.4 million, respectively, 
and the accrued pension costs of $.1 million. An intangible asset of $.5 
million at December 31, 1992, and $.3 million at December 31, 1991, offset the 
additional minimum pension liability.

</TABLE>

In June 1993, Westinghouse changed the actuarial assumptions regarding future 
events for the multiemployer plans. Those changes included lowering the 
discount, wage escalation, and return on plan asset rates. As a result of 
those changes it is estimated that DCBU's 1993 full year pension expense for 
multiemployer plans will be approximately 40 percent higher than the 1992 
level. Additionally, effective December 31, 1993, Westinghouse made further 
changes in its pension actuarial assumptions. It is estimated that DCBU's full 
year 1994 pension expense for multiemployer plans will be approximately 20 
percent higher than the 1993 estimated level. The actuarial assumptions in use 
by Westinghouse for 1994 are a discount rate of 7.25 percent, a wage increase 
rate of 4.0 percent, and a return on plan asset rate of 9.75 percent.

As discussed above, the Challenger plans use actuarial assumptions different 
from those in the multiemployer plans. While an actuarial study to determine 
the effect of such rate changes on the Challenger plans has not been prepared, 
it could reasonably be expected that the resulting rate of change in 
Challenger pension expense would be less than that experienced in the 
multiemployer plans.

Note 5: Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

Westinghouse sponsors defined benefit postretirement plans that provide 
medical, dental and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and 
dependents, including DCBU's eligible retirees located in the U.S., Puerto 
Rico and Canada. During 1992, Westinghouse adopted SFAS 106, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," on the immediate 
recognition basis. This statement requires employers that sponsor single-
employer defined benefit postretirement plans to recognize net periodic 
postretirement benefit costs during an employee's service to the employer and, 
when adopted on the immediate recognition basis, a transition obligation for 
postretirement benefits accumulated by employees in earlier periods. However, 
for the purposes of these financial statements, DCBU is considered to have 
participated in a multiemployer postretirement benefit plan as defined in SFAS 
106. Therefore, no provision has been made in these financial statements to 
recognize an obligation for accumulated postretirement benefits.

For multiemployer plans, employers are required to recognize as net post-
retirement benefit costs, total contributions for the period. For 1992, DCBU's 
net postretirement benefit cost for multiemployer plans was $10.5 million 
which represents DCBU's contribution to Westinghouse for eligible retiree and 
dependent benefits.

Certain of DCBU's non-U.S. subsidiaries have private and government-sponsored 
plans for retirees. The cost of these plans is not material to DCBU.

Deferred federal income taxes for 1993 include a benefit of $0.4 million 
resulting from the enactment of an increase in the statutory federal income 
tax rate from 34% to 35%.

In 1992, DCBU adopted SFAS No. 109 retroactive to 1990.

The foreign portion of income or loss before income taxes in the consolidated 
statement of income was a loss of $0.4 million for nine months of 1993, income 
of $1.2 million in 1992, and a loss of $5.1 million in 1991.

Deferred federal income taxes have not been provided on cumulative 
undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries, totaling $7.1 million at 
December 31, 1992, in which the earnings have been reinvested for an 
indefinite time. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability 
that would result had such earnings been repatriated. The amount of 
withholding taxes that would be payable upon such repatriation is estimated to 
be $0.5 million.

Net income includes income of certain manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico 
which are exempt from U.S. income tax and partially exempt from Puerto Rican 
income tax under grants of industrial tax exemptions. These tax exemptions 
provided net tax benefits of $5.1 million for nine months of 1993, $5.2 
million in 1992, and $8.4 million in 1991. The exemptions will expire at 
various dates from 1997 through 2007. The 1993 Revenue Reconciliation Act 
places limits on the amount of tax benefits available to U.S. corporations in 
Puerto Rico beginning in 1994. These limitations are not expected to have a 
material effect on DCBU's results of operations as an historical stand-alone 
taxpayer.

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the financial bases 
and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The type of differences that give 
rise to significant portions of deferred income tax liabilities or assets are 
shown in the accompanying table.

have no expiration date.

At September 30, 1993 there were $14.3 million of net operating loss 
carryforwards attributable to foreign subsidiaries. Of this total, 
approximately $6.5 million will expire in 1997 and the balance has no 
expiration date. A valuation allowance of $4.2 million related to those losses 
has been established since it is considered more likely than not that the 
benefit will not be realized.

federal tax returns of all years through December 31, 1992 will have no 
material effect on DCBU for purposes of these financial statements.

Note 8: Customer Accounts Receivable, net

Allowances for doubtful accounts of $4.8 million and $4.9 million at December 
31, 1992 and 1991, respectively, were deducted from customer receivables. As 
of December 31, 1992 and 1991, DCBU had no significant concentrations of 
credit risk due to the large number of customers comprising the DCBU customer 
base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic 
areas. DCBU performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally 
does not require collateral.

Note 17: Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

DCBU is a party to personal injury and property damage litigation arising out 
of incidents involving the use of its products. Annually, Westinghouse 
administers DCBU's product liability insurance program based on DCBU's current 
and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance. 
The combination of these annual programs constitutes DCBU's aggregate product 
liability insurance coverage. DCBU's program for 1992 was comprised of a self-
insurance retention and catastrophic coverage in excess of the retention. 
Cumulative amounts estimated to be payable by DCBU with respect to pending and 
potential claims for all years in which DCBU is liable under its self-
insurance retention are $24.8 million at September 30, 1993, $25.3 million at 
December 31, 1992, and $26.0 million at December 31, 1991. These amounts have 
been accrued for in these financial statements. See note 15.

Environmental:

It is the policy of Westinghouse to operate and maintain its facilities in 
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations to protect the environment 
and the health and safety of its employees. Compliance with federal, state and 
local regulations relating to the discharge of substances into the 
environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other related activities 
affecting the environment have had and will continue to have an impact on the 
operations of DCBU. Thus far, compliance with environmental requirements and 
resolution of environmental claims has been accomplished without material 
adverse effect on DCBU's liquidity, competitive status, financial condition or 
results of operations.

While it is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate costs to be incurred 
in the future due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, 
technology and information available for individual sites, management has 
estimated the reasonably possible remediation costs that could be incurred by 
DCBU based on the facts and circumstances known currently. Such estimates 
include the professional judgment of Westinghouse's environmental experts, 
outside environmental specialists and other experts and, when necessary, legal 
counsel. In addition, the likelihood that other parties which also have been 
named as potential responsible parties (PRP's) will have the financial 
resources to fulfill their obligations at superfund sites where they are also 
liable has been considered.

In accordance with the above policy, there are several ongoing environmental 
evaluations and remediation programs under federal and state superfund laws 
for which Westinghouse has responsibility on behalf of DCBU. These programs 
involve investigations and remediation actions at DCBU's Beaver, Pennsylvania, 
and Horseheads, New York, facilities, and related investigations and 
remediation resulting from alleged off-site contamination and waste disposal 
from the facilities.

In addition, five sites acquired as part of the Challenger acquisition in 
1987, four of which have been sold, are subject to ongoing soil, ground water 
and underground tank remediation. The remediation is the responsibility of and 
is being borne by Challenger's predecessors in interest. Virtually all of the 
remedial work addressing these environmental concerns has been completed. 
Westinghouse has full indemnities for these identified environmental 
liabilities at the five Challenger sites, and therefore, management believes 
it has no obligation for funding the completion of the remedial work.

Management has estimated the total probable costs which could be incurred for 
remediation of the above mentioned environmental sites to be approximately 
$10.0 million at September 30, 1993, $16.4 million at December 31, 1992 and 
$17.6 million at December 31, 1991. These amounts have been accrued for in 
these financial statements. Management believes that the total remaining 
reasonably possible costs which could be incurred for remediation of the above 
mentioned environmental sites, none of which have been accrued, will not have 
a material adverse effect on DCBU's liquidity, competitive status, financial 
condition or results of operations. See note 15.

Note 18: Leases

DCBU has commitments under operating leases for certain machinery and 
equipment and facilities used in various operations. Rental expense in 1992 
and 1991 was $19.1 million and $22.1 million, respectively. These amounts 
include immaterial amounts for contingent rentals and sublease income.

Note 19: Financial Instruments

The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by DCBU 
using the best available market information and appropriate valuation 
methodologies. Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily 
indicative of the amounts that DCBU could realize in a current market exchange 
or the value that ultimately will be realized by DCBU upon maturity or 
disposition.

At December 31, 1992, DCBU held foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
maturing in 1993 for the purchase or sale of European and Canadian currencies 
to hedge foreign currency transactions. Open sales contracts totalled $9.7 
million. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts which 
hedge specific transactions are recognized in net income, offsetting the 
underlying foreign currency transaction gains or losses.

Note 20: Business Segment and Geographical Region Information

DCBU operates solely in the industrial and commercial electrical equipment 
market segment. DCBU's products include electromechanical and electronic 
controls, motor starters, programmable controllers, sensors, circuit breakers, 
load centers, safety switches, panelboards, busway, commercial switches,
