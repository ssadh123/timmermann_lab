Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On April 18, 1994, Advanced Technology Laboratories, Inc. ("ATL" or
the "Company" ) and Interspec, Inc. ("Interspec") distributed to each
of its respective shareholders a Notice and Proxy Statement/Prospectus
seeking approval for a previously announced Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the "Merger") whereby Interspec would become a wholly owned
subsidiary of ATL through an exchange of 0.413 shares of ATL stock for
each share of Interspec stock.

On May 16, 1994, ATL announced that its shareholders had approved the
Merger. Also, on May 16, 1994, Interspec announced that its
shareholders had approved the issuance of ATL stock to consummate the
Merger.

On May 17, 1994, the effective date of the Merger, ATL Sub Acquisition
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of ATL, was merged with Interspec,
with Interspec continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly
owned subsidiary of ATL with 100 shares of common stock outstanding.
Also, on May 17, 1994, ATL announced that the Merger transaction had
been completed and that the Company would be mailing transmittal forms
to Interspec's shareholders to exchange their Interspec stock
certificates for ATL certificates. Effective at 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Daylight Savings Time on May 17, 1994, all shares of the Interspec
common stock ceased to be outstanding and traded, and each share of
Interspec common stock thereafter represents a right to acquire 0.413
shares of ATL common stock issued in connection with the Merger.

Following the merger, the fiscal year end for the combined companies
will end December 31, consistent with ATL's fiscal year. In order to
conform the financial reporting periods of the two companies, the
results of Interspec's operations for the one month period ended March
31, 1994 will be excluded from the consolidated statements of income
and cash flows and be reported as an adjustment to retained earnings.

The Company is anticipating incurring expenses of approximately $3
million for the integration of the operations of ATL and Interspec
associated with the termination of Interspec dealer arrangements and
consolidation of operations in countries outside the United States,
compared to $2 million previously estimated. In addition, in a recent
development, accounts receivable of approximately $1.5 million have
been garnished in the bankruptcy proceeding of Interspec's former
Italian distributor, a proceeding reported in Interspec's Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended February 28, 1994. As a
result, a reserve of $2.2 million has been established for the $1.5
million in garnished receivables and the remaining unreserved
receivable of $0.7 million owed Interspec by the Italian distributor.
Approximately $2.1 million of the estimated $5.2 million total of the
two preceeding non recurring operating expense items was incurred by
Interspec in March 1994 and will not be reported in the Company's
second quarter statement of income, but will be charged to retained
earnings due to the conformance of financial reporting periods as
discussed above. Additionally, as previously reported, Merger costs
of approximately $2.3 million relating primarily to legal, accounting,
investment advisory and printing services will be charged against
income in the second quarter of 1994.

SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE ATL/INTERSPEC MERGER

SEATTLE, Washington, May 16, 1994--ATL (Advanced Technology
Laboratories, Inc.), a worldwide leader in diagnostic
medical ultrasound, announced today that shareholders of
both ATL and Interspec, Inc. have approved the merger of the
two companies. Interspec, a leader in the U.S. cardiology
ultrasound market, will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
ATL through an exchange of one share of Interspec stock for
0.413 shares of ATL stock. On a 1993 basis, the acquisition
creates an ultrasound company with combined revenues of
approximately $360 million, an installed base of over 20,000
systems and a product line spanning all major clinical
applications.

"This acquisition broadens and complements our strong
position in the premium performance general imaging markets
led by the success of our digital High Definition (tm) Imaging
system," said Dennis C. Fill, ATL Chairman and CEO. "Nearly
half of ATL's revenues were generated by the international
markets in 1993. With the addition of Interspec, we obtain
an excellent base from which to address the growing
international demand for mid-priced, high quality ultrasound
systems as well as immediately expand our position in the
U.S. cardiology market. We believe that Interspec's high quality
Apogee (r) systems, designed specifically to meet the needs
of the radiology and cardiology mid-range markets, will be a 
strategic asset in ATL's growth."

The merger agreement provides that Edward Ray, currently
Interspec Chairman and CEO, will continue as president of
Interspec and join the ATL Board of Directors. The
transaction is anticipated to close on May 17, 1994.
Interspec stock (Nasdaq:ISPC) will cease trading as of the
close of business on that day. Concurrently, Ralph M.
Barford is stepping down from the ATL Board as part of a
decision to reduce his corporate activities.

ATL, with headquarters in Bothell, Washington, is a
worldwide leader in the development, manufacture,
distribution and service of diagnostic medical ultrasound
systems. ATL stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market
under the symbol ATLI. Interspec is located in Ambler,
Pennsylvania.
