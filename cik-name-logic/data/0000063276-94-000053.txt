MATTEL THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS INCREASE 26 PERCENT;
MOMENTUM ASSURES ANOTHER RECORD YEAR
------------------------------------

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 18 -- Mattel, Inc. today reported record net

income of $131.8 million or $.72 per share for the third quarter

ended Sept. 30, 1994, up 26 percent from $104.7 million or $.58

per share in the 1993 quarter. Net sales also reached record

levels, increasing 16 percent to $1.04 billion from $897 million

last year.

For the first nine months of 1994, net income increased 30

percent to a record $213.0 million or $1.15 per share, versus

$163.9 million or $.91 per share in the first nine months of 1993

before accounting changes. Net sales were a record $2.17

billion, up 11 percent from $1.95 billion in 1993.

"We are most pleased with Mattel's performance for the third

quarter and nine months," John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and

chief executive officer, said. "Despite the fact that shipping

patterns are changing to later in the year and many countries

outside the United States continue to be in a recessionary

environment, Mattel's performance in each quarter this year has

exceeded our expectations," he said.

"The company's capacity to generate cash continues to be

excellent. Mattel's senior debt, net of acquisitions, declined

by more than $80 million versus year ago, and cash is up by

approximately $35 million versus the same time last year,"

Amerman said. "As was expected, the Kransco and Spear

acquisitions only had a minor effect on third quarter

profitability. We do anticipate profitable impact from these

acquisitions in the fourth quarter, which will help ensure

achievement of our 1994 goal.

"Strong consumer demand for the full range of Mattel

products, coupled with our unique ability to support retailer

requirements, bodes well for the 1994 holiday season," he said.

"Excellent growth of Barbie in the U.S. has been a strong

foundation for our success in 1994. Disney products, led by 'The

Lion King'; Fisher-Price toys; Hot Wheels vehicles and playsets,

and Polly Pocket are helping to draw consumers into toy retail

stores. As a result, we are confident that 1994 will be the

sixth consecutive year of record sales and record earnings for

Mattel," Amerman said.

Mattel, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design,

manufacture and marketing of children's toys. With headquarters

in El Segundo, California, Mattel has offices and facilities in

34 foreign countries and sells its products in more than 140

nations throughout the world.
