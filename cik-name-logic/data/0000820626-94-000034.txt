The following is the text of a press release relating to senior
management changes of the Company. 

The following is the text of a press release relating to a dam
breach at the Florida joint venture.

NORTHBROOK, IL., October 3, 1994 -- IMC Fertilizer Group, Inc.
(NYSE symbol: IFL) reported today that an earthern dam breach which
occurred Sunday afternoon at an IMC-Agrico Company phosphate mining
facility in central Florida has been contained, and that most of the
water released during the breach period is being contained on the
property of the Company and neighboring CF Industries. CF has found
it necessary to discharge limited amounts of the release into a
creek. 

The water, which contains clay separated from phosphate ore, was
being stored in a pond until the clay settled prior to reclamation of
the site for agricultural use. The clay is a natural soil material
and it is unlikely that anything other than limited amounts of clay
will be discharged. The creek is being monitored to determine if
there are any adverse effects to aquatic life.

A 250-foot wide breach was discovered in a settling pond dam at
the Company's Payne Creek Mining operation by employees conducting
one of three regular daily inspections of the dams. The Company
estimates that approximately 5,500 acre-feet of water was lost from
the pond; however, most of this water remains on IMC-Agrico and CF
Industries mining lands. Based on current information, the Company
believes it may have violated turbidity discharge permits but expects
there to be minimal environmental impact. 

The Company said that after discovering the breach it immediately
notified the Florida Department of Environmental Protection which had
a representative on site monitoring the repairs throughout the
night. All other appropriate agencies also were notified.
Appropriate resources were mobilized to repair the dam and contain
the water loss from the pond. 

"We do not know what caused the breach," said IMC-Agrico's John
A. Brafford, vice president for phosphate operations; "however, every
available resource is being employed to address the situation. We
are indebted to the dedicated people who worked to quickly repair the
dam and contain the water loss."

We are currently investigating the cause of the breach but
believe that the fact that Florida recently experienced its wettest
summer since 1948 may be a factor.

IMC-Agrico is a joint venture between IMC and
Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners (NYSE: FRP) a 51% owned
affiliate of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FTX). IMC manages
the joint venture.
