Item 5. Other Events

CILCORP Inc. (the Company), a holding company, is the parent of 
Central Illinois Light Company (CILCO). CILCO is a public utility 
under the laws of the State of Illinois and, as such, is subject to 
regulation by the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) and the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission.

On December 12, 1994, the ICC issued a rate order designed 
to grant CILCO a $10.6 million, or 6.7%, annual increase in base 
rate gas revenues. The order represents approximately 75 percent of 
CILCO's original rate increase request. The new rates, designed to 
yield a return on common equity of 11.82 percent, are expected to go 
into effect the week of December 12, 1994. Reference is made to Form 10-K
of CILCORP and CILCO for the year ended December 31, 1993, and Form 10-Q
for the nine months ended September 30, 1994, under the heading
CILCO Gas Rate Increase Request.

As a part of its rate order, the ICC disallowed approximately $7.5 
million of CILCO's investment in the Springfield cast iron renewal 
project. Of this amount, CILCO previously recorded a pre-tax charge of 
approximately $4.6 million against third quarter 1994 earnings. CILCO 
plans to record the remaining disallowance through a one-time, pre-tax 
charge of approximately $2.9 million against fourth quarter net income.
