KNOWLEDGEWARE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)

- - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared by [KnowledgeWare] pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission regarding interim financial reporting.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements
and should be read in conjunction with the most recent annual audited financial
statements of [KnowledgeWare]. In the opinion of [KnowledgeWare's] management,
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all 
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. Operating results for the three
months ended September 30, 1994 are not necessarily indicative of the results 
expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1995.

2. Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share

Net income (loss) per common share is based on [KnowledgeWare's] Common Stock
and is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common
equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common equivalent
shares consist of stock options and are calculated based on the treasury stock
method.

3. Income Taxes

[KnowledgeWare] provides for income taxes at the end of each interim period 
based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. Cumulative
adjustments to the tax provision are recorded in the interim period in which a
change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined. KnowledgeWare's
net income tax for the first quarter of fiscal 1995 is zero as a result of
significant operating losses. No benefit has been recorded due to limitations
based on a valuation allowance.

4. Inventory

The components of inventory consist of the following (in thousands):

5. Legal Proceedings

On December 18, 1991, a complaint was filed in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division which consolidated
and amended several class action lawsuits previously filed against KnowledgeWare
in October 1991 (the "1991 Class Action"). The 1991 Class Action was a class
action lawsuit alleging violations of Sections 20 and 10(b) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. In summary, the complaint alleged
KnowledgeWare misrepresented or failed to disclose material facts which would
have a material adverse impact on KnowledgeWare or approved such
misrepresentations and omissions. The complaint sought compensatory damages and
reimbursements for the plaintiffs' fees and expenses. On January 26, 1994,
KnowledgeWare entered into and the District Court preliminarily approved a
stipulation of settlement in this lawsuit. By entering into the settlement,
KnowledgeWare did not admit the allegations in the suit and, to the

contrary, denied any wrongdoing. The settlement, which received final court
approval in April 1994, required a cash payment of $1,750,000, all of which was
paid by KnowledgeWare's insurance carrier, and the issuance by KnowledgeWare of
warrants, which allow the holders to acquire an aggregate of 500,000 shares of
KnowledgeWare's Common Stock at a price of $17.50 per share. The warrants are
exercisable for a period of three years from June 9, 1994 (the date of
issuance). On August 30, 1994, the plaintiffs in the 1991 Class Action filed a
motion (the "Motion") alleging that the proposed business combination between
KnowledgeWare and Sterling and the announcement by KnowledgeWare that it
modified its accounting policy for revenue recognition and restated financial
results for the first three quarters of fiscal year 1994 resulted in a
substantially reduced value of the warrants available to the plaintiffs under
the stipulation of settlement. Accordingly, the plaintiffs moved the District
Court for a decree of specific performance of the terms of the stipulation of
settlement entailing the delivery of new warrants of equivalent value to the
original value of the warrants, and for a preliminary injunction of the
consummation of any business combination between KnowledgeWare and Sterling,
pending compliance by KnowledgeWare with the terms of the stipulation of
settlement. Alternatively, the plaintiffs moved for a declaration that the
warrant agreement set forth in the stipulation of settlement was the product of
fraud and for an award to the plaintiffs of the appropriate measure of damages.
Subsequent to the filing of the Motion, the plaintiffs filed a motion with the
District Court to withdraw the request for a preliminary injunction of the
business combination between KnowledgeWare and Sterling.

On August 30 and 31, 1994, five lawsuits were filed against KnowledgeWare in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta
Division. The respective cases are styled as follows: (1) Marshall Wolf, on
behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v. KnowledgeWare, Inc.,
Francis A. Tarkenton, Donald P. Addington, and Rick W. Gossett, Civil Action
File No. 1:94-CV-2312-JEC; (2) Ernest Deangelis, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated v. KnowledgeWare, Inc., Francis A. Tarkenton, Donald
P. Addington, and Rick W. Gossett, Civil Action No. 1:94-CV-2303-JEC; (3) Steven
Covington, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v.
KnowledgeWare, Inc., Francis A. Tarkenton, Donald P. Addington, and Rick W.
Gossett, Civil Action File No. 1:94-CV-2301-JEC; (4) Sam Wietschner v.
KnowledgeWare, Inc., Francis A. Tarkenton, Donald P. Addington, and Rick W.
Gossett, Civil Action File No. 1:94-CV-2320-JEC; and (5) Jack Schecter v.
KnowledgeWare, Inc., Francis A. Tarkenton, Donald P. Addington, and Rick W.
Gossett, Civil Action File No. 1:94-CV-2302-JEC. Three lawsuits were filed
against KnowledgeWare in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia, Atlanta Division on September 12, 22 and 23, 1994. The
respective cases are styled as follows: (6) Subhash Bhardwaj, on behalf of
himself and all others similarly situated v. KnowledgeWare, Inc., Francis A.
Tarkenton, Donald P. Addington, and Rick W. Gossett, Civil Action File No. 1:94-
CV-2427-JEC; (7) Wayne D. Thornhill, individually, as Attorney in Fact for
Georgette C. Thornhill, and on behalf of himself and all others similarly
situated v. KnowledgeWare, Inc., Francis A. Tarkenton, Donald P. Addington, and
Rick W. Gossett, Civil Action File No. 1:94-CV-2538-JEC; and (8) Paul Cross, on
behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v. KnowledgeWare, Inc.,
Francis A. Tarkenton, Donald P. Addington, and Rick W. Gossett, Civil Action
File No. 1:94-CV-2540-JEC (each of those actions numbered 1-8 may be hereinafter
referred to as the "1994 Class Action Suits"). Each of the 1994 Class Action
Suits is purportedly a class action lawsuit on behalf of [KnowledgeWare's]
shareholders alleging violations of Sections 20 and 10(b) of the Exchange Act,
and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. The alleged factual basis underlying the
1994 Class Action Suits and the relief sought therein is the plaintiffs'
allegations that [KnowledgeWare] and the individual defendants actively
misrepresented or failed to disclose the actual financial condition of 
[KnowledgeWare] throughout fiscal year 1994 and that the value of
[KnowledgeWare's] Common Stock was artificially inflated as a result of such
misrepresentations or failures to disclose. Each of the 1994

5. Legal Proceedings, continued

Class Action Suits seeks compensatory damages and reimbursement for the
plaintiffs' fees and expenses.

On September 9, 1994, a lawsuit styled Ecta Corporation and Fairfield
Development, Inc. v. KnowledgeWare, Inc., Donald P. Addington and Francis A.
Tarkenton, Civil Action File No. 4-94-CV-80587, was filed against
[KnowledgeWare] in the Southern District of Iowa, Central Division (the "Ecta
Suit"). The Ecta Suit is a lawsuit alleging violations of Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act, Section 12(2) of the Securities
Act, violation of the Iowa Blue Sky Laws (Iowa Stat. Ann. (S) 502.502), fraud
and breach of contract. The alleged factual basis underlying the Ecta Suit
arises in connection with the purchase by [KnowledgeWare] of substantially all
of the assets of ClearAccess Corporation (now known as Ecta Corporation) and
Fairfield Software, Inc. (now known as Fairfield Development, Inc.) pursuant to
an Asset Purchase Agreement dated May 26, 1994 (the "Acquisition Agreement").
The plaintiffs allege that [KnowledgeWare] and the individual defendants
misrepresented or failed to disclose the actual financial condition of
[KnowledgeWare], that the value of [KnowledgeWare's] Common Stock was
artificially inflated as a result of such misrepresentations or failures to
disclose and that [KnowledgeWare] has breached certain warranties,
representations and covenants made in the Acquisition Agreement. The Ecta Suit
seeks compensatory damages, rescission of the Acquisition Agreement and/or the
sale of [KnowledgeWare's] securities issued pursuant thereto, punitive damages,
prejudgment interest, and reimbursement of attorneys' fees and costs.

The plaintiffs in the above-described actions seek unspecified compensatory
damages, legal fees and litigation costs. [KnowledgeWare] is unable to predict
the outcome or the potential financial impact of the above-described legal
proceedings either as an amount or range of amounts. [KnowledgeWare] does,
however, believe defense costs related to the proceedings will equal or exceed
the retention amount of $500,000 under the applicable insurance policies.
[KnowledgeWare] has, therefore, accrued a $500,000 loss relative to these
matters in the quarter ended September 30, 1994. For the 12 month period ended
September 30, 1994, KnowledgeWare maintained directors and officers liability
insurance policies with a maximum aggregate loss amount of $4.0 million. Losses,
claims, judgements costs and expenses of Knowledgeware and Sterling resulting
from the above-described actions will also result in claims for indemnification
to be satisfied from the escrowed shares provided for in the Amended Merger
Agreement. As of October 26, 1994, KnowledgeWare estimates that approximately
$55,000 of costs and expenses have been incurred since August 31, 1994 with
respect to the above-described actions.

KnowledgeWare has received informal requests for information from the Staff of
the Securities and Exchange Commission as to which persons and entities had
knowledge of the negotiations between KnowledgeWare and Sterling prior to the
public announcement of the Merger Agreement on August 1, 1994, and as to the
circumstances with respect to KnowledgeWare's restatement of financial results
for the first three quarters of fiscal 1994. Additionally, a request has been
received [by KnowledgeWare] from the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. for information as to persons and entities who may have had information
concerning events preceding the press release of KnowledgeWare made on August
30, 1994 regarding results for fiscal 1994.

On October 27, 1994, KnowledgeWare received a letter on behalf of certain
persons (the "Investors") who purchased shares of KnowledgeWare Common Stock
pursuant to a stock purchase agreement between the Investors and KnowledgeWare
dated January 26, 1994. The Investors assert that in light of, among other
things, KnowledgeWare's announcement on September 1, 1994 and KnowledgeWare's
other public statements disclosing its restatement of its financial statements
for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 1994, it is the position of
the Investors that KnowledgeWare is in breach of the representations and
warranties it made to the Investors in the stock purchase agreement and seek to
recover damages in the amount of approximately $9.5 million, representing the
difference between the

aggregate purchase price the Investors paid for their KnowledgeWare Common Stock
and the aggregate price for which they sold those shares.

6. Reclassifications

Certain changes in the presentation of amounts as of and for the three
months ended September 30, 1993 have been made to conform to the comparable
presentations as of and for the three months ended September 30, 1994.

7. Note Payable

On August 31, 1994 [KnowledgeWare] entered into a revolving and term loan
agreement with Sterling to replace the loan agreement with IBM Credit
Corporation and expand [KnowledgeWare's] borrowing capacity. The agreement
provides for maximum borrowings under the loan arrangement of $22,000,000,
(including a revolving line of credit of $16,000,000 and a term loan of
$6,000,000), the issuance of 70,250 warrants to purchase [KnowledgeWare's]
common stock at its fair market value upon the date of issuance (initially $4.50
per share) for each one million dollars drawn; and interest at 1 1/4% over prime
and a maturity date of August 31, 1995. [KnowledgeWare] has reserved a maximum
of 1,545,500 shares of its Common Stock for issuance under the loan agreement
with Sterling. On October 25, 1994, Sterling and KnowledgeWare amended the
arrangement to increase the revolving portion of the facility to $22,000,000 and
agreed to waive the borrowing base requirements with respect to borrowings of up
to $16,000,000 under the revolving portion of the facility. [KnowledgeWare] has
reserved an additional 421,500 shares of its Common Stock for issuance under the
loan agreement with Sterling.

8. Corporate Restructuring Charge

As a result of a rapidly changing operating environment and disappointing
fiscal 1994 performance, [KnowledgeWare] implemented a plan to restructure its
operations in the first quarter of fiscal 1995. The plan included the
termination of approximately 250 employees, consolidation of corporate real
estate and the closing of certain European subsidiaries. The restructuring
charge of $6,205,000 included approximately $4,000,000 related to the reduction
of personnel, $1,800,000 related to consolidation of corporate real estate and
$400,000 related to the closing of certain European subsidiaries. Accrued
expenses at September 30, 1994 include approximately $3,500,000 relative to this
restructuring charge and approximately $1,100,000 relative to a restructuring
charge in the third quarter of fiscal 1993.

9. Liquidity

[KnowledgeWare] has suffered recurring losses from operations. These losses
have resulted in negative working capital and an accumulated deficit. In
addition, losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 violated financial
covenants in the line of credit agreement with IBM Credit Corporation for which
[KnowledgeWare] received a waiver until September 30, 1994. The loan was
subsequently acquired and amended by Sterling Software, Inc. Management [of
KnowledgeWare] believes that existing cash balances must be supplemented by
additional cash from outside sources in order to fund currently anticipated cash
and capital requirements.

Understanding its strategic alternatives, including remaining an independent
company and the impact of financial constraints on its ability to invest in and
execute future plans, management [of KnowledgeWare]
