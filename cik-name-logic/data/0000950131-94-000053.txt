1993 Net Income, dated January 27, 1994

Exhibit 99
----------

Heller Financial, Inc.
----------------------
Reports Record 1993 Net Income,
-------------------------------
Improvement in Nonearning Assets
--------------------------------

Chicago -- (January 27, 1994) -- Heller Financial, Inc. reported record 1993
full-year net income available for common stock as well as a significant
improvement in nonearning assets as of year-end 1993, Michael S. Blum, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, announced today.

Full-year 1993 net income available for common stock was $105.6 million, a 24
percent increase compared to 1992 net income available for common stock of $85.3
million. Excluding a tax accounting credit recorded in 1992, net income
available for common stock increased 139 percent year to year.

The record increase in earnings was due to continued growth in operating
revenues and reduced credit quality costs. Operating revenues, which grew 11
percent year to year, were driven by strong gains on investments and increased
fees and other income from newer business initiatives, and continued growth in
net interest income. Notably, fees and other income increased 37 percent over
the prior year, largely due to new business initiatives in specialized financing
and investments, real estate and small business loan activities. Net interest
income growth was attributable to improved funding spreads due to the low
interest rate environment coupled with increased turnover in the portfolio.

Operating expenses were slightly higher in 1993 as the company boosted
spending to fund ongoing diversification efforts. This increase in operating
expenses was partially

offset by the benefits of productivity enhancements and expense controls in the
core businesses.

Even though provision for losses declined in 1993, significant progress was
made in writing down and in resolving prior years' problem accounts. Reserves
were maintained at 3 percent of receivables even as the level of problem
accounts receded and the performance of new financings over the past three years
remained strong.

As a result of these efforts, the company continued to make progress toward
achieving one of its major goals, improved asset quality. At year-end 1993,
nonearning assets declined by $119.9 million, a 22 percent reduction from the
prior year. The ratio of nonearning assets to total lending assets was 5.9
percent at year-end 1993 compared to 7.2 percent at year-end 1992.

"Measured against our stated goals to improve earnings and asset quality,
diversify our asset base and strengthen our balance sheet, 1993 was a very
successful year for Heller Financial," said Blum. "In 1993, our record
earnings, together with the steep drop in nonearning assets and the launch of
new business initiatives, significantly strengthened our company.
Diversification remains a top priority at Heller, as evidenced by the 1993
formation of Heller Business Credit and Small Business Finance, investments in
Mexican and Malaysian joint ventures, and the expansion of businesses that were
launched or acquired in 1992."

"Importantly, our low leverage, strong reserves, increased equity through
retained earnings and greater liquidity at year-end combined to give Heller its
strongest balance sheet and most stable credit profile in nearly 10 years,"
added Blum. "We will continue to focus on these important goals in order to
meet our future growth objectives."
