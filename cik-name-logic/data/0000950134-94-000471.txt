Capital, as of March 31, 1993, as set forth on Schedule 2.9 hereto
(the "March 31, 1993 Balance Sheet"), is referred to as the "Initial
Net Working Capital". On or before the day that is the second
Business Day preceding the Closing Date, the Seller will provide the
Purchaser with a good faith estimate of the Company's Net Working
Capital (the "Estimated Net Working Capital") as of 12:01 a.m. (Miami,

Liabilities at such time (the "Estimated Long-Term Liabilities")
calculated from the most recently available financial statements (the
"Current Financial Statements") plus such adjustments as are mutually
acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller. The Seller will provide
the Purchaser with a copy of the Current Financial Statements as soon
as such statements are available. The Base Cash Amount will be
reduced (or increased) by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated
Net Working Capital is less (or greater) than the Initial Net Working
Capital and will be reduced by the amount of the Estimated Long-Term
Liabilities.

(b) Determination of Final Cash Amount. Within
90 Business Days after the Closing, the Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to the Seller a balance sheet of the Company and a calculation
of the Net Working Capital and Long-Term Liabilities as of the
Calculation Time. Such calculations shall be made in a manner
consistent with the respective calculations of the Initial Net Working
Capital, the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated Long-Term
Liabilities under Section 2.9(a) above. The Purchaser will make
available to the Seller the work papers and other accounting records
used in preparing such balance sheet and calculations. Within 30 days
following the delivery of the balance sheet and Net Working Capital
and Long-Term Liabilities calculations, the Seller will deliver to the
Purchaser a detailed written statement describing its objections (if
any) to the Purchaser's calculation of the Net Working Capital and
Long-Term Liabilities. If the Seller does not deliver a detailed
written statement describing any such objections within such 30-day
period, the calculations of the Net Working Capital and Long-Term

9
<PAGE> 16

Liabilities shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. If the
Seller does deliver a detailed written statement raising any such
objections, the Purchaser and the Seller will use reasonable efforts
to resolve any disputes related thereto, but if a final resolution is
not obtained within 30 days after the Seller has submitted its written
objections to the Purchaser, any remaining disputes regarding the
calculations of the Net Working Capital and Long-Term Liabilities will
be submitted for resolution in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement to the Independent Accountant. The determination of the
Independent Accountant will be submitted in writing to each of the
Purchaser and the Seller not later than 30 days after the submission
of such dispute to the Independent Accountant, and the determinations
contained in that report will be conclusive and binding upon the
parties. The Purchaser and the Seller will each pay one-half of the
fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant. The Company's Net
Working Capital and Long-Term Liabilities, as finally determined
pursuant to this subsection (b), are referred to herein respectively
as the "Final Net Working Capital" and the "Final Long-Term
Liabilities" and the balance sheet setting forth the Final Net Working
Capital and the Final Long-Term Liabilities is referred to herein as
the "Final Balance Sheet".

(c) Physical Inventory. In order to prepare the
Estimated Net Working Capital calculation and the Final Balance Sheet
and to determine the Estimated Net Working Capital and Final Net
Working Capital, a physical count of the Company's Inventory will be
completed as of the close of business on the Sunday immediately
preceding the Closing Date. The Purchaser and the Seller will follow
the procedures set forth in Schedule 2.9(c) hereto, and each of the
Purchaser and the Seller will be entitled to have its representatives
present at the taking of the physical count by the Company.

(d) Final Adjustments. Within five Business Days
after the determination of the Final Net Working Capital, the
Estimated Cash Amount will be adjusted pursuant to this subsection
(d). The Final Cash Amount will be equal to the Estimated Cash Amount
reduced (or increased) by the amount, if any, by which the Final Net
Working Capital is less (or greater) than the Estimated Net Working
Capital and the amount, if any, by which the Final Long-Term
Liabilities are greater (or less) than the Estimated Long-Term
Liabilities. If the Estimated Cash Amount exceeds the Final Cash
Amount,

10
<PAGE> 17

such difference shall be paid by the Seller to the Purchaser in
immediately available funds within three Business Days after the
determination of the Final Cash Amount, together with interest thereon
from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the annual rate of 7%.
If the Final Cash Amount exceeds the Estimated Cash Amount, such
difference shall be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller in immediately
available fund within three Business Days after the determination of
the Final Cash Amount, together with interest thereon from the Closing
Date to the date of payment at the annual rate of 7%.

relating thereto within such specified period of survival, if any, may not be
pursued and is hereby irrevocably waived after such time. Any such notice
shall specifically identify the particular breach and the underlying facts and
Indemnifiable Loss relating thereto.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all
indemnification relating to Taxes shall be governed exclusively by the Tax
Matters Agreement.

Section 10.2. Limitations on Liability. (a) For purposes of
this Agreement, (i) "Indemnity Payment" means any amount of Indemnifiable
Losses required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) "Indemnitee" means
any person or entity entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (iii)
"Indemnifying Party" means any person or entity required to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, (iv) "Indemnifiable Losses" means any and
all damages, losses, liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), and any and all claims, demands or suits (by any
person or entity, including any governmental entity), in any such case provided
that the underlying liability or obligation giving rise thereto is not the
result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Indemnified Party, or
any affiliate thereof, and (v) "Third Party Claim" means any claim, action or
proceeding made or brought by any person or entity who or which is not a party
to this Agreement or an affiliate of a party to this Agreement.

(b) Reserved.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof or of any
applicable statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation:

(i) no Indemnitee will be entitled to make a claim
against an Indemnifying Party under Sections 10.3(a)(i) or 10.3(b)(i)
unless and until the aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Losses incurred
by the Indemnitee in respect of any individual event or occurrence or
series of related events or occurrences giving rise to such
Indemnifiable Losses exceeds $10,000, in which event (subject to the
following provisions of this Section 10.2), such Indemnitee may assert
its right to indemnification hereunder to the full extent of its
Indemnifiable Losses in respect thereof; and

48
<PAGE> 55
(ii) no Indemnitee will be entitled to make a claim
against an Indemnifying Party under Sections 10.3(a)(i) or 10.3(b)(i)
unless and until the aggregate amount of claims which may be asserted
for Indemnifiable Losses under Section 10.3(a)(i) or 10.3(b)(i), as
applicable, exceeds $225,000, and then only to the extent of the
excess;

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, the indemnification obligations of the Seller under Section
10.3(a)(i) and of the Purchaser under Section 10.3(b)(i) will not exceed
$4,500,000.

(e) As between the Seller, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, the rights and obligations set forth in Articles
V and X and Sections 7.18, 7.19 and 7.20 will be the exclusive rights and
obligations with respect to this Agreement, the events giving rise to this
Agreement and the transactions provided for herein or contemplated thereby.
Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, as a material
inducement to the other parties hereto entering into this Agreement, each of
the parties to this Agreement hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law,
any claim or cause of action which it otherwise might assert, including without
limitation under the common law or any other statute, law, ordinance, rule or
regulation, by reason of this Agreement, the events giving rise to this
Agreement and the transactions provided for herein or contemplated hereby or
thereby, except for claims or causes of action brought under and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Article X or, as applicable, Article V, Sections
7.18, 7.19 and 7.20; provided, however, in no event shall any claim based on
fraud be waived by the foregoing provision.

Section 10.3. Indemnification. (a) Subject to Sections 10.1,
10.2 and 10.4, the Seller will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Purchaser from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent
relating to, resulting from or arising out of:

(i) any breach by the Seller of any of the
representations or warranties of the Seller contained in Sections 4.1
through 4.25 inclusive, Sections 4.26(b), (c) and (d), and Sections
4.27 through 4.36 inclusive, of this Agreement;

<PAGE> 56

(iii) any breach by the Seller of the representations and
warranties of the Seller contained in Section 4.26(a).

(b) Subject to Sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10.4, the
Purchaser will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller from and against
any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent relating to, resulting from or
arising out of:

(i) any breach by the Purchaser of any of the
representations or warranties of the Purchaser contained in this
Agreement; and

(ii) any breach by the Purchaser of any covenant of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement.

(c) The Seller and the Purchaser agree that any indemnity
payment hereunder shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price.

Section 10.4. Defense of Claims. (a) If any Indemnitee
receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any Third Party Claim
against such Indemnitee with respect to which an Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee will
give such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice of such
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure by an Indemnitee to give
such notice within 30 calendar days shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure to give timely notice. Such notice will describe
the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, will include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in, or,
by giving written notice to the Indemnitee, to assume, the defense of any Third
Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying
Party's own counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee), and the
Indemnitee will cooperate in good faith in such defense.

(b) If, within 10 calendar days after giving notice of a
Third Party Claim to an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 10.4(a), an
Indemnitee receives written notice from the Indemnifying Party that the
Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
as provided in the last sentence of Section 10.4(a), the Indemnifying Party
will not

50
<PAGE> 57
be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with the defense thereof. Without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party will not enter into any settlement of any
Third Party Claim unless the Indemnitee is fully released by the claimant from
all liability arising from such Third Party Claim.

(c) Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an
Indemnifiable Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim") will be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt
written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 30 calendar days after
the Indemnitee becomes aware of such Direct Claim, and the Indemnifying Party
will have a period of 30 calendar days within which to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such
30 calendar day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected
such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will be free to pursue such remedies
as may be available to the Indemnitee on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Article X.

(d) If the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss, at any time
subsequent to the making of an Indemnity Payment, is reduced by recovery,
settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or
pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other
entity, the amount of such reduction, less any costs, expenses, premiums or
taxes incurred in connection therewith, together with interest thereon from the
date of payment of such amount by the Indemnifying Party at a rate of interest
equal to 7% per annum will promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the
Indemnifying Party. Upon making any Indemnity Payment, the Indemnifying Party
will, to the extent of such Indemnity Payment, be subrogated to all rights of
the Indemnitee against any third party that is not an affiliate of the
Indemnitee in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the Indemnity Payment
relates; provided, however, that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall then be in
compliance with its obligations under this Agreement in respect of such
Indemnifiable Loss and (ii) until the Indemnitee recovers full payment of its
Indemnifiable Loss, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any
such third party on account of said Indemnity Payment will be subrogated and
subordinated in right of payment to the Indemnitee's rights against such third
party. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision
hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnifying Party will duly execute upon
request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the
above-described subrogation and subordination rights.

books, records, files and documents related to the Company are required in
connection with any proceeding, litigation or similar matter, the Seller shall
have the right to use such originals; provided, the Seller shall use its
Reasonable Efforts to have such originals released from any such proceeding,
litigation or other matter and returned to the Purchaser as soon as reasonably
possible under the circumstances. The Purchaser will cause the books, records,
files and documents related to the Company to be maintained in original form
with respect to legal documents and photographic, micrographic or other storage
form with respect to other books, records, files and documents (to the extent
consistent with Legal Requirements applicable to the Seller and the Purchaser)

Purchaser shall not destroy or allow the destruction of the same without
providing to the Seller a reasonable opportunity to take possession thereof.
