One Valley Bancorp of West Virginia, Inc.

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

The merger between One Valley Bancorp of West Virginia, Inc., and 

Mountaineer Bankshares of W. Va., Inc., was completed effective at the close of 

business on January 28, 1994, after receiving approval of the shareholders of 

both companies along with state and federal regulatory agencies. 

Under terms of the merger agreement, One Valley exchanged 1.5 shares of 

One Valley's common stock, par value $10.00 per share, for each share of 

Mountaineer's outstanding common stock, par value $2.50 per share, in a

tax-free exchange. The merger is accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.

The value of the transaction amounted to approximately $119 million based 

on the current market price for One Valley common stock.

As a result of the merger, One Valley has total assets of $3.5 billion and 

total deposits of $2.9 billion. On December 31, 1993, One Valley had total 

assets of $2.8 billion and total deposits of $2.3 billion and Mountaineer had 

total assets of $739 million and deposits of $608 million.

With the addition of Mountaineer's 23 full service banking offices, One 

Valley now has 80 offices in 23 counties in West Virginia, including the north-

central and panhandle regions of West Virginia. Principal subsidiaries of 

Mountaineer included Old National Bank in Martinsburg, The Empire National Bank 

of Clarksburg, City National Bank of Fairmont, Mercantile Banking & Trust in 

Moundsville, The Bank of Wadestown, The Bank of Cameron and The Sunshine Bank

of Wheeling. Former Mountaineer banking locations will eventually operate

under the name of One Valley Bank. 

Robert F. Baronner will continue as Chairman of One Valley and J. Holmes 

Morrison will remain as President and Chief Executive Officer. Lacy I. Rice, 

Jr., former chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mountaineer, will be Vice 

Chairman of One Valley and Brent D. Robinson, former president of Mountaineer, 

will be Executive Vice President of One Valley.

In addition, Rice and Cecil B. Highland, Jr., former members of the Board 

of Directors of Mountaineer, have been elected to the Board of Directors of One 

Valley.
