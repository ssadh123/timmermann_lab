Item 5. Other Events

On March 4, 1994, Moog Inc. ("Registrant" or "Moog") and
AlliedSignal Inc. ("AlliedSignal") signed a memorandum of
understanding pursuant to which Registrant will purchase
the assets of AlliedSignal's mechanical and hydraulic
aerospace actuation business. AlliedSignal will retain
its electromechanical actuation product line.

The actuation products to be acquired by Moog are used on
a variety of domestic and international commercial and
military aircraft, including drive systems for leading
edge flaps and hydraulic servoactuators for primary and
secondary flight controls. Revenues attributable to this
business are expected to approximate $75 million a year,
split evenly between commercial and military. It is
anticipated that Moog will continue the acquired business
in Torrance, California, its current location.

The purchase price for the business to be acquired is $71
million. The completion of the transaction, estimated to
occur in the second quarter of the year, is subject to
the negotiation of definitive agreements and regulatory
approvals. It is expected that financing for the
transaction will be provided by commercial banks.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Moog Inc.

Dated: March 4, 1994 By
