RECENT OPERATING RESULTS

Norwest Corporation's ("Norwest") net income was $202.0 million for the 
quarter ended June 30, 1994, a 19.6% increase over the $168.9 million earned 
in the second quarter of 1993. Net income per common share was 61 cents, 
compared with 52 cents in the second quarter of 1993, an increase of 17.3%. 
Return on common equity was 22.4% and return on assets was 1.48% for the 
second quarter of 1994, compared with 20.4% and 1.37%, respectively, in the 
second quarter of 1993. 

For the first six months of 1994, net income was $392.5 million, or $1.20 per 
common share, an increase of 20.0% and 18.8%, respectively, over the $327.2 
million or $1.01 per common share earned in the first six months of 1993. 
Return on common equity was 21.5% and return on assets was 1.47% for the first 
six months of 1994, compared with 20.2% and 1.35%, respectively, for the same 
period a year ago. 

The 1993 results have been restated to include First United Bank Group, Inc. 
(First United), acquired on January 14, 1994, in a pooling of interests 
transaction. 

Net interest income in the second quarter of 1994 was $697.3 million, compared 
with $614.3 million in the second quarter of 1993, an increase of 13.5%. The 
improvement from the second quarter of 1993 is primarily due to a 10.7% growth 
in average earning assets, and a 11 basis point increase in net interest 
margin. Net interest income increased 10.0% to $1,347.2 million for the first 
six months of 1994, compared to the same period in 1993. The increase is 
attributable to a 10.3% higher level of earning assets. 

Norwest provided $23.7 million for credit losses in the second quarter of 
1994, or 0.32% of average loans and leases. This compares with $39.4 million 
or 0.61% in the same period a year ago. Net credit losses totaled $33.4 
million in the second quarter of 1994, compared with $45.2 million in the 
second quarter of 1993. As a percent of average loans and leases, net credit 
losses were 0.45% in the second quarter of 1994, compared with 0.70% in the 
same period a year ago. 

For the first six months of 1994, Norwest's provision amounted to $60.0 
million, compared with $77.5 million for the same period of 1993. Net credit 
losses were $76.6 million and $83.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 
1994 and 1993, respectively. Net credit losses, as a percent of average loans 
and leases, were 0.53% in the first half of 1994, compared with 0.65% in the 
same period of 1993. 

Non-performing assets, including non-accrual and restructured loans and leases 
and other real estate owned, totaled $200.7 million, or 0.66% of loans, leases 
and other real estate owned, at June 30, 1994. Non-performing assets were 
$269.0 million at December 31, 1993, and $343.3 million at June 30, 1993. The 
decrease from year-end 1993 was primarily due to a $52.2 million reduction in

non-accrual loans. The allowance for credit losses was $790.4 million at June 
30, 1994, and represented 393.8% of non-performing assets. 

Consolidated non-interest income decreased 8.2% to $386.9 million, compared to
the second quarter of 1993. Investment securities losses of $43.5 million
were recorded during the second quarter of 1994, providing an opportunity
to reinvest at higher yields.

For the first six months of 1994, non-interest income was up $50.2 million
to $821.0 million, an increase of 6.5% over 1993. This increase was
primarily due to increased mortgage banking revenues, insurance fees and
deposit service charges. 

Consolidated non-interest expenses in the second quarter of $759.0 million
represented an increase of 0.5% over the second quarter of 1993.
For the six months ended June 30, 1994, non-interest expenses were
up $88.7 million to $1,528.1 million, an increase of 6.2% over 1993. The 
quarterly and year-to-date increases reflect higher salaries and benefits 
costs at Norwest Mortgage to support origination and servicing growth and in 
the Banking Group due to acquisitions. Offsetting the increases in salaries 
and benefits were decreases in other non-interest expenses of $68.2 million 
for the three months and $93.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 1994, 
compared to the same periods of the prior year. 

Norwest's Banking Group reported earnings of $136.2 million in the second 
quarter of 1994, 38.0% above second quarter 1993 earnings of $98.7 million. 
For the first six months of 1994, the Banking Group had net income of $264.1 
million, a 30.0% increase compared with $203.1 million in 1993. Banking Group 
earnings in the first half of 1994 included a 11.8% growth in net interest 
income and a $18.5 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, 
partially offset by a 6.0% decrease in non-interest income. 

Mortgage banking operations earned $11.5 million in the current quarter, down 
from $23.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 1993. For the first six 
months of 1994, mortgage banking operations had net income of $22.3 million, a 
decrease of 33.4% from the first six months of 1993 when a gain of $61.8 
million was realized on the sale of $2.9 billion of servicing in accordance 
with the terms of a long-term contract. 

Norwest Financial Services, Inc. ("Norwest Financial") reported second quarter 
1994 net income of $54.3 million, an increase of 15.0% from the second quarter 
of 1993. Norwest Financial's net income of $106.1 million for the first six 
months of 1994 was up 17.1% from the first six months of 1993. Norwest 
Financial's net interest income increased 13.5% as average finance receivables 
grew 12.9%. Net interest margin widened 4 basis points, reflecting lower 
funding costs. 

At June 30, 1994, total assets were $55.8 billion, compared with $54.7 billion 
at December 31, 1993. Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, increased 
4.9% from year-end 1993, and totaled $30.2 billion at June 30, 1994. Total 
investment securities were $14.8 billion at June 30, 1994, compared with $12.7 
billion at December 31, 1993, an increase of 16.4%. Deposits decreased from 
$36.0 billion at year-end 1993 to $34.7 billion at June 30, 1994, principally 
in non-interest-bearing demand deposits. 

Consolidated stockholders' equity was $3.84 billion at June 30, 1994, compared 
with $3.76 billion at December 31, 1993. Tier 1 and total capital ratios were 
10.00% and 12.40%, respectively, at June 30, 1994, compared with 9.71% and 
12.39%, respectively, at December 31, 1993. The leverage ratio was 6.85% at 
June 30, 1994 and 6.46% at year-end 1993.
