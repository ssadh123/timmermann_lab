BELL ATLANTIC DECLARES DIVIDEND INCREASE

PHILADELPHIA, March 22, 1994 -- The board of directors of Bell Atlantic
Corporation (NYSE: BEL) today declared an increase in its quarterly dividend
from $.67 to $.69 per share on the company's outstanding common shares. The 
company has increased its dividend for the tenth consecutive year.

The dividend will be payable on May 2, 1994, to shareowners of record of
outstanding shares on April 11, 1994. Bell Atlantic has approximately 436 
million shares of common stock outstanding and approximately one million 
shareowners of record.

"This dividend increase reflects our growing confidence in Bell Atlantic's
future in the expanding markets for communications, information, and
entertainment," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Raymond W. Smith.
"I believe our industry is entering a new era of growth. Our key strategies,
which remain unchanged, will move us aggressively into areas which can
provide high incremental returns. As the only regional Bell company currently
permitted to provide cable television service in its home territories, Bell
Atlantic is well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. As I told
the broadcast industry on Monday, Bell Atlantic expects to be equipped to 
offer broadband services to a million households in our territory by the end
of next year. We believe such growth opportunities, coupled with our current 
strong cash flow, improving revenues, and solid business fundamentals, set the
stage to provide attractive long-term returns to investors."
