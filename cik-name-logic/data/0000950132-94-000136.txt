FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

MELLON REPORTS RECORD QUARTERLY NET INCOME IN FIRST QUARTER 1994

o Net Income Increases 41 Percent and Earnings Per Share Increases
39 Percent, Excluding a Restructuring Charge and Securities 
Gains in Prior-Year Quarter

o Return on Equity Reaches 17.25 Percent for Quarter; Return on Assets
Reaches 1.43 Percent

o Fee Revenue Increases 48 Percent, Comprises Nearly 50 Percent
of Total Revenue for Quarter

PITTSBURGH, April 19, 1994 -- Mellon Bank Corporation today reported 
first quarter 1994 net income of $131 million, or $1.77 per common 
share, compared with net income of $34 million, or $.31 per common 
share, in the first quarter of 1993. Net income was at the highest 
quarterly level in the Corporation's history, excluding those quarters 
affected by certain nonrecurring gains. Annualized return on common 
shareholders' equity and return on assets were 17.25 percent and 1.43 
percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 1994.

Results for the first quarter of 1993 included an after-tax 
restructuring charge of $112 million taken in connection with the 
acquisition of The Boston Company, as well as $53 million in after-tax 
gains on the sale of securities. Excluding these items, the 
Corporation's pro forma net income would have been $93 million, or 
$1.27 per common share, in the first quarter of 1993; and pro forma 
annualized return on common shareholders' equity and return on assets 
would have been 13.86 percent and 1.17 percent, respectively.

"Our first quarter results affirm, again, Mellon's earnings strength 
and momentum," said Frank V. Cahouet, chairman, president and chief 
executive officer. "The same trends that have driven earnings growth 
over the past several quarters--strong revenue growth propelled by our 
recent acquisitions, and reduced credit quality expense--sustained very 
good results."

Net interest revenue for the quarter was $362 million, up 14 percent 
from $317 million in the prior-year period. Fee revenue was $343 
million, up 48 percent from $232 million in the first quarter of 1993. 
The increase in net interest revenue was attributable primarily to the 
Corporation's 1993 acquisitions of The Boston Company and AFCO Credit 
Corporation; the increase in fee revenue was attributable principally 
to The Boston Company acquisition.

Operating expense for the first quarter of 1994 was $471 million, 
compared with $533 million in the first quarter of 1993. The year-ago 
quarter included a $175 million pretax restructuring charge related to 
The Boston Company acquisition. Excluding this item, operating expense 
for the first quarter of 1993 would have been $358 million.

The provision for credit losses was $20 million in the first quarter of 
1994, compared with $35 million in the prior-year period. Net credit 
losses were $17 million, down significantly from $49 million in the 
first quarter of 1993.

Nonperforming assets totaled $314 million at March 31, 1994, down
$27 million, or 8 percent, from $341 million at Dec. 31, 1993. 
Nonperforming assets decreased by $218 million, or 41 percent, compared 
with March 31, 1993.

With assets of approximately $37 billion, Mellon Bank Corporation is a 
major financial services company headquartered in Pittsburgh, providing 
commercial banking, retail financial services and numerous fee-based 
service products, including trust and investment, cash management and 
mortgage banking.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
________________________

Pending Dreyfus Corporation Merger
__________________________________

In December 1993, the Corporation entered into a definitive
agreement to merge with The Dreyfus Corporation (Dreyfus). 
Dreyfus is the nation's sixth-largest mutual fund company, with
approximately $74 billion of assets under management and
administration. The merger of the Corporation and Dreyfus will
create a diversified financial services organization with annual
revenues of more than $3 billion, including fee revenue of about
$1.6 billion.

Dreyfus shareholders will receive .88017 shares of the
Corporation's common stock for each share of Dreyfus common stock
outstanding. Dreyfus has approximately 37 million shares
outstanding. The transaction will be accounted for under the
pooling-of-interests method, with prior period financial results
restated to reflect the merger. The Corporation's capital ratios
following the merger will be substantially higher than the March
31, 1994 ratios. However, as a result of the approximately 32
million additional shares of the Corporation's common stock to be
issued to the Dreyfus shareholders, the Corporation's restated
earnings per share and book value per share will be approximately
15% lower than previously reported amounts.

In connection with the transaction, the Corporation expects to
record one-time after-tax merger expenses and restructuring
charges of approximately $73 million at closing, which is
anticipated in the third quarter of 1994.
<PAGE>

Completion of the merger is contingent upon the approval of the
shareholders of the Corporation and Dreyfus, various regulatory
approvals and certain approvals by the boards of directors and
shareholders of the mutual funds advised by Dreyfus.

</TABLE>

The 14% improvement in net interest revenue in the first
quarter of 1994, compared with the first quarter of 1993,
primarily reflected a higher level of interest-earning assets
resulting from the second quarter 1993 acquisition of The Boston
Company and the December 1993 acquisition of AFCO Credit
Corporation (AFCO). AFCO contributed approximately $16 million
to net interest revenue in the first quarter of 1994. A
reduction in nonperforming assets also contributed to the
improved net interest revenue and net interest margin compared
with the prior-year period. Net interest revenue in the first
quarter of 1994 included revenue from the Corporation's seasonal
tax refund anticipation loan program, which contributed 11 basis
points to the net interest margin compared with 13 basis points
in the prior-year period.

(a) Excludes net credit losses on segregated assets.

Credit quality expense, defined as the provision for credit
losses plus the net expense of acquired property, was $48 million
lower in the first quarter of 1994, compared with the prior-year
period, reflecting continuing improvement in the credit quality
of the loan portfolio and the lower level of real estate acquired
(OREO). The $8 million in net revenue from acquired property in
the first quarter of 1994 primarily resulted from $9 million in
net gains on the sale of acquired property. Net expense of
acquired property of $25 million in the first quarter of 1993
included $21 million of provision to the reserve for OREO. No
provision to the reserve for OREO was recorded in the first
quarter of 1994. Net credit losses decreased $32 million
compared with the first quarter of 1993 primarily resulting from
lower commercial real estate net credit losses. The Corporation
expects continued moderation in the level of credit losses for
the remainder of 1994, compared with the prior year, particularly
in the level of commercial real estate credit losses.

</TABLE>

Fee revenue increased by $111 million, or 48%, in the first
quarter of 1994, compared with the first quarter of 1993,
primarily reflecting $112 million of fee revenue attributable to
The Boston Company, partially offset by the approximately $21
million reduction in fee revenue resulting from the fourth
quarter 1993 sale of two information services businesses.

The $102 million improvement in trust and investment management
fees in the first quarter of 1994 resulted principally from $95
million of these fees earned at The Boston Company. The $3
million increase in cash management and deposit transaction
charges, compared with the first quarter of 1993, was the result
of increased volume.

Information services fees decreased $16 million compared with the prior-
year period, primarily as a result of the Corporation's December 1993 sale 
of two information services businesses. The two businesses sold generated
<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings
April 19, 1994
Page 8

quarterly revenues of approximately $21 million. Partially offsetting the
decrease in information services fees was revenue generated by a Canadian stock
transfer company in which the Corporation increased its ownership from 10% to
80% during the second quarter of 1993.

The increase in foreign currency and securities trading fee
revenue in the first quarter of 1994 was attributable to foreign
exchange fees earned, primarily from global custody customers, at
The Boston Company. Other fee revenue included $11 million from
the Corporation's tax refund anticipation loan program, which
will be lower in the second half of 1994. Fee revenue generated
by this seasonal product decreased $7 million compared with the
prior year period, due primarily to a change in the operating
agreements with tax preparation firms with whom the Corporation
does business. Increases in several other fee revenue categories
offset the decreased revenue from the tax refund anticipation
loan program.

The Corporation recorded $87 million in gains on the sale of
securities during the first quarter of 1993, resulting from the
sale of securities in the available for sale portfolio. These
sales were undertaken as part of the financing plan and balance
sheet restructuring related to the acquisition of The Boston
Company.

</TABLE>
* Operating expense before the net expense (revenue) of acquired
property and restructuring expense as a percentage of net
interest revenue (computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis)
and noninterest revenue, excluding securities gains.

Operating expense before the net expense of acquired property and
restructuring expense increased by $146 million, or 44%, in
the first quarter of 1994, compared with the first quarter of
1993. The increase was primarily the result of $98 million of
expenses attributable to The Boston Company and an increase in
marketing expense of $20 million, primarily related to the
introduction of the Corporation's CornerStone credit card
product. The impact of expenses attributable to AFCO were offset
by the decrease in expenses related to the information services
businesses sold in December 1993. Also impacting first quarter
1994 operating expense were increases in various categories in
support of revenue growth.

Operating expense before the net expense of acquired property and
restructuring expense increased $15 million in the first quarter of 1994
from $464 million in the fourth quarter of 1993. This increase resulted
from a $20 million increase in marketing expense primarily related to the
CornerStone credit card product as well as increased expense in support of
<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings
April 19, 1994
Page 10

revenue growth. The fourth quarter of 1993 included $13 million of
nonrecurring expenses related to winding down certain data processing
operations.

The increase in average full-time equivalent staff level,
compared with the prior-year quarter, primarily reflected the
addition of the employees of The Boston Company. The acquisition
of The Boston Company contributed approximately 3,200 to the
average full-time equivalent staff in the first quarter of 1994.

The Corporation adopted FAS No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits", on a prospective basis in the first
quarter of 1994. Adoption of the standard did not materially
affect the Corporation's first quarter 1994 financial position or
results of operations.

A restructuring charge of $175 million pretax, or $112 million
after-tax, was recorded in the first quarter of 1993 to reflect
management's estimate of restructuring costs associated with the
integration of The Boston Company.

Income Taxes
- ------------

The provision for income taxes totaled $83 million in the first quarter of
1994, for an effective tax rate of approximately 38.5%, compared with $34
million in the first quarter of 1993. Excluding the impact of the
restructuring charge and securities gains, the Corporation's effective tax
rate for the first quarter of 1993 was 40%. The decrease in the effective
rate between quarters is primarily the result of tax legislation, enacted
<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings
April 19, 1994
Page 11

in August 1993, which permitted the deductibility of
certain intangible amortization expense. The Corporation
currently estimates that the ongoing effective tax rate will be
38.5% until the completion of the merger with The Dreyfus
Corporation, after which it is currently anticipated that the
effective tax rate will increase to approximately 39%.

</TABLE>

(a) Excludes segregated assets.

Nonperforming assets totaled $314 million at March 31, 1994, a decrease of
$27 million, or 8%, compared with December 31, 1993. Domestic 
nonperforming real estate assets, which include nonperforming commercial
and consumer real estate loans and OREO net of the reserve, decreased by
$47 million during the quarter primarily as a result of returns to accrual
status, asset sales and repayments. The increase in other domestic
nonperforming loans primarily resulted from the addition of a commercial
<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings
April 19, 1994
Page 12

and industrial borrower while the increase in international nonperforming
loans resulted from the addition of loans to a real estate developer.

Nonperforming assets decreased by $218 million, or 41%,
compared with March 31, 1993, primarily due to the $170 million
reduction in domestic nonperforming real estate assets. The
reduction resulted primarily from returns to accrual status,
asset sales and credit losses, offset in part by an increase in
nonperforming consumer mortgages, primarily from The Boston
Company. Other domestic nonperforming loans decreased by $45
million primarily due to repayments and credit losses. The $11
million decrease in other assets acquired resulted from asset
sales and write-downs.

(c) The book value per common share assumes full conversion of

this includes the additional paid-in capital on the Series D

liquidation preference over the common stock.

The increase in the Corporation's common and total shareholders'
equity in the first quarter of 1994, compared with December 31,
1993, was primarily the result of earnings retention. In the
first quarter of 1994, the Corporation increased its quarterly
common stock dividend by 47%, to $.56 per share, from $.38
per share.

FAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities", became effective on January 1, 1994. 
Adoption of FAS No. 115 resulted in $15 million, net of tax, of
unrealized losses on assets classified as available for sale at
March 31, 1994 being recorded in retained earnings. Increased
volatility of shareholders' equity, certain capital ratios and
book value per common share could result in the future from
changes in unrealized gains and losses on assets classified as
available for sale.

Note: In accordance with the adoption of FAS No. 115, certain
assets available for sale are reported at fair value at
March 31, 1994 with the unrealized loss of $15 million, net
of taxes, included in retained earnings. No
reclassifications of assets were made to adopt this new
accounting standard. The impact of recording the unrealized
loss resulted in a reduction of book value per common share
of $.22 cents.
