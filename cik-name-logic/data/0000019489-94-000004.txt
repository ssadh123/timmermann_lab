all the Securities of such series, to waive, with respect to the
Securities of such series, compliance by the Company with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the
Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by
the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note
issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent
or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of

principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and
rates, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture, and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, this Note is transferable on the

like aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated
transferee or transferees.

sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in
connection therewith.

<FN> 
* Represents the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle relating
to the adoption of SFAS 109 ("Accounting for Income Taxes") in the first quarter
of 1993. 

** For the years ended December 31, 1990 and 1989, earnings did not cover fixed
charges by $91 million and $449 million, respectively, primarily as a result of
large additions to the Reserve for Possible Credit Losses and special charges.

For purposes of computing the consolidated ratios, earnings represent net income
(loss) plus applicable income taxes and fixed charges, less cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle for the year ended December 31,1993 and equity in
undistributed earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries and associated
companies. Fixed charges represent interest expense (exclusive of interest on
deposits in one case and inclusive of such interest in the other), amortization
of debt discount and issuance costs and one-third(the amount deemed to represent
an interest factor) of net rental expense under all lease commitments.
