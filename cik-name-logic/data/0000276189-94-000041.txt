FAIRFIELD COMMUNITIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements reflect
the sale of all of the outstanding stock of First Federal for approximately $41
million. The amount of available cash proceeds due Fairfield at closing has been
reduced by approximately $1.4 million due to the Litigation Indemnity. The
amount of these escrowed funds has been included in "Net assets held for sale"
in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet.

As part of the transactions, Fairfield purchased (i) approximately $16
million (net book value) of certain real estate, classified loans, joint venture
interests and other assets owned by First Federal (the "Excluded Association
Assets") and (ii) lot and vacation ownership contracts receivable and related
assets which First Federal previously acquired from Fairfield (the "Contracts
Receivable"), having a net book value of approximately $41.6 million. The
Excluded Association Assets and the Contracts Receivable are collectively
referred to as the "Excluded Assets". 

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements reflect
First Federal's sale and Fairfield's purchase of the Excluded Assets, with
Fairfield's purchase funded by the net cash proceeds totaling approximately
$39.6 million from the sale of First Federal's stock and borrowings of approxi- 
mately $17.7 million under available financing arrangements.The interest expense
associated with the additional borrowings of approximately $17.7 million 
incurred by Fairfield to purchase the Excluded Assets,using an interest rate of 
8.125% (i.e., the Company's incremental borrowing rate), results in calculated
additional interest expense of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 1993 and approximately $.7 million for the six months ended June 30
1994. Interest expense included in the preceding pro forma financial statements
may not be indicative of the future cost to the Company considering that the
disposition of the deposit base of First Federal will result in probable future
increased cost of funds. 

The purchase of the Excluded Assets by Fairfield is a condition to the
consummation of the sale of the stock of First Federal. As most of the Excluded
Association Assets are dissimilar to the assets of continuing operations, the
Company anticipates disposing of these assets in a manner different than First
Federal. Therefore, the Company has recorded valuation allowances related to the
Excluded Assets of approximately $3.5 million, based upon the expected change in
Fairfield's method of disposal of such assets subsequent to the consummation of
the transactions. The net gain on the sale of the stock of First Federal of
approximately $5.2 million, net of selling expenses, is composed primarily of an
(i) expected sales price of $41 million (ii) a basis of the investment in the
stock of First Federal of approximately $30.5 million and (iii) valuation
allowances of the Excluded Assets of approximately $3.5 million. The gain on the
sale of First Federal's stock did not result in an increase in income taxes due
to the additional tax basis in First Federal's stock and underlying assets (tax
goodwill) for which no deferred tax asset was previously recorded under the
provisions of SFAS 109.

For purposes of determining the pro forma effects of the above mentioned
transactions, the following pro forma adjustments have been made (In

purchase of Excluded Assets by the Company:

(2) Other assets (accrued interest - contracts) 344

(2) Net assets held for sale, net 
of $2.2 million valuation allowance 14,114 
(2) Cash $57,661 
(1) Net liabilities held for sale 30,548 
Gain on the sale of stock 5,200 

The gain on the sale of the stock of First Federal is not
included in the Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Earnings as Rule 11-02(b)(5) of Regulation S-X states that pro forma
financial statements are to be presented based on earnings from
continuing operations before nonrecurring charges or credits directly
attributable to the transaction.
