Item 5. Other Events.

On November 7, 1994, the National Transportation Safety
Board (the "NTSB") recommended to the Federal Aviation
Administration (the "FAA") that, among other things, the FAA
restrict the operation of ATR-42 and ATR-72 turbo-propeller
aircraft in icing conditions. American Eagle carriers, which are
wholly-owned by AMR Eagle, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation,
operate 71 ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft. Although there is
currently no indication that the FAA will adopt the NTSB's
recommendation, the adoption by the FAA of the recommendation
would require many of such aircraft to be rescheduled to areas
where icing conditions are unlikely to arise or, perhaps, to be
removed from scheduled service. Such actions could have a
material adverse effect on the financial results of AMR
Corporation and the Corporation.
