Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

On July 5, 1994 Smith Corona Corporation (the "Company")
sold substantially all the assets and liabilities of SCM Office
Supplies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, to Ampad Corporation
(the "Sale"). The selling price of approximately $13 million is
subject to the terms of the asset purchase agreement which
requires, among other things, approval by the Company and Ampad
Corporation of the assets and liabilities on the final closing
balance sheet. A copy of the asset purchase agreement is
attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following pro forma financial statements give effect for
the Sale and are presented for illustrative purposes only. These
pro forma financial statements are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results and financial position that might have been
achieved had the Sale occurred as of an earlier date, nor are
they necessarily indicative of operating results and financial
position which may occur in the future.

A pro forma balance sheet is provided as of March 31, 1994,
giving effect to the Sale as though it had been consummated on
that date. Pro forma income statements are provided for the
nine-month period ended March 31, 1994, and the year ended June
30, 1993, giving effect to the Sale as though it had occurred at
the beginning of each period presented.

The historical statement of income for the year ended June
30, 1993 is derived from the historical consolidated financial
statements of Smith Corona Corporation and should be read in
conjunction with the 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
historical financial statements as of and for the nine months
ended March 31, 1994 have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applicable to interim
financial information and, in the opinion of management, include
all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial
information for such interim periods.

Note 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The pro forma financial statements are presented for
illustrative purposes only, giving effect for the sale of
substantially all the assets and liabilities of SCM Office
Supplies, Inc. (the "Sale"). In accordance with Commission
reporting rules, the pro forma income statements, and the

of approximately $2.2 million net of tax is not reflected in the
pro forma income statements.

The pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 1994 includes,
in accordance with Commission reporting rules, the impact of all
transactions, whether of a recurring or nonrecurring nature, that
can be reasonably estimated and should be reflected as of that
date.

Note 2. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

Pro forma adjustments include amounts for the following:

- Substantially all historical assets and liabilities and all
historical results of operations relating to SCM Office
Supplies, Inc.

- Paydown of bank loans from proceeds of the Sale estimated at
approximately $13.0 million with applicable reductions of
interest expense

- Income taxes (benefit) using the historical effective tax 
rate

Assets (the "Purchase Price") will be equal to the Net Asset Value

immediately available funds (the "Estimated Purchase Price").

2.3 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Post-Closing Determination. Within 60 days after
the Closing Date, the Purchaser and its auditors will conduct a
review (the "Closing Review") as of the open of business on the
Closing Date and will prepare and deliver to the Seller a
computation of the actual amounts of the Net Asset Value as of the
open of business on the Closing Date (the "Draft Balance Sheet"). 
The Purchaser and its auditors shall give the Seller and its
auditors an opportunity to observe the Closing Review and shall
make available to such Persons all records and work papers used in
preparing the Draft Balance Sheet. If the Seller disagrees with the
computation of the Net Asset Value reflected on the Draft Balance
Sheet, the Seller may, within 30 days after receipt of the Draft
Balance Sheet, deliver a notice (an "Objection Notice") to the
Purchaser setting forth the Seller's calculation of the actual
amount of the Net Asset Value in dispute as of the open of business
on the Closing Date. The Purchaser and the Seller will use rea-
sonable efforts to resolve any disagreements as to the computation
of the Net Asset Value. If they do not obtain a final resolution
within 30 days after the Purchaser has received the Objection
Notice, the Purchaser and the Seller will jointly retain an
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing (the
"Firm") to resolve any remaining disagreements. If the Purchaser
and the Seller are unable to agree on the choice of the Firm, the
Firm shall be a "big-six" accounting firm selected by lot (after
excluding one firm designated by each of the Purchaser and the
Seller). The Purchaser and the Seller shall direct the Firm to
render a determination within 15 days of its retention and the
Purchaser and its employees shall cooperate with the Firm during
its engagement. The Firm shall consider only those items and
amounts in the Draft Balance Sheet set forth in the Objection
Notice which the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve. 
The Firm's determination shall be based on the definitions of the
Net Asset Value included herein. The determination of the Firm will
be conclusive and binding upon the Seller and the Purchaser. The
Purchaser and the Seller will each pay one half of the fees and
expenses of the Firm. The amount of the Net Asset Value, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.3(a), is referred to herein
as the "Actual NAV".

(b) Post-Closing Adjustment. 

(i) Payments by the Purchaser. If the Estimated
Purchase Price is less than the Actual NAV, the Purchaser
shall, within two (2) business days after the determination
thereof, pay to the Seller an amount equal to such difference
by wire transfer or delivery of immediately available funds. 

(ii) Payments by the Seller. If the Actual NAV is
less than the Estimated Purchase Price, the Seller shall,
within two (2) business days after the determination thereof,
pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to such difference by
wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available
funds.

2.4 The Closing. The closing of the purchase and sale
of the Acquired Assets, the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities,
and the transactions relating thereto (the "Closing") will take
place on July 6, 1994 at the offices of Kirkland & Ellis, 153 East
53rd Street, New York, NY 10022 or at such other place time and

complaint, action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, claim,
or demand in connection with (a) any transaction contemplated by

and its counsel in such contest or defense, make available such
other Party's and its Affiliates' personnel and provide such
testimony and access to books and records as are reasonably
requested in connection with such contest or defense, all at the
contesting or defending Person's expense (unless the contesting or
defending Person is entitled to indemnification therefor pursuant

construed so as to limit the Seller's obligation to transfer to the

surrender to the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be, such
business records and files or any portion thereof of which the
Seller or the Stockholder on one hand or the Purchaser on the other
may intend to destroy, alter or dispose. The party to whom such
business records and files are offered shall have not less than 30
days after delivery of written notice stating the such business
records and files are to be disposed of to take possession of such
business records and files.

consummation of any transaction pursuant to any Transaction
Document nor any waiver of any condition to such participation

event will not exceed five years, at the Indemnified Party's
incremental cost of borrowed funds). A "Tax Benefit" means
any Loss which is reasonably likely to result in any refund of
income Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of income Taxes
which otherwise would have been paid currently.

7.3 Indemnification Obligations of the Purchaser. The
Purchaser will indemnify the Seller and its Affiliates,
stockholders, officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives and permitted successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnities") and hold each of them harmless against
any Loss which such Seller Indemnitee suffers, sustains or becomes
subject to as a result of, in connection with, relating to or by
virtue of, without duplication:

(a) any misrepresentation or breach of any
representation or warranty by the Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement or any certificate or other instrument or document
delivered to the Purchaser pursuant to any Transaction Document;

(b) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Purchaser set forth in any Transaction Document;
or 

(c) any Assumed Liability.

7.4 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) Notice of Claim. Any Person making a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 or 7.3 above (an
"Indemnified Party") must give the Party from whom indemnification
is sought (an "Indemnifying Party") written notice of such claim
(an "Indemnification Claim Notice") promptly after the Indemnified
Party receives any written notice of any action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or other claim (a "Proceeding") against
or involving the Indemnified Party by a Government Entity or other
third party or otherwise discovers the liability, obligation or
facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification; provided that
the failure to notify or delay in notifying an Indemnifying Party
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations pursuant
to Section 7.2 or 7.3, as applicable, except to the extent that
such failure actually harms the Indemnifying Party. Such notice
must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount
of such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss
is known at such time).

(b) Control of Defense: Conditions. With respect to
the defense of any Proceeding against or involving an Indemnified
Party in which the Government Entity or other third party in
question seeks only the recovery of a sum of money for which
indemnification is provided in Section 7.2 or 7.3, at its option an
Indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel of such defense any
legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Party; provided that
before the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense it
must first

(i) enter into an agreement with the Indemnified
Party (in form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party) pursuant to which the Indemnifying Party agrees to be
fully responsible (with no reservation of any rights other
than the right to be subrogated to the rights of the
Indemnified Party) for all Losses relating to such Proceeding
and unconditionally guarantees the payment and performance of
any liability or obligation which may arise with respect to
such Proceeding or the facts giving rise to such claim for
indemnification, and

(ii) furnish the Indemnified Party with evidence
that the Indemnifying Party, in the Indemnified Party's sole
judgment, is and will be able to satisfy any such liability. 

(c) Control of Defense: Exceptions, etc. 
Notwithstanding Section 7.4(b), the Indemnified Party will be
entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ
counsel of its choice for such purpose at its own expense; provided
that the Indemnifying Party will bear the reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel incurred prior to the date upon
which the Indemnifying Party effectively assumes control of such
defense. The Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to assume
control of the defense of such claim, and will pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of legal counsel retained by the Indemnified
Party, if

(i) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that
an adverse determination of such Proceeding could be
detrimental to or injure the Indemnified Party's reputation or
future business prospects,

(ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that
there exists or could arise a conflict of interest which,
under applicable principles of legal ethics, could prohibit a
single legal counsel from representing both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party in such Proceeding, or

(iii) a court of competent jurisdiction rules that
the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to prosecute
or defend vigorously such claim; and

The Indemnifying Party must obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which the Indemnified Party will not unrea-

sonably withhold) prior to entering into any settlement of such
claim or Proceeding or ceasing to defend such claim or Proceeding.

7.5 Payment. Subject to Section 7.6(g), the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the Indemnified Party to the extent
the Indemnified Party is entitled to payment hereunder in
immediately available funds promptly after the Indemnified Party
provides the Indemnifying Party with notice of a claim hereunder
and the parties reasonably agree that there is a reasonable basis
for liability of Losses in respect of such claim, or a final
result, determination, finding, judgment and/or award is made
pursuant to the terms of Section 7.6 below.

7.6 Arbitration Procedure.

(a) The Purchaser and the Seller agree that the
arbitration procedure set forth below shall be the sole and
exclusive method for resolving and remedying claims for money
damages arising out of the provisions of Article 7 (the
"Disputes"). Nothing in this Section 7.6 shall prohibit a Party
from instituting litigation to enforce any Final Determination (as
defined below). The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that,
except as otherwise provided in this Section 7 or in the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association as in
effect from time to time, the arbitration procedures and any Final
Determination hereunder shall be governed by, and shall be enforced
pursuant to the New York Arbitration Act.

(b) In the event that any Party asserts that there
exists a Dispute, such Party shall deliver a written notice to each
other Party involved therein specifying the nature of the asserted
Dispute and requesting a meeting to attempt to resolve the same. 
If no such resolution is reached within ten business days after
such delivery of such notice, the Party delivering such notice of
Dispute (the "Disputing Person") may, within 45 business days after
delivery of such notice, commence arbitration hereunder by
delivering to each other Party involved therein a notice of
arbitration (a "Notice of Arbitration"). Such Notice of
Arbitration shall specify the matters as to which arbitration is
sought, the nature of any Dispute, the claims of each Party to the
arbitration and shall specify the amount and nature of any damages,
if any, sought to be recovered as a result of any alleged claim,
and any other matters required by the Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association as in effect from time to
time to be included therein, if any.

(c) The Purchaser and the Seller each shall select one
non-neutral arbitrator expert in the subject matter of the Dispute
(the arbitrators so selected shall be referred to herein as the
"Purchaser's Arbitrator" and the "Seller's Arbitrator,"
respectively). In the event that either Party fails to select an
arbitrator as set forth herein within 20 days from the delivery of
a Notice of Arbitration, then the matter shall be resolved by the
arbitrator selected by the other Party. The Seller's Arbitrator
and the Purchaser's Arbitrator shall select a third independent,
neutral arbitrator expert in the subject matter of the dispute, and
the three arbitrators so selected shall resolve the matter
according to the procedures set forth in this Section 7.6. If the
Seller's Arbitrator and the Purchaser's Arbitrator are unable to
agree on a third arbitrator within 20 days after their selection,
the Seller's Arbitrator and the Purchaser's Arbitrator shall each
prepare a list of three independent arbitrators. The Seller's
Arbitrator and the Purchaser's Arbitrator shall each have the
opportunity to designate as objectionable and eliminate one
arbitrator from the other arbitrator's list within seven days after
submission thereof, and the third arbitrator shall then be selected
by lot from the arbitrators remaining on the lists submitted by the
Seller's Arbitrator and the Purchaser's Arbitrator.

(d) The arbitrator(s) selected pursuant to Section
7.6(c) above will determine the allocation of the costs and
expenses of arbitration based upon the percentage which the portion
of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the
amount actually contested by such Party. For example, if the
Purchaser submits a claim for $1,000 and if the Seller contests
only $500 of the amount claimed by the Purchaser, and if the
arbitrator(s) ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the
Purchaser $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses
of arbitration will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to the
Seller and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Purchaser.

(e) The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New
York under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association as in effect from time to time, except as
modified by the agreement of all of the parties to this Agreement. 
The arbitrator(s) shall so conduct the arbitration that a final
result, determination, finding, judgment and/or award (the "Final
Determination") is made or rendered as soon as practicable, but in
no event later than 90 business days after the delivery of the
Notice of Arbitration nor later than 10 days following completion
of the arbitration. The Final Determination must be agreed upon
and signed by the sole arbitrator or by at least two of the three
arbitrators (as the case may be). The Final Determination shall be
final and binding on all parties and there shall be no appeal from
or reexamination of the Final Determination, except for fraud,
perjury, evident partiality or misconduct by an arbitrator
prejudicing the rights of any Party and to correct manifest
clerical errors.

(f) The Purchaser and the Seller may enforce any Final
Determination in any state or federal court located in New York,
New York. For the purpose of any action or proceeding instituted
with respect to any Final Determination, each Party hereto hereby
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts, irrevocably
consents to the service of process by registered mail or personal
service and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which it may have or hereafter have
as to personal jurisdiction, the laying of the venue of any such
action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that
any such action or proceeding brought in any court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.

(g) Any Party required to make a payment pursuant to
this Section 7.6 shall pay the Party entitled to receive such
payment within three days of the delivery of the Final
Determination to such responsible Party. If any Party shall fail
to pay the amount of any damages, if any, assessed against it
within such three day period, the unpaid amount shall bear interest
from the date of such delivery at the lesser of (i) the prime rate
of interest published by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System as the "Bank Prime Loan" rate, in effect from time
to time (which rate shall be adjusted on the effective date of each
change in such prime rate) plus 2.00% and (ii) the maximum rate
permitted by applicable usury laws. Interest on any such unpaid
amount shall be compounded semi-annually, computed on the basis of
a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and shall be
payable on demand. In addition, such Party shall promptly
reimburse the other Party for any and all costs and expenses of any
nature or kind whatsoever (including but not limited to all
attorneys' fees) incurred in seeking to collect such damages or to
enforce any Final Determination.

7.7 Exclusive Remedy. The foregoing indemnification
provisions shall be the exclusive remedy pursuant to Sections
7.2(a)(i) and 7.3(a) for any breach of representation or warranty
set forth in this Agreement or any Schedule, Exhibit, certificate
or other instrument or document furnished pursuant to any
Transaction Document; provided, however, that the foregoing
indemnification provisions are in addition to, and not in
derogation of, any statutory or common law remedy any Party may
have for any matter other than breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement or any Schedule, Exhibit,
certificate or other instrument or document furnished pursuant to
any Transaction Document.

9.5 Benefits Matters. 

(a) Transferred Employees. Purchaser shall have no
obligation to hire any employee of Seller but may offer to employ,
as of the Closing Date, some or all of the employees of Seller as
Purchaser shall so desire. Any employee of Seller who accepts
Purchaser's offer of employment (the "Transferred Employees") shall
be hired under the terms and conditions of employment as offered to
such person by Purchaser. To the extent required by law, Purchaser
shall recognize the bargaining representative currently
representing Seller's employees (the "Union"), however, unless
Purchaser notifies the Union to the contrary, Purchaser shall not
assume Seller's bargaining agreement with the Union. The Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and the Stockholder
from and against all liability arising under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended ("WARN"), as a
result of the Purchaser's failure to offer employment to any Person
who is an active employee of the Seller as of the Closing Date or
as a result of actions taken by the Purchaser after the Closing
Date. At the Closing, the Seller shall provide to the Purchaser a
list of all employees of the Seller whose employment has been
terminated within 90 days prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Employee Benefits. 

(i) Comparable Benefits: Crediting of Service:
Assumption of Liability. Except as otherwise provided in Section
9.5(b)(iii) below, as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
provide the Transferred Employees employee benefits which in the
aggregate are substantially comparable (but not necessarily
identical on a plan or program basis) to those provided by the
Seller as of the Closing Date under the employee benefit plans
listed on the Employee Benefits Schedule (other than with respect
to pension plan benefits and post-employment health and welfare
benefits which will not be provided by the Purchaser). The
Purchaser shall grant the Transferred Employees credit for service
with the Seller for purposes of eligibility and vesting under
benefit plans to be provided by the Purchaser.

(ii) Vacation. The Purchaser agrees to provide vacation
benefits similar to those provided to the Transferred Employees by
the Seller as of the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall accept the
vacation balances owing to Transferred Employees as of the Closing
Date, provided that the Seller provides to the Purchaser a schedule
of all vacation vested as of June 30, 1994 and the pro rata
vacation time earned for the period, if any, from June 30, 1994
through the Closing Date but not taken or paid as of the Closing
Date and such amount is properly accrued on the Closing Balance
Sheet.

(iii) Group Health. The Purchaser shall, with respect to
all Transferred Employees (and their "qualified beneficiaries"
within the meaning of Section 4980B(g) of the Code) who were
covered by "group health plans," within the meaning of Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code, maintained by the Seller immediately prior
to the Closing Date and who are not denied coverage under
Purchaser's group health plans because they have been treated for
any condition within the 90-day period ending on the Closing Date,
cover such persons under the group health plans maintained by the
Purchaser, which plans shall recognize pre-existing health
conditions and shall recognize payments made by Transferred
Employees under the Seller's group health plans for purposes of
deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums under the Purchaser's plans. 
With respect to Transferred Employees (and their "qualified
beneficiaries" within the meaning of Section 4980B(g) of the Code)
who were covered by "group health plans," within the meaning of
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, maintained by the Seller
immediately prior to the Closing Date and who are denied coverage
under Purchaser's group health plans because they have been treated
for any condition within the 90-day period ending on the Closing
Date ("Non-covered Persons"), such Non-covered Persons will not be
covered under the Purchaser's plans and the Seller shall make
available to such Non-covered Persons continuation of coverage
under the provisions of COBRA on the same terms as made available
to other terminated employees for a period of at least one year
following the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall not be responsible
or liable for continuation of coverage under the provisions of
COBRA where the event entitling the person to continuation of
coverage occurred on or prior to the Closing Date, including with
respect to Non-covered Persons and other employees of Seller who
are not Transferred Persons. The parties hereto agree that there
will be no reserve on the Draft Balance Sheet with respect to the
above described matters.

(iv) Pre-closing Obligations. Purchaser shall not assume
any liability for any claim (including, without limitation, medical
and workers compensation claims) incurred on or prior to the
Closing Date or benefit accrued prior to the Closing Date. The
Seller shall be responsible for all liability relating to any
claims incurred (whether or not reported and whether or not paid)
on or prior to the Closing Date or benefits accrued prior to the
Closing Date and no reserve for such claims shall be reflected on
the Closing Balance Sheet. In addition, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not assume any
responsibility for or obligation to any person who is not a
Transferred Person, including without limitation, any retired or
former employee of the Seller.

(v) Salaried and Hourly Pension Plans. Purchaser shall
not assume sponsorship of or any responsibility or obligation under
the Salaried Pension Plan or the Hourly Pension Plan (the "Pension
Plans"). Each employee of Seller who is a participant in the
Pension Plans will be fully vested in all benefits accrued
thereunder as of the Closing Date. Seller shall retain
responsibility for all benefits accrued under the Pension Plans and
shall distribute such benefits to the Transferred Employees in
accordance with the terms of the plans and as required by law.

(vi) 401(k) Plan. Purchaser shall not assume sponsorship
of or any responsibility under the salaried 401(k) plan or the
hourly 401(k) plan. Each employee of Seller who is a participant
in the 401(k) plans will be fully vested in all benefits accrued
thereunder as of the Closing Date. Seller shall retain all
responsibility for such plans and shall distribute the account
balances maintained thereunder to the Transferred Employees in
accordance with the terms of the plans and as required by law. The
Purchaser shall permit Transferred Employees, at their election, to
rollover their balances in such 401(k) plans of Seller into the
Purchaser's 401(k) plan.

(vii) Nonqualified Plans. The Purchaser shall not assume
any liability or responsibility under any nonqualified employee
benefit plans of Seller (including any Section 125 plan), whether
or not attributable to Transferred Employees.

(viii) Required Documentation. In connection with the
implementation of this Section 9.5(b), the Seller and the Purchaser
shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of all documentation
which may be required to be filed with the Internal Revenue
Service, the Department of Labor or any other applicable
governmental agency.

(c) Retention Bonuses. On or about January 14, 1994,
Stockholder entered into the retention agreements listed on
Schedule 9.5(c) attached hereto (the "Retention Agreements") with
those of Seller's employees listed on Schedule 9.5(c) (the
"Retention Employees") in anticipation of the sale of the Business. 
Under the Retention Agreement, a bonus will be paid to the
Retention Employees if the Business is sold and the Retention
Employees satisfy the conditions set forth in the Retention
Agreement. The retention bonus will be paid in two installments,
the first coming due shortly after closing, and the second coming
due six months after closing (assuming the Retention Employee has
satisfied the conditions for payment). Seller will pay the first
installment of the retention bonus under the Retention Agreements. 
Purchaser hereby agrees to assume Stockholders and/or Seller's
obligation for the second installment due under the Retention
Agreements entered into with respect to each Retention Employee
hired by Purchaser as of the Closing Date; provided such employee
(i) satisfies each condition set forth in the Retention Agreement
and (ii) is employed by Purchaser for the six months following the
Closing Date. 

(d) Severance. Purchaser agrees to establish and
maintain for a period one year after the Closing Date a severance
policy which shall be identical to that maintained by Stockholder
as of the date hereof; provided, however, such severance policy
shall only apply to all employees of the Seller at the time of
Closing who are not represented by the Union. Purchaser shall also
offer to John Noblitt an agreement which provides severance
benefits substantially similar to his current arrangement in effect
with Seller. 

9.6 Transfer Taxes. Purchaser will be liable for all
transfer, sales and use Taxes, if any, arising from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that Seller will be liable for any transfer, sales and use
Taxes related to the ownership and disposition of the Excluded
Assets.

9.7 Non-Compete. 

(a) As a significant inducement to Purchaser to enter
into and to perform its obligations under this Agreement, Seller
and Stockholder agree that, for a period of two years after the
Closing Date, they will not anywhere in the United States, directly
or indirectly, either for themselves or any other Person, compete
with the Business; provided, however, that this Section 9.7 will
not prohibit Seller or Stockholder from (i) acquiring up to 5% of
the outstanding securities of any class of a corporation which is
publicly traded, (ii) acquiring any business not more than the
lesser of (A) 10% or (B) $5 million of the total revenue of which
is derived from businesses or products which compete with the
Business; or (iii) acquiring any business larger than that referred
to in clause (ii) above but not more than the lesser of (A) 50% or
(B) $40 million of the total revenue of which is derived from
businesses or products which compete with the Business (provided
that (x) upon acquisition thereof such competing businesses are
offered to be sold to the Purchaser at a price which is mutually
agreeable to the Purchaser and the Stockholder (or, if the
Purchaser desires to purchase such businesses but the parties
cannot agree on price, at a price equal to the fair value of such
businesses, as determined by a nationally recognized investment
banking firm mutually acceptable to the Purchaser and the
Stockholder) and (y) if the Purchaser does not desire to purchase
such businesses, the Stockholder disposes of such competing
businesses within 6 months following notification from the
Purchaser that it does not desire to purchase such businesses).

(b) If, at the time of enforcement of this Section 9.7,
a court holds that the duration, scope or area restrictions stated
herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the
parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable
under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated
duration, scope or area.

(c) Seller and Stockholder agree that in the event of any
breach of any provisions of this Section 9.7, Purchaser will have
the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in
its favor, to enforce its rights and Seller's and Stockholder's
obligations under this Section 9.7 not only by an action or actions
for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief in order
to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this
Section 9.7.

(d) Each Party agrees that no portion of the Purchase
Price is being paid nor will be allocated to the agreement not-to-
compete set forth in this Section 9.7.

9.8 Transaction Expenses. Each of the Parties will be
responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by such Party in
connection with the negotiation, preparation and entry into the
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions to
be consummated pursuant to the Transaction Documents.

9.9 Further Assurances. From and after the Closing, the
Seller will execute all documents and take any other action which
it is reasonably requested to execute or take to further effectuate
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

9.10 Announcements. Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser
will not make any public announcement of or regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
approval of the Seller as to the timing and content of such
announcement (which approval the Seller may not unreasonably
withhold or delay). Neither the Seller nor the Stockholder will
make any public announcement of or regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior approval of the
Purchaser as to the timing and content of such announcement (which
approval the Purchaser may not unreasonably withhold or delay);
provided that the Stockholder may, without the Purchaser's
approval, make a public announcement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent required
by law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
securities exchange so long as prior to making any such public
announcement the Stockholder gives the Purchaser the opportunity to
review and comment upon the contents thereof.

9.11 Property Taxes and FICA.

(a) FICA. The alternative procedure established in
Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 84-77, 1984-2 C.B. 753, relating to
employment tax returns and statements shall be adopted by the
Purchaser and the Seller for Transferred Employees. The Seller
shall, in a timely fashion, furnish the Purchaser with the
information it needs to comply with this procedure.

(b) Property Taxes. Real and personal property Taxes
relating to the Acquired Assets for a taxable period that includes
the Closing Date shall be pro rated between the Seller and the
Purchaser according to the number of days in such taxable period on
or before the Closing Date and the number of days in such taxable
period after the Closing Date. The period to which a Tax paid in
advance or paid in arrears relates shall be determined under
applicable federal, state and local Tax law.

9.12 Public Offering. In the event that Purchaser or
Ampad Holding Corporation desire to file a registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which requires
financial information of Seller for pre-Closing periods, Seller and
Stockholder will, and will permit their accountants to, provide
Purchaser with such financial information as Purchaser reasonably
requests.

9.13 Obsolete Inventory. The Seller shall have the
right, at its sole cost and expense, upon reasonable notice to the
Purchaser, at any time within 30 days of the Closing which is
during normal business hours and is reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser, to take possession of all or any portion of the
inventory of the Seller which is part of the Excluded Assets (the
"Obsolete Inventory"). The Purchaser shall have the right to
dispose of, for its own account and without any liability to the
Seller whatsoever, any Obsolete Inventory which Seller does not
take possession of within such 30-day period. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Seller
shall be permitted to dispose of the Obsolete Inventory to any
Person (other than any competitor of the Purchaser or any Person
that is a customer of the Purchaser or the Business as of the
Closing Date or is a wholesaler or distributor who services any
such customer), so long as the Seller disposes of such inventory in
a manner which could not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Purchaser or the Business.

ARTICLE 10

OTHER AGREEMENTS

10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated:

(a) at any time prior to the Closing by mutual agreement
of the Purchaser and the Seller,

(b) by the Purchaser, at any time when any Party other
than the Purchaser is in breach of any of its material obligations
pursuant to this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of
any Party other than the Purchaser is false or misleading in any
material respect (provided that such condition is not the result of
any breach of any covenant, representation or warranty of the
Purchaser set forth in any Transaction Document),

(c) by the Seller, at any time when the Purchaser is in
breach of any of its material obligations pursuant to this
Agreement or if any representation or warranty of the Purchaser is
false or misleading in any material respect (provided that such
condition is not the result of any breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty of a Party other than the Purchaser set
forth in any Transaction Document), or

(d) by the Purchaser or the Seller, at any time after
July 15, 1994, if the Closing has not then occurred.

Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to any of clauses
10.1(b) through (d) will be effected by written notice from the
terminating Party to the Purchaser (if the Seller is the
terminating Party) or the Seller (if the Purchaser is the
terminating Party). Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
clause 10.1(b) or (c) will not terminate the liability of any Party
for any breach or default of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement set forth in any Transaction Document which
exists at the time of such termination (other than a breach of a
representation or warranty which has been supplemented or amended
to cure such breach prior to the time of termination).

10.2 Remedies. No failure to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege under this
Agreement by any Party will operate as a waiver of such right,
remedy, power or privilege, nor will any single or partial exercise
of any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement
preclude any other or further exercise of such right, remedy, power
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided
pursuant to this Agreement are cumulative and not exhaustive of any
other rights, remedies, powers and privileges which may be provided
by law.

10.3 Consent to Amendments. No waiver, amendment,
modification or supplement of this Agreement will be binding upon
any Party unless such waiver, amendment, modification or supplement
is set forth in writing and is executed by such Party. No other
course of dealing between or among any of the Parties or any delay
in exercising any rights pursuant to this Agreement will operate as
a waiver of any rights of any Party.

10.4 Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, all covenants and agreements
set forth in this Agreement by or on behalf of the Parties will
bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and
assigns of the Parties, whether so expressed or not, except that
neither this Agreement or any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned by the Seller without the
Purchaser's prior written consent. The Purchaser may (at any time
prior to the Closing), in whole or in part assign its rights
pursuant to this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates, and
the Purchaser may, direct the Seller to convey the Acquired Assets,
in whole or in part, to one or more of the Purchaser's Affiliates;
provided, however, that in such event the Purchaser shall remain
fully liable for the fulfillment of all of its obligations
hereunder. Furthermore, the Purchaser may assign its rights under
this Agreement for collateral security purposes to any lenders
providing financing to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

10.5 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of
New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the State of New York to be applied. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the internal law of the State of New York will control
the interpretation and construction of this Agreement, even if
under such jurisdiction's choice of law or conflict of law
analysis, the substantive law of some other jurisdiction would
ordinarily apply.

10.6 Notices. All demands, notices, communications and
reports provided for in this Agreement will be in writing and will
be either personally delivered, sent by telecopier, with receipt
requested or sent by reputable overnight courier service (delivery
charges prepaid) to any Party at the address specified below, or at

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
undertakings and agreements set forth below, the parties hereby
agree as follows:

exclusive, royalty-free license to use the Licensed Trademarks 
in connection with the manufacture, advertising, marketing,
distribution and sale of Products. 
2.2. Ampad agrees that it will not use either of the
Licensed Trademarks as a trade name.
2.3 Ampad shall have the right to use the Licensed
Trademarks in combination or association with other names and
marks owned or used by Ampad. The use of such other names and
marks shall inure to the sole benefit of Ampad, and Ampad shall

retain any rights whatsoever to the combination or association of
such Licensed Trademarks with such other names and marks.

ARTICLE III
QUALITY CONTROL

3.1 Ampad shall maintain quality standards for all
Products in connection with which Ampad uses the Licensed
Trademarks that are at least substantially equivalent to the
quality standards maintained by O.S.I. in connection with the
Products prior to the effective date of this Agreement.
3.2 Upon reasonable request from O.S.I., Ampad shall
provide O.S.I. with access to the Products at Ampad's premises or
elsewhere to enable O.S.I. to determine whether Ampad is
maintaining the quality standards set forth in Section 3.1. 

ARTICLE IV
PROTECTION OF THE LICENSED TRADEMARKS

4.1 Ampad acknowledges that O.S.I. is the owner of the
Licensed Trademarks for the Products and that all use of the
Licensed Trademarks by Ampad under this Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of O.S.I. Ampad acknowledges that it is not
acquiring any interest or right in the Licensed Trademarks apart
from the rights set forth in this Agreement. Ampad will not
contest or deny the validity of the Licensed Trademarks or the
title of O.S.I. thereto, register or attempt to register the
Licensed Trademarks, or in any way assist others in so doing. 
Upon termination of this agreement, Ampad shall forthwith
discontinue entirely all use of the Licensed Trademarks and all
rights granted according to the terms of this Agreement shall
revert to O.S.I., provided, however, that Licensee shall have the
right to continue to use the Licensed Trademarks for a reasonable
period of time, not to exceed six (6) months to sell off or use
up its then existing inventory or supply of Products and
materials bearing the Licensed Trademarks, and to make
appropriate changes in signs, stationery, telephone directory
listings, trade name filings and the like.
4.2 Ampad agrees not to use at any time during the
term of this Agreement or thereafter any other word, trademark,
brand name, trade name, symbol, design or the like which
is confusingly similar to the Licensed Trademarks. Ampad will
not take any action which will harm or prejudice the Licensed
Trademarks or O.S.I.'s rights therein.

5.1 O.S.I. represents and warrants that it has
sufficient rights with respect to the Licensed Trademarks to
grant the license hereunder, but only as to the United States of
America.
5.2 O.S.I. represents and warrants that within the
past ten (10) years it has not received any notice of
infringement with respect to the use of the Licensed Trademarks
in connection with the manufacture, advertising, marketing,
distribution and sale of Products.

ARTICLE VI
TERM, CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION

6.1 The term of this Agreement shall commence on the
date hereof and continue uninterrupted unless and until one or
more of the following events shall occur:
(i) Ampad shall give O.S.I. Notice of
termination; 
(ii) Default by Ampad in the performance of 
sections 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 7.1 (ii) or 7.1 (iii) of this
Agreement which is not cured and continues for sixty (60) days
after receipt of written notice from O.S.I. of such default; or
(iii) Filing by or against Ampad of a petition in
bankruptcy or the making of an assignment for the benefit of
creditors.
(iv) The failure of Ampad to use the Licensed
Trademarks for two (2) consecutive years.

ARTICLE VII
TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS

7.1 Ampad will promptly notify O.S.I. of any actual
or, to their knowledge, threatened infringement of either of the
Licensed Trademarks; and
(i) O.S.I. may, acting in its sole
discretion, elect to bring proceedings against such infringer at
its own expense, but if it does not or is unwilling so to do,
then it shall notify Ampad and Ampad may at its own expense and,
insofar as the law so permits, in its own name or in the name of
O.S.I. undertake proceedings against any such infringer on terms
that all costs and expenses shall be borne solely by Ampad. In
such an event, Ampad shall retain the entire amount of any
judgment. O.S.I. hereby consents, upon Ampad's consent, to be
joined as a necessary party in any such action.
(ii) If Ampad commences infringement
proceedings pursuant to this paragraph, it will not abandon
prosecution of such proceedings before final adverse judgment
rendered by a court of last resort, without first offering O.S.I.
the opportunity, at its own expense, to take over the conduct of
such proceedings.
(iii) If Ampad commences infringement
proceedings pursuant to this paragraph, it will not settle any
such proceeding without the consent of O.S.I., which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld.
(iv) If in any infringement action commenced
by Ampad pursuant to this paragraph, the infringer pleads or
brings proceedings for revocation or otherwise alleges or pleads
that the Licensed Trademarks or any of them or any of the claims
thereof are invalid, then Ampad will notify O.S.I. of such
infringement by the infringer, and O.S.I. may, upon notification
to Ampad within twenty (20) days of being notified of such
infringement by Ampad, take over, at its own cost, the sole
responsibility for the conduct of the action.
(v) Each party will at the request and
expense of any other party give all reasonable assistance to such
other party if such other party is engaged in proceedings to
enforce any of the Licensed Trademarks, provided that no party
need undertake any special work or extra staff so to assist such
other party but, if it is willing to do so and is so requested by
such other party, may in such case require that such other party
meets the reasonable cost of so doing.

ARTICLE VIII
NON ASSIGNABILITY

8.1. Subject to O.S.I.'s prior written approval, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Agreement may
be assigned or transferred by Ampad to a non-competitor of Smith
Corona Corporation as part of the sale of all or substantially
all of Ampad's assets or business. Ampad shall notify O.S.I. of
any such intended assignment or transfer and, unless O.S.I.
notifies Ampad within ten (10) days of its objection to such an
assignment or transfer, O.S.I. shall be deemed to have given its
approval to such assignment or transfer. This Agreement may be
assigned by O.S.I.

termination of this Agreement.

GUARANTY AGREEMENT

GUARANTY AGREEMENT (this "Guaranty Agreement") dated as of [ 
], 1994 made by SMITH CORONA CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (the "Guarantor"), in favor of AMPAD CORPORATION, a
Massachusetts corporation ("Ampad").

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, the Guarantor is the legal and beneficial owner of
all of the issued and outstanding stock of SCM Office Supplies,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("OSI");
WHEREAS, the Guarantor, OSI and Ampad have entered into an
Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") dated as of
June 8, 1994, pursuant to which, among other things, Ampad will
purchase from OSI, and OSI will sell to Ampad, substantially all of
the assets of OSI, all upon the terms and conditions set forth in
the Purchase Agreement;
WHEREAS, the Guarantor has agreed to guarantee the obligations
of OSI under a Trademark License Agreement dated as of the date
hereof by and between OSI and Ampad (the "License Agreement"); and
WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement that the
Guarantor execute and deliver this Guaranty Agreement to Ampad;
NOW, THEREFORE, in order to induce Ampad to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and License
Agreement, the Guarantor hereby agrees with Ampad as follows:

1. Guaranty. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees the observance and performance, when and as
due, of each and all of the obligations and liabilities of OSI
under the License Agreement (all of the foregoing obligations and
liabilities under the License Agreement being hereinafter called,
collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations" and, individually, a
"Guaranteed Obligation").
2. Manner of Performance. The parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the Guarantor's obligations under Section 1 are to be
construed, interpreted, enforced, applied, observed or performed as
fully as if (but only as fully as if) the Guarantor were jointly
and severally liable with OSI for each and every one of the
Guaranteed Obligations, and provided Ampad has complied with
Section 3 hereof.
3. Notice to the Guarantor. The Guarantor hereby agrees that
if any Guaranteed Obligation is not observed or performed, as the
case may be, when and as due, and if Ampad shall notify the
Guarantor of such non-performance, the Guarantor shall cause OSI to
promptly observe or perform or the Guarantor will promptly observe
or perform, as the case may be, such Guaranteed Obligation.
4. Absoluteness of Guaranty. Subject to the provisions of
Section 7 hereof, the obligations of the Guarantor under this
Guaranty Agreement shall be absolute and unconditional, present and
continuing, irrespective of any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of or
termination of the existence of OSI, or any circumstance which
might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor; it
being agreed that the obligations of the Guarantor under this
Guaranty Agreement shall not be discharged except by observance or
performance as herein provided.
5. Guaranty Not Affected. The Guarantor hereby consents and
agrees that, at any time and from time to time:
(a) the time, manner, place and/or terms and conditions
of observance or performance of all or any of the Guaranteed
Obligations may be extended, amended, modified or changed pursuant
to agreement between OSI and Ampad;
(b) the time for performance of or compliance with any
term, obligation, covenant or agreement on the part of OSI to be
performed or observed by OSI under the License Agreement may be
extended, or such performance or compliance waived, or failure in
or departure from such performance or compliance consented to; and
(c) the License Agreement may be amended or modified in
any respect by the parties thereto, all in such manner and upon
such terms as the parties thereto may deem proper, and without
notice to or further assent from the Guarantor, and all without
affecting this Guaranty Agreement or the obligations of the
Guarantor hereunder, which shall continue in full force and effect
until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all obligations of the
Guarantor hereunder shall have been fully observed and performed.
6. Reinstatement. This Guaranty Agreement shall continue to
be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time
observance or performance, or any part thereof, of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored
or returned by Ampad upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of OSI, all as though such observance or performance
has not been made.
7. Guarantor's Rights. By their acceptance of this Guaranty,
Ampad agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Guaranty Agreement, the Guarantor shall have the right to avail
itself of (a) any and all defenses to and valid setoffs,
counterclaims and claims of recoupment against any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations that may at any time be available to the
Guarantor, OSI or any other person or entity and (b) any and all
other defenses, whether arising under any statute or at law or in
equity, available to the Guarantor as a defense against or
reduction of any or all of its liabilities or obligations
hereunder; provided, however, such defenses, setoffs,
counterclaims, claims of recoupment and other defenses shall only
be available to the Guarantor to the extent they would have been
available to the Guarantor if the Guarantor were a party to the
License Agreement with joint and several liability for the
obligations of OSI thereunder.
8. Representations. The Guarantor represents and warrants
that:
(a) The Guarantor is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and has all requisite corporate right, power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform this Guaranty Agreement. 
This Guaranty Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Guarantor, and is enforceable against the Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, as well
as general principles of equity limiting the availability of the
remedy of specific performance.
(b) The execution and delivery by the Guarantor of this
Guaranty Agreement and the performance by the Guarantor of its
obligations hereunder have been duly authorized by all the
necessary corporate action of the Guarantor and do not and will not
violate any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-
laws of the Guarantor or any judgment, order, decree, law or
regulation applicable to the Guarantor or do not and will not (i)
result in the breach of, or constitute a default under, or require
any consent (other than any consent which has been obtained) under
any agreement or instrument to which the Guarantor is a party or by
which the Guarantor or any of its properties may be bound or
affected or (ii) result in the creation or imposition of any lien,
charge, claim or encumbrance of any nature upon any of the assets
of the Guarantor.

any federal, state or local governmental body or regulatory or
supervisory authority, or any third party, is required in

threatened before any court, tribunal or governmental authority
seeking or threatening to restrain or prohibit, or which could in
any way affect, the performance of the Guarantor's obligations
contemplated by this Guaranty Agreement.
9. No Waiver; Amendments, Etc. No failure or delay on the
part of Ampad in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or remedy hereunder. No amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of this Guaranty Agreement, nor consent to
any departure by the Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Ampad,
and then such amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose given. No notice to or demand on the Guarantor in any case
shall entitle the Guarantor to further notice or demand in similar

until observance and performance in full of the Guaranteed
Obligations, (b) shall be binding upon the Guarantor, its

Agreement.

demands and other communications hereunder shall be given in
