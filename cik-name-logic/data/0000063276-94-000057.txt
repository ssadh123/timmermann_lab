warehouses and the company's manufacturing plants in Monterrey

and Tijuana, Mexico -- as well as U.S., Canadian and Latin

American inventories -- will be available to replace those lost

in the fire.

manufacture and marketing of children's toys. With headquarters

in El Segundo, California, Mattel has offices in 34 foreign

countries and markets its products in more than 140 nations

throughout the world.
