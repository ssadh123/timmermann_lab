Fiscal Year 1994 Earnings
-------------------------

CONNECTICUT NATURAL GAS CORPORATION ANNOUNCES INCREASE IN YEAR-END EARNINGS

HARTFORD, Connecticut, November 22, 1994 --- Connecticut Natural Gas

Corporation (NYSE:CTG) today reported consolidated net income for the

fiscal year ending September 30, 1994 of $17,637,000, up 5.1% from

$16,788,000 for fiscal 1993. Consolidated earnings per share were $1.85,

compared with $1.76 in fiscal 1993.

Victor H. Frauenhofer, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

said, "Earnings for the year benefitted from new rates which were approved

by regulators and took effect in December and from weather that was 7

percent colder than normal and 4 percent colder than the previous year." 

Mr. Frauenhofer continued, "Aggressive cost containment and increased off-

system sales were also factors in the year's financial improvement. CTG

continued its aggressive marketing efforts during fiscal 1994 which

resulted in 1.3 million MCF in new sales, from both traditional and non-

traditional sources."

The Company also announced a voluntary early retirement program in August

of 1994. Twenty employees accepted retirement effective November 1, 1994. 

The $1.3 million in expenses associated with this program were recognized

by CTG in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994.

Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation is the largest distributor of natural

gas in Connecticut and currently serves approximately 140,000 customers

in 22 municipalities in Greater Hartford/New Britain areas and Greenwich. 

The Company's nonregulated subsidiary provides district heating and cooling

to the downtown Hartford and State Capitol areas.
