BELO BUYS STATION
KIRO-TV IN SEATTLE

SEATTLE -- A. H. Belo Corporation and Bonneville International
Corporation announced today an agreement in principle for Belo to acquire the
assets of Bonneville's KIRO-TV in Seattle, Washington, for $160 million in
cash. The asset purchase is subject to certain conditions, including the
approval of appropriate federal agencies.

Based on speculation that the CBS Television Network may move its
affiliation in the Seattle-Tacoma market to another station, Belo said that it
initially plans to operate KIRO as an independent station with a full local
news service.

In making the announcement, Robert W. Decherd, Belo's chairman of the
board, president and chief executive officer, said: "Seattle-Tacoma is the 12th
largest broadcast market in the country. KIRO's distinguished 36-year history,
its strong local news presence, and its community ties combine with the growing
Seattle economy to provide Belo with several attractive operating strategies."

Rodney H. Brady, president and chief executive officer of Bonneville
International Corporation, said: "Over the past 30 years Bonneville, through
its KIRO-TV and KIRO radio stations, has developed strong, supportive ties to
the greater Seattle community. Happily, Bonneville will continue its powerful
news, community service, and public affairs presence in the Puget Sound area
through its KIRO radio stations, its pending purchase of KING (AM), and its
sales agreement with KING (FM). Although the decision to sell KIRO has been
very difficult, one of the primary reasons we have entered into the agreement
with Belo is that we are confident that Belo shares the same strong commitment
to employees, programming and community values as Bonneville. Thus, the people
of the greater Seattle area will benefit from two broadcasting companies deeply
committed to community involvement."

Belo Buys KIRO-TV in Seattle

Ken Hatch, president and chief executive officer of KIRO, Inc., said:
"I believe Belo is the best of all possible buyers. Belo has an outstanding
record in markets where they operate stations. They are known for journalistic
excellence in all their broadcast properties and newspapers. It is a
progressive company that will offer great career opportunities to our people."

KIRO and its production arm, Third Avenue Productions, will become a
part of Belo's Broadcast Division headed by Ward L. Huey, Jr., president of
the Broadcast Division and vice chairman of Belo's Board of Directors. Mr.
Huey noted: "The addition of KIRO will give Belo three television stations in
the top 12 U.S. markets, increasing our station group's coverage to more than 8
percent of the nation's television households."

Belo owns and operates network-affiliated television stations WFAA-TV
(ABC) in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas; KHOU-TV (CBS) in Houston, Texas; KXTV (CBS)
in Sacramento, California; WVEC-TV (ABC) in Hampton-Norfolk, Virginia; WWL-TV
(CBS) in New Orleans, Louisiana; and KOTV (CBS) in Tulsa, Oklahoma; as well as
Belo Productions, Inc.. Belo also owns The Dallas Morning News; DFW Suburban
Newspapers, Inc., publisher of eight community newspapers; and DFW Printing
Company, Inc.. Shares of Belo Series A Common Stock are traded on the New York
