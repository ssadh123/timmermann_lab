PROTECTIVE LIFE ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF
NATIONAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS

Protective Life Corporation (NYSE:PL) announced today that it has entered
into an agreement to acquire National Health Care Systems of Florida, Inc., a
dental health maintenance organization based in Jacksonville, Florida that
transacts business in the southeastern United States under the trade name
"DentiCare". The purchase price, which is to be paid in a combination of cash
and Protective Life Corporation common stock, will be determined at closing and
is estimated to be approximately $38 million. The transaction is subject to
approval by regulators and certain other conditions.

In announcing the proposed acquisition, Drayton Nabers, Jr., Chief
Executive Officer, stated: "We are excited about acquiring DentiCare. It is one
of the premiere franchises in the dental HMO business. This acquisition is a
major step toward our strategic goal of increasing our presence in this growing
segment of the supplemental health insurance business. We believe the
combination of Protective's traditional indemnity business with DentiCare's
dental HMO capability will position us to become a major force in the dental
health care market."

Protective Life Corporation provides financial services through the
production, distribution and administration of insurance and investment products
throughout the United States. It currently has annual revenues of approximately
$800 million and assets of $5.8 billion.
