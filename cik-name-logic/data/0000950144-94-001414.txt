MEDIUM-TERM FIXED RATE NOTE, SERIES B

Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes and
other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (hereinafter called the "Debt
Securities"), all unconditionally guaranteed by BanPonce Corporation
(hereinafter called the "Guarantor") and issued or to be issued under and
pursuant to an indenture dated as of October 1, 1991 (hereinafter called the
"Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantor to
Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (hereinafter called the "Trustee"), to which
Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for
a description of the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee
and the rights thereunder of the Holders of the Debt Securities. As provided
in the Indenture, the Debt Securities may be issued in one or more series,
which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts,
may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates,
may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to
different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to
different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as provided
or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Debt
Securities, which series is limited in aggregate initial offering price of up
to $500,000,000, designated as the Medium-Term Notes, Series B (the "Notes") of
the Company. The Notes may mature at different times, bear interest, if any,
at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be
repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, be
issued at an original issue discount, and be denominated in different
currencies.

In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect
to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be
declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable in the
manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the
Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities of each series to
be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and

-5-
<PAGE> 6
the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in
principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time Outstanding of each series
to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders
of specified percentages in principal amount of the Debt Securities of each
series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Debt Securities
of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of
the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their
consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be
conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this
Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in
exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or
waiver is made upon this Note.

In the event that the Guarantor shall be obligated to pay any
Additional Amounts due to a change in law, regulation or interpretation, the
Company may, at its option, redeem the Note as a whole at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount thereof (or, if such Note is an original issue
discount note, 100% of the OID Default Amount) together with accrued interest.

If so provided on the face of this Note, this Note may also be
redeemed by the Company on and after the date so indicated on the face hereof;
provided, however, that the first two paragraphs of Section 1103 of the
Indenture shall not apply to this Note, and if less than all of the Notes are
to be redeemed, the Company may select, from Notes that are subject to
redemption pursuant to the terms thereof, the Note or Notes, or portion or
portions thereof, to be redeemed. On and after the date, if any, from which
this Note may be redeemed, this Note may be redeemed in whole or in part, at
the option of the Company at a redemption price equal to the product of the
principal amount of this Note to be redeemed multiplied by the Redemption
Percentage, together with accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for
redemption. The Redemption Percentage shall initially equal the Initial
Redemption Percentage specified on the face of this Note, and shall decline at
each anniversary of the initial date that this Note is redeemable by the amount
of the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction specified on the face of this
Note, until the Redemption Percentage is equal to 100%.

If so provided on the face of this Note, this Note will be repayable
in whole or in part in increments of $1,000, provided that the remaining
principal amount of any Note surrendered for partial repayment shall be at
least $1,000, on any Business Day on or after the "Initial Date on

-6-
<PAGE> 7
which the Note is Repayable at the Option of the Holder" (as stated on the face
hereof), at the option of the Holder, at 100% of the principal amount to be
repaid, plus accrued interest, if any, to the repayment date. In order for the
exercise of the option to be effective and the Note to be repaid, the Company
must receive at the applicable address of the Paying Agent set forth below or
at such other place or places of which the Company shall from time to time
notify the Holder of this Note, on or before the thirtieth, but not earlier
than the sixtieth calendar day, or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next
succeeding Business Day, prior to the repayment date, either (i) this Note,
with the form below entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, or
(ii) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter from a member of a
national securities exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. or a commercial bank or a trust company in the United States of America
setting forth (a) the name, address, and telephone number of the Holder of this
Note, (b) the principal amount of this Note and the amount of this Note to be
repaid, (c) a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised
thereby, and (d) a guarantee stating that the Paying Agent on behalf of the
Company will receive this Note, with the form below entitled "Option to Elect
Repayment" duly completed, not later than five Business Days after the date of
such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter (and this Note and form
duly completed are received by the Paying Agent on behalf of the Company by
such fifth Business Day). Any such election shall be irrevocable. The address
to which such deliveries are to be made is Citibank, N.A., Attention:
Corporate Trust Services, 111 Wall Street, New York, New York 10043 (or, at
such other places as the Company shall notify the Holders of the Notes). All
questions as to the validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and
acceptance of any Note for repayment will be determined by the Company, whose
determination will be final and binding.

If this Note is issued with an original issue discount, (i) if an
Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have occurred and be
continuing, the amount of principal of this Note which may be declared due and
payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided
in the Indenture, shall be determined in the manner set forth under "OID
Default Amount" on the face hereof, and (ii) in the case of a default of
payment in principal upon acceleration, redemption, repayment at the option of
the Holder or at the Maturity Date hereof, in lieu of any interest otherwise
payable, the overdue principal of this Note shall bear interest at a rate of
interest per annum

-7-
<PAGE> 8
equal to the Default Rate stated on the face hereof (to the extent that the
payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), which shall accrue from
the date of such acceleration, redemption, repayment at the option of the
Holder or Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the date payment has been made
or duly provided for or such default has been waived in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture.

The Notes are issuable in definitive form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. Upon due presentment
for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the
Company maintained for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of
New York, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations for an equal
aggregate principal amount and like tenor will be issued to the transferee in
exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture and to
the limitations described below if applicable, without charge except for any
tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.

If this Note is a Global Note (as specified on the face hereof), this
Note is exchangeable only if (x) the Depository notifies the Company that it is
unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for this Global Note or if at any
time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (y) the Company in its sole
discretion determines that this Global Note shall be exchangeable for
definitive Notes in registered form or (z) an Event of Default, or an event
which with notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default,
with respect to the Notes represented hereby has occurred and is continuing.
If this Note is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be
exchangeable for definitive Notes in registered form, bearing interest (if any)
at the same rate or pursuant to the same formula, having the same date of
issuance, redemption provisions, if any, Maturity Date and other terms and of
differing denominations aggregating a like amount.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or
of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note
at the places, at the respective times, at the rate and in the currency herein
prescribed.

The Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and any paying agent may deem
and treat the Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note at such Holder's
address as it appears on the Security Register as kept by the Trustee or

-8-
<PAGE> 9
duly authorized agent of the Company (whether or not this Note shall be
overdue), for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account hereof and for
all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Guarantor nor the Trustee
nor any Paying Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All
payments made to or upon the order of such registered Holder shall, to the
extent of the sum or sums paid, satisfy and discharge liability for moneys
payable on this Note.

Terms used herein which are defined in the Indenture and are not
defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the
Indenture.

This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York.

under "Interest Payment Period", on the Interest Payment Dates specified above
and at Maturity, on said principal sum at said offices or agencies, in like
coin or currency, at a rate per annum equal to the Initial Interest Rate

Rate, CMT Rate, Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, Federal Funds Rate,
LIBOR, Prime Rate or Treasury Rate; provided, however, that if any Interest
Payment Date specified above would otherwise fall on a day that is not a

succeeding Business Day, except that in the event that the Interest Rate Basis
for this Note is LIBOR, if such day falls in the next calendar month, such

under "Interest Rate Reset Period" and as determined in accordance with the
provisions on the reverse hereof, from the Interest Payment Date next preceding
the date of this Note to which interest has been paid, unless the date hereof
is an Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid, in which case from
the date of this Note, or unless no interest has been paid on this Note, in
which case from the Original Issue Date specified above, until the principal
sum hereof has been paid or duly provided for or (b) if the rate at which
interest on this Note is payable shall be adjusted daily or weekly, as
specified above under "Interest Rate Reset Period" and as determined in
accordance with the provisions on the reverse hereof, from the Regular Record
Date (as defined herein) next preceding the date of this Note through which

Note, or unless no interest has been paid on this Note, in which case from the
Original Issue Date specified above, until the principal sum hereof has been
paid or duly provided for; provided, however, that if the Original Issue Date
is after any Regular Record Date preceding any Interest Payment Date and before

Interest Payment Date unless the rate at which interest on this Note is payable
shall be adjusted daily or weekly, as provided above under "Interest Rate Reset
Period" and as determined in accordance with the provisions on the reverse
hereof, in which case interest on this Note shall accrue from such Regular
Record Date, or, in either case, if no interest has been paid on this Note,
from the Original Issue Date specified above. The interest so payable on any
Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Holder at the close of business on
the Regular Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date, and interest
payable at Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom said principal sum is
payable; provided, however, that the first payment of interest on a Note
originally issued between a Regular Record Date and an Interest Payment Date
will be made on the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular
Record Date to the Holder on such next succeeding Regular Record Date. Any
such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for ("Defaulted
Interest") will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular
Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or
one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a
Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by

be made by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto at his last address as
it appears on the Security Register or, if a Depository with respect to this
Note is specified above or if $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes
of this series with the Interest Payment Dates specified above are registered
in the name of the Holder hereof, in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to such account as may have been appropriately designated by the

the period from and after Maturity.

BANPONCE FINANCIAL CORP.

MEDIUM-TERM FLOATING RATE NOTE, SERIES B

Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or
other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (hereinafter called the "Debt
Securities"), all unconditionally guaranteed by BanPonce Corporation
(hereinafter called the "Guarantor") and issued or to be issued under and
pursuant to an indenture dated as of October 1, 1991 (hereinafter called the
"Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantor to
Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (hereinafter called the "Trustee"), to which
Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for
a description of the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee
and the rights thereunder of the Holders of the Debt Securities. As provided
in the Indenture, the Debt Securities may be issued in one or more series,
which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts,
may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates,
may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to
different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to
different covenants and events of default, and may otherwise vary as provided
or permitted in the Indenture. This Note is one of a series of the Debt
Securities, which series is limited in aggregate initial offering price of up
to $500,000,000, designated as the Medium-Term Notes, Series B (the "Notes")
of the Company. The Notes may mature at different times, bear interest, if
any, at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be
repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all, and be
denominated in different currencies.

The interest rate in effect from the date of issue to the first
Interest Reset Date shall be the Initial Interest Rate specified on the face
hereof. Commencing with the first Interest Reset Date following the Original
Issue Date specified on the face hereof, the rate at which interest on this
Note is payable shall be adjusted daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly,
semi-annually or annually as specified on the face hereof under "Interest Rate
Reset Period". Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable from and including
the Interest Reset Date to which it relates but not including the next
succeeding Interest Reset Date or until Maturity, as the case may be. Subject
to applicable provisions of law and except as specified herein, on each

-6-
<PAGE> 7
Interest Reset Date, the rate of interest on this Note shall be the rate
determined with respect to the Interest Determination Date next preceding such
Interest Reset Date in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading
below.

If the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face of this Note is the
Certificate of Deposit Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, CMT Rate, Federal Funds
Rate or Prime Rate, the Interest Determination Date with respect to any
Interest Reset Date shall be the second Business Day immediately preceding such
Interest Reset Date. If the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof
is the Treasury Rate, the Interest Determination Date with respect to any
Interest Reset Date shall be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset
Date falls on which Treasury bills are auctioned; provided, however, that if,
as a result of a legal holiday, an auction with respect to any week is held on
the preceding Friday, such Friday shall be the Interest Determination Date with
respect to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week. If
the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face of this Note is the Eleventh
District Cost of Funds Rate, the Interest Determination Date with respect to
any Interest Reset Date shall be the last Business Day of the month immediately
preceding such Interest Reset Date on which the Federal Home Loan Bank of San
Francisco publishes the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index (as defined
below). If the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face of this Note is
LIBOR, the Interest Determination Date with respect to any Interest Reset Date
shall be the second London Banking Day preceding such Interest Reset Date.

If the Interest Rate Reset Period specified on the face hereof is
daily, the Interest Reset Dates with respect to this Note shall be each
Business Day. If the Interest Rate Reset Period specified on the face of this
Note is weekly, the Interest Reset Dates with respect to this Note shall be
Wednesday of each week; provided, however, that if the Interest Rate Basis
specified on the face of this Note is the Treasury Rate, the Interest Reset
Dates with respect to this Note shall be Tuesday of each week. If the Interest
Rate Reset Period specified on the face of this Note is monthly, the Interest
Reset Dates with respect to this Note shall be the third Wednesday of each
month; provided, however, if the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face of
this Note is the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, the Interest Reset Date
with respect to this Note shall be the first Business Day of each month. If
the Interest Rate Reset Period specified on the face of this Note is quarterly,
the Interest Reset Dates with respect to this

-7-
<PAGE> 8
Note shall be the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of
each year. If the Interest Rate Reset Period specified on the face of this
Note is semi-annual, the Interest Reset Dates with respect to this Note shall
be the third Wednesday of the two months in each year specified on the face
hereof under Interest Rate Reset Period. If the Interest Rate Reset Period
specified on the face of this Note is annual, the Interest Rate Reset Dates
with respect to this Note shall be the third Wednesday of the month in each
year specified on the face hereof under Interest Rate Reset Period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face
hereof is Treasury Rate and any Interest Reset Date with respect to this Note
falls on a day on which Treasury bills are to be auctioned, then such Interest
Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day. If any
Interest Reset Date with respect to this Note would otherwise be a day that is
not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next
succeeding Business Day; provided, however, if the Interest Rate Basis
specified on the face hereof is LIBOR, if such next succeeding Business Day is
in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the
immediately preceding Business Day. Unless otherwise specified on the face
hereof, the Calculation Date with respect to any Interest Determination Date
shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest
Determination Date, or if any such day is not a Business Day (as defined in the
Indenture) the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day preceding
the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity, as the case may be.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for Certificate of Deposit
Rate Notes. If the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is
Certificate of Deposit Rate, the Interest Rate per annum determined with
respect to any Interest Determination Date shall equal the rate on such date,
adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the
face hereof, and/or by multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any,
specified on the face hereof and calculated to the nearest one hundred-
thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage
point rounded upwards, for negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof as published by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest
Rates" or any successor publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System ("H.15(519)") under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)." In
the event that such rate is not published prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City
time, on the Calculation Date with respect to such Interest Determination Date,
then the

-8-
<PAGE> 9
Certificate of Deposit Rate with respect to such Interest Reset Date shall be
the rate (adjusted and/or multiplied and calculated as described above) on such
Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit having the
Index Maturity specified on the face hereof as published by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York in its daily statistical release, "Composite 3:30 P.M.
Quotations for U.S. Government Securities," or any successor publication of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("Composite Quotations"), under the heading
"Certificates of Deposit." If by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the
Calculation Date with respect to such Interest Determination Date such rate is
not published in either H.15(519) or Composite Quotations, the Certificate of
Deposit Rate with respect to such Interest Determination Date shall be
calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the arithmetic mean (adjusted
and/or multiplied and calculated as described above) of the secondary market
offered rates, as of 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Interest
Determination Date, of three leading nonbank dealers of negotiable U.S. dollar
certificates of deposit in The City of New York selected by the Calculation
Agent for negotiable certificates of deposit of major United States money
center banks (in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit) with a
remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity, specified on the face hereof
in denominations of U.S. $5,000,000; provided, however, that, if fewer than
three dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are quoting as
mentioned in this sentence, the Certificate of Deposit Rate with respect to
such Interest Determination Date will be the Certificate of Deposit Rate in
effect on such Interest Determination Date.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for Commercial Paper Rate
Notes. If the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is Commercial
Paper Rate, the interest rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest
Determination Date shall equal (a) the Money Market Yield (as defined herein)
of the rate on such Interest Determination Date for commercial paper having the
Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, (i) as such rate is published in
H.15(519), under the heading "Commercial Paper," or (ii) if such rate is not so
published on or prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date
pertaining to such Interest Determination Date, as published in Composite
Quotations, under the heading "Commercial Paper," or (b) if by 3:00 P.M., New
York City time, on the Calculation Date with respect to such Interest
Determination Date, such rate is not published in either of such publications,
the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates, as of 11:00
A.M., New York City time,

-9-
<PAGE> 10
on such Interest Determination Date, of three leading dealers in commercial
paper in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial
paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof placed for
industrial issuers whose bond rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a
nationally recognized rating agency, in each of the above cases, adjusted by
the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face
hereof, and/or by multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on
the face hereof and calculated to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a
percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded 
upwards; provided, however, that if fewer than three dealers selected as 
aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are quoting rates as described above, the 
interest rate per annum hereon with respect to such Interest Determination Date
shall be the Commercial Paper Rate in effect hereon on such Interest 
Determination Date.

"Money Market Yield" shall be a yield (expressed as a percentage)
calculated in accordance with the following formula:

Money Market Yield = 100 x 360 x D
---------------------
360 - (D x M)

where "D" refers to the per annum rate for commercial paper, quoted on a bank
discount basis and expressed as a decimal calculated to seven decimal places,
without rounding; and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the interest
period for which interest is being calculated.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for CMT Rate Notes. If the
Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is CMT Rate, the Interest Rate
per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date shall
equal the rate displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page (as defined
herein) under the caption ". . .Treasury Constant Maturities. . .Federal
Reserve Board Release H.15...Mondays Approximately 3:45 P.M.," under the column
for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (as defined herein) for (i) if the
Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7055, the rate on such Interest Determination
Date and (ii) if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7052, the week, or the
month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week in which the related
Interest Determination Date occurs. If such rate is no longer displayed on the
relevant page, or if not displayed by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the
related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for such Interest Determination
Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate for the Designated CMT
Maturity Index as

-10-
<PAGE> 11
published in the relevant H.15(519). If such rate is no longer published, or
if not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation
Date, then the CMT Rate for the Interest Determination Date will be such
treasury constant maturity rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (or other
United States Treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index) for the
Interest Determination Date with respect to such Interest Reset Date as may
then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation
Agent determines to be comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the
Designated CMT Telerate Page and published in the relevant H.15(519). If such
information is not provided by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related
Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for such Interest Determination Date will
be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity, based
on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market closing offer side prices as of
approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date
reported, according to their written records, by three leading primary United
States government securities dealers (each, a "Reference Dealer") in The City
of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference Dealers
selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in
the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the
event of equality, one of the lowest)), for the most recently issued direct
noncallable fixed rate obligations of the United States ("Treasury Notes") with
an original maturity of approximately the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a
remaining term to maturity of not less than such Designated CMT Maturity Index
minus one year. If the Calculation Agent cannot obtain three such Treasury
Note quotations, the CMT Rate for such Interest Determination Date will be
calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity based on
the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offer side prices as of
approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date
of three Reference Dealers in The City of New York (from five such Reference
Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation
(or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation
(or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for Treasury Notes with an
original maturity of the number of years that is the next highest to the
Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity closest to the
Designated CMT Maturity Index and in an amount of at least $100 million. If
three or four (and not five) of such Reference Dealers are quoting as described
above, then the CMT Rate will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offer
prices obtained and neither the

-11-
<PAGE> 12
highest nor the lowest of such quotes will be eliminated; provided, however,
that if fewer than three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent
are quoting as described herein, the CMT Rate will be the CMT Rate in effect on
such Interest Determination Date. If two Treasury Notes with an original
maturity as described in the third preceding sentence have remaining terms to
maturity equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, the quotes for the
Treasury Note with the shorter remaining term to maturity will be used.

"Designated CMT Telerate Page" means the display on the Dow Jones
Telerate Service on the page designated above (or any other page as may replace
such page on that service for the purpose of displaying Treasury Constant
Maturities as reported in H.15(519)), for the purpose of displaying Treasury
Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519). If no such page is specified,
the Designated CMT Telerate Page shall be 7052, for the most recent week.

"Designated CMT Maturity Index" means the original period to maturity
of the U.S. Treasury securities (either 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20 or 30 years)
specified on the face hereof with respect to which the CMT Rate will be 
calculated. If no such maturity is specified, the Designated CMT Maturity 
Index shall be 2 years.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for Eleventh District Cost of
Funds Notes. If the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is
Eleventh District Cost of Funds, the interest rate per annum determined with
respect to any Interest Determination Date shall be the rate equal to the
monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar month immediately
preceding the month in which such Interest Determination Date falls, as set
forth under the caption "11th District" on Telerate page 7058 as of 11:00 A.M.,
San Francisco time, on such Interest Determination Date. If such rate does not
appear on Telerate Page 7058 on any related Interest Determination Date, the
Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for such Interest Determination Date shall
be the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions of
the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District that was most recently announced
(the "Index") by the FHLB of San Francisco as such cost of funds for the
calendar month immediately preceding the date of such announcement. If the
FHLB of San Francisco fails to announce such rate for the calendar month
immediately preceding such Interest Determination Date, then the Eleventh
District Cost of Funds Rate determined as of the Interest Determination Date
will be the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate in effect on such Interest
Determination

-12-
<PAGE> 13
Date. In determining that the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco has
failed in any month to publish the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index, the
Calculation Agent may conclusively rely on any written advice of the Federal
Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to such effect.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for Federal Funds Rate Notes.
If the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is Federal Funds Rate,
the interest rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest
Determination Date shall equal the rate, adjusted by the addition or
subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, and/or by
multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof
and calculated to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point,
with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards, on such
Interest Determination Date for Federal Funds as published in H.15(519) under
the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)." In the event that such rate is not so
published prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date with
respect to such Interest Determination Date, then the Federal Funds Rate with
respect to such Interest Determination Date will be the rate (adjusted or
multiplied and calculated as described above) on such Interest Determination
Date as published in Composite Quotations under the heading "Federal
Funds/Effective Rate." If by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation
Date with respect to such Interest Determination Date such rate is not
published in either H.15(519) or Composite Quotations, the Federal Funds Rate
with respect to such Interest Reset Date shall be calculated by the Calculation
Agent and shall be the arithmetic mean (adjusted and/or multiplied and
calculated as described above) of the rates for the last transaction in
overnight Federal Funds arranged by three leading brokers of Federal Funds
transactions in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent as of
9:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Interest Determination Date; provided,
however, that if fewer than three brokers selected as aforesaid by the
Calculation Agent are quoting rates as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal
Funds Rate with respect to such Interest Determination Date shall be the
Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Interest Determination Date.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for LIBOR Notes. If the
Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is LIBOR, the interest rate
per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date relating
to a LIBOR Note (a "LIBOR Interest Determination Date") shall equal LIBOR,
adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the
face hereof, and/or by

-13-
<PAGE> 14
multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face 
hereof and calculated to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards,
determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following
provisions: (i) LIBOR will be determined as set forth on the face hereof, as
either (a) the arithmetic mean of the offered rates for deposits in U.S.
dollars having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, commencing on
the second London Banking Day immediately following such LIBOR Interest
Determination Date, that appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page as of 11:00
A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date, if at least two
such offered rates appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page ("LIBOR Reuters"), or
(b) the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having the Index Maturity specified
on the face hereof, commencing on the second London Banking Day immediately
following such LIBOR Interest Determination Date, that appears on Telerate Page
3750 as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date
("LIBOR Telerate"). "Reuters Screen LIBO Page" means the display designated as
page "LIBO" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as
may replace page LIBO on that service for the purpose of displaying London
interbank offered rates of major banks). "Telerate Page 3750" means the
display designated as page "3750" on the Telerate Service (or such other page
as may replace the 3750 page on that service or such other service or services
as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose of
displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits). If
neither LIBOR Reuters nor LIBOR Telerate is specified above, LIBOR will be
determined if LIBOR Telerate had been specified. If LIBOR Reuters is specified
above and at least two such offered rates appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO
Page, the rate in respect of such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be the
arithmetic mean of such offered rates as determined by the Calculation Agent.
If fewer than two offered rates appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page, or if
no rate appears on Telerate Page 3750, as applicable, LIBOR in respect of such
LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined as if the parties had
specified the rate described in (ii) below.

(ii) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which
fewer than two offered rates for the applicable Index Maturity appear on the
Reuters Screen LIBO Page, as specified in (i) (a) above, or on which no rate
appears on Telerate Page 3750, as specified in (i) (b) above, as applicable,
LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S.
dollars having the Index Maturity specified above are offered at approximately
11:00

-14-
<PAGE> 15
A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by four major
banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (the
"Reference Banks") to prime banks in the London interbank market, commencing on
the second London Banking Day immediately following such LIBOR Interest
Determination Date and in a principal amount equal to an amount of not less
than U.S. $1 million that is representative for a single transaction in such
market at such time. The Calculation Agent will request the principal London
office of each of the Reference Banks to provide a quotation of its rates. If
at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR for such LIBOR Interest
Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer
than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such LIBOR Interest Determination
Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by 11:00 A.M., New York
City time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks in
The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in U.S.
dollars to leading European banks, having the Index Maturity specified in the
applicable Pricing Supplement, commencing on the second London Banking Day
immediately following such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal
amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. $1 million that is
representative for a single transaction in such market at such time; provided,
however, that if the banks selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are
not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR will be LIBOR in effect on
such LIBOR Interest Determination Date.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for Prime Rate Notes. If the
Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is Prime Rate, Prime Rate
determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date shall equal the rate
adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the spread, if any, specified on the
face hereof, and/or by multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any,
specified on the face hereof and calculated to the nearest one
hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a
percentage point rounded upwards, set forth in H.15(519) for such date opposite
the caption "Bank Prime Loan." If such rate is not yet published by 9:00 A.M.,
New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Prime Rate for such Prime Rate
Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates of
interest publicly announced by each bank named on the Reuters screen NYMF Page
as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as in effect for such Prime Rate
Interest Determination Date as quoted on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page on such
Prime Rate Interest Determination Date, or, if fewer than four such rates
appear on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page for such Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date, the rate

-15-
<PAGE> 16
shall be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates quoted on the basis of the
actual number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on
such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by at least two of the three major
money center banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent
from which quotations are requested. If fewer than two quotations are
provided, the Prime Rate shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall
be determined as the arithmetic mean of the prime rates quoted in The City of
New York on such date by the approximate number of banks or trust companies
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, or any State
thereof, each having total equity capital of at least $500 million and being
subject to supervision or examination by a Federal or State authority, selected
by the Calculation Agent to quote such rate or rates; provided, however, that
if the Prime Rate is not published in H.15(519) and the banks or trust
companies selected as aforesaid are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence,
the Prime Rate with respect to such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date will
be the interest rate otherwise in effect on such Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date. "Reuters Screen NYMF Page" means the display designated as
page "NYMF" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as
may replace page NYMF on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates
or base lending rates of major United States banks).

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for Treasury Rate Notes. If
the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is Treasury Rate, the
interest rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination
Date shall equal the rate adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the
spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, and/or by multiplication by the
Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof and calculated to the
nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths
of a percentage point rounded upwards, for the most recent auction of direct
obligations of the United States ("Treasury bills") having the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519), under the heading
"Treasury bills -- Auction Average (Investment)" or, if not so published by
3:00 P.M., New York City time, on or prior to the Calculation Date pertaining
to such Interest Determination Date, the auction average rate for the
aforementioned auction for such Interest Determination Date (expressed as a
bond equivalent, calculated to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a
percentage point, rounded upwards, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days,
as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) for such auction as otherwise
announced by the United

-16-
<PAGE> 17
States Department of the Treasury, in either case, adjusted by the addition or
subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, and/or by
multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof
and calculated to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point,
with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards. In the event
that the results of the auctions of Treasury bills having the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof are not published or reported as provided above by
3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such
Interest Determination Date or if no such auction is held for a particular
week, then the Treasury Rate with respect to such Interest Determination Date
shall be a yield to maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent, calculated to one
hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, without rounding, on the basis of a
year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) of the
arithmetic mean (adjusted and/or multiplied and calculated as described above)
of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City
time, on such Interest Determination Date, of three leading primary United
States government securities dealers selected by the Calculation Agent, for the
issue of Treasury bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof; provided, however, that if fewer than three
dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned
in this sentence, the Treasury Rate with respect to such Interest Determination
Date shall be the Treasury Rate in effect on such Interest Determination Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate per annum hereon
shall not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the
Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. The Calculation
Agent shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing
on or before each Interest Determination Date.

The interest rate on this Note shall in no event be higher than the
maximum rate permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United
States law of general application.

At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent will
provide to the Holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if
different, the interest rate which will become effective as a result of a
determination made on the most recent Interest Determination Date with respect
to this Note.

-17-
<PAGE> 18

Interest payments hereon will include interest accrued to but excluding
the applicable Interest Payment Date. Accrued Interest hereon from the
Original Issue Date or from the last date to which interest hereon has been
paid, as the case may be, shall be an amount calculated by multiplying the face
amount hereof by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor
shall be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day from
the Original Issue Date or from the last date to which interest shall have been
paid or duly provided for, as the case may be, up to but not including the date
for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each
such day shall be computed by dividing the interest rate per annum applicable
to such day by 360 if the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is
Certificate of Deposit Rate, Commercial Paper Rate, Eleventh District Cost of
Funds Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate or by the actual number of
days in the year if the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is
Treasury Rate or CMT Rate.

In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect
to the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be
declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable in the
manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the
Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the Guarantor and the rights of the Holders of the Debt Securities
of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company,
the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than
a majority in principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time Outstanding
of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions
permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Debt
Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of
all Debt Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company and the
Guarantor with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults
under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the
Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon
all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not
notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

-18-
<PAGE> 19
In the event that the Guarantor shall be obligated to pay any
Additional Amounts due to a change in law, regulation or interpretation, the
Company may, at its option, redeem the Note as a whole at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount thereof together with accrued interest.

If so provided on the face of this Note, this Note may be redeemed by
the Company on and after the date so indicated on the face hereof; provided,
however, that the first two paragraphs of Section 1103 of the Indenture shall
not apply to this Note, and if less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed,
the Company may select, from Notes that are subject to redemption pursuant to
the terms thereof, the Note or Notes, or portion or portions thereof, to be
redeemed. On and after the date, if any, from which this Note may be redeemed,
this Note may be redeemed in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at
a redemption price equal to the product of the principal amount of this Note to
be redeemed multiplied by the Redemption Percentage together with accrued
interest to the date fixed for redemption. The Redemption Percentage shall
initially equal the Initial Redemption Percentage specified on the face of this
Note, and shall decline at each anniversary of the initial date that this Note
is redeemable by the amount of the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction
specified on the face of this Note, until the Redemption Percentage is equal to
100%.

If so provided on the face of this Note, this Note will be repayable
in whole or in part in increments of $1,000, provided that the remaining
principal amount of any Note surrendered for partial repayment shall be at
least $1,000, on any Business Day on or after the "Initial Date on which the
Note is Repayable at the Option of the Holder" (as stated on the face hereof),
at the option of the Holder, at 100% of the face amount hereof, plus accrued
interest, if any, to the repayment date. In order for the exercise of the
option to be effective and the Notes to be repaid, the Company must receive at
the applicable address of the Paying Agent set forth below or at such other
place or places of which the Company shall from time to time notify the Holder
of this Note, on or before the thirtieth, but not earlier than the sixtieth

Business Days after the date of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or

on behalf of the Company by such fifth Business Day). Any such election shall
be irrevocable. The address to which such deliveries are to be made is
Citibank, N.A., Attention: Corporate Trust Services, 111 Wall Street, New York,
New York 10043 (or at such other places as the Company shall notify the Holders
of the Notes). All questions as to the validity, eligibility (including time
of receipt) and acceptance of any Note for repayment will be determined by the
Company, whose determination will be final and binding.

The Notes are issuable in definitive form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. Upon due presentment
for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the
Company maintained for such purposes in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of
New York, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations for an equal
aggregate principal amount and like tenor will be issued to the transferee in
exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture and to
the limitations described below, if applicable, without charge except for any
tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.

If this Note is a Global Note (as specified on the face hereof), this
Note is exchangeable only if (x) the Depository notifies the Company that it is
unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for this Global Note or if at any
time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (y) the Company in its sole
discretion determines that this Global Note shall be exchangeable for
definitive Notes in registered form or (z) an Event of Default, or an event
which with notice or lapse of time or both would be an Event of Default, with
respect to the Notes represented hereby has occurred and is continuing. If
this Note is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be
exchangeable for definitive Notes in registered form, bearing interest (if any)
at the same rate or pursuant to the same formula, having the same date of
issuance, redemption provisions, if any, Maturity Date and other terms and of
differing denominations aggregating a like amount.

BANPONCE FINANCIAL CORP.

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
(DATED AS OF AUGUST 1, 1994)

Medium-Term Notes (collectively, the "Notes") in the aggregate
principal amount of up to $500,000,000 are to be offered on a continuous basis
by BanPonce Financial Corp. (the "Company") through Merrill Lynch & Co.,
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch"), CS First
Boston Corporation ("CS First Boston") and First Chicago Capital Markets, Inc.
("First Chicago") who, as agents (each an "Agent"), have agreed to use their
reasonable efforts to solicit offers to purchase the Notes from the Company.
The Agents also may purchase Notes as principal for resale.

The Notes are being sold pursuant to a Distribution Agreement among
the Company, BanPonce Corporation (the "Guarantor") and the Agents, dated
October 11, 1991, as amended on December 2, 1993 and supplemented on June 16,
1993 and August 1, 1994 (the "Distribution Agreement"). The Notes will be
unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest by the Guarantor (the "Guarantees"). The Notes and related Guarantees
will be issued pursuant to the Indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of October
1, 1991, among the Company, the Guarantor and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the
"Trustee"). A Registration Statement (the "Registration Statement", which term
shall include any additional registration statements filed in connection with
the Notes and related Guarantees as provided in the Distribution Agreement)
with respect to the Notes and related Guarantees has been filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). The most recent base
Prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as supplemented with respect
to the Notes and related Guarantees, is herein referred to as the "Prospectus".
The most recent supplement to the Prospectus with respect to the specific 
terms of the Notes is herein referred to as the "Pricing Supplement."

The Notes will either be issued (a) in book-entry form and represented
by one or more fully registered Notes (each, a "Book-Entry Note") delivered to
the appropriate Trustee, as agent for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), and
recorded in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, or (b) in certificated
form (each, a "Certificated Note") delivered to the purchaser thereof or a
person designated by such purchaser. Owners of beneficial interests in
Book-Entry Notes will be entitled to physical delivery of Certificated Notes
equal in principal amount to their respective beneficial interests only upon
certain limited circumstances described in the Prospectus.

General procedures relating to the issuance of all Notes are set forth
in Part I hereof. Additionally, Book-Entry Notes will be issued in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Part II hereof and Certificated Notes will be

payments determined by reference to
an index currency are herein
referred to as "Indexed Notes."

Denominations: The Notes will be issued in
denominations of $1,000 and integral
multiples thereof. Any Notes
denominated other than in U.S.
dollars will be issuable in
denominations as set forth in the
relevant Multi-Currency and Indexed
Note Prospectus Supplement. For
special provisions relating to
Multi-Currency Notes and Indexed
Notes, see the related Multi-
Currency and Indexed Note
Supplement.

Registration: Notes will be issued only in fully
registered form.

Redemption/Repayment: The Notes will be subject to
repayment at the option of the
Holders thereof in accordance with
the terms of the Notes on their
respective Optional Repayment Dates,
if any. Optional Repayment Dates,
if any, will be fixed at the time of
sale and set forth in the applicable
Pricing Supplement and in the
applicable Note. If no Optional
Repayment Dates are indicated with
respect to a Note, such Note will
not be repayable at the option of
the Holder prior to Maturity.

The Notes will be subject to 
redemption by the Company on and 
after their respective Initial 
Redemption Dates, if any. Initial 
Redemption Dates, if any, will be 
fixed at the time of sale and set 
forth in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement and in the applicable 
Note. If no Initial Redemption 
Dates are indicated with respect to 
a Note, such Note will not be 
redeemable prior to Maturity.

Calculation of 
Interest: In the case of Fixed Rate Notes, 
interest (including payments for 
partial periods) will be calculated 
and paid on the basis of a 360-day 
year of twelve 30-day months. In 
the case of Floating Rate Notes, 
interest will be calculated and 
paid on the basis of the actual 
number of days in the interest 
period divided by 360 with the 
exception of Treasury Rate Notes 
for which interest will be 
calculated on the basis of the 
actual number of days in the 
interest period divided by the 
actual number of days in the year. 
If an Interest Payment Date with 
respect to any Fixed Rate Note 
falls on a day that is not a
Business Day (as hereinafter 
defined), the payment of interest 
required to be made on such 
Interest Payment Date need not be 
made on such day, but may be made 
on the next succeeding Business Day 
with the same force and effect as 
if made on such Interest Payment 
Date and no interest shall accrue on
such payment for the period from 
and after such Interest Payment 
Date. If an Interest Payment Date 
with respect to any Floating Rate 
Note would otherwise fall on a day 
that is not a Business Day, such 
Interest Payment Date will be the 
following day that is a Business 
Day, except that in the case of a 
LIBOR Note, if such day falls in 
the next calendar month, such 
Interest Payment Date will be the 
preceding day that is a Business 
Day. If the Stated Maturity, or 
date of earlier redemption or 
repayment, as the case may be, of a 
Note is not a Business Day, the 
payment of principal and interest 
due on such day shall be made on 
the next succeeding Business Day
and no interest shall accrue on 
such payment for the period from 
and after such

-4-
<PAGE> 5
Stated Maturity, or date of earlier
redemption or repayment. For
special provisions relating to
Multi-Currency Notes and Indexed
Notes, see the related
Multi-Currency and Indexed Note
Prospectus Supplement. 

Acceptance and 
Rejection of Offers: The Company shall have the sole
right to accept offers to purchase
Notes from the Company and may
reject any such offer in whole or
in part. Each Agent shall
communicate to the Company, orally
or in writing, each reasonable offer
to purchase Notes from the Company
received by it. Each Agent shall
have the right, in its discretion
reasonably exercised, without notice
to the Company, to reject any offer
to purchase Notes through it in
whole or in part. 

Preparation of
Pricing Supplement: If any offer to purchase a Note is
accepted by the Company, the
Company, with the approval of the
Agent which presented the order (the
"Presenting Agent"), will prepare a
Pricing Supplement reflecting the
terms of such Note and file 10
Pricing Supplements relating to the

Act. Information to be included in
the Pricing Supplement shall
include: 

1. the name of the Company

5. Net Proceeds to the 
Company (but only if (a) the trade 
is being made on a principal basis 
and (b) the Net Proceeds to the 
Company is other than 100%), less

In each instance that a Pricing
Supplement is prepared, the
Presenting Agent will affix the
Pricing Supplement to supplemented
Prospectuses prior to its use.
Outdated Pricing Supplements and the
Prospectuses to which they are
attached (other than those retained
for files) will be destroyed.

Settlement: The receipt of immediately available
funds by the Company in payment for
a Note and the authentication and
delivery of such Note, including the
related Guarantee, shall, with
respect to such Note, constitute
"settlement." Offers accepted by
the Company will be settled at a
time as the purchaser and the
Company shall agree and pursuant to
the timetable for settlement set
forth in Parts II and III hereof
under "Settlement Procedures" with
respect to Book-Entry Notes and
Certificated Notes, respectively
(each such date fixed for
settlement, a "Settlement Date").
If procedures A and B of the
applicable Settlement Procedures
with respect to a particular offer
are not completed on or before the
time set forth under the applicable
"Settlement Procedures Timetable",
such offer shall not be settled
until the Business Day following the
completion of Settlement Procedures
A and B or such

-8-
<PAGE> 9
later date as the purchaser and the
Company shall agree.

In the event of a purchase of Notes 
by the Presenting Agent as principal,
appropriate settlement details will
be set forth in the applicable Terms
Agreement to be entered into between
the Presenting Agent and the Company
pursuant to the Distribution
Agreement.

Procedure for Changing 
Rates or Other 
Variable Terms: When a decision has been
reached to change the interest rate
or any other variable term on any
Notes being offered by the Company,
the Company will promptly advise the
Agents and the Agents will forthwith
suspend solicitation of offers to
purchase such Notes. Each Agent
will telephone the Company with
recommendations as to the changed
interest rates or other variable
terms. At such time as the Company
advises the Agents of the new
interest rates or other variable
terms, the Agents may resume
solicitation of offers to purchase
such Notes. Until such time, only
"indications of interest" may be
recorded. Immediately after
acceptance by the Company of an
offer to purchase at a new interest
rate or new variable term, the
Company, the Agents and the Trustee
shall follow the procedures set
forth under the applicable
"Settlement Procedures."

Suspension of 
Solicitation;
Amendment or 
Supplement: The Company may instruct the
Agents to suspend solicitation of
purchases at any time. Upon receipt
of such instructions, the Agents
will forthwith suspend solicitation
of offers to purchase from the
Company until such time as the

-9-
<PAGE> 10

Company has advised them that
solicitation of offers to purchase
may be resumed. If the Company and
the Guarantor decide to amend the
Registration Statement (including
incorporating any documents by
reference therein) or supplement any
of such documents (other than to
change rates or other variable
terms), they will promptly advise
the Agents and, except in the case
of an amendment by the filing of a
document incorporated by reference
in the Registration Statement, will
furnish each Agent and its counsel
with copies of the proposed
amendment or supplement. One copy
of such filed document, along with a
copy of the cover letter sent to the
Commission, will be delivered or
mailed to the Agents at the
following addresses:

rates or other variable terms) there

Notes that have been accepted by the

the Company will promptly advise the
Agents and the Trustee whether such
offers may be settled and whether
copies of the Prospectus as
theretofore amended and/or
supplemented as in effect at the
time of the suspension may be
delivered in connection with the
settlement of such orders. The
Company will have the sole
responsibility for such decision and

authenticity of the signature of 
any officer, employee or agent of 
the Company, the Guarantor or the 
Trustee on any Note or related 
Guarantee.

PART II: PROCEDURES FOR NOTES ISSUED
IN BOOK-ENTRY FORM

In connection with the qualification of Book-Entry Notes for eligibility
in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, the Trustee will perform the
custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in
accordance with its obligations under a Letter of Representations from the
Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee to DTC, dated August 1, 1994, and a
Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between the Trustee and DTC, dated
October 21, 1988 (the "Certificate Agreement"), and its obligations as a
participant in DTC, including DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS").

Issuance: All Fixed Rate Book-Entry Notes
having the same Original Issue Date,
interest rate, terms of redemption
or repayment, if any, and Stated
Maturity (collectively, the "Fixed
Rate Terms") will be represented
initially by a single global
security in fully registered form
without coupons; and all Floating
Rate Book-Entry Notes having the
same Original Issue Date, interest
rate basis or bases upon which
interest may be determined (each, an
"Interest Rate Basis"), which may be
one or more of the Commercial Paper
Rate, the Treasury Rate, LIBOR, the
CD Rate, the CMT Rate, the Federal
Funds Rate, the Prime Rate, the
Eleventh District Cost of Funds
Rate, any other rate set forth by
the Company, Initial Interest Rate,
Index Maturity, Spread and/or Spread
Multiplier, if any, Minimum Interest
Rate, if any, Maximum Interest Rate,
if any, terms of redemption or
repayment, if any, and Stated
Maturity (collectively, "Floating
Rate Terms") will be represented
initially by a single Book-Entry
Note.

Each Book-Entry Note will be dated 
and issued as of the date of its
authentication by the Trustee or its
duly appointed authenticating

-13-
<PAGE> 14
agent. Each Book-Entry Note will 
bear interest from a date (the 
"Interest Accrual Date") which will 
be (a) with respect to an original
Book-Entry Note (or any portion
thereof), its Original Issue Date
and (b) with respect to any
Book-Entry Note (or portion thereof)
issued subsequently upon exchange or
transfer of a Book-Entry Note or in
lieu of a destroyed, lost or stolen
Book-Entry Note, the most recent
Interest Payment Date (or, in the
case of Floating Rate Notes with
interest rates which reset daily or
weekly, the day following the most
recent Record Date to which interest
has been paid or duly provided for
on the predecessor Book-Entry Note
or Notes (or if no such payment or
provision has been made, the
Original Issue Date of the
predecessor Book-Entry Note or
Notes), regardless of the date of
authentication of such subsequently
issued Book-Entry Note. No
Book-Entry Note shall represent any
Certificate Note.

Identification: The Agents have arranged with the
CUSIP Service Bureau (the "CUSIP
Service Bureau") of Standard &
Poor's Corporation ("Standard &
Poor's") for the reservation of
approximately 900 CUSIP numbers for
each rank of Notes which have been
reserved for future assignment to
Book-Entry Notes representing Notes
issued in book-entry form and have
delivered to the Company, the
Trustee and DTC an initial written
list of such CUSIP numbers. The
Trustee will assign CUSIP numbers to
Book-Entry Notes as described below
under Settlement Procedure B. DTC
will notify the CUSIP Service Bureau
periodically of the CUSIP numbers
that the Trustee has assigned to
Book-Entry Notes. The Trustee will
notify the Company at

-14-
<PAGE> 15
any time when fewer than 100 of the
respective reserved CUSIP numbers
remain unassigned to Book-Entry
Notes, and, if it deems necessary,
the Company will reserve additional
CUSIP numbers for assignment to
Book-Entry Notes representing Notes
issued in book-entry form. Upon
obtaining such additional CUSIP
numbers, the Company will deliver a
list of such additional numbers to
the Trustee and DTC. Book-Entry
Notes having an aggregate principal
amount in excess of $150,000,000 and
otherwise required to be represented
by the same Global Certificate will
instead be represented by two or
more Global Certificates which shall
be assigned the same CUSIP number.

Registration: Each Book-Entry Note will be
registered in the name of CEDE &
CO., as nominee for DTC, on the
register maintained by the Trustee
under the Indenture. The beneficial
owner of a Book-Entry Note (i.e., an
owner of a beneficial interest in a
Book-Entry Note), or one or more
indirect participants in DTC
designated by such owner, will
designate one or more participants
in DTC (with respect to such
Book-Entry Note, the "Participants")
to act as agent for such beneficial
owner in connection with the
book-entry system maintained by DTC,
and DTC will record in book-entry
form, in accordance with
instructions provided by such
Participants, a credit balance with
respect to such Book-Entry Note in
the account of such Participants.
The ownership interest of such
beneficial owner in such Book-Entry
Note will be recorded through the
records of such Participants or
through the separate records of such
Participants and one or more
indirect participants in DTC.

-15-
<PAGE> 16
Transfers: Transfers of beneficial interests in
a Book-Entry Note will be
accomplished by book entries made by
DTC and, in turn, by Participants
(and in certain cases, one or more
indirect participants in DTC) acting
on behalf of beneficial transferors
and transferees of such Book-Entry
Note.

Exchanges: The Trustee may deliver to DTC and
the CUSIP Service Bureau at any time
a written notice specifying (a) the
CUSIP numbers of two or more
Book-Entry Notes Outstanding on such
date that represent Book-Entry Notes
having the same Fixed Rate Terms or
Floating Rate Terms, as the case
may be, other than Original Issue
Dates, and for which interest has
been paid to the same date; (b) a
date, occurring at least 30 days
after such written notice is
delivered and at least 30 days
before the next Interest Payment
Date for the related Book-Entry
Notes, on which such Book-Entry
Notes shall be exchanged for a
single replacement Book-Entry Note;
and (c) a new CUSIP number to be
assigned to such replacement
Book-Entry Note. Upon receipt of
such a notice, DTC will send to its
Participants (including the Trustee)
a written reorganization notice to 
the effect that such exchange will 
occur on such date. Prior to the
specified exchange date, the Trustee
will deliver to the CUSIP Service
Bureau written notice setting forth
such exchange date and the new CUSIP
number and stating that, as of such
exchange date, the CUSIP numbers of
the Book-Entry Notes to be exchanged
will no longer be valid. On the
specified exchange date, the Trustee
will exchange such Book-Entry Notes
for a single Book-Entry Note bearing
the new CUSIP number and the CUSIP
numbers of the

-16-
<PAGE> 17
exchanged Book-Entry Notes will, in
accordance with CUSIP Service Bureau
procedures, be cancelled and not
immediately reassigned.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Book-Entry Notes to be
exchanged exceed $150,000,000 in
aggregate principal amount, one
replacement Book-Entry Note will be
authenticated and issued to
represent each $150,000,000 of
principal amount of the exchanged
Book-Entry Notes and an additional
Book-Entry Note will be
authenticated and issued to
represent any remaining principal
amount of such Book-Entry Notes (see
"Denominations" below).

Denominations: All Book-Entry Notes will be
denominated in U.S. dollars and will
be issued in denominations of $1,000
and integral multiples thereof.
Book-Entry Notes will be denominated
in principal amounts not in excess
of $150,000,000. If one or more
Book-Entry Notes having an aggregate
principal amount in excess of
$150,000,000 would, but for the
preceding sentence, be represented
by a single Book-Entry Note, then
one Book-Entry Note will be issued
to represent each $150,000,000
principal amount of such Note or
Notes issued in book-entry form and
an additional Book-Entry Note will
be issued to represent any remaining
principal amount of such Note or
Notes issued in book-entry form. In
such a case, each of the Book-Entry
Notes shall be assigned the same
CUSIP number.

Interest: General. Interest on each Note
issued in book-entry form will
accrue from the Interest Accrual
Date of the Book-Entry Note
representing such Note. Each
payment of interest on a Book-Entry
Note will include interest accrued
through the day preceding, as the
case may

-17-
<PAGE> 18
be, the Interest Payment Date
(provided that in the case of
Floating Rate Notes with interest
rates which reset daily or weekly
interest payments will include
interest accrued to and including
the Regular Record Date immediately
preceding the Interest Payment
Date), the Stated Maturity Date,
Redemption Date or Repayment Date. 
Interest payable at Maturity of a
Book-Entry Note will be payable to
the Person to whom the principal of
such Note is payable. DTC will
arrange for each pending deposit
message described under Settlement
Procedure C below to be transmitted
to Standard & Poor's Corporation
("S&P"), which will use the
information in the message to
include certain terms of the related
Book-Entry Note in the appropriate
daily bond report published by S&P.

Interest Payment Dates. Interest
payments will be made on each
Interest Payment Date commencing
with the first Interest Payment Date
following the Original Issue Date;
provided, however, the first payment
of interest on any Book-Entry Note
originally issued between a Regular
Record Date and an Interest Payment
Date will occur on the Interest
Payment Date following the next
Regular Record Date.

Fixed Rate Notes. Interest
payments on Fixed Rate Book-Entry
Notes will be made semiannually on
June 15 and December 15 of each year
and at Maturity.

Floating Rates Notes. Except as
provided in Part I under
"Calculation of Interest", the
Interest Payment Date for a Floating
Rate Note will be, in the case of
Floating Rate Notes which reset

-18-
<PAGE> 19
daily, weekly or monthly, on
the third Wednesday of each month or
on the third Wednesday of March,
June, September and December of each
year as specified in the applicable
Pricing Supplement; in the case of
Floating Rate Notes which reset
quarterly, on the third Wednesday of
March, June, September and December
of each year; in the case of
Floating Rate Notes which reset
semiannually, on the third Wednesday
of the two months of each year
specified in the applicable Pricing
Supplement; or, in the case of
Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate
Notes, on the first Business Day of
each month or the first Business Day
of each March, June, September or
December as specified in the
applicable Pricing Supplement and in
the case of Floating Rate Notes
which reset annually, on the third
Wednesday of the month specified in
the applicable Pricing Supplement;
and, in each case, at Maturity. For
additional special provisions
relating to Floating Rate Notes, see
the Prospectus Supplement.

Regular Record Dates. The Regular
Record Date with respect to any
Interest Payment Date for a Fixed
Rate Note shall be the May 31 or
November 30 preceding such Interest
Payment Date. The Regular Record
Date with respect to any Interest
Payment Date for any Floating Rate
Note shall be the date 15 calendar
days (whether or not a Business Day)
preceding such Interest Payment
Date.

Notice of Interest Payments and
Regular Record Dates. On the first
Business Day of January, April, July
and October of each year, the
Trustee will deliver to the Company
and DTC a written list of Regular
Record Dates and Interest Payment

-19-
<PAGE> 20

Dates that will occur during the
six-month period beginning on such
first Business Day with respect to
Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes.
Promptly after each Interest
Determination Date for Floating Rate
Book-Entry Notes, the Company will
notify S&P of the interest rates
determined on such Interest
Determination Date.

Payments of Principal 
and Interest: Payments of Interest Only. 
Promptly after each Regular Record 
Date, the Trustee will deliver to 
the Company and DTC a written 
notice specifying by CUSIP number
the amount of interest to be paid 
on each Book-Entry Note issued 
under the Indenture on the 
following Interest Payment Date 
(other than an Interest Payment 
Date coinciding with Maturity) and 
the total of such amounts. DTC
will confirm the amount payable on 
each Book-Entry Note on such 
Interest Payment Date by reference 
to the daily bond reports published 
by Standard & Poor's. On such 
Interest Payment Date, the Company 
will pay to the Trustee, and the 
Trustee in turn will pay to DTC, 
such total amount of interest due
(other than at Maturity), at the 
times and in the manner set forth 
below under "Manner of Payment."

Payments at Maturity. 
On or about the first Business Day 
of each month, the Trustee will
deliver to the Company and DTC a 
written list of principal, interest 
and premium, if any, to be paid on 
each Book-Entry Note issued under 
the Indenture having a Maturity in 
the following month. The Trustee
and DTC will confirm the amounts of 
such principal, premium and 
interest payments with respect to a 
Book-Entry Note on or about the fifth
Business Day preceding the

-20-
<PAGE> 21
Maturity of such Book-Entry Note. At
such maturity, the Company will pay 
to the Trustee, and the Trustee in 
turn will pay to DTC, the principal 
amount of such Note, together with
interest and premium, if any, due 
at such Maturity, at the times and 
in the manner set forth below under 
"Manner of Payment." Promptly after
payment to DTC of the principal, 
interest and premium, if any, due 
at the Maturity of such Book-Entry
Note, the Trustee will cancel and 
destroy such Book-Entry Note and 
deliver to the Company a 
certificate of destruction therefor.

Manner of Payment. The total 
amount of any principal, premium, if
any, and interest due on Book-Entry 
Notes on any Interest Payment Date 
or at Maturity shall be paid by the
Company to the Trustee in funds 
available for use as of 9:30 a.m., 
New York City time, on such date. 
The Company will make such payment 
on such Book-Entry Notes by 
instructing the Trustee to withdraw 
funds from an account maintained by
the Company with the Trustee. The 
Company will confirm such 
instructions in writing to the 
Trustee. Prior to 10:00 a.m., New 
York City time, on such date or as 
soon as possible thereafter, the
Trustee will pay by separate wire 
transfer (using Fedwire message 
entry instructions in a form 
previously specified by DTC) to an 
account at the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York previously specified by
DTC, in funds available for 
immediate use by DTC, each payment 
of principal (together with 
interest and premium, if any) due 
on a Book-Entry Note on such date.
Thereafter on such payment date, 
DTC will pay, in accordance with 
its SDFS operating procedures then in
effect, such amounts in funds

-21-

<PAGE> 22
available for immediate use to the 
respective Participants in whose names 
such Notes are recorded in the 
book-entry system maintained by
DTC. Neither the Company nor the
Trustee shall have any responsibility
or liability for the payment by DTC of
the principal of, or interest on, the
Book-Entry Notes to such Participants.

Withholding Taxes. The amount of any 
taxes required under applicable
law to be withheld from any interest
payment on a Note will be determined
and withheld by the Participant,

possible but not later than the
respective times (New York City

-27-
<PAGE> 28
If a sale is to be settled
more than one Business Day after the
trade date, Settlement Procedures A,
B, and C may, if necessary, be
completed at any time prior to the
specified times on the first
Business Day after such trade date. 
In connection with a sale which is
to be settled more than one Business
Day after the trade date, if the
initial interest rate for a Floating
Rate Note is not known at the time
that Settlement Procedure A is
completed, Settlement Procedures B
and C shall be completed as soon as
such rates have been determined, but
no later than 11:00 a.m. and 2:00
p.m., New York City time,
respectively, on the second Business
Day before the Settlement Date.
Settlement Procedure I is subject to
extension in accordance with any
extension of Fedwire closing
deadlines and in the other events
specified in the SDFS operating
procedures in effect on the
Settlement Date.

If settlement of a Book-Entry Note is
rescheduled or cancelled, the
Company shall notify the Trustee and
the Trustee will deliver to DTC,
through DTC's Participant Terminal
System, a cancellation message to
such effect by no later than 2:00
p.m., New York City time, on the
Business Day immediately preceding
the scheduled Settlement Date.

Failure to Settle: If the Trustee has not entered an
SDFS deliver order with respect to a
Book-Entry Note pursuant to
Settlement Procedure G, then upon
written request (which may be
evidenced by facsimile transmission)
of the Company the Trustee shall
deliver to DTC, through DTC's
Participant Terminal System, as soon
as practicable a withdrawal message
instructing DTC to debit

-28-
<PAGE> 29
such Note to the participant
account of the Trustee maintained at
DTC. DTC will process the
withdrawal message, provided that
such participant account contains a
principal amount of the Book-Entry
Note representing such Note that is
at least equal to the principal
amount to be debited. If withdrawal
messages are processed with respect
to all the Notes represented by a
Book-Entry Note, the Trustee will
mark such Book-Entry Note
"cancelled", make appropriate
entries in its records and send such
cancelled Book-Entry Note to the
Company. The CUSIP number assigned
to such Book-Entry Note shall, in
accordance with CUSIP Service Bureau
procedures, be cancelled and not
immediately reassigned. If
withdrawal messages are processed
with respect to a portion of the
Notes represented by a Book-Entry
Note, the Trustee will exchange such
Book-Entry Note for two Book-Entry
Notes, one of which shall represent
the Book-Entry Notes for which
withdrawal messages are processed
and shall be cancelled immediately
after issuance, and the other of
which shall represent the other
Notes previously represented by the
surrendered Book-Entry Note and
shall bear the CUSIP number of the
surrendered Book-Entry Note.

If the purchase price for any
Book-Entry Note is not timely paid
to the Participants with respect to
such Note by the beneficial
purchaser thereof (or a person,
including an indirect participant in
DTC, acting on behalf of such
purchaser), such Participants and,
in turn, the Presenting Agent may
enter SDFS deliver orders through
DTC's Participant Terminal System
reversing Settlement Procedures G
and H, respectively. Thereafter,

-29-
<PAGE> 30
the Trustee will deliver the
withdrawal message and take the
related actions described in the
preceding paragraph. If such
failure shall have occurred for any
reason other than default by the
Presenting Agent to perform its
obligations hereunder or under the
Distribution Agreement, the Company
will reimburse the Presenting Agent
on an equitable basis for its loss
of the use of funds during the
period when the funds were credited
to the account of the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon any failure to settle with
respect to a Book-Entry Note, DTC
may take any actions in accordance
with its SDFS operating procedures
then in effect. In the event of a
failure to settle with respect to a
Note that was to have been
represented by a Book-Entry Note
also representing other Notes, the
Trustee will provide, in accordance
with Settlement Procedures D and E,
for the authentication and issuance
of a Book-Entry Note representing
such remaining Notes and will make
appropriate entries in its records.

PART III: PROCEDURES FOR NOTES ISSUED
IN CERTIFICATED FORM

Denominations: The Certificated Notes, other than
Index Notes and Multi-Currency
Notes, will be issued in
denominations of $1,000 and integral
multiples thereof. Index Notes and
Multi-Currency Notes will be issued
in the denominations specified in a
related Multi-Currency and Indexed
Note Prospectus Supplement and
Pricing Supplement.

Interest: Each Certificated Note will bear
interest in accordance with its

-30-
<PAGE> 31

terms. Interest will begin to accrue
on the Original Issue Date of a
Certificated Note for the first
Interest Payment Period and on the
most recent Interest Payment Date to
which interest has been paid for all
subsequent Interest Payment Periods.
Each payment of interest shall
include interest accrued to, but
excluding, the date of such payment.
Interest payments in respect of
Fixed Rate Certificated Notes will
be made semiannually on June 15 and
December 15 of each year and at
Maturity. However, the first
payment of interest on any
Certificated Note issued between a
Regular Record Date and an Interest
Payment Date will be made on the
Interest Payment Date following the
next succeeding Regular Record Date.
The Regular Record Date with respect
to any Interest Payment Date for a
Fixed Rate Certificated Note shall
be the May 31 or November 30
preceding such Interest Payment
Date. Interest at Maturity will be
payable to the person to whom the
principal is payable.

Except as provided in Part I under
"Calculation of Interest", the
Interest Payment Date for a Floating
Rate Certificated Note will be, in
the case of Floating Rate Notes
which reset daily, weekly or
monthly, on the third Wednesday of
each month or on the third Wednesday
of March, June, September and
December of each year as specified
in the applicable Pricing
Supplement; in the case of Floating
Rate Notes which reset quarterly, on
the third Wednesday of March, June,
September and December of each year;
in the case of Floating Rate Notes
which reset semiannually, on the
third Wednesday of the two months of
each year specified in the
applicable Pricing Supplement;

-31-
<PAGE> 32
or, in the case of Eleventh District
Cost of Funds Rate Notes, on the
first Business Day of each month
or the first Business Day of each 
March, June, September or December as
specified in the applicable Pricing
Supplement and in the case of
Floating Rate Notes which reset
annually, on the third Wednesday of
the month specified in the
applicable Pricing Supplement; and,
in each case, at Maturity. The
Regular Record Date with respect to
a Floating Rate Note shall be the
date 15 calendar days (whether or
not a Business Day) preceding an
Interest Payment Date.

Notwithstanding the above, in the 
case of Floating Rate Certificated 
Notes having interest rates which 
reset daily or weekly, interest 
payments shall include accrued 
interest from, and including, the 
date of issue or from, but 
excluding, the last date in respect
of which interest has been accrued 
and paid, as the case may be, 
through, and including, the Regular
Record Date, except that at Maturity
the interest payable will include 
interest accrued to, but excluding,
the date of Maturity. For 
additional special provisions 
relating to Floating Rate
Certificated Notes, see the
Prospectus Supplement.

Payments of Principal 
and Interest: Upon presentment and delivery of the
Certificated Note, the Trustee or the
Company's duly authorized agent will
pay the principal amount of each 
Certificated Note at Maturity and the
final installment of interest in 
immediately available funds. All 
interest payments in U.S. dollars on
a Certificated Note, other than 
interest due at Maturity, will be 
made by check drawn on the Trustee or
the

-32-
<PAGE> 33
Company's duly authorized agent and
mailed by such Trustee or agent to
the person entitled thereto as
provided in the Certificated Note.
However, the Registered Owners (as
hereinafter defined) of ten million
dollars or more in aggregate
principal amount of the same series
of Certificated Notes (whether
having identical or different terms
and provisions) shall be entitled to
receive payments of interest, other
than at Maturity, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds if
appropriate wire transfer
instructions have been received in
writing by the appropriate Trustee
or such agent not less than 16 days
prior to the applicable Interest
Payment Date.

For special provisions relating to
Multi-Currency Notes and Indexed
Notes, see the related
Multi-Currency and Indexed Note
Prospectus Supplement.

The Trustee will provide monthly to
the Company a list of the principal
and interest in each currency to be
paid on Certificated Notes maturing
in the next succeeding month. Such
Trustee or agent will be responsible
for withholding taxes on interest
paid as required by applicable law,
but shall be relieved from any such
responsibility if it acts in good
faith and in reliance upon an
opinion of counsel.

Certificated Notes presented to the
Trustee or the Company's duly
authorized agent at Maturity for
payment will be cancelled by such
Trustee or agent. All cancelled
Certificated Notes held by such
Trustee shall be destroyed, and the
Trustee shall furnish to the Company
a certificate with respect to such
destruction.

Exhibit (10)(b)

INTEREST CALCULATION AGENCY AGREEMENT

INTEREST CALCULATION AGENCY AGREEMENT between BanPonce Financial
Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer"), and CITIBANK, N.A., dated as of
August 1, 1994.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

1. The Issuer proposes to issue and sell Medium-Term Notes, Series B
(the "Notes") from time to time under, and pursuant to, the terms of an
Indenture, dated as of October 1, 1991 (the "Indenture," the terms defined
being used herein as defined therein or in the Notes), among the Issuer,
BanPonce Corporation, a Puerto Rico corporation, and Citibank, N.A., trustee
under the Indenture (acting in such capacity, the "Trustee").

2. The Issuer desires to appoint an agent of the Issuer to calculate
the base rates applicable to those Notes on which interest is to accrue at a
variable or floating rate ("Floating Rate Notes"), determined by references to
LIBOR, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, the Commercial Paper Rate, the
Treasury Rate, the Certificate of Deposit Rate, the CMT Rate, the Prime Rate or
the Federal Funds Rate (collectively, the "Base Rates") as are specified and
described in the Floating Rate Notes, a copy of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit A.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Issuer and Citibank, N.A. hereby agree as follows:
<PAGE> 2
Section 1. Appointment of Calculation Agent. The Issuer hereby
appoints Citibank, N.A. as Calculation Agent (in such capacity, the
"Calculation Agent") of the Issuer with respect to any Floating Rate Notes to
be issued by the Issuer under and pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, and
the Calculation Agent hereby accepts its obligations as set forth in this
Agreement upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.

Section 2. Calculation of Base Rates. Unless otherwise specified to
the Calculation Agent with respect to any particular note, the calculation date
for each applicable Interest Determination Date for any Note shall be the
earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such Interest Determination Date,
or if any such day is not a Business Day (as defined in the Indenture) the next
succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable
Interest Payment Date or Maturity, as the case may be. The Calculation Agent
shall notify the Issuer and the Trustee of such Base Rate on such calculation
date. If at any time the Calculation Agent is not also acting as Trustee under
the Indenture, the Issuer shall, upon the issuance of each Floating Rate Note
having a different Base Rate or different Interest Determination Dates than the
Base Rate or Interest Determination Dates for any prior Floating Rate Note,
notify such Calculation Agent of such Interest

-2-
<PAGE> 3
Determination Dates and Base Rate for such Floating Rate Note.

Section 3. New Base Rates. If the Issuer proposes to issue Floating
Rate Notes whose interest rate will be determined on a basis or formula not
referred to above (a "New Base Rate"), the Issuer shall give a description of
such New Base Rate to the Calculation Agent. The Calculation Agent shall
determine if it is able and willing to calculate the New Base Rate and upon its
agreement in writing to do so the term "Base Rate" shall be deemed to include
the New Base Rate. If the Calculation Agent notifies the Issuer that it is not
able or willing to calculate the New Base Rate, or that it is only willing to
do so on the basis of an increase of its fees not acceptable to the Issuer, the
Calculation Agent shall have no responsibility with respect to such New Base
Rate and the Issuer shall appoint a different calculation agent to determine
the New Base Rate.

Section 4. Fees and Expenses. The Calculation Agent shall be
entitled to such compensation for its services under this Agreement as may be
agreed upon with the Issuer, and the Issuer shall pay such compensation and
shall reimburse the Calculation Agent for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Calculation Agent in
connection with the services rendered by it under this Agreement, including
reasonable legal fees

-3-
<PAGE> 4
and expenses, upon receiving an accounting therefor from the Calculation Agent.

Section 5. Right and Liabilities of Calculation Agent. The
Calculation Agent shall incur no liability for, or in respect of, any action
taken, omitted to be taken or suffered by it in reliance upon any Floating Rate
Note, certificate, affidavit, instruction, notice, request, direction, order,
statement or other paper, document or communication reasonably believed by it
to be genuine. Any order, certificate, affidavit, instruction, notice,
request, direction, statement or other communication from the Issuer made or
given by it and sent, delivered or directed to the Calculation Agent under,
pursuant to or as permitted by any provision of this Agreement shall be
sufficient for purposes of this Agreement if such communication is in writing
and signed by any officer of the Issuer. The Calculation Agent may consult
with counsel satisfactory to it and the opinion of such counsel shall
constitute full and complete authorization and protection of the Calculation
Agent with respect to any action taken, omitted to be taken or suffered by it
hereunder in good faith and in accordance with and in reliance upon the opinion
of such counsel. In acting under this Agreement, the Calculation Agent (in its
capacity as such) does not assume any obligation towards, or any relationship
of agency or trust for or with the holders of the Notes.

-4-
<PAGE> 5
Section 6. Right of Calculation Agent to Own Floating Rate Notes.
The Calculation Agent may act as Trustee under the Indenture and it, its
officers, employees and shareholders may become owners of, or acquire any
interests in, Floating Rate Notes, with the same rights as if the Calculation
Agent were not the Calculation Agent, and may engage in, or have an interest
in, any financial or other transaction with the Issuer as if the Calculation
Agent were not the Calculation Agent.

Section 7. Duties of Calculation Agent. The Calculation Agent shall
be obliged only to perform such duties as are specifically set forth herein and
no other duties or obligations on the part of the Calculation Agent, in its
capacity as such, shall be implied by this Agreement.

Section 8. Termination, Resignation or Removal of Calculation Agent.
The Calculation Agent may at any time terminate this Agreement by giving no
less than 90 days' written notice to the Issuer unless the Issuer consents in
writing to a shorter time. Upon receipt of notice of termination by the
Calculation Agent, the Issuer agrees promptly to appoint a successor
Calculation Agent. The Issuer may terminate this Agreement at any time by
giving written notice to the Calculation Agent and specifying the date when
the termination shall become effective; provided, however, that no termination
by the Calculation Agent or by the Issuer shall become effective prior to the
date of the

-5-
<PAGE> 6
appointment by the Issuer, as provided in Section 9 hereof, of a successor
Calculation Agent and the acceptance of such appointment by such successor
Calculation Agent. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Calculation
Agent shall not have been delivered to the Calculation Agent within 30 days
after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Calculation Agent
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Calculation Agent. Upon termination by either party pursuant to the
provisions of this Section, the Calculation Agent shall be entitled to the
payment of any compensation owed to it by the Issuer hereunder and to the
reimbursement of all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred
or made by the Calculation Agent in connection with the services rendered by it
hereunder, as provided by Section 4 hereof.

Section 9. Appointment of Successor Calculation Agent. Any successor
Calculation Agent appointed by the Issuer or by a court following termination
of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section 8 hereof shall execute
and deliver to the Calculation Agent and to the Issuer an instrument accepting
