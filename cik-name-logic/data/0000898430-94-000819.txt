FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

HOUSE OF FABRICS TO COMPLETE RESTRUCTURING THROUGH CHAPTER 11; SMALLER CHAIN 
TO EMERGE WITH EXPANDED FOCUS ON CRAFTS AND HOME DECORATING

SHERMAN OAKS, CALIF. -- NOVEMBER 3, 1994 -- House of Fabrics, Inc. 
(NYSE:HF) said today that, in order to complete the company's previously 
announced restructuring in a more efficient environment, it has filed to 
reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The filing took place late 
Wednesday afternoon in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of 
California in Los Angeles. Included in the filing were House of Fabrics, Inc. 
and its wholly owned subsidiaries Fabricland, Inc., So-Fro Fabrics, Inc. and 
House of Fabrics of South Carolina, Inc. Metrolina Express, Inc., a subsidiary 
of House of Fabrics of South Carolina, Inc., was also included in the filing.

According to Gary L. Larkins, president and chief executive officer of the 
427-store chain, "For more than a year, the company's operating options and 
liquidity have been severely limited. By utilizing the Chapter 11 process, we 
believe we can achieve an orderly restructuring that will enable us to
capitalize on opportunities resulting from improvements in operations and
merchandising.

"While we would have preferred to complete our restructuring out of court, 
we now believe that it is in the best interests of all the company's 
constituents to complete the restructuring through a court-supervised process 
that fairly recognizes the interests of, among others, our vendors, other 
creditors and shareholders."

Mr. Larkins emphasized that the filing will have no effect on the customers
or employees of House of Fabrics stores.

"Daily operations will continue as usual, store hours will stay the same 
and all aspects of the business will go on as before the filing," he stated. 
"Our sales associates and employees will continue to be paid as if no 
proceeding had been filed."

Mr. Larkins added that the company intends to honor customer commitments 
relative to delivery schedules for merchandise on order, return and exchange 
policies, gift certificates, service agreements and warranties and other 
customer-related aspects of the business. He said that the company would 
continue to accept MasterCard, Discover Card and Visa credit cards.

Mr. Larkins further stated that, "We've already made many of the tough 
decisions that will result in a smaller but stronger chain that is well 
positioned to meet the competitive challenges of the 90s and beyond." He said 
that the company has recently implemented a number of programs aimed at 
eliminating marginal stores, reducing inventories, improving cash flow and 
liquidity and enhancing operations. During the past several months, House of 
Fabrics:

. Announced plans to close approximately 200 stores in an effort to 
eliminate unprofitable or marginal operations and concentrate on 
stronger core locations.

. Remodeled eight superstores based on its successful, new "creative"
store format featuring expanded emphasis on home decorating and
crafts. The new format stores feature floral departments, home
decorating items and expanded craft selections.

It is anticipated that the new format stores will continue to outpace
sales trends for the rest of the chain.

. Enhanced the efficiency of its distribution and general and 
administrative operations.

. Achieved significant improvements in merchandising and promotion 
through expanded emphasis on crafts and home decorating.

Mr. Larkins said that, as a result of the filing, the company expects to 
have the use of its cash flow from its continuing operations. He further stated
that the priority status accorded payment for shipments made during the Chapter 
11 case, and the availability of cash flow should assure the company's vendors 
that they will be paid for the merchandise the company purchases from them going
forward. Additionally, he said, the company is negotiating a commitment for 
debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing which, if approved, would provide 
additional liquidity which the company can use for its seasonal needs.

"We have sufficient resources to fund ongoing operations through the busy 
holiday season. We fully expect our suppliers to work with us during the 
restructuring period as they have with the many other retail companies that have
faced similar situations. While federal law prohibits us from paying for goods 
received before the filing, payment for goods and services received now is
given priority status by the Court.

"We have our work cut out for us, but I am optimistic that, with the 
support of our vendors, the hard work of our employees and the loyalty of our 
customers, we will come through this process a stronger, more competitive 
company than ever before," Mr Larkins said.

announced the appointment to its board of directors of William W. Pennell, a 
former consultant specializing in corporate turnarounds and reorganizations and 
a former trustee for the Chapter 11 reorganization of Paramount Petroleum. Mr.

Fabrics as we move ahead with building a stronger company."
