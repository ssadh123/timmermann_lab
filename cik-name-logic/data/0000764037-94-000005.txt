Item 5. Other Events
As of February 4, 1994 (the "Closing Date"), Encore Computer
Corporation ("Company") and Gould Electronics Inc. ("Gould")
consummated the transaction described below.

As of the Closing Date, Gould (a wholly owned subsidiary of
Japan Energy Corporation) exchanged $100,000,000 of indebtedness
owed to it by the Company for 1,000,000 shares of the
Company's Series E Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series E")
with a liquidation preference of $100,000,000. The Series E is
senior in liquidation priority to all other classes of the
Company's preferred and common stock.

The principal terms of the Series E are:
(i) 6% cumulative annual dividend which the Company can
elect to (i) pay in additional shares of Series E valued at
its liquidation preference until shareholders' equity
exceeds $50,000,000 or (ii) accumulate and pay in cash when
shareholders' equity exceeds $50 million.

(ii) a liquidation preference of $100 per share.

(iii) convertible, at the holder's option, into the
Company's common stock at the liquidation preference divided
by $3.25 per share (subject to potential adjustments for
splits, etc.) only (a) if the shareholder is a United States
citizen or a corporation or other entity beneficially owned
in the majority by United States citizens; or (b) in
connection with an underwritten public offering.

(iv) convertible, at the Company's option in accordance
with the conversion methodology described in (iii) above
if the price of the common stock exceeds $3.90 per share
for twenty consecutive days and (i) a buyer is
contractually committed to purchase for at least $3.90
per share at least 50% of the shares into which all
outstanding Series E would be converted; or (ii) a buyer is
contractually committed to purchase for at
least $3.50 per share at least 75% of the shares into
which all outstanding Series E would be converted.

(v) non-voting, except for the right to approve
actions adversely affecting the Series E.

The conversion of the indebtedness into Series E will reduce the
Company's annual interest expense by approximately $7 million.
However, dividends paid or accumulated to shareholders of the
Series E reduces the net income available to common shareholders
thereby reducing primary earnings per share. No other changes
to the Company's Income Statement are anticipated.

Prior to the transaction, Japan Energy Corporation, the
successor to Nikko Kyodo Co., Ltd., and its wholly owned
subsidiaries including Gould (the "Japan Energy Group")
beneficially owned 62.1% of the Company's outstanding common
stock assuming the full conversion of all outstanding shares of
preferred stock. Upon completion of this transaction, Japan
Energy Group's beneficial ownership on a fully converted
basis increased to 71.1%.

In connection with this transaction, the United States
Defense Investigative Service ("DIS") reviewed the
relationship between the Company, Japan Energy Corporation (a
Japanese corporation) and its wholly owned subsidiaries
(including Gould), under the United States government
requirements relating to foreign ownership, control or
influence and have indicated that they have no objection to the
business relationship.

Since 1989, the principal source of financing for the
Company has been provided by Japan Energy Corporation and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company is dependent on the
continued long term financial support of the Japan Energy
Group. Should the Japan Energy Group withdraw its financial
support at any time prior to the time the Company returns to
profitability by either (i) enforcement of its rights under
the terms of its revolving credit agreement with the Company
in the event of any future default by the Company related to
covenants contained therein, (ii) failing to renew the
revolving credit agreement which expires on April 16, 1994 or
(iii) failing to provide additional credit as needed, the
Company anticipates it will not be able to secure financing from
other sources. In such a case, the Company will suffer a
severe liquidity crisis and it will have difficulties settling
its liabilities in the normal course of business.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits
(c) The Company files herewith the following exhibit: Unaudited
pro forma Consolidated Balance Sheet dated as of December 31,
1993 showing the financial position of the Company and its
subsidiaries after giving effect to the transaction described
in Item 5 hereof.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its
behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
