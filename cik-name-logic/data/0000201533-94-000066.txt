ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

Ludington Pumped Storage Plant

As is discussed in ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS and Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 1993 of CMS Energy Corporation and its wholly-
owned subsidiary, Consumers Power Company ("Consumers"), in September 1986
the Attorney General filed a lawsuit against Consumers and Detroit Edison
seeking $148 million in past damages and $89,000 per day for future
damages for alleged injuries to fishing resources due to the operation of
the jointly owned Ludington Pumped Storage Plant. The Attorney General
filed a second lawsuit in 1987 which sought to have the plant's bottom
lands lease agreement with the State declared void.

On October 5, 1994, an agreement was reached between Consumers, Detroit
Edison, the Attorney General, the DNR and other parties to settle these
lawsuits. The settlement covers the continued operation of the plant with
the use of a fish barrier net through the term of the plant's license,
which expires in the year 2019. Consumers and Detroit Edison have agreed
to pay for certain unavoidable fish loss, to establish a fishery trust
fund, to pay for certain recreational enhancement projects, and to convey
certain lands to the state. Consumers' share of the cost of the
settlement, which is to be recovered from its electric customers, is
spread over a 24-year period consisting of approximately $3 million
annually for the first 10 years and $1.5 million annually thereafter. The
agreement is subject to approval by the MPSC, which must approve the
recovery from its electric customers of all Consumers' costs, and by the
FERC.
