SUMMARIZED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF ITEL CORPORATION

Upon consummation of the Transaction, Itel Corporation ("Itel") will be
engaged in the distribution of wiring system products for the transmission of
power and voice, data and video communications through Anixter. Itel also will
have a 33% investment in ANTEC Corporation ("ANTEC") and a 9% investment in the
common stock of Santa Fe Energy Resources, Inc. The financing operations of
Signal Capital Corporation ("Signal Capital") and various other assets are being
held for sale. The acquired Signal Capital portfolio is being liquidated and no
material amounts of new loans or investments are being made by Signal Capital.

The following information sets forth, for the periods and at the dates
indicated, summarized unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data
for Itel. Unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is
derived from the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information of
Itel reflects (a) the condensed consolidated results of continuing operations as
if the following transactions had occurred on December 31, 1992 and (b) the
condensed consolidated balance sheet as if the sale of the rail car leasing
business ("Rail car leasing") occurred on June 30, 1994.

The transactions impacting pro forma financial information are:

(1) In July 1994, Itel sold substantially all its remaining interest
in its fleet of railcars for approximately $204.5 million.

(2) In May 1994, Itel sold 4.0 million shares of ANTEC common stock
for $82.8 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $48.2 million reflected as
a non-recurring item.

The pro forma condensed consolidated financial information reflects: (1)
recognition of the impact of the sale of Rail car leasing; (2) recognition of
the impact of the sale of ANTEC common stock; and (3) the decrease of net
interest expense resulting from the assumed payment of Itel and subsidiary
senior bank loans with proceeds from the respective sales. The net gain on the
sale of ANTEC common stock is not reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated income statement for the six months ended June 30, 1994 results of
continuing operations.

The pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated financial information is not
necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of continuing operations as
they might have been if the sales had been consummated on the assumed date.

excess cash to repay indebtedness of approximately $260 million at the

car leasing and (2) $83 million from the sale of ANTEC common stock.

4.4 No Violations. None of the execution, delivery or performance
(including the purchase of the Shares and the Acquired Trust Interests by
Purchaser and the redemption of the Shares and the issuance of the Redemption
Note and the SCH Guaranty) of this Agreement or the Related Documents, or the
consummation of the transactions herein or therein contemplated, will conflict
with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan
agreement or other agreement or instrument to which Purchaser or Signal Capital
Holdings is a party or by which Purchaser or Signal Capital Holdings is bound or
to which any of the property or assets of Purchaser or Signal Capital Holdings
is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of
the Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws or other governing document of
Purchaser or Signal Capital Holdings or any statute or any order, rule or
regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over
Purchaser or Signal Capital Holdings or any of their properties. The

4.5 Litigation. (a) There are no legal or governmental proceedings pending
to which Purchaser is a party or of which any property of Purchaser is the
subject which, if determined adversely to Purchaser, would be reasonably likely,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations
of Purchaser; and, to the best of Purchaser's knowledge, no such proceedings are
threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others.

(b) There is no action, suit or proceeding against, or investigation of,
Purchaser pending or, to the best knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, before any
court, administrative agency or other tribunal which (i) asserts the invalidity
of this Agreement or any of the Related Documents, (ii) seeks to prevent the
purchase of the Shares or the Acquired Trust Interests or the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Related Documents,
(iii) could, either individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely
affect the performance by Purchaser of its obligations under, or the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or the Related Documents.

4.6 Investigation. (a) Purchaser has made its own independent decision to
enter this Agreement and the Related Documents to which it is a party following
its own independent examination and investigation and without any reliance on

contained in ARTICLE III of this Agreement. Purchaser acknowledge that it is
familiar with the assets, business, prospects and financial condition of Signal
Capital Holdings, the Trust and the Partnership, has had the opportunity to ask
questions regarding the assets, business, prospects and financial condition of
Signal Capital Holdings, the Trust and the Partnership, and has been furnished
with such information regarding the foregoing as it has requested.

(b) PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND ITEL CONTAINED IN ARTICLE III OF THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER

PARTNERSHIP, AND THAT SELLER IS TRANSFERRING THE SHARES AND THE ACQUIRED TRUST
INTERESTS WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND WITHOUT ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES
WHATSOEVER.

(c) WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, PURCHASER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLER AND ITEL HAVE MADE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
REGARDING ANY MATTER RELEVANT TO THE RECEIPT OR NON-RECEIPT BY THE PARTNERSHIP
OF ANY "ADDITIONAL RENT" UNDER EITHER OF THE LEASES, AND PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES
AND RELEASES ALL CLAIMS, RIGHTS, ACTIONS AND CAUSES OF ACTION, OF ANY KIND OR
NATURE, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, THAT COULD AT ANY
TIME BE BROUGHT AGAINST SELLER OR ITEL RELATING TO THE RECEIPT OR NON-RECEIPT BY
THE PARTNERSHIP OF ANY "ADDITIONAL RENT" UNDER EITHER OF THE LEASES.

4.7 Purchase for Investment; Securities Act. Purchaser is acquiring the
Shares and the Acquired Trust Interests for investment for its own account and
not with a view to the distribution thereof. Purchaser acknowledges that the
Shares and the Acquired Trust Interests are not subject to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act, and that, accordingly, neither
the Shares nor the Acquired Trust Interests, nor any interest in this Agreement,
may be transferred, unless in a transaction exempt from the requirements of the
Securities Act and otherwise permitted by applicable law.

4.8 Experience; Financial Capability. Purchaser has such knowledge and
experience in business and financial matters as to be capable of evaluating the

finder or intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
who might be entitled to a fee or other commission from Seller upon consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.10 No Default. On the Closing Date, after giving effect to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, no event or condition will have
occurred and be continuing which constitutes, or which with the passing of time
or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute, an Event of Default under
any of the Related Documents.

4.11 Balance Sheet; Material Adverse Change. The balance sheet of Purchaser
dated as of June 23, 1994 (together with the notes thereto), true and complete
copies of which have been delivered to Itel and Seller, has been prepared in
accordance with GAAP and fairly presents the financial condition of Purchaser as
of such date. Since the date of such balance sheet, there has not been any
change in the equity capital or long term debt of Purchaser or any material
adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse
change, in or having a material adverse affect on the general affairs,
management, financial position, owners' equity or results of operations of the
Purchaser.

reasonable efforts to obtain the consents described in Schedule 3.13, and the
opinion of counsel required pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Trust Agreement in

Closing Date, Itel proposes to enter into any transaction after which the
consolidated net worth of Itel would be less than $200,000,000, then, prior to
entering any agreement to enter into such a transaction, Itel shall notify
Purchaser in writing thereof (if not previously so notified) and, if requested
by Purchaser, shall arrange alternative means of providing for the obligations
of Itel set forth in this Agreement (which may include, by way of example,
arrangements such as the assumption of such obligations by another party,
insurance, surety bonds or the creation of an escrow), in each case with a
party, in an amount and upon terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser; provided, that any assumption of the obligations of Itel under this
Agreement by any entity having a consolidated net worth of $200,000,000 or more
(an "Eligible Assignee") shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this
Section 5.5.

5.6 Inspection. Each of Itel, Seller and Purchaser agrees to provide the
other upon reasonable notice at reasonable times on or after the Closing Date
with access to its records (to the extent it shall have retained any records in

safeguards to preserve and protect the confidentiality and/or proprietary nature
of any such materials.

14
<PAGE> 15

prior to the Closing, that Seller shall cause such actions to be taken so that
at the Closing Signal Capital Holdings shall have no assets other than (i) a
68.5% Trust Interest, (ii) $75,000 in cash or cash equivalents and (iii)
goodwill and any other asset which cannot be transferred or removed. The actions

or otherwise, from direct or indirect subsidiaries of Signal Capital Holdings to

direct or indirect subsidiaries of Signal Capital Holdings into other such
subsidiaries and the merger of various subsidiaries of the Company into the
Company and the merger of the Company into Signal Capital Holdings.

5.8 Assistance by Purchaser. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser
agrees to take such action (at the sole cost and expense of Itel and Seller) as
Itel or Seller may request to assist Itel or Seller in collecting, enforcing or
otherwise realizing upon any assets, claims or rights of Signal Capital Holdings
or its subsidiaries, other than the 68.5% Trust Interest and the $75,000 in cash
described in clause (ii) of Section 5.7 (the "Retained Assets"), including,
without limitation, rights under the Transaction Documents other than the 68.5%
Trust Interest, arising, accruing or relating to events, conditions or periods
prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller and Itel the
original of any mail or communication, and shall promptly deliver to Seller any
moneys, checks or other instruments of payment, received by Buyer relating to
any of the Retained Assets.

5.9 Actions by Purchaser at the Closing. At the Closing, immediately
following the conveyance to Purchaser and redemption by Signal Capital Holdings
of the Shares and the conveyance to Purchaser of the Acquired Trust Interests,
Purchaser shall take such actions (including, without limitation, the
contribution of cash and/or property to Signal Capital Holdings) as may be
required so that Signal Capital Holdings has the ability to pay any Taxes for
any period beginning on or after the Closing relating to the 68.5% Trust
Interest held by Signal Capital Holdings assuming the exercise of the Purchase
Options under the Leases without consideration of any financings (including
those contemplated by this Agreement) or Tax deductions arising therefrom.

5.10 Actions by Purchaser after the Closing. If Seller should elect
pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(xii) to accept less than complete evidence of the
taking of the actions described in Section 5.9, Purchaser shall complete such
evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of Seller within 6 months of the
Closing.

5.11 Utilization of SPC Investor. As long as the stock of the SPC Investor
owned by the stockholders of the SPC Investor is subject to forfeiture for the
failure to provide services relating to the Trust, Purchaser shall and shall
cause Signal Capital Holdings to furnish to the SPC Investor all information
from the Trust not directly furnished to the SPC Investor and, to the extent
that time permits and the holder of the Trust Interests can take any action in
relation to the business of the Trust, seek the advice of the SPC Investor on
such action. Purchaser shall and shall cause Signal Capital Holdings to cause
any subsequent holder of Trust Interests to enter into an agreement to the
effect of this Section 5.11.

Purchaser contained in this Agreement, the indemnity of Seller and Itel set
forth in Sections 9.2(a)(i) and (ii) and the indemnity of Purchaser contained in
Section 9.2(b)(ii) shall survive the Closing for all claims for which a Notice
of Claim is submitted prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date;
provided, that the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.6 and
the indemnity of Seller and Itel set forth in Sections 9.2(a)(i) and (ii) as it
relates to such representations and warranties shall survive, without limit as
to time, the Closing and the representations and warranties contained in Section
4.3 and the indemnification of Purchaser set forth in Section 9.2(b)(ii) as it
relates to such representations and warranties shall survive the Closing,
without limitation as to time, for all claims for which a Notice of Claim is
submitted prior to the date on which all amounts due under the Note are paid in
full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnities of Seller and Itel set
forth in Section 9.2(a)(iii) and the indemnities of Purchaser set forth in
Section 9.2(b)(i) shall survive, without limit as to time, the Closing Date and
termination of this Agreement.

9.2 Indemnification; Limitations of Liability. (a) If the Closing occurs,
Itel and the Seller will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser, Signal Capital Holdings and their respective agents, successors,
assigns, transferees, officers, directors and employees, and each person, if
any, who "controls" any of them within the meaning of the Securities Act (each a
"Purchaser Indemnitee"), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or
liabilities ("Losses") incurred or suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee, to the
extent arising out of or based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Business Description or the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
(ii) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty, covenant or agreement made or
to be performed by Itel or the Seller

17
<PAGE> 18

pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Document, or (iii) any Liability; and
will reimburse each Purchaser Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending such
action or claim as such expenses are incurred. Subject to Section 4.6(c) and,
with respect to Purchaser's assignees and transferees, Section 9.6, each
Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely on the information provided in
the Business Description and the representations and warranties provided by Itel
and Seller herein, without conducting any independent investigation of the
matters covered thereby, and any independent investigation conducted by a
Purchaser Indemnitee shall not affect or mitigate Itel's or Seller's
indemnification obligation hereunder.

(b) If the Closing occurs, the Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless
Itel, the Seller, and their respective agents, successors, assigns, officers,
directors and employees, and each person, if any, who "controls" any of them
within the meaning of the Securities Act (each an "Itel Indemnitee"), from and
against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Itel Indemnitee, to the
extent arising out of or based upon (i) any Assumed Liability; or (ii) any
misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Document, and
will reimburse each Itel Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending such action or
claim as such expenses are incurred. Each Itel Indemnitee shall be entitled to
rely on the representations and warranties provided by Purchaser herein, without
conducting any independent investigation of the matters covered thereby, and any
independent investigation conducted by an Itel Indemnitee shall not affect or
mitigate Purchaser's indemnification obligation hereunder.

(c) Promptly upon learning thereof, any party entitled to indemnification
hereunder (the "Indemnitee") shall notify the party liable for such
indemnification (the "Indemnitor") in writing of any Loss which the Indemnitee
has determined has given or could give rise to a claim for indemnification under
Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(b), as the case may be. Such notice (a "Notice of
Claim") shall specify in reasonable detail, so far as the Indemnitee is able to
do so, the nature and any particulars of any such claim giving rise to a right
of indemnification (including the amount thereof, so far as the Indemnitee is
able to do so). The delay or failure of the Indemnitee to give such notice shall
not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability it may have hereunder to the
Indemnitee except to the extent the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced thereby.

(d) With respect to any claim, suit, action or proceeding (a "Claim") by a
third party or any judgment in favor of a third party that could give rise to
indemnification under this Section 9.2, the Indemnitor shall have the right (but
not the obligation) to defend (in the name of the Indemnitee, if necessary), at
its own expense with attorneys of its own selection (which attorneys shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee), any such Claim, and the Indemnitee
shall not settle any such Claim without the Indemnitor's written consent;
provided, that if any Indemnitor is not defending such Claim within thirty (30)
days after having been afforded the opportunity to so in accordance with this
Section, then the Indemnitee shall have the right to reasonably defend the Claim
in such manner as it may deem appropriate at the cost and expense of the
Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee therefor
in accordance with this Section 9.2, and the Indemnitor's consent to any
proposed settlement shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the
assumption by the Indemnitor of the defense of any Claim as provided in this
paragraph, the Indemnitee shall be permitted to participate in the defense of
such Claim and to employ counsel at its own expense (subject to the right of the
Indemnitor to control and direct such defense), in which case the Indemnitor
shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal expenses of such other
counsel or any other expenses, in each case incurred by the Indemnitee, in
connection with the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of
investigation undertaken at the request of the Indemnitor or counsel to the
Indemnitor in connection with the defense of the claim. The Indemnitee shall
make available (or ensure that any relevant affiliate makes available) to the
Indemnitor or its representatives access to all personnel, records and other
materials reasonably required by them for their use in connection with any Claim
and shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in connection with all such Claims as
reasonably required by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor does not assume the
defense of any Claim, then any failure of the Indemnitee to defend shall not
relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder; provided that the
Indemnitee shall have given the Indemnitor notice of its intention not to defend
and afford the Indemnitor the opportunity to assume the defense within such
period as may be reasonable (taking into consideration when determining whether
such period is reasonable,

18
<PAGE> 19

the time when notice was given to the Indemnitee by the Indemnitor that such
Indemnitor did not intend to assume the defense thereof).

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no Indemnitor
shall settle any Claim without the consent of the Indemnitees if such settlement
would (i) involve an admission by the Indemnitee of criminal liability or (ii)
otherwise materially adversely affect the Indemnitee or its subsidiaries.

(f) The Seller and the Purchaser agree that any payment made under this
Section 9.2 shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the purchase price and
treated accordingly.

(g) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9.2 is unavailable
to or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnitee in respect of any Losses with
respect to which such indemnification is applicable on its face, then each
Indemnitor, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnitee, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a result of such Losses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of and the relative
benefits received by the parties hereto.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Seller nor Itel will have any liability with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in Article III of this Agreement other
than those in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.6(a) until the aggregate amount of
Losses for which it would be liable (but for this clause) exceeds $2,500,000,
and then only to the extent that such Losses exceed such amount.

(i) Nothing in this Article IX shall limit the ability of either party to
seek the enforcement of, or damages for the failure of the other party to
perform under any provisions of, Section 2.1 or Article V of this Agreement.

(j) It is the intent of the parties that each Purchaser Indemnitee and Itel
Indemnitee, other than the parties hereto, shall be considered to be third party
beneficiaries of the indemnification provided by this Section 9.2.

9.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party
hereto will bear, or cause to be borne, without liability to any other party,
its costs and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether or not consummated), including (without limitation) attorneys',
consultants', brokers', accountants', finders' and financial advisors' fees and
expenses and any other similar charges; provided, that Seller shall bear any
sales, use, documentary, value added or transfer tax or assessment payable in
connection with the transfer of the Shares and the Acquired Trust Interests to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

9.4 Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented, but only in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. No
waiver of any provision hereof shall be effective unless in writing and signed
by the party giving such waiver. No waiver with respect to any matter or event
shall extend to other matters or events, whether or not similar to the matter or
event waived.

9.5 Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given
hereunder by a party hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
given, (a) when received if given in person or by courier or a courier service,

transmission or (c) three business days after being deposited in the mail,

ITEL HAS AGREEMENT TO SELL REMAINING RAILCAR INTERESTS

CHICAGO, June 24, 1994 -- Itel Corporation (NYSE: ITL) announced today that
an agreement has been reached to sell substantially all its remaining interests
in its fleet of railcars to a newly formed corporation owned by private
investors.

Itel's interests are in a trust which holds the rights to the fleet's
residual value on the expiration of the 12-year leases executed in 1992. The
agreement is subject to contingencies, including the completion of the
purchaser's arrangements for bank loans for the cash portion of the purchase
price. There can be no assurance that these contingencies will be met.

The transaction will involve the direct sale of a 30% interest in the Trust
and the sale of stock of a subsidiary holding a 68 1/2% interest in the trust
(after the other assets of the subsidiary have been removed), and the redemption
by that subsidiary of the remainder of its stock. The transaction will trigger a
taxable gain to Itel of approximately $500 million, of which approximately 80%
will be covered by Itel's existing NOLs and tax credits, which will essentially
be exhausted by this transaction.

Upon the closing, which is scheduled for the third quarter of this year,
Itel will receive from the purchaser and the acquired company cash of $35
million and notes totaling $169.5 million. The cash portion of the purchase
price is being borrowed by the purchaser and the acquired company from a bank
pursuant to short-term loans. There can be no assurance that these loans can be
refinanced or otherwise paid when they become due. The bank will have a sole
lien on the 30% trust interest being acquired by the purchaser and a prorata
lien with Itel on the stock of the acquired company and its 68 1/2% trust
interest.

The notes to be received by Itel will not be due until the end of 1998, and
payment of principal and interest can be deferred until that time at the
election of the obligors. These notes will be backed by the same resources as
the bank loans, subject to the prior or prorata claims of the bank. There can be
no assurance that these notes will not be accelerated by defaults on the bank
loans or otherwise.

The timing of the recognition of the net gain for financial reporting
purposes from this transaction, which is estimated to exceed $200 million, is
yet to be determined.
