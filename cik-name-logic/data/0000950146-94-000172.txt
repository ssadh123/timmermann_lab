Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

On September 16, 1994, Deloitte & Touche LLP was dismissed as the
Registrant's independent certified public accountants and Ernst & Young LLP
was appointed in replacement thereof to serve as the Registrant's independent
certified public accountants, effective as of September 16, 1994, for the
balance of the Registrant's fiscal year ending May 31, 1995. In connection
with the audits of the two most recent fiscal years of the Registrant and all
subsequent interim periods preceding such dismissal, there was no disagreement
between the Registrant and Deloitte & Touche LLP on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte
& Touche LLP, would have caused them to make reference thereto in their report
on the financial statements for such periods. The reports of Deloitte & Touche
LLP for such periods did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of
opinion nor were they qualified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting
principles. The decision to dismiss Deloitte & Touche LLP and to appoint Ernst
& Young LLP as the Registrant's independent certified public accountants was
unanimously approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Registrant.
