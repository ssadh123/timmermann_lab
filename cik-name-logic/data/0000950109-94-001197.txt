News Release

SUPERVALU REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
AT COMPANY'S ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING

MINNEAPOLIS -- Citing substantial progress in corporate retail performance 
and integration and consolidation of distribution operations, SUPERVALU INC. 
today at its annual stockholders meeting reported sales of $5.0 billion for 
its first quarter ended June 18, 1994. This represents a 2.4 percent increase 
over the $4.9 billion first quarter sales of one year ago. Net earnings were 
$51 million or $.71 per share for the quarter, even with last year's results.

"These are very reasonable results, considering the first quarter 
consolidation and acquisition costs and other investments for our future," said
Michael W. Wright, SUPERVALU chairman, president and CEO. External factors 
affecting company performance include food price deflation, higher Federal tax
rates, and somewhat weak results form ShopKo. Food inflation for the quarter 
as measured by the company was negative 0.8 percent.

"We should begin to show improved results in the latter half of the year," 
Wright added, "after the costs of integration and consolidation, customer 
changes and the sales impact of cigarette price cuts by manufacturers are 
completely cycled out from the previous fiscal year."

"We continue our aggressive wholesale consolidation efforts, evidenced by the 
recently announced closing of the company's Northboro, MA distribution 
facility acquired with Sweet Life Foods in March of this year," Wright stated.
The wholesale grocery volume will be transferred to the Andover, MA facility, 
he said. Wright added that facilities consolidation, which began last year, 
offers excellent potential to increase operating efficiency and buying 
advantage, build volume and leverage fixed expenses.

Food distribution sales were $4.5 billion, up 2.0 percent over last year. "The
first quarter acquisition of Sweet Life Foods contributed to sales growth, 
helping to offset negative food deflation, a tough retail environment and the 
usual sales impact when consolidating facilities," Wright said. Food 
distribution operating earnings decreased 3.5 percent principally resulting 
from consolidations, acquisitions completed in the quarter and reduced LIFO 
income. Wright said that, "Although these investments to improve our buying 
leverage, efficiencies of scale and operating productivity have short-term 
costs, they are imperative to build our competitive edge for future growth."

Retail food sales were $1.1 billion, up 6.9 percent over last year. "We are 
very pleased with our corporate retail progress. It further validates our 
strategy to grow the retail segment of our business," Wright said. Same-store 
corporate retail sales showed healthy improvement by remaining even overall, 
reversing a negative trend from previous quarters. Retail food operations 
profits more than doubled, with Cub Foods, Shop 'n Save and the Scott's 
divisions producing excellent results, despite increasing competition in 
certain markets. At quarter-end, SUPERVALU operated 295 retail food stores 
principally under the Cub, Save-A-Lot, Shop 'n Save, Scott's Foods, Laneco, 
Hornbachers, MAX CLUB and Twin Valu names.

Earlier the company announced fiscal 1995 budget plans to add up to nine 
corporate Cub Foods stores and seven franchised stores in the current fiscal 
year. Save-A-Lot plans to add a total of 20 corporate-owned and 85 licensed 
stores this year.

In addition, the Save-A-Lot division completed in May the acquisition of 30 
Texas T stores located in the Dallas-Ft. Worth market. These stores are being 
converted to the Save-A-Lot limited-assortment format over the next several 
months. The acquired Texas T distribution center will also help reduce 
distribution costs for existing customers in the Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas
markets.

At the annual meeting four directors were re-elected and one new director was 
elected to the 12-member SUPERVALU board. Re-elected to three-year board terms
were Vernon H. Heath, retired chairman of the board of Rosemount, Inc., 
Minneapolis; William A. Hodder, chairman, president, CEO and a director of
Donaldson Company, Inc., Minneapolis; Harriet Perlmutter, businesswoman; and
Winston R. Wallin, chairman of the board and a director of Medtronic, Inc.,
Minneapolis. Newly elected for a two-year term is R.L. (Dick) Knowlton,
chairman of the board of Austin, MN-based Hormel Foods since 1984. Knowlton
was also president and CEO of that company from 1984 to 1992. He serves on the
boards of Northwestern National Life Insurance Co. and First Bank System and
is a member of the board of trustees for the Mayo Foundation.
