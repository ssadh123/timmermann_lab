NATIONAL INTERGROUP OFFERS TO PURCHASE ALL OF
FOXMEYER CORPORATION HELD BY THE PUBLIC

DALLAS, TEXAS, March 1,1994--National Intergroup, Inc. (NYSE:NII) 
and FoxMeyer Corporation (NYSE:FOX) today announced that National
Intergroup has proposed to the board of directors of FoxMeyer, its
80.5 percent owned subsidiary, a business combination in which a 
National Intergroup subsidiary would merge with and into FoxMeyer 
Corporation.

In the proposed merger, the holders of each share of FoxMeyer
Corporation (other than National Intergroup) would receive $14.75
principal amount of a new issue of 8.25 percent Senior Notes due 
2004 of FoxMeyer Holding Corporation. FoxMeyer Holding will be 
newly created for the purpose of holding a majority of FoxMeyer
Corporation's outstanding shares. Based on the 5,510,000 common 
shares of FoxMeyer Corporation not already owned by National 
Intergroup, FoxMeyer Holding would issue an aggregate of 
$81,273,000 principal amount of the 8.25 percent senior notes.

On February 28, 1994, the closing price for FoxMeyer's common
shares on the New York Stock Exchange was $13.50 per share.
National Intergroup urged that a Special Committee of FoxMeyer
Corporation directors not affiliated with National Intergroup be
formed to consider the proposal. FoxMeyer's board of directors 
responded by forming a Special Committee chaired by Daniel J. 
Callahan, III, which undertook to engage an investment banking 
firm and counsel to assist the Special Committee in evaluating 
the proposal.

The proposal is conditioned upon the execution of a definitive
merger agreement mutually satisfactory to National Intergroup and
FoxMeyer Corporation, and is further conditioned upon the effective-
ness of the registration of the 8.25 percent senior notes to be 
issued in the merger and the receipt of all bank, regulatory 
and shareholder approvals necessary to accomplish this transaction.

FoxMeyer Corporation is the nation's fourth largest pharma-
ceutical distributor, with projected sales of $5.1 billion for the 
year ended March 31, 1994. Along with its ownership in FoxMeyer 
Corporation, National Intergroup owns 67.3 percent of Ben Franklin
Retail Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:BFRS), which owns 10 franchised craft 
superstores and which is a franchisor of more than 950 variety and 
craft stores in 47 states.
