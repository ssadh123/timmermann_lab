INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Terra Industries Inc.
Sioux City, Iowa

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Asgrow Florida Company
(the "Company") (a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Upjohn Company) as of
December 31, 1993, and the related statements of income and retained earnings
and of cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 1993, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company is involved in
certain environmental cleanup matters. The ultimate outcome of these matters
cannot presently be determined. Accordingly, no provision for loss, if any,
that may result from these matters has been made in the accompanying financial
statements.

ASGROW FLORIDA COMPANY
(A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE UPJOHN COMPANY)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Asgrow Florida Company (the "Company"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Asgrow Seed Company who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Upjohn
Company (the "Parent" or "Upjohn"), distributes agricultural products
(seed, agricultural chemicals, and specialty products) to citrus, vegetable,
and ornamental crop producers in Florida and southern Georgia. Its
operations consist of a central office and warehouse located in Plant City,
Florida, and twelve distribution centers located throughout Florida and
one in southern Georgia.

Certain of the Company's liabilities (for example, income tax liabilities and
accrued pension cost) are determined by the Parent, see Note 5. The Company
records such expenses through intercompany balances.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared from the
separate records maintained by the Company and may not necessarily be
indicative of the conditions that would have existed or the results of
operations if the Company had not been operated as a subsidiary of the
Parent.

Inventories

Inventories on a separate company basis are carried at the lower of cost or
market, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. The
Parent adjusts the Company's inventories to the last-in, first-out basis,
upon consolidation, for income tax and SEC reporting purposes.

Property, Plant and Equipment

All expenditures for additions, replacements and major improvements are
charged to the property accounts at cost. Depreciation is provided
principally on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of
the related assets as determined by the Parent with useful lives ranging
from 3 to 41 years. Normal repair and maintenance expenditures are charged
to operations.

Income Taxes

As described at Note 5, the Company is included in the consolidated income
tax returns of Upjohn. Income taxes are determined using the applicable
statutory federal income tax rates on the Company's reported pretax
financial statement income.

5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Upjohn has provided a variety of services to the Company. Additionally, the
Company entered into several transactions in the normal course of business
with Upjohn and Asgrow Seed. The principal transactions between the
Company and its Parent and affiliates are summarized below:

(1) The Company has participated in Upjohn's centralized
cash management system. In addition to funding
working capital and operational requirements, Upjohn
has also funded capital expenditures. Intercompany
transactions do not bear interest and have been
effected through changes in the intercompany
receivable account.

(2) The Company has sold products to and purchased products from
various affiliates. These transactions are settled through the
intercompany accounts.

(3) The Company has been allocated various general and administrative
costs from Upjohn, (e.g., legal, employee benefits, and insurance).
The method used to allocate these costs considers, among other
things, the number of employees and time spent by certain
employees on special functions.

(4) Income taxes are determined using the applicable statutory federal
income tax rates on the Company's reported pretax financial 
statement income. The corresponding liability is netted in the 
intercompany receivable account.

Amounts payable to Upjohn related to income taxes as of 
December 31, 1993 consist of the following:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Federal $ 2,546,000
State 378,000
-----------
Total $ 2,924,000
-----------
-----------
</TABLE> 

(5) The Company participates in Upjohn's life, disability and medical 
insurance plans for its employees. Medical insurance coverage is 
provided for retirees and family members of retirees who have 
fulfilled minimum service requirements. Company employees are also
eligible to participate in Upjohn's defined benefit pension and 
tax-deferred savings plans. The Company is apportioned a share of
Upjohn's expense in funding and contributing to these plans based 
on the employees participating.

</TABLE>

6. CONTINGENCIES

The Company is involved in negotiations with the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection ("FDEP") regarding the appropriate nature and
scope of a Preliminary Corrective Action Plan and a Corrective Action
Plan (collectively referred to as "CAP") deemed desirable for the parcels
of the Company's real property located in Plant City, Florida (hereafter
referred to as the "Plant City Real Property"). The purpose of the CAP and
related activity is to define environmental conditions within the scope of
the CAP and identify action, if any, which may be appropriate for protection
of human health or the environment. Upon completion of the CAP, certain
monitoring, risk assessment or remedial action at the Plant City Real
Property may be required. The Company is unable, at present, to determine
the ultimate liability relating to these matters.

The Company is also involved in various other legal actions and claims
arising from the normal course of business. Although it is not possible to
predict with any certainty the outcome of such matters, it is the opinion of
management that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company.

7. SALE OF THE COMPANY

Effective with the close of business on December 31, 1993, Terra Industries
Inc. ("Terra") purchased the majority of the Company's net assets, through
a new company, Terra Asgrow Florida. Under the purchase agreement with
Upjohn, Terra purchased certain of the Company's real and fixed property,
inventories, accounts receivable, and other assets and assumed certain of
the Company's liabilities, as well as open purchase orders. The Company is
responsible for approximately $289,000 accrued severance benefits payable
to all employees who were not hired by the successor owner, as well as all
taxes and similar expenses incurred prior to January 1, 1994.

F-9
<PAGE> 12
In connection with the sale of the Company, Upjohn has indemnified Terra
against losses and costs incurred by the Company through December 31, 1993,
including the environmental matters discussed in Note 6. Specifically,
under the agreement, Upjohn has agreed to indemnify Terra against all costs
attributable to hazardous substances discovered in or on the real property
purchased within 7 1/2 years after the closing date to the extent that the
cause of the contamination can be clearly attributed to the Company.
However, if within 5 years after the closing date, hazardous substances are
discovered and the identity of the causing party is not clearly
determinable, the costs attributable to the contamination shall be
allocated between Terra and the Company using a defined allocation schedule
based upon the year of discovery.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENT

On December 31, 1993, Terra International, Inc. ("Terra International")
purchased net assets, including real property, machinery, vehicles, accounts
receivable and inventory, of certain operations of Asgrow Florida Company, Inc.
("Asgrow Florida"), a distributor of fertilizer, chemicals and seed to the
vegetable, citrus and ornamental markets mostly in Florida, for approximately
$39 million. Asgrow Florida is a wholly owned subsidiary of Asgrow Seed
Company, which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Upjohn Company
("Upjohn"). Terra International, a wholly owned subsidiary of Terra Industries
Inc. ("the Corporation"), is engaged in the business of producing, marketing,
selling and distributing fertilizers, seeds, herbicides, pesticides and other
agricultural products through outlets in the 48 contiguous United States and
Canada.

Terra International will assimilate the twelve retail locations formerly owned
by Asgrow Florida into its existing network of Florida sales locations, and
will initially operate its Florida business under the name Terra Asgrow
Florida.

Terra International paid $31 million at closing with the remainder to be
determined based on the value of net assets acquired at the closing date.

Effective March 31, 1993, Terra International, through its wholly owned
subsidiary Terra International (Canada) Inc. ("Terra Canada"), acquired the
rights to an anhydrous ammonia production facility and related upgrading
facilities located near Sarnia, Ontario (the "Courtright Plant"), purchased
working capital associated with the Courtright Plant, and purchased interests
in 32 farm service centers operated under the trademark "Agromart" in Ontario,
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Terra Canada's pro forma statement of income
for the 1993 first quarter is based on amounts and adjustments presented in the
Corporation's Form 8-K filed in connection with that acquisition, as amended
on June 9, 1993.

The accompanying pro forma statement of income for the year ended December 31,
1993 presents the pro forma combined results of Terra Industries Inc. assuming
the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 1993. The pro forma statement of
income includes adjustments to revenues, costs, expenses and income taxes
necessary to reflect the purchase price of net assets acquired. An exchange
rate of $0.80 U.S. to $1.00 Canadian is assumed for the first quarter 1993 pro
forma Terra Canada results of operations. A pro forma statement of financial
position is not presented since the net assets of each acquired business were
included in the Corporation's December 31, 1993 consolidated statement of
financial position.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA STATEMENT OF INCOME

(1) Certain operations of Asgrow Florida, principally a retail location in
southern Georgia and the seed distribution business to vegetable markets
in North Carolina, were not acquired. Revenues, costs of sales, selling
expenses and depreciation are reduced $4.3 million, $2.1 million, $0.5
million and $85,000, respectively to reflect operations not acquired.

(2) Asgrow Florida had purchased proprietary seed from Asgrow Seed Company
("Asgrow Seed") at Asgrow Seed's cost. Terra Asgrow Florida will
purchase seed from Asgrow Seed at prices that represent wholesale market
value. The increase in seed purchase costs is estimated to increase pro
forma cost of sales by $1.9 million.

(3) Asgrow Florida received charges from Upjohn totaling $1.8 million for
allocations of research and development costs and general administrative
services. These expenses are not expected to continue after December 31,
1993.

(4) The acquisition price included approximately $13 million of unassigned
cost which will be charged against operations $867,000 per year for 15
years.

(5) Interest income is reduced to reflect use of available cash to fund the
purchase from Asgrow Florida.

(6) Income taxes are adjusted to reflect statutory rates for the acquired
operations of Asgrow Florida.
