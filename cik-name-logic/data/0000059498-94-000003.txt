Item 5. Other Events.

On June 8, 1994, LIN Broadcasting Corporation (the
"Company") announced that it intends to distribute the common
stock of its indirect subsidiary, LIN Television Corporation
("LIN Television"), to the Company's stockholders on a tax-free
basis pursuant to Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Distribution"). The Company also
announced that the Company and LIN Television entered into an
Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with
Cook Inlet Communications, Inc., an Alaska corporation, and Cook
Inlet Communications Corp., a Delaware corporation ("CICC"),
pursuant to which LIN Television would acquire substantially all
the assets and assume certain liabilities of WTNH-TV, Hartford-
New Haven, Connecticut ("WTNH-TV") from CICC in exchange for
$120,170,000 in cash, subject to adjustment as set forth in the
Asset Purchase Agreement, and approximately 11.5% of the common
stock of LIN Television (the "Acquisition" and, together with the
Distribution, the "Transaction").

As a result of the Transaction, approximately 42.1% of LIN
Television's shares will be publicly traded; approximately 11.5%
will be owned by CICC; and approximately 46.4% will be owned by
McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("McCaw"). LIN Television intends to apply for listing of its
shares on the Nasdaq National Market. The closing of the
Transaction is expected to occur by year-end. The record date
for the Distribution will be announced at a later date.

Following the Transaction, LIN Television will own WTNH-TV,
an American Broadcasting Companies ("ABC") affiliate, in addition
to KXAS-TV, a National Broadcasting Company ("NBC") affiliate in
Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas; WISH-TV, a Columbia Broadcasting System
("CBS") affiliate in Indianapolis, Indiana; WAVY-TV, an NBC
affiliate in Hampton Roads-Norfolk, Virginia; KXAN-TV, an NBC
affiliate in Austin, Texas; WAND-TV, an ABC affiliate in Decatur-
Champaign-Springfield-Danville, Illinois; and WANE-TV, a CBS
affiliate in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The Company will retain
ownership of WOOD-TV, an NBC affiliate in Grand Rapids-Kalamazoo-
Battle Creek, Michigan, in addition to its cellular business.

The Transaction is subject to approval by the Federal
Communications Commission and to obtaining a private letter
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that
neither the Company nor any of its stockholders will be required
to recognize gain or loss, or include any amount in income, as a

result of the Distribution. The Transaction is also subject to
other conditions, including the filing by both the Company and
CICC of notifications, and the expiration of the applicable
waiting period, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

LIN Television also expects to enter into a Television
Private Market Value Guarantee with McCaw (the "Television
Guarantee") at the time of the Distribution, providing that three
of LIN Television's directors shall be independent directors
initially designated by the Company's independent directors. 
Pursuant to the Television Guarantee, McCaw would agree to
certain continuing protections for the stockholders of LIN
Television (other than McCaw and its affiliates) and would be
required either to commence a specified process for acquiring all
publicly held shares of LIN Television on January 1, 1998, or put
the entire company up for sale under the direction of the
independent directors of LIN Television. The Asset Purchase
Agreement also provides that LIN Television will enter into a
Registration Rights Agreement with CICC (the "Registration Rights
Agreement") and a Stockholders Agreement with McCaw and CICC (the
"Stockholders Agreement"). Pursuant to the Stockholders
Agreement, McCaw and CICC will agree to vote their shares of
Common Stock and take all action necessary to cause LIN
Television's board of directors to consist of ten members, six of
whom shall be designated by McCaw, one of whom shall be
designated by CICC and three of whom shall be independent
directors under the Television Guarantee. LIN Television also
expects to refinance its existing credit facility to fund the
Acquisition and provide working capital for its operations. 

The Company also entered into a first amendment dated
June 7, 1994 (the "First Amendment") to that certain Private
Market Value Guarantee, dated as of December 11, 1989, between
the Company and McCaw. The First Amendment provides that the
Transaction may be undertaken if the Company's independent
directors determine in their good-faith judgment that both the
Transaction and the consideration to be paid in the Acquisition
are fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company's
stockholders (other than McCaw and its affiliates). The
independent directors have made such determination and the LIN
Board, including the independent directors, has approved the
Acquisition and approved in principle the Distribution.

the Registration Rights Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement and
the First Amendment, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 2.1,
2.2, 2.3 and 99.1, respectively, and are incorporated herein by

Separately, on May 31, 1994, the Company completed the
acquisition of an additional 5.2% indirect interest in the New
York City cellular licensee for approximately $145 million cash,
bringing the Company's total interests in the New York licensee
to 98.3%. On May 25, 1994, the Company completed the acquisition
of 100% of the Connecticut-1 RSA near the New York market for
approximately $30 million cash. The Company utilized additional
borrowings under its existing cellular bank credit facility to
fund these acquisitions.

under Revenue Procedure 86-41, 1986-2 C.B. 716, as amended
through the date hereof (the "Revenue Procedure"), to the
effect that neither Parent nor any of its stockholders will be
required to recognize gain or loss, or include any amount in
income, as a result of the Distribution, pursuant to
Section 355 of the Code and any other applicable sections of
the Code.

Parent will not withdraw from the IRS its request for the

information or action not required under the Revenue Procedure
or (b) the IRS indicates that it will not issue the Letter
Ruling, in either of which events Parent may, in its sole
discretion, withdraw from the IRS its request for the Letter
Ruling.

Acquiror and Parent shall keep Station informed on an
ongoing basis with respect to the status of Parent's efforts
to obtain the Letter Ruling. In the event that (a) Parent
withdraws from the IRS its request for the Letter Ruling or
(b) after December 31, 1994, Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue (or
any successor counsel to Parent) indicates to Parent that it
is not likely that the IRS will issue the Letter Ruling,
Acquiror and Parent shall immediately, and in all such events
within three business days, provide Station with written
notice of same (the "Letter Ruling Notice").

6.2.4 Distribution

Following receipt of the Letter Ruling and immediately
prior to the Closing, Parent shall effect the Distribution;

Ruling, the FCC Approval provided in Section 7.1.3 and
expiration of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

6.2.5 Registration of Acquiror Common Stock

Acquiror shall prepare, at its expense, the Form S-4
registering the shares of Acquiror Common Stock for sale by
Acquiror to Station pursuant to the Securities Act, shall file
the Form S-4 with the SEC in accordance with the Securities
Act and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the Form S-4
to be declared effective prior to the Closing. Acquiror shall

Exchange Act, the Securities Act or state securities or other
blue sky laws in connection with the issuance of the shares of
Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement.

to (y) have assets sufficient to meet the Parent Threshold 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 62

Amount or (z) obtain a third-party guarantee or letter of
credit in an amount equal to the Parent Threshold Amount. 
Parent shall also cause any Person (other than McCaw) that
alone or with its Affiliates owns 50% or more of the
outstanding voting shares of Parent or its successors to
assume McCaw's obligations under the Solvency Letter Agreement
and, for so long as the Solvency Letter Agreement shall remain
outstanding, to (y) have assets with a Net Market Value
sufficient to meet the Parent Threshold Amount or (z) obtain a
third-party guarantee or letter of credit in an amount equal
to the Parent Threshold Amount. Neither this Section 6.2.9
nor the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed in
any way to release (i) Parent from its obligations under the
terms of this Agreement or any of the Related Agreements or
(ii) McCaw from its obligations under the Solvency Letter
Agreement.

6.3 Further Agreements

Parent, Acquiror, Stockholder and Station agree to

Stockholder's counsel and accountants in connection with any
steps required to be taken as part of the obligations of
Stockholder and Station under this Agreement. None of Parent,

representation, warranty or agreement made by it in this
Agreement untrue.

6.3.4 Other Cooperation After Closing Date

Stockholder and Station will cooperate with Acquiror, at
Acquiror's reasonable request, to effect an orderly and prompt
transfer of title, possession and control of the Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities from Station to Acquiror on and after

preserve or improve the rights of Acquiror in and to the
Assets transferred pursuant to Section 2.1.5.

Parent and Acquiror will (a) cooperate with Stockholder
and Station after the date hereof in completing or filing any

records and files only in the ordinary course of business and
in accordance with applicable law.

6.3.5 Post-Closing Adjustment

(a) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but
in no event later than 45 days thereafter, Station shall 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 64

prepare and deliver to Acquiror the Station Closing Balance
Sheet. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in
no event later than 45 days thereafter, Acquiror shall prepare
and deliver to Station the Acquiror Closing Balance Sheet and
a calculation of the Actual Cash Consideration. Acquiror
shall have an opportunity to review and comment upon the
Station Closing Balance Sheet, and Station shall have an
opportunity to review and comment upon the Acquiror Closing
Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Actual Cash
Consideration. 

(b) The Station Closing Balance Sheet and the Acquiror
Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles on a basis consistent
(including account classifications) with that used in the
preparation of the Station Financial Statements and the
Acquiror Financial Statements, respectively, and shall present
fairly the financial position of Station and Acquiror,
respectively, as of the date indicated. Station will deliver
a certificate confirming the representation set forth in
Section 3.6 with respect to the Station Closing Balance Sheet
and Acquiror will deliver a certificate confirming the
representation set forth in Section 4.6 with respect to the
Acquiror Closing Balance Sheet.

(c) If the Actual Cash Consideration exceeds the
Estimated Cash Consideration, Acquiror shall pay the amount of
such difference to Station plus Interest from the Closing Date
to, but excluding, the date such amount is paid in full. If
the Estimated Cash Consideration exceeds the Actual Cash
Consideration, Station shall pay the amount of such difference
to Acquiror plus Interest from the Closing Date to, but
excluding, the date such amount is paid in full. If payment
is required to be made pursuant to this Section 6.3.5, the
settlement shall take place by delivery of immediately
available funds to the party entitled to receive such funds
promptly after calculation of the Actual Cash Consideration.

6.3.6 Accounts Receivable

Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect all the Accounts Receivable of Station within 180 days
after the Closing Date. Except for accounts with respect to
which a bona fide payment dispute exists before the Closing,
all payments received by Acquiror from any entity that
constitutes an obligor with respect to any of the accounts
included within the Accounts Receivable of Station as of the
Closing Date shall be credited first against the amounts owed
by such obligor included within the Accounts Receivable of
Station in order of the date of invoice until all such amounts
are paid in full. Acquiror shall not compromise, settle or 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 65

adjust any such accounts without the specific written
permission of Station. Acquiror shall make available to
Station such information as may be necessary or desirable to
permit Station to monitor Acquiror's efforts to collect the
Accounts Receivable of Station. With respect to any accounts
not paid in full within 90 days after the Closing Date,
Station shall have the right, but not the obligation, to take
control from Acquiror of the effort to collect such accounts. 
Any and all payments received by Station with respect to such
Accounts Receivable of Station as a result of any such
collection efforts by Station shall be forwarded within five
days of receipt thereof to Acquiror, provided that Station
shall be entitled to deduct therefrom reasonable costs of
collection.

6.3.7 Film Payables

Station agrees to use reasonable efforts to pay its film
contract obligations no more than 60 days after the
contractual due date of each such film contract obligation.

6.3.8 Employee Matters

(a) Schedule 6.3.8 contains a true and complete list of
all persons employed by Station, their current position with
Station, their current employment status and their current
accrued paid leave, whether for vacation, sickness or other
circumstance. Station shall provide to Acquiror at the
Closing a true and complete copy of each personnel file
maintained by Station for each of its employees.

(b) Acquiror agrees to employ at the Closing each of the
employees of Station who are made available to Acquiror by
Station. Such persons shall become employees of Acquiror and
shall initially have positions (including status, offices,
titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties and
responsibilities comparable to those held and exercised by
such employee with Station on the Closing Date; provided,
however, that Acquiror shall in no event be restricted from
making such employment decisions after the Closing as it deems
appropriate. Acquiror further agrees initially to provide
each such employee with compensation and a package of benefit
plans, taken as a whole, comparable to those in effect on the
Closing Date; provided, however, that Acquiror shall in no
event be restricted from making such compensation and benefit
decisions after the Closing as it deems appropriate. Acquiror
agrees to give such employees full credit for the paid time
off and sick pay earned or accrued by them during, and to
which they are entitled as a result of, their employment by
Station, either by allowing such employees such paid time off
and sick pay as to which such employees would have been 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 66

entitled as of the Closing Date under the policies of Station
if such employees had remained employees of Station or, upon
termination of employment, by making full payment to such
employees of the paid time off that such employees would have
received had they taken such paid time off.

(c) Acquiror agrees to provide the employees of Station
with health care benefits consistent with those provided by
Acquiror to its existing employees. Acquiror further agrees
to permit employees of Station participating in Station's
health care plans to participate in Acquiror's health care
plans; provided, however, that such health care benefits shall
be immediately available to such employees as of the Closing
Date, and such employees shall become as of the Closing Date
participants thereunder, without regard to any applicable
waiting period or any limitation with respect to preexisting
conditions. Acquiror agrees to act as a successor employer
for purposes of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), so that Station's employees
will not, as a result, be deemed to have had a termination of
employment for purposes of COBRA and that any COBRA notices or
coverage required to be given or made available to any such
employee shall be given or made by Acquiror, not Station.

(d) Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that as of the date
and time the Closing is effective, Acquiror is considered for
purposes of the WARN Act the employer of the employees of
Station and that Acquiror (and not Station) shall thereupon be
responsible for complying with the WARN Act with respect to
such employees and that prior to such time none of such
employees shall be, nor shall they be deemed to be, terminated
for purposes of the WARN Act.

(e) Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and hold Station
harmless from and against any and all losses, claims and
expenses of any kind whatsoever, including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees and costs of investigation,
resulting from or arising out of (i) the discharge or other
termination of employment by Acquiror from and after the
Closing Date of any employee of Station, including, without
limitation, claims for health care coverage or benefits and
all compliance obligations (including, without limitation, the
obligation to give notice or pay money) of Station or Acquiror
under the WARN Act, and (ii) the Station Union Contracts from
and after the Closing.

(f) Acquiror agrees to assume sponsorship of the Profit
Sharing Plan as of the Closing; provided, however, that
Acquiror shall have the right to amend or terminate the Profit
Sharing Plan at any time and in any manner it deems
appropriate or desirable, including, but not by way of 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 67

limitation, merging the Profit Sharing Plan into a plan
sponsored or maintained by Acquiror. Station agrees,
represents and covenants that it will complete the Form 5500
for the 1993 plan year and file such form with the IRS not
later than July 31, 1994, and will provide Acquiror with a
copy of such filing and such other evidence as the Acquiror
may require to establish that the filing has occurred within
10 days after said filing occurs. Stockholder and Station
agree, represent and covenant that they and their Affiliates
will provide any assistance and any information that Acquiror
deems necessary to obtain a determination from the IRS that
the Profit Sharing Plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code and that the related trust is exempt from federal
income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code.

6.3.9 Financial Information

Station has provided Acquiror and Parent with certain
internal budget documents, pacing reports and similar items
(collectively, the "Station Financial Information") regarding
the prospective performance of Station. The Station Financial
Information was prepared in the ordinary course of business
for Station's internal purposes, consists only of management's
estimate of Station's future performance in the categories
reflected in the Station Financial Information, and does not
constitute any representation or agreement that Station's
actual performance will match the Station Financial
Information.

Acquiror has provided Station and Stockholder with
certain internal budget documents, pacing reports, projections
and similar items (collectively, the "Acquiror Financial
Information") regarding the prospective performance of
Acquiror, as well as projected balance sheet items of Acquiror
as of September 30, 1994 ("Balance Sheet Items"). The
Acquiror Financial Information was prepared in the ordinary
course of business for Acquiror's internal purposes, consists
only of management's estimate of Acquiror's future performance
in the categories reflected in the Acquiror Financial
Information, and does not constitute any representation or
agreement that Acquiror's actual performance will match the
Acquiror Financial Information. The Balance Sheet Items were
prepared in good faith, consistent with generally accepted
accounting principles and with Acquiror's regularly prepared
financial statements, and constitute management's best
estimate of such items as of September 30, 1994, but do not
constitute any representation or agreement that Acquiror's
actual September 30, 1994 balance sheet will match the Balance
Sheet Items.

<PAGE> 68

6.3.10 Prorations; Trade Agreements

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

(a) In calculating the amount of the Station Accounts
Payable, all items of expense (including prepaid expenses)
arising from the business or operations of Station, including,
without limitation, rents, property and payroll taxes (other
than taxes payable in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which shall be
paid in accordance with the terms of Section 2.5),
assessments, business and license fees (other than the Station
Film Payables Outstanding), insurance premiums, salaries and
wages (other than as excluded from the definition of Station
Accounts Payable), and charges for heat, power, water,
utilities and other current operating expenses, shall be
prorated as of the Closing Date on the basis of a 365-day
year, so as to effectuate the parties' intent that (i) only
items of expense arising from or relating to periods prior to
the Closing are included in the Station Accounts Payable and
(ii) the amount of any expenses prepaid by Station
attributable to post-Closing Date periods is credited against
the expenses included in the Station Accounts Payable; and

(b) To the extent that the aggregate value (as
determined by reference to Station's rate card as in effect at
the Closing) by which Station's post-Closing Date obligations
under trade, barter or similar arrangements for the sale of
advertising time (with the exception of film contracts or
program barter agreements) is greater than the aggregate fair
market value of the goods, services or other items to be
received by Acquiror as Station's successor on or after the
Closing Date, the amount of such difference shall be (i) added
to the amount of the Station Accounts Payable, if positive, or
(ii) added to the amount of the Station Closing Accounts
Receivable, if negative.

6.3.11 Oxford Property

At the Closing, Station shall convey by quit claim deed
without warranty all of its right, title and interest (if any)
to the Oxford property (more particularly described in the
Chicago Title Insurance Company Commitment for Title
Insurance, Title Number 944201332, effective May 26, 1994) to
Acquiror, including, without limitation, by assigning to
Acquiror any rights Station may have to such property pursuant
to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated July 30, 1985, between
Capital Cities Communications, Inc. and Cook Inlet
Communications, L.P. Station will negotiate with Capital
Cities Communications, Inc. and otherwise use its reasonable
efforts to attempt to provide Acquiror with good and 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 69

marketable title to such property evidenced by a warranty deed
relating to such property. In connection with the foregoing,
Station shall not be obligated to pay any amount or undertake
any obligation to Capital Cities Communications, Inc. or its
successors or Affiliates.

10.3 Indemnification and Survival of Warranties

10.3.1 Generally

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 10.3.5, Parent and Acquiror, jointly and severally,
agree to indemnify and hold harmless Stockholder and Station,
their successors and permitted assigns, and the officers,
directors, Affiliates, employees, controlling Persons and
agents of the foregoing and to hold each such party harmless
against and in respect of any and all losses, damages,
penalties, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
and accountants' fees (the "Seller Indemnified Damages"),
incurred by any such party by reason of any of the following: 
(i) a breach of any of the representations or warranties made
by Parent or Acquiror in this Agreement, (ii) Acquiror's
failure to satisfy the Assumed Liabilities, (iii) a breach of
undertakings by Parent or Acquiror in any other document,
agreement or amendment relating to or executed in connection
with this Agreement or the Related Agreements, or in any
Officer's Certificate or other certificate delivered to
Stockholder at or in connection with the Closing, (iv) the
nonperformance (whether partial or total) of any covenant or
agreement made in this Agreement or the Related Agreements by
Parent or Acquiror, or (v) liability or alleged liability to
unaffiliated third parties under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, state securities laws or related common law
claims because of any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Acquiror
Disclosure Document, including any preliminary prospectus or
final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or
supplements thereto, the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
in connection therewith any other violation or alleged
violation by Acquiror of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 76

thereunder or any related common law claim; provided, however,
that Acquiror and Parent shall not be liable in any such case
referred to in this subparagraph (v) for any such Seller
Indemnified Damages to the extent that they are not permitted
to be paid under law (in which event the Indemnitees shall be
entitled to contribution as to Seller Indemnified Damages in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of the Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnitees) or that
they arise out of or are based upon any of the foregoing that
occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished by Stockholder or Station expressly for
use in connection with such Acquiror Disclosure Document. 

(b) In addition to the rights afforded by
Section 10.3.1(a) and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 10.3.5, Parent agrees to pay to Station and its
successors and permitted assigns the amount of any and all
losses, damages, penalties, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees, incurred by
Acquiror by reason of (i) the existence of any condition or
fact, or the happening of any event, that constitutes a breach
of any of the representations or warranties made by Parent or
Acquiror in this Agreement and (ii) all federal and state
Taxes imposed on the operations or property of Acquiror or any
of Acquiror's subsidiaries for all periods or portions of
periods up to and including the Closing Date, which are not
otherwise accrued for on the Acquiror Closing Balance Sheet
(either (i) or (ii), an "Acquiror Loss"); provided, however,
that the payment to be made to any Indemnitee (as defined
below) with respect to an Acquiror Loss shall be equal to the
product of (y) such payee's percentage ownership interest in
the Acquiror Common Stock as of the date that Acquiror first
learned of the circumstance that resulted in such Acquiror
Loss (counting for purposes of determining such ownership
interest only those shares of Acquiror Common Stock included
as part of the Share Consideration) multiplied by (z) the
amount of the Acquiror Loss (such product being the "Deemed
Loss"). The parties hereto hereby agree and acknowledge that
the foregoing agreement regarding the calculation of an
Indemnitee's claim for damages under this Section 10.3.1(b)
with respect to a Deemed Loss is reasonable and appropriate,
given that it may be impracticable or extremely difficult to
establish such Indemnitee's actual damages. Nothing in
Section 10.3.1(a) or (b) shall be construed to limit any
claims Indemnitees under this section may have against the
Indemnifying Parties under state or federal securities laws,
provided that amounts payable to any Indemnitee as a Deemed
Loss and any other amounts payable to such Indemnitee under
other potential causes of action, including, without
limitation, pursuant to Section 10.3.1(a), arising out of the 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 77

same facts and circumstances shall be offset against each
other.

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 10.3.5, Stockholder and Station, jointly and
severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless Parent and
Acquiror, their successors and permitted assigns, and the
officers, directors, Affiliates, employees, controlling
Persons and agents of the foregoing and to hold each such
party harmless against and in respect of any and all losses,
damages, penalties, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' and accountants' fees (the "Buyer Indemnified
Damages"), incurred by any such party by reason of any of the
following: (i) a breach of any of the representations or
warranties made by Stockholder or Station in this Agreement,
(ii) Station's failure to satisfy the Excluded Liabilities,
(iii) a breach of undertakings by Stockholder or Station in
any other document, agreement or amendment relating to or
executed in connection with this Agreement or the Related
Agreements, or in any Officer's Certificate or other
certificate delivered to Acquiror at or in connection with the
Closing, (iv) the nonperformance (whether partial or total) of
any covenant or agreement made in this Agreement or the
Related Agreements by Stockholder or Station, or (v) liability
or alleged liability to unaffiliated third parties under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state securities laws or
related common law claims because of any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Acquiror Disclosure Document, including any preliminary
prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any
amendments or supplements thereto, the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, or in connection therewith any other violation or
alleged violation by Acquiror of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or
regulation promulgated thereunder or any related common law
claim because of reliance by Acquiror or Parent upon and in
conformity with written information furnished by Stockholder
or Station expressly for use in connection with the Acquiror
Disclosure Documents. To the extent such Buyer Indemnified
Damages are not permitted to be paid under law, the
Indemnitees shall be entitled to contribution as to Buyer
Indemnified Damages in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Parties and the
Indemnitees.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any
claims Indemnitees under this section may have against the
Indemnifying Parties under state or federal securities laws.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 78

(d) For purposes of the indemnifications made in this
Section 10.3, all representations and warranties shall be
deemed to have been made as of and on the Closing Date, except
to the extent that such representations and warranties are
made as of a specified date, in which case such
representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been
made as of such specified date.

10.3.2 Notice

In the event of any matter that may give rise to the
right of Parent, Acquiror, Stockholder or Station, their
successors or permitted assigns, or the officers, directors,
Affiliates, employees, controlling Persons or agents of the
foregoing to be indemnified under this Section 10.3 (the
"Indemnitee") with respect to claims made by third parties, if
any Indemnitee is threatened with any claim, or any claim is
presented to, or any action or proceeding is commenced
against, such Indemnitee that may give rise to the right of
indemnification hereunder, the Indemnitee shall promptly
notify the party or parties bearing the indemnification
obligation (the "Indemnifying Party") thereof in writing. 

The failure to deliver written notice to the Indemnifying
Party within a reasonable time to the extent such delay is
prejudicial shall relieve such Indemnifying Party of liability
to the Indemnitee under this Section 10.3 to the extent of the
monetary impact of such prejudice, but the omission so to
deliver written notice to the Indemnifying Party will not
relieve it of any liability that it may have to any Indemnitee
otherwise.

10.3.3 Procedure for Third-Party Claims

With respect to claims made or actions or proceedings
commenced by third parties, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to participate in the defense of such claim, action
or proceeding and, except as to such third party claims,
actions or proceedings seeking damages in excess of the
remaining limitations set forth in Section 10.3.5, and except
as to third party claims, actions or proceedings seeking, in
whole or in part, injunctive or other equitable relief against
Indemnitee, to the extent the Indemnifying Party so desires,
jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly notified,
to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually
satisfactory to such parties and the Indemnitee. The
Indemnifying Party shall assume the expense of the
Indemnitee's attorneys' fees unless the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnitee agree upon mutually satisfactory counsel to
assume the defense, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall
be obligated to pay only the fees and expenses of such 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 79

mutually satisfactory counsel. In the event the Indemnifying
Party undertakes to compromise or defend any such liability,
the Indemnifying Party shall so notify the Indemnitee promptly
in writing of its intention to do so, and the Indemnitee shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the
compromising of or the defending against any such liability or
claim except that the Indemnifying Party may not seek to
compromise or settle any liability which exceeds the remaining
limitations on indemnification set forth in Section 10.3.5 or
any claim, action or proceeding which involves injunctive or
other equitable relief against the Indemnitee without the
express written approval of the Indemnitee. Such approval may
be given or withheld by Indemnitee in its sole discretion. 
Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, providing
the Indemnifying Party reasonable access to the Indemnitee's
business records, research, documents and employees as they
relate to the defense of any indemnified claim. In response
to a bona fide settlement offer, the Indemnifying Party may
settle the monetary portion of an indemnifiable matter that it
has duly elected to contest to the extent such settlement does
not exceed the remaining limitations set forth in
Section 10.3.5 and does not involve a matter in which
injunctive or other equitable relief is sought but such
matters shall only be settled with the consent of the
Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
In the event the Indemnitee unreasonably declines to consent
to the monetary settlement described in the preceding
sentence, then the Indemnitee shall have no right to
indemnification beyond, and the Indemnifying Party shall have
no obligation to pay damages or attorneys' fees hereunder in
excess of, the amount of the proposed settlement.

10.3.4 Survival

All representations and warranties made by Parent,
Acquiror, Stockholder and Station shall survive the Closing to
the following extent:

(a) the representations and warranties made by
Stockholder and Station in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 and by Parent
and Acquiror in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3(a) shall survive
indefinitely;

(b) all other representations and warranties shall
survive for a period of three years; and

(c) except as to claims under Sections 10.3.1(a)(v) and
10.3.1(c)(v), no party shall be entitled to indemnification 
under this Section 10.3 unless such claim for indemnification
is asserted in writing to the party from whom indemnification
is sought within three years after the Closing Date.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 80

10.3.5 Certain Limitations

(a) No claim for indemnification for any breach of any
representation or warranty under Section 10.3.1(a) or for any
Deemed Loss under Section 10.3.1(b) shall be made by any party
until the aggregate amount of any Seller Indemnified Damages
and Deemed Losses equals or exceeds $2,775,000, at which time
the Indemnitees shall have the right to indemnification for
all Seller Indemnified Damages and Deemed Losses, including
the first $2,775,000 of such Seller Indemnified Damages and
Deemed Losses up to an aggregate maximum indemnification
payment of $15 million pursuant to Section 10.3.1(a) for 
breaches of any representations or warranties and for Deemed
Losses under Section 10.3.1(b). The terms of this Section
10.3.5(a) shall not apply to a Deemed Loss relating to federal
and state Taxes under Section 10.3.1(b)(ii).

(b) No claim for indemnification for any breach of any
representation or warranty shall be made under
Section 10.3.1(c) or 10.4.1 by any party until the aggregate
amount of any Buyer Indemnified Damages and claims pursuant to
Section 10.4.1 equals or exceeds $925,000, at which time the
Indemnitees shall have the right to indemnification for all
Buyer Indemnified Damages and claims pursuant to
Section 10.4.1, including the first $925,000 of such Buyer
Indemnified Damages and claims pursuant to Section 10.4.1. 
Stockholder and Station shall be liable for an aggregate
maximum payment of $15 million pursuant to Section 10.3.1(c) 
for breaches of any representations or warranties and Section
10.4.1.

10.3.6 Effectiveness

The provisions of this Section 10.3 shall have no force
or effect prior to consummation of the Closing.

10.4 Tax Indemnification and Tax Matters

10.4.1 Stockholder and Station Indemnification

Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10.3.5,
Stockholder and Station, jointly and severally, agree to
indemnify and hold harmless Acquiror and its successors,
permitted assigns, officers, directors, employees and agents
for all Taxes (a) imposed on Stockholder's and Station's
Affiliated Group for any taxable year or (b) imposed on
Station or its successors, or for which Station or its
successors may otherwise be liable for any period or portion
of a period up to and including the Closing Date.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 81

10.4.2 Additional Stockholder and Station
Indemnification

Stockholder and Station, jointly and severally, also
agree to indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its successors
(the "Parent Tax Indemnitees") for their proportionate share
of the Taxes imposed upon Parent as a result of the
Distribution not qualifying for nonrecognition of gain (or no
inclusion of income) treatment under Section 355 of the Code,
but only to the extent the Distribution's failure to so
qualify is finally determined, in judicial proceedings to
which Stockholder and Station are parties, to have been
proximately caused, in whole or in part, by a breach of a
Section 355 Representation by Stockholder or Station. 
Stockholder and Station's proportionate share of such Taxes
shall be determined by a comparison between (i) the extent to
which their breach of a Section 355 Representation proximately
caused the Distribution to not qualify for nonrecognition of
gain (or no inclusion of income) treatment under Section 355
of the Code and (ii) the extent to which the actions of any
other person or entity not an Affiliate of Stockholder or
Station proximately caused the Distribution not to qualify for
nonrecognition of gain (or no inclusion of income) treatment
under Section 355 of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
unless Stockholder's and Station's proportionate share of
responsibility equals or exceeds 25%, Stockholder and Station
shall have no responsibility to indemnify under this
Section 10.4.2 and no liability to any person or entity based
upon the breach of such representation. For purposes hereof,
only the following shall constitute a Section 355
Representation: the representations made by Stockholder or
Station in Exhibit C to this Agreement. Stockholder and
Station agree and acknowledge that the Section 355
Representations are being made directly to Parent and Acquiror
and that Parent and Acquiror intend to rely upon the Section
355 Representations. Stockholder and Station shall be liable
for no more than an aggregate maximum of $35 million for
breaches of Section 355 representations.

10.4.3 Additional Parent Indemnification

Parent agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
Stockholder, Station, and each of their successors, permitted
assigns, officers, directors, employees, and agents (the
"Station Tax Indemnitees") from and against any and all
claims, causes of action, losses, damages, costs, and expenses
(including attorney's fees and costs of investigation) of any
nature whatsoever arising out of or resulting from the
Distribution not qualifying for nonrecognition of gain (or no
inclusion of income) treatment under Section 355 of the Code,
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required by the 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 82

terms hereof to indemnify Stockholder or Station with respect
to any amount required to be paid by Stockholder or Station to
the Parent Tax Indemnitees pursuant to the terms of
Section 10.4.2.

10.4.4 Separate Obligations

The indemnification obligations set forth in
Sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.3 are separate and independent. 
Accordingly, Parent's obligation to indemnify the Station Tax
Indemnitees set forth in Section 10.4.3 shall not be
diminished or in any way affected by the pendency of any claim
against Stockholder or Station pursuant to the terms of
Section 10.4.2, provided, however, that in the event a final
determination is obtained in judicial proceedings to which
Stockholder and Station are parties holding that Stockholder
and Station are obligated to indemnify the Parent Tax
Indemnitees pursuant to the terms of Section 10.4.2, then the
amount of any such indemnification obligation may be offset
following such determination against any amounts due to the
Station Tax Indemnitees pursuant to the terms of
Section 10.4.3. The above is not intended to delay the
obligation of Stockholder and/or Station to pay any
indemnification in accordance with Section 10.4.2 after a
final determination is obtained in judicial proceedings.

10.4.5 Procedure as to Judicial Proceedings 
Relating to Section 10.4.2 Indemnification

For the purpose of seeking a final determination in a
judicial proceeding to which Stockholder and Station are
parties as to Stockholder and/or Station's responsibility for
indemnification under Section 10.4.2, if deemed necessary by
Parent Tax Indemnitees, Stockholder and Station consent and
submit to jurisdiction over them in the courts (state or
federal) of the State of Washington. The requirements in
Sections 10.4.2, 10.4.3, and 10.4.4 that both Stockholder and
Station be parties to such a proceeding shall not apply if
either no longer exists at the time such a judicial
determination is sought in which event only the then existing
entity, if any, need be made a party to the judicial
proceeding.

10.4.6 Limitation

(a) Stockholder and Station shall not be entitled to
indemnification for a 10.4.3 Claim (as defined below) under
Section 10.4.3 unless such 10.4.3 Claim is pending within
seven years and one month after the Trigger Date (as defined
below). Any claim pursuant to the indemnification provisions
of Section 10.4.3 hereof or any written indication from the 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 83

IRS of its intention to challenge the Distribution's
qualification for nonrecognition of gain (or no inclusion of
income) treatment under Section 355 of the Code shall be
considered claims (each, a "10.4.3 Claim"). The date on which
Acquiror files its federal income tax return with the Internal
Revenue Service for the year in which the Distribution is
completed shall be the trigger date (the "Trigger Date").

(b) Parent shall not be entitled to indemnification for
a 10.4.2 Claim (as defined below) under Section 10.4.2 unless
such 10.4.2 Claim is pending within three years after the
Trigger Date. Any claim pursuant to the indemnification
provisions of Section 10.4.2 hereof or any written indication
from the IRS of its intention to challenge the Distribution's
qualification for nonrecognition of gain (or no inclusion of
income) treatment under Section 355 of the Code shall be
considered claims (each, a "10.4.2 Claim").

10.4.7 Assistance and Cooperation

After the Closing Date, each of Stockholder, Station, 
Parent and Acquiror shall:

(a) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to
assist) the other parties in preparing any Tax Returns or
reports that any such other party is responsible for preparing
and filing in accordance with this Section 10.4;

(b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns;

(c) make available to the other parties and to any
taxing authority as reasonably requested all information,
records and documents relating to Taxes of Station or Taxes of
Parent as a result of the Distribution; and

(d) furnish the other parties with copies of all
correspondence received from any taxing authority in
connection with any Tax audit or information request relating
to Taxes that the other parties may be required to indemnify
under Section 10.4.1 or 10.4.2.

10.4.8 Parent Indemnification of Acquiror

Parent agrees to indemnify Acquiror for all Tax liability
for which Acquiror is or may be liable solely as a result of
being a member of Parent's Affilitated Group (and not as a
result of its own operations).

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 84

10.5 Waivers

Any terms, covenants, representations, warranties or
agreements of any party hereto may be waived at any time by an
instrument in writing executed by the party for whose benefit
such terms exist. The failure of any party at any time or
times to require performance of any provision hereof shall not
in any manner affect its right at a later time to enforce the
same. No waiver by any party of any condition or breach of
any terms, covenants, representations, warranties or
agreements contained in this Agreement shall be effective
unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or more instances
shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any
other condition or any breach of any other terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or agreements.

10.6 Counterparts

This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.

10.7 Headings

The headings preceding the text of Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not
be deemed parts hereof.

10.8 Applicable Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of
Washington, as applied to contracts executed and to be fully
performed in such state by citizens of such state. 

10.9 Parties in Interest

All the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
against the respective successors and permitted assigns of the
parties hereto, whether herein so expressed or not, but this
Agreement shall not be assigned by any party hereto in whole
or in part without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto. Nothing in Section 6.3.8 shall be construed
to give to any employee of Station any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under this Agreement.

Registrable Securities. The Shares (as defined below);
provided, however, that those Shares as to which the following
apply shall cease to be Registrable Securities: (a) a
registration statement with respect to the sale of such

registering the sale of such securities by the Company to
Station) shall have become effective under the 1933 Act and such
Registrable Securities shall have been disposed of under such
registration statement; (b) such Registrable Securities shall
have been sold pursuant to Rule 144 or 145(d) or any successor
rule or provision promulgated under the 1933 Act; or (c) such
Registrable Securities shall have ceased to be outstanding.

Stock.

2. Request for Registration

2.1 Request by Station

Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.2, upon
written request of the holder or holders of an aggregate of 20%
or more of the Registrable Securities then outstanding that the
Company effect the registration of all or part of the Registrable
Securities held by such holder or holders, the Company will
promptly give written notice of such requested 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 3

registration to all holders of Registrable Securities and
thereupon will promptly exercise all reasonable efforts to effect
the registration under the 1933 Act of:

(a) the Registrable Securities that the Company has
been so requested to register by such holder or holders and

(b) all other Registrable Securities that the Company
has been requested to register by the holders of Registrable
Securities by written request delivered to the Company within
15 days after the giving of such written notice by the Company.

Each such registration shall be on Form S-1, or on Form S-3
(if available for such offering), as determined by the Company,
permitting registration of such Registrable Securities for resale
by such holders in the manner or manners designated by them
(including, without limitation, one or more underwritten
offerings).

The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to keep such
registration effective for a period of 30 days from the date on
which the registration is declared effective (subject to
extension pursuant to the next paragraph of this Section 2.1) or
for such shorter period that will terminate when all Registrable
Securities covered by such registration have been sold pursuant
to such registration or withdrawn from sale, unless such failure
to become or remain effective is the result of an action or
failure to act by any holder of Registrable Securities to be
covered by such registration.

A registration will not be deemed to have been effected
unless it has become effective; provided, that if after it has
become effective the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant
to such registration is interfered with by any stop order or
other governmental agency, such registration will be extended for
the period of any such suspension or, if required, a new
registration statement shall be filed and diligently prosecuted,
so that the holders shall have had Registrable Securities
included in an effective registration until they have been sold.

If any of the Registrable Securities covered by a
registration pursuant to this Section 2.1 are to be sold in an
underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment
bankers and manager or managers that will manage the offering
will be selected by the holders of a majority of such Registrable
Securities included in such offering, provided that such
investment banker or manager shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Company.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4

2.2 Limitations on Registration Obligation

The Company's obligations under Section 2.1 shall be subject
to the following limitations:

(a) the Company shall not be required to effect a
registration pursuant to Section 2.1 unless the requests from
such holder or holders for such registration, which have not been
withdrawn or reduced, cover Registrable Securities at least equal
to an aggregate offering of $2,000,000;

(b) if the Company shall furnish to such holder or
holders a certificate signed by the President or Vice President
of the Company stating that the Board of Directors reasonably
believes that, during such period, the requested registration
would have a material adverse effect on, or interfere in any
material respect with, any proposal or plan by the Company to
engage in any private or public financing or any material pending
corporate development or transaction, including, without
limitation, a material acquisition of assets, any tender offer or
any merger, consolidation or other similar transaction material
to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Company
shall have the right to defer the filing or effectiveness of the
registration statement for a period of not more than 120 days in
any one calendar year after receipt of the request of such holder
or holders under Section 2.1; provided, however, that no deferral
of the registration pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) shall relieve
the Company of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement by
virtue of Section 2.2(c);

(c) the Company shall not be required to effect any
registration pursuant to Section 2.1 if the written request
therefor is not received by the Company within seven years from
the date of this Agreement;

(d) the Company shall not be obligated to effect more
than two registrations pursuant to Section 2.1; and

(e) if (i) the registration pursuant to Section 2.1
involves a firm commitment underwritten offering and (ii) the
managing underwriters of such offering shall advise such holders
in writing that, in their judgment, the total amount of
securities proposed to be included in such offering is
sufficiently large to materially and adversely affect the success
of the offering, then the number of shares of Registrable
Securities that are proposed to be registered by each holder who
requests registration pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be reduced
pro rata in proportion to the reduction in the total number of
shares of Registrable Securities as to which registration has
been requested. To the extent Registrable Securities requested
to be registered are excluded from the offering, then the holders
of such Registrable Securities shall 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

have the right to one additional registration hereunder with
respect to such Registrable Securities, provided that the failure
of such Registrable Securities to be registered is through no
fault of such holder, and provided that such an additional
registration is available on only one occasion.

2.3 Inclusion of the Company's Securities in
Registration

The Company, on its own behalf or on behalf of its security
holders, shall have the right to include any of the Company's
securities in any registration initiated by a holder or holders
of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2.1 (to the extent
permitted by the rules applicable to use of Form S-1 or other
appropriate form); provided, however, that if (i) the
registration pursuant to Section 2.1 involves a firm commitment
underwritten offering and (ii) the managing underwriters of such
underwritten offering shall advise the Company in writing that,
in their judgment, the distribution of all or a specified portion
of the securities to be registered on behalf of the Company or
its security holders pursuant to this Section 2.3 concurrently
with the Registrable Securities being distributed by such
underwriters will materially and adversely affect the
distribution of such Registrable Securities by such underwriters,
then the Company will exclude all or such specified portion of
such securities (other than the Registrable Securities) to be
registered on behalf of the Company or its security holders from
such underwritten offering and will select, in its sole
discretion, the securities to be so excluded from such offering.

2.4 Withdrawal of Registrable Securities by 
Holders

The holders of Registrable Securities may withdraw their
Shares from registration, but unless the withdrawal is due to a
material adverse change in the condition, business or prospects
of the Company which was not, and upon reasonable investigation
of public information by such holders could not have been, known
at the time of the request, the Company will not be obligated to
effect another registration pursuant to Section 2.1. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any request for a registration
that is withdrawn by the holders prior to the effectiveness of
the registration statement shall not be counted as one of the two
registrations referenced in Section 2.2(d) if the holders
reimburse the Company for all expenses incurred by the Company in
preparing such registration statement.

2.5 Piggyback Registration

2.5.1 If the Company shall, at any time prior
to the seventh anniversary of this Agreement, propose to 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6

register any shares of Common Stock under the 1933 Act, whether
or not for sale for its own account, on a registration form and
in a manner that would permit registration of Registrable
Securities for sale to the public under the 1933 Act, it will
each such time give prompt written notice to all holders of
Registrable Securities of its intention to do so, describing such
securities and specifying the form and manner and the other
relevant facts involved in such proposed registration and, upon
the written request of any such holder of Registrable Securities
delivered to the Company within 15 days after such notice shall
have been given to such holder and subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 2.5.2, the Company will use all reasonable
efforts to effect the registration under the 1933 Act, as
expeditiously as is reasonably possible, of all Registrable
Securities that the Company has been so requested to register by
the holders of Registrable Securities, to the extent required to
permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended method
thereof specified in such notice from the Company as aforesaid)
of the Registrable Securities so to be registered. The Company
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the managing
underwriter or underwriters of a proposed firm commitment
underwriting to permit the holders of Registrable Securities
requesting to be included in such offering to include such
securities in such offering on the same terms and conditions as
any similar security of the Company included therein.

2.5.2 The Company's obligations under
Section 2.5.1 shall be subject to the following limitations:

(a) if, at any time after giving such
written notice of its intention to register any of such
securities and prior to the effective date of the registration
statement filed in connection with such registration, the Company
shall determine for any reason not to register such securities,
the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to each holder of Registrable Securities that has
requested to register Registrable Securities and thereupon the
Company shall be relieved of its obligation to register any
Registrable Securities in connection with such registration;

(b) if (i) the registration so proposed by
the Company involves a firm commitment underwritten offering and
(ii) the managing underwriters of such underwritten offering
shall advise the Company in writing that, in their judgment, the
total amount of securities which they or the Company and any
other persons or entities intended to include in such offering is
sufficiently large to materially and adversely affect the success
of the distribution of such securities by such underwriters, then
the Company will promptly advise each such holder of Registrable
Securities thereof and may require, by written notice to each
such holder accompanying such advice, 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7 

that all or such specified portion of such Registrable Securities
be excluded from such underwritten offering; provided, however,
that the securities so excluded shall be apportioned first to any
selling security holders other than holders of Registrable
Securities and then pro rata among holders of Registrable
Securities according to the total dollar amount of securities
entitled to be included therein owned by each holder of
Registrable Securities or in such other proportions as shall
mutually be agreed to by such holders of Registrable Securities;

(c) the Company shall not be obligated to
effect any registration of Registrable Securities under this
Section 2.5 incidental to the registration of any of its
securities in connection with mergers, acquisitions, exchange
offers, distributions to its stockholders, dividend reinvestment
plans, stock option or other employee benefit plans, debenture
offerings or preferred stock offerings; and

(d) if the registration so proposed by the
Company involves an underwritten offering, the right of any
holder to include his or her Registrable Securities in such
registration shall be conditioned upon the following: (i) such
holder shall participate in such underwriting and only such
holder's shares of Registrable Securities that are to be
distributed pursuant to the underwriting shall be included in
such registration and (ii) all holders proposing to distribute
their Registrable Securities through such underwriting shall
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
underwriter or underwriters.

3. Expenses

The Company will pay all Registration Expenses in connection
with each of the registrations of Registrable Securities effected
by the Company pursuant to Section 2; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to pay Registration Expenses for
any registration process begun pursuant to Section 2 if the
registration process is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) because of withdrawals of requests for
registration by the holders of Registrable Securities (in which
case all withdrawing holders shall bear such expenses pro rata in
proportion to the shares of Registrable Securities withdrawn);
provided, further, however, that if at the time of such
withdrawal the withdrawing holders have learned of a material
adverse change in the condition, business or prospects of the
Company from that which was not, and, upon reasonable
investigation would not have been, known to the withdrawing
holders at the time of their request, then the withdrawing
holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and
shall retain their rights pursuant to Section 2. Holders of
Registrable Securities being registered pursuant to 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8

this Agreement shall pay all Selling Expenses with each such
holder bearing a pro rata portion of the Selling Expenses based
upon the number of Registrable Securities registered in such
registration by each such holder.

4. Registration Procedures

4.1 The Company's Obligations

If and whenever the Company is required to effect the
registration of any Registrable Securities under this Agreement,
the Company will as expeditiously as is reasonably possible:

(a) prepare and file with the Commission, on any
appropriate form, a registration statement with respect to such
Registrable Securities and use all reasonable efforts to cause
such registration statement to become and remain effective;
provided, however, that before filing a registration statement or
prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, including
documents incorporated by reference after the initial filing of
the registration statement, the Company shall furnish to the
holders of the Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement and the underwriters, if any, copies of
all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents will be
subject to the review of such holders and underwriters, and the
Company will not file any registration statement or amendment
thereto or any prospectus or any supplement thereto (including
such documents incorporated by reference) to which the holders of
a majority of the shares of the Registrable Securities covered by
such registration statement or the underwriters, if any, shall
reasonably object, but their reasonable objection may only be
with respect to information contained in such document about the
selling holder of the Registrable Securities and may be based
only upon an assertion that such information contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or an omission to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances, not
misleading;

(b) prepare and file with the Commission such
amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the
prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to
keep such registration statement effective for the applicable
period, cause the related prospectus to be supplemented by any
required prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to be
filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions then in
force) under the 1933 Act, and comply with the provisions of the
1933 Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable
Securities and other securities covered by such registration
statement in accordance with the intended method of disposition
by the seller or sellers thereof set forth in such registration
statement;

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 9

(c) furnish to each selling holder of Registrable
Securities and each managing underwriter, without charge, at
least one signed copy of the registration statement and any
posteffective amendment thereto, including financial statements
and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference
and all exhibits (including those incorporated by reference);

(d) furnish to each seller of such Registrable
Securities such number of copies of the prospectus and any
supplements thereto included in such registration statement
(including a preliminary prospectus) and other documents as such
seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale or
disposition of such Registrable Securities, and consent to the
use of the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by
each of the selling holders of Registrable Securities and the
underwriters, if any, in connection with the offering and sale of
the Registrable Securities covered by the prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto;

(e) use all reasonable efforts to register or qualify
all securities covered by such registration statement under such
other securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as each
seller or underwriter shall reasonably request, and do any and
all other acts and things that may be necessary to enable such
seller or underwriter to consummate the disposition in such
jurisdictions of its Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement, except that the Company shall not for any
such purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a
foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so
qualified, or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing
business in any such jurisdiction, or to consent to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction;

(f) notify the selling holders of Registrable
Securities and the managing underwriters, if any, promptly, and
(if requested by any such person) confirm such advice in writing:

(i) when the prospectus or any prospectus supplement
or posteffective amendment has been filed, and, with respect
to the registration statement or any posteffective
amendment, when the same has become effective;

(ii) of any request by the Commission for amendments or
supplements to the registration statement or the prospectus
or for additional information;

(iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the registration
statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that
purpose;

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 10

(iv) if at any time the representations and warranties
of the Company contemplated by paragraph (k) below cease to
be true and correct;

(v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification
with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the
Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the
Company's knowledge of the initiation or threatening of any
proceedings for such purpose; and

(vi) of the happening of any event as a result of which
the prospectus included in such registration statement, as
then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing
or if it is necessary to amend or supplement such prospectus
to comply with the law, and, at the request of any such
seller, prepare and furnish to such seller a reasonable
number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such
prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities
or securities, such prospectus, as amended or supplemented,
will comply with the law;

(g) cause all Registrable Securities to be listed on
any national securities exchange on which shares of Common Stock
are then listed, if such securities are not already so listed and
if such listing is then permitted under the rules of such
exchange, or qualify such securities for inclusion in the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated
Quotation System, and provide a transfer agent and registrar for
such Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of
such registration statement;

(h) issue to any underwriter or any other person to
which any holder of Registrable Securities may sell such
Registrable Securities in connection with such registration (and
to any direct or indirect transferee of any such underwriter or
to such holder, if such registered offering is not underwritten)
certificates evidencing such Registrable Securities without any
legend restricting the transferability of the Registrable
Securities;

(i) use all reasonable efforts to obtain the
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of the
registration statement or the lifting of any suspension of the
qualifications (or exemption from qualification) at the earliest
possible moment;

(j) if reasonably requested by the managing
underwriter or underwriters or the holders of a majority of the 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 11

Registrable Securities being sold in connection with an
underwritten offering, immediately incorporate in a prospectus
supplement or posteffective amendment such information as the
managing underwriters and the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities being sold agree should be included
therein relating to the sale of the Registrable Securities,
including, without limitation, information with respect to the
number of shares of Registrable Securities being sold to such
underwriters and the purchase price being paid therefor by such
underwriters and with respect to any other terms of the
underwritten (or best efforts underwritten) offering of the
Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering; and make all
required filings of such prospectus supplement or posteffective
amendment as soon as notified of the matters to be incorporated
in such prospectus supplement or posteffective amendment;

(k) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts
to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the
Commission, and make generally available to its security holders

the 1933 Act, no later than 45 days after the end of any 12-month
period (or 90 days, if such period is a fiscal year)
(i) commencing at the end of any fiscal quarter in which
Registrable Securities are sold to underwriters in an
underwritten offering or, if not sold to underwriters in such an
offering, (ii) beginning with the first month of the Company's
first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the
registration statement, which statements shall cover said 12-
month periods; and

(l) enter into such agreements (including an
underwriting agreement) and take all such actions in connection
therewith in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of
such Registrable Securities and, in such connection, whether or
not an underwriting agreement is entered into and whether or not
the registration is an underwritten registration:

(i) make such representations and warranties to the
holders of such Registrable Securities and the underwriters,
if any, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made
by issuers to underwriters in primary underwritten
offerings;

(ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and
updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope
and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
managing underwriters, if any, and the holders of a majority
of the shares of Registrable Securities being sold)
addressed to each selling holder and the underwriters, if
any, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions
requested in underwritten offerings and

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 12

such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the
underwriters;

(iii) obtain "cold comfort" letters and updates thereof
from the Company's independent certified public accountants
addressed to the selling holders of Registrable Securities
and the underwriters, if any, such letters to be in
customary form and covering matters of the type customarily
covered in "cold comfort" letters by underwriters in
connection with primary underwritten offerings;

(iv) if an underwriting agreement is entered into, the
same shall set forth in full the customary indemnification
provisions and procedures of Section 7 hereof with respect
to all parties to be indemnified pursuant to said Section;
and

(v) the Company shall deliver such documents and
certificates as may be requested by the holders of a
majority of the shares of the Registrable Securities being
sold and the managing underwriters, if any, to evidence
compliance with clause (i) above and with any customary
conditions contained in the underwriting agreement.

The above shall be done at each closing under such underwriting
or similar agreement or as and to the extent required thereunder.

In the event the Company shall give any notice of the
happening of an event of the kind described in Section 4(f)(vi),
the time period mentioned in Section 2.1 shall be extended by the
number of days during the period from and including the date of
the giving of such notice to and including the date when each
seller of Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement either receives the copies of the supplemented or
amended prospectus contemplated by Section 4(f)(vi) or is advised
in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be
resumed.

5. Preparation; Reasonable Investigation

In connection with the preparation and filing of each
registration statement registering Registrable Securities under
the 1933 Act, the Company will give the holders of Registrable
Securities on whose behalf such Registrable Securities are to be
so registered and their underwriters, if any, and their
respective counsel and accountants, the opportunity to
participate in the preparation of such registration statement,
each prospectus included therein or filed with the Commission,
and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto, and will afford
such holders of Registrable Securities, underwriters, counsel and
accountants reasonable access to the Company's 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 13

records, personnel and properties, including all financial
records, and cause the Company's officers, directors and
employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such representative, underwriter, attorney or accountant in
connection with the registration.

6. Furnish Information

The Company may require each seller of Registrable
Securities as to which registration is being effected to furnish
to the Company such information regarding such seller, the
Registrable Securities held by such seller and the intended
method of disposition of such securities as shall be reasonably
required to effect the registration of such seller's Registrable
Securities as the Company may reasonably request, and the Company
may exclude from such registration the Registrable Securities of
any seller who unreasonably refuses to furnish such information
within a reasonable period after receiving such request.

7. Indemnification and Contribution

In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a
registration statement under Section 2:

(a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will
indemnify and hold harmless Station, the officers, directors,
agents and employees of Station, any underwriter (as defined in
the 1933 Act) for Station and each person, if any, who controls
Station or any underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act or
the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(joint or several) to which they may become subject under the
1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other federal or state law, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the
following statements, omissions or violations (collectively, a
"Violation"): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in such registration
statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final
prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements
thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged
violation by the Company of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, any state
securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the
1933 Act, the 1934 Act or any state securities law; and the
Company will reimburse Station, officer, director, agent,
employee, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by it, him or her in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the

indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(a) shall not
apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected
without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Company be liable in any
such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action
to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation
which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished expressly for use in connection with such
registration by Station, or any such underwriter or controlling
person.

(b) To the extent permitted by law, Station will
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its officers,
directors, agents or employees, each person, if any, who controls
the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act and any
underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(joint or several) to which they may become subject, under the
1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other federal or state law, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in
each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such
Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished by Station expressly for use in connection
with such registration; and Station will reimburse any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such
officer, director, agent, employee, controlling person or
underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however,
that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(b) shall
not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected
without the consent of Station, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party
under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action
(including any governmental action), such indemnified party will,
if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any
indemnifying party under this Section 7, deliver to the
indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof
and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate
in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume
the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the
parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have
the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses
to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such
indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying
party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
or conflicting interests between such indemnified party and any
other party represented by such 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 15

counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written
notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the
commencement of any such action, to the extent prejudicial to its
ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying
party of liability to the indemnified party under this Section 7
to the extent of such prejudice, but the omission so to deliver
written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of
any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise
than under this Section 7.

(d) If recovery is not available under the foregoing
indemnification provisions of this Section 7, for any reason
other than as specified therein, the parties entitled to
indemnification by the terms thereof shall be entitled to
contribution to liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
parties and the indemnified parties, except to the extent that
contribution is not permitted under Section 11(f) of the
1933 Act. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and
indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, the parties' relative knowledge and access to
information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim
was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any
statement or omission and any other equitable considerations
appropriate under the circumstances. The Company and Station
agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such
contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita
allocation. Station shall not be obligated to make any
contribution hereunder which in the aggregate exceeds the total
public offering price of the securities sold by Station, less the
aggregate amount of any damages which Station has otherwise been
required to pay in respect of the same claim or any substantially
similar claim.

8. Reports Under the 1934 Act

With a view to making available to the holders of
Registrable Securities the benefits of Rules 144 and 145(d)
promulgated under the 1933 Act and any other rule or regulation
of the Commission that may at any time permit a holder of
Registrable Securities to sell securities of the Company to the
public without registration or pursuant to a registration
hereunder, the Company agrees to:

(a) make and keep public information available, as
those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144, at all times;

(b) take such action as is reasonably necessary to
enable holders of Registrable Securities to utilize Form S-3 for
the sale of their Registrable Securities;

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 16

(c) file with the Commission in a timely manner all
reports and other documents required of the Company under the
1933 Act and the 1934 Act; and

(d) furnish to any holder of Registrable Securities,
so long as such holder owns any Registrable Securities, forthwith
upon request (i) a written statement by the Company that it has
complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the
1933 Act and the 1934 Act, and/or that it qualifies as a
registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3
(at any time after it so qualifies), (ii) a copy of the most
recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other
reports and documents filed with the Commission by the Company,
and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested
in availing any such holder of any rule or regulation of the
Commission which permits the selling of any such securities
without registration or pursuant to such form, including making
publicly available other information necessary to permit sales
pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act.

9. Registration of Securities Other Than Registrable
Securities

The Company has not granted and, without the written consent
of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Registrable
Securities, shall not grant to any person the right to request
the Company to register any equity securities under the 1933 Act
unless the rights so granted are subject to the prior rights of
the Holders of Registrable Securities set forth in, and are not
otherwise in conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of,
this Agreement.

10. Miscellaneous

10.1 Amendment and Waivers

Any provision of this Agreement may be amended and the
observance thereof may be waived (either generally or in a
particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively),
only with the written consent of the Company and the holders of a
majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding. Any
amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 10.1
shall be binding upon each holder of Registrable Securities at
the time outstanding, each future holder of Registrable
Securities, and the Company.

10.2 No Inconsistent Agreements

The Company will not on or after the date of this Agreement
enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is
inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 17

Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts
with the provisions hereof. The Company has not previously
entered into any agreement with respect to its securities
granting any registration rights to any person. The rights
granted to the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder do not
in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights
granted to the holders of the Company's securities under any such
agreements.

10.3 Successors and Assigns

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties,
including, without limitation and without the need for an express
assignment, subsequent holders of Registrable Securities;
provided, however, that this Agreement shall not inure to the
benefit of or be binding upon a successor or assign of a holder
of Registrable Securities unless and to the extent such successor
or assign acquired Registrable Securities from such holder, and
such successor or assign is restricted by Rule 144 of the
Commission in the public sale of such Registrable Securities
because such successor or assign is an "affiliate" of the Company
at the time of sale.

10.4 Notices

Any notice required or permitted to be given hereunder shall
be in writing given by personal delivery, certified or registered
mail (postage prepaid) or facsimile, addressed as respectively
set forth below or to such other address as any party shall have

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LIN BROADCASTING TO SPIN OFF LIN TELEVISION GROUP
ACQUIRES WTNH-TV, CONNECTICUT

KIRKLAND, Wash., June 8, 1994 - LIN Broadcasting Corporation
(NASDAQ: LINB) today announced that it intends to distribute the
common stock of its subsidiary, LIN Television Corp., to LIN
Broadcasting's stockholders on a tax-free basis. LIN also
announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
WTNH-TV, the ABC affiliate in Hartford-New Haven, Connecticut
from Cook Inlet Communications Corp. for approximately $120
million cash and 11.5% of the common stock of LIN Television
Corp. These transactions will create a public company which owns
seven network-affiliated television stations, including stations
in Dallas, Indianapolis and Norfolk.

Craig O. McCaw, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of LIN Broadcasting Corporation, said "Television and
cellular are two great but fundamentally different businesses
that should be managed separately. We believe the spin-off
enables LIN Television to continue to do acquisitions like WTNH-
TV and feel there is substantial opportunity for an independent,
highly focused television business to grow rapidly and take
advantage of the opportunities we see ahead."

McCaw, who will serve as the Chairman of the new entity,
went on to say, "I am pleased to announce that Gary Chapman, who
has ably shepherded the LIN Television properties since 1989 has
been named President and Chief Executive Officer of the company
which I am confident will continue to grow and prosper as an
independent public company under his leadership. Gary has not
only delivered excellent financial performance, but also been
innovative in the areas of programming and community
involvement."

Gary R. Chapman, currently President of LIN Broadcasting's
television group, said "It is a great time to be going out on our
own in the television industry. Free over-the-air broadcasting
has recovered with the economy and has proven its durability in
the face of competition from cable and other media. These
stations have strong franchises in attractive markets. We
believe that with our major news presence and local programming,
combined with our network affiliations, we can provide real value
to viewers, advertisers and investors."

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 2

Following the spin off, it is expected that approximately
42% of LIN Television Corp.'s shares will be publicly owned and
approximately 46% will be owned by McCaw Cellular Communications,
Inc. (NASDAQ: MCAWA). A share distribution ratio has not yet
been established. LIN Television Corp. intends to apply for
listing of its shares on NASDAQ. The transaction is subject to
Federal Communications Commission and other approvals, and to
obtaining a satisfactory tax ruling permitting the spin off to be
structured as a tax-free distribution to shareholders of the
common stock of LIN Broadcasting. The closing of the acquisition
and the spin off are expected to occur by year-end 1994.

In connection with these transactions, LIN Television Corp.
and McCaw Cellular will enter into a Private Market Value
Guarantee which will require McCaw Cellular, effective January,
1998, either to acquire all the outstanding shares of LIN
Television Corp. at a private market value per share as
determined by independent investment banks, or to put LIN
Television Corp. in its entirety up for sale, under the direction
of independent directors, in a manner intended to maximize value
for all LIN Television Corp. shareholders. This Guarantee does
not otherwise change the existing Private Market Value Guarantee
between LIN Broadcasting and McCaw Cellular, which provides for
an appraisal process of LIN Broadcasting beginning in January,
1995.

On May 31, LIN entered into a Local Marketing Agreement with
KXTX-TV, channel 39, an independent station in Dallas-Ft. Worth
owned by the Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc. LIN Television
Corp.'s Dallas station, KXAS-TV will handle substantially all
programming and production for both stations. It will also
program the highly acclaimed children's program "Bill Nye the
Science Guy," which is produced in partnership with the Disney
Co., and local news will be rebroadcast over KXTX-TV, providing a
larger audience and expanded production facilities for KXAS-TV's
programming.

Following the acquisition, LIN Television Corp. will own
WTNH-TV; KXAS-TV, channel 5, an NBC affiliate in Dallas-Ft.
Worth, Texas; WISH-TV, channel 8, a CBS affiliate in
Indianapolis, Indiana; WAVY-TV, channel 10, an NBC affiliate in
Hampton Roads-Norfolk-Portsmouth, Virginia; KXAN-TV, channel 36,
an NBC affiliate in Austin, Texas; WAND-TV, channel 17, an ABC
affiliate in Decatur-Champaign-Springfield-Danville, Illinois;
and WANE-TV, channel 15, a CBS affiliate in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. 
Pro-forma for the acquisition, LIN Television Corp.'s 1993
revenue would have been approximately $160 million and
broadcasting cash flow would have been approximately $80 million. 
LIN Television Corp. expects to have debt at closing of the
acquisition and spin off of approximately $320 million.
