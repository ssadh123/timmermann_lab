I am the General Counsel of McGraw-Hill, Inc., a New York corporation
(the "BORROWER"). This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section
4.6 of that certain Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "SECOND
AMENDMENT") dated as of November 7, 1994, among the Borrower, each of the
Banks (the "BANKS") listed therein and Bankers Trust Company, as Agent (the
"Agent"). The undersigned has prepared this opinion and delivered it to the
Banks for their benefit at the request of the Borrower. Unless otherwise
defined herein, the meanings of the capitalized terms used in this opinion
shall be the same as those in the Second Amendment.

I advise you that, in my opinion:

1. The Borrower is and each Material Subsidiary of the Borrower is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in corporate good standing
under the laws of its state of incorporation and has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on
its business as now conducted and proposed to be conducted. The Borrower is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted or the properties or assets owned or leased by it makes such
qualification reasonably necessary and where the failure to qualify would have
a Material Adverse Effect.

2. The Borrower has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver the Second Amendment and to carry out the transactions
contemplated thereby and to issue, deliver and make payments in respect of the
Second Amended and Restated Notes. The execution, delivery and performance of
the Second Amendment have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action by the Borrower and the issuance, delivery and making of payments in
respect of the Second Amended and Restated Notes have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action by the Borrower.

3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the
Second Amendment, the issuance, delivery and making of payments in respect of
the Second Amended and Restated Notes by the Borrower and the consummation of
any transaction contemplated by the Second Amendment do not and will not (i)
violate any provision of law applicable to the Borrower, or any of its Material
Subsidiaries, the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Borrower or
any of its Material Subsidiaries, or any order, judgment or decree of any court
or other agency of government binding on the Borrower or any of its Material
Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any contractual obligation of
the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries, (iii) result in or require
the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the material properties or
assets of the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries or (iv) require any
approval of stockholders or any approval or consent of any Person under any
contractual obligation of the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries
other than such approvals or consents which have been obtained or will be
obtained on or before the Second Amendment Effective Date; except for any
violation, conflict, default, breach, Lien or lack of approval the existence of
which would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

4. The Second Amendment and the Second Amended and Restated Notes
each constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower,
enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms except (i) that
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization and other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and (ii) that the remedy of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief are
subject to certain equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before
which any proceeding therefor may be brought (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). The Borrower has duly executed
and delivered the Second Amendment and the Second Amended and Restated Notes.

5. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the
Second Amendment and the issuance, delivery and making of payments in respect
of the Second Amended and Restated Notes by the Borrower do not and will not
require any registration with, consent or approval of, or notice to, or other
action to, with or by, any federal, state or other governmental authority or
regulatory body other than any such registration, consent, approval, notice or
other action which has been duly made, given or taken.

6. The Borrower is not an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

7. The Borrower is not subject to regulation under any federal or
state statute or regulation limiting its ability to incur indebtedness for
money borrowed

as contemplated by the Second Amendment or by the Second Amended and Restated
Notes.

8. The Borrower is not engaged, directly or indirectly,
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of
extending, or arranging for the extension of, credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any margin stock, within the meaning of Regulation G, T,
U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

I am admitted to practice law in the State of New York. No opinion is
expressed herein with respect to any laws other than those of the State of New
York and the United States.

Very truly yours,
