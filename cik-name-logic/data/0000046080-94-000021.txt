HASBRO, INC. ANNOUNCES REVENUES AND 
EARNINGS FOR THIRD QUARTER 1994

Pawtucket, RI (October 13, 1994) -- Hasbro, Inc. (HAS:ASE) today reported 
results for its second quarter ended September 25, 1994.

Revenues were $796,222,000, compared to the $812,393,000 reported in the 
third quarter of 1993. Net earnings for the quarter were $75,151,000, compared 
to the $75,548,000 reported last year. Earnings per share were $.85 up from the 
$.84 a year ago. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding was 
88,841,000 compared to 90,243,000 in 1993. 

For the year to date, revenues totaled $1,729,679,000, down from the 
$1,814,980,000 in 1993. Earnings before accounting change for the nine months 
were $103,502,000, or $1.16 per share, compared to the $129,278,000, or $1.44 
per share a year ago. Net earnings and earnings per share for the nine months, 
after an accounting change recorded in the first quarter of 1994, were 
$99,220,000 and $1.11, respectively. The weighted average number of shares 
outstanding was 89,592,000 for the first nine months of 1994 and 89,936,000 for 
the same period of 1993.

"As we had anticipated, our third quarter revenues returned to a level 
comparable with those of a year ago" said Alan G. Hassenfeld, Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer. "In spite of losing approximately $80,000,000 of 
worldwide volume from Jurassic Park(TM) and Barney(R) products during the 
quarter, we were able to recoup most of this lost revenue. Internationally, 
most of our European units continued to experience moderate growth from their 
1993 levels although domestically we could not sustain the record revenue 
levels of a year ago which had been buoyed by the successes of those two 
products. For the quarter, in the domestic market, our Batman(R) range of 
action figures continued to be strong, the relaunched version of Risk(R), the 
new Nerf(R) Liquidator(TM) Bat, our Gator Golf(TM) game and Playskool's(R) 
Magic Smoking Grill(TM) were all well received." 

"Our earnings for the quarter include the net effect of three unusual 
items", he continued. "We have provided $12,500,000 for the pretax costs 
associated with the restructuring of our operations and have also recorded an 
aggregate of approximately $23,000,000 in pretax gains from the liquidation of 
our investment in J.W. Spear & Sons PLC and the sale of our investment in 
Virgin Interactive Entertainment plc to Blockbuster Entertainment."

Mr. Hassenfeld concluded by noting, "Although it will not have a 
significant impact on our 1994 results, our new joint venture with Connector 
Set Limited Partnership for the international distribution of the K'NEX(R) line 
of construction toys is operating and has orders for all of its available 
product. Additionally, we have incorporated the games and puzzles purchased 
from Western Publishing into our product lines and the reorganized Hasbro Toy 
Group is up and running. With all of this behind us, and the new products and 
relationships which we have under contract and development, we remain 
enthusiastic about 1995 and beyond."
