Dear Sirs:

Fleet Financial Group, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation 
(the "Company"), confirms its agreement with each of you with 
respect to the issue and sale by the Company of up to 
$1,126,900,000 aggregate principal amount of its Senior 
Medium-Term Notes, Series H and Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, 
Series I (respectively, the "Senior Notes" and the 
"Subordinated Notes"), Due Nine Months or More from Date of 
Issue (collectively, the "Notes"). The Senior Notes are to be 
issued under an indenture dated as of October 1, 1992, between 
the Company and The First National Bank of Chicago (the "Senior 
Trustee" or "First Chicago"), as trustee (the "Senior 
Indenture"). The Subordinated Notes are to be issued under an 
indenture dated as of October 1, 1992, between the Company and 
First Chicago as trustee (the "Subordinated Trustee" and, 
collectively with the Senior Trustee, the "Trustee") as 
supplemented by a first supplemental indenture dated as of 
November 30, 1992, between the Company and the Subordinated 
Trustee (as so supplemented, the "Subordinated indenture" and 
collectively with the Senior Indenture, the "Indentures"). The 
Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $1,000 and 
integral multiples thereof, will be issued only in fully 
registered form and will have the annual interest rates, 
maturities and, if appropriate, other terms set forth in a 
supplement to the Prospectus referred to below. The Notes will 
be issued, and the terms thereof established, in accordance 
with the applicable Indenture and the Medium-Term Notes 
Administrative Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit A (the 
"Procedures") (unless a Terms Agreement (as defined in Section 
2(b)) modifies or otherwise supersedes such Procedures with 
respect to Notes issued pursuant to such Terms Agreement). The 
Procedures may only be amended by written agreement of the 
Company and you after notice to, and with the approval of, the 
Trustee. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Agent" 
shall refer to any of you acting solely in the capacity as 
agent for the Company pursuant to Section 2(a) and not as 
principal (collectively, the "Agents"), the term "Purchaser" 
shall refer to one of you acting solely as principal pursuant 
to Section 2(b) and not as agent, and the term "you" shall 
refer to you collectively whether at any time any of you is 
acting in both such capacities or in either such capacity. In 
acting under this Agreement, in whatever capacity, each of you 
is acting individually and not jointly.

1. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents 
and warrants to, and agrees with, you as set forth below in 
this Section 1. Certain terms used in this Section 1 are 
defined in paragraph (d) hereof.

(a) The Company meets the requirements for use 
of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the 
"Act") and has filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement 
on such Form (File Number: 33-55555), including a 
basic prospectus, which also constitutes pursuant to 
Rule 429 under the Act Post-Effective Amendments No. 1 
to registration statements on such Form (File Numbers: 
33- 50214 and 33-50216) and which have become 
effective, for the registration under the Act of 
securities (the "Securities"), including the Notes, in 
an aggregate principal amount of $1,126,900,000. Such 
registration statements, as amended at the date of 
this Agreement, meet the requirements set forth in 
Rule 415(a)(1)(ix) or (x) under the Act and comply in 
all other material respects with said Rule. The 
Company has included in such registration statements, 
as amended at the date of this Agreement, or has filed 
or will file with the Commission pursuant to the 
applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) under the Act, a 
supplement to the form of prospectus included in such 
registration statement relating to the Notes and the 
plan of distribution thereof (the "Prospectus 
Supplement"). In connection with the sale of Notes 
the Company proposes to file with the Commission 
pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) 
under the Act further supplements to the Prospectus 
Supplement specifying the interest rates, maturity 
dates and, if appropriate, other terms of the Notes 
sold pursuant hereto or the offering thereof.

(b) As of the Execution Time, on the Effective 
Date, when any supplement to the Prospectus is filed 
with the Commission, as of the date of any Terms 
Agreement, on each day of an Offering Period (referred 
to below) and at the date of delivery by the Company 
of any Notes sold hereunder (a "Closing Date"), (i) 
the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such 
time, and the Prospectus, as supplemented as of any 
such time, and each Indenture will comply in all 
material respects with the applicable requirements of 
the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust 
Indenture Act") and the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the respective rules 
thereunder; (ii) the Registration Statement, as 
amended as of any such time, did not or will not 
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or 
omit to state any material fact required to be stated 
therein or necessary in order to make the statements 
therein not misleading; and (iii) the Prospectus, as 
supplemented as of any such time, will not contain any 
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a 
material fact necessary in order to make the 
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances 
under which they were made, not misleading; provided, 
however, that the Company makes no representations or 
warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration 
Statement which shall constitute the Statement of 
Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the 
Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the 
information contained in or omitted from the 
Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or any 
supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity 
with information furnished in writing to the Company 
by any of you specifically for inclusion in connection 
with the preparation of the Registration Statement or 
the Prospectus (or any supplement there to).

(c) As of the time any Notes are issued and sold 
hereunder, each Indenture will constitute a legal, 
valid and binding instrument enforceable against the 
Company in accordance with its terms and such Notes 
will have been duly authorized, executed, 
authenticated and, when paid for by the purchasers 
thereof, will constitute legal, valid and binding 
obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of 
the applicable Indenture.

(d) The terms which follow, when used in this 
Agreement, shall have the meanings indicated. The 
term "the Effective Date" shall mean each date that 
the Registration Statement and any post-effective 
amendment or amendments thereto became or become 
effective. "Execution Time" shall mean the date and 
time that this Agreement is executed and delivered by 
the parties hereto. "Basic Prospectus" shall mean the 
form of basic prospectus relating to the Securities 
contained in the Registration Statement at the 
Effective Date. "Prospectus" shall mean the Basic 
Prospectus as supplemented by the Prospectus 
Supplement. "Registration Statement" shall mean the 
registration statements referred to in paragraph (a) 
above, including incorporated documents, exhibits and 
financial statements, as amended at the Execution 
Time. "Rule 415" and "Rule 424" refer to such rules 
under the Act. Any reference herein to the 
Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the 
Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus shall be 
deemed to refer to and include the documents 
incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 
of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on 
or before the Effective Date of the Registration 
Statement or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, 
the Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus, as the 
case may be; and any reference herein to the terms 
"amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to 
the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the 
Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus shall be 
deemed to refer to and include the filing of any 
document under the Exchange Act after the Effective 
Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date 
of the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or 
the Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be 
incorporated therein by reference.

2. Appointment of Agents; Solicitation by the Agents of 
Offers to Purchase; Sales of Notes to a Purchaser. (a) Subject 
to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company 
hereby authorizes each of the Agents to act as its agent to 
solicit offers for the purchase of all or part of the Notes 
from the Company. The Company shall notify the Agents from 
time to time as to the commencement of a period during which 
the Notes may be offered and sold by the Agents (each period, 
commencing with such notification and ending at such time as 
the authorization for offers and sales through the Agents shall 
have been suspended by the Company or the Agents as provided 
hereunder, being referred to as an "Offering Period").

On the basis of the representations and warranties, and 
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each of 
the Agents agrees, as agent of the Company, to use its 
reasonable efforts to solicit offers to purchase the Notes 
during each Offering Period from the Company upon the terms and 
conditions set forth in the Prospectus (and any supplement 
thereto) and in the Procedures.

The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to 
instruct the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of 
time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase the 
Notes. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the 
Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to 
purchase Notes from the Company until such time as the Company 
has advised them that such solicitation may be resumed.

The Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, on the 
Closing Date with respect to each sale of Notes by the Company 
as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent as agent, in 
an amount equal to that percentage specified in Schedule I 
hereto of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes sold by 
the Company. Such commission shall be payable as specified in 
the Procedures.

Subject to the provisions of this Section and to the 
Procedures, offers for the purchase of Notes may be solicited 
by an Agent as agent for the Company at such time and in such 
amounts as such Agent deems advisable. The Company may from 
time to time offer Notes for sale otherwise than through an 
Agent; provided, however, that so long as this Agreement shall 
be in effect, the Company shall not solicit or accept offers to 
purchase Notes through any agent other than an Agent or an 
affiliate of the Company (including Fleet Bank of 
Massachusetts, National Association, which has entered into a 
distribution agreement with the Company providing for the sale 
of Notes on terms and conditions substantially similar to those 
contained herein) unless such solicitation or acceptance is on 
terms with respect to commissions substantially similar to 
those set forth in Schedule I hereto and the Company shall give 
the Agents reasonable notice of the appointment of such agents 
for the purpose of soliciting the Notes.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, 
whenever the Company and any Agent determine that the Company 
shall sell Notes directly to such Agent as principal, each such 
sale of Notes shall be made in accordance with the terms of 
this Agreement and a supplemental agreement relating to such 
sale between the Company and the Purchaser. Each such 
supplemental agreement (which may be an oral or written 
agreement) is herein referred to as a "Terms Agreement". Each 
Terms Agreement shall describe (whether orally or in writing) 
the Notes to be purchased by the Purchaser pursuant thereto and 
shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, the 
price to be paid to the Company for such Notes, the maturity 
date of such Notes, the rate at which interest will be paid on 
such Notes, the dates on which interest will be paid on such 
Notes and the record date with respect to each such payment of 
interest, the Closing Date for the purchase of such Notes, the 
place of delivery of the Notes and payment therefor, the method 
of payment and any requirements for the delivery of opinions of 
counsel, certificates from the Company or its officers or a 
letter from the Company's independent public accountants, as 
described in Section 6(b). Any such Terms Agreement may also 
specify the period of time referred to in Section 4(m). Any 
such Terms Agreement may be in the form attached hereto as 
Exhibit B. The Purchaser's commitment to purchase Notes shall 
be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations 
and warranties of the Company herein contained and shall be 
subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth.

Delivery of the certificates for Notes sold to the 
Purchaser pursuant to a Terms Agreement shall be made not later 
than the Closing Date agreed to in such Terms Agreement, 
against payment of funds to the Company in the net amount due 
to the Company for such Notes by the method and in the form set 
forth in the Procedures unless otherwise agreed to between the 
Company and the Purchaser in such Terms Agreement.

Unless otherwise agreed to between the Company and the 
Purchaser in a Terms Agreement, any Note sold to a Purchaser 
(i) shall be purchased by such Purchaser at a price equal to 
100% of the principal amount thereof less a percentage equal to 
the commission applicable to an agency sale of a Note of 
identical maturity and (ii) may be resold by such Agent at 
varying prices determined at the time of sale or, if so agreed 
and set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, at a fixed 
public offering price, from time to time. In connection with 
any resale of Notes purchased, a Purchaser may use a selling or 
dealer group and may reallow any portion of the discount or 
commission payable pursuant hereto to dealers or purchasers.

3. Offering and Sale of Notes. Each Agent and the Company 
agree to perform the respective duties and obligations 
specifically provided to be performed by them in the Procedures.

4. Agreements. The Company agrees with you that:

(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of 
the Notes, the Company will not file any amendment of 
the Registration Statement or supplement to the 
Prospectus (except for (i) periodic or current reports 
filed under the Exchange Act, (ii) a supplement 
relating to any offering of Notes providing solely for 
the specification of or a change in the maturity 
dates, interest rates, issuance prices or other terms 
of any Notes or (iii) a supplement relating to an 
offering of Securities other than the Notes) unless 
the Company has furnished each of you a copy for your 
review prior to filing and given each of you a 
reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed 
amendment or supplement. Subject to the foregoing 
sentence, the Company will cause each supplement to 
the Prospectus to be filed with the Commission 
pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) 
within the time period prescribed and will provide 
evidence satisfactory to you of such filing. The 
Company will promptly advise each of you (i) when the 
Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have 
been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 
424(b), (ii) when, prior to the termination of the 
offering of the Notes, any amendment of the 
Registration Statement shall have been filed or become 
effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for 
any amendment of the Registration Statement or 
supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional 
information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of 
any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the 
Registration Statement or the institution or 
threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) 
of the receipt by the Company of any notification with 
respect to the suspension of the qualification of the 
Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation 
or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. 
The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the 
issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to 
obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.

(b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating 
to the Notes is required to be delivered under the 
Act, any event occurs as a result of which the 
Prospectus as then supplemented would include any 
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state 
any material fact necessary to make the statements 
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which 
they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be 
necessary to amend the Registration Statement or to 
supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or 
the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, 
the Company promptly will (i) notify each of you to 
suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes (and, 
if so notified by the Company, each of you shall 
forthwith suspend such solicitation and cease using 
the Prospectus as then supplemented), (ii) prepare and 
file with the Commission, subject to the first 
sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an 
amendment or supplement which will correct such 
statement or omission or effect such compliance and 
(iii) supply any supplemented Prospectus to each of 
you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. 
If such amendment or supplement, and any documents, 
certificates and opinions furnished to each of you 
pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Section 4 in 
connection with the preparation or filing of such 
amendment or supplement are satisfactory in all 
respects to you, each of you will, upon the filing of 
such amendment or supplement with the Commission and 
upon the effectiveness of an amendment to the 
Registration Statement, if such an amendment is 
required, resume your obligation to solicit offers to 
purchase Notes hereunder.

(c) The Company, during the period when a 
prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be 
delivered under the Act, will file promptly all 
documents required to be filed with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act and will furnish to each of you copies of 
such documents. In addition, on the date on which the 
Company makes any announcement to the general public 
concerning earnings or concerning any other event 
which is required to be described, or which the 
Company proposes to describe, in a document filed 
pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Company will furnish 
to each of you the information contained or to be 
contained in such announcement. The Company also will 
furnish to each of you copies of all other press 
releases or announcements to the general public of a 
financial nature. The Company will immediately notify 
each of you of (i) any decrease in the rating of the 
Notes or any other debt securities of the Company, by 
any "nationally recognized statistical rating 
organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) 
under the Act) or (ii) any notice given of any 
intended or potential decrease in any such rating or 
of a possible change in any such rating that does not 
indicate the direction of the possible change, as soon 
as the Company learns of any such decrease or notice.

(d) As soon as practicable, the Company will 
make generally available to its security holders and 
to each of you an earnings statement or statements of 
the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy 
the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 
158 under the Act.

(e) The Company will furnish to each of you and 
your counsel, without charge, copies of the 
Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) 
and, so long as delivery of a prospectus may be 
required by the Act, as many copies of the Prospectus 
and any supplement thereto as you may reasonably 
request.

(f) The Company will arrange for the 
qualification of the Notes for sale under the laws of 
such jurisdictions as any of you may designate, will 
maintain such qualifications in effect so long as 
required for the distribution of the Notes, and will 
arrange for the determination of the legality of the 
Notes for purchase by institutional investors.

(g) The Company shall furnish to each of you 
such information, documents, certificates of officers 
of the Company and opinions of counsel for the Company 
relating to the business, operations and affairs of 
the Company, the Registration Statement, the 
Prospectus, and any amendments thereof or supplements 
thereto, each Indenture, the Notes, this Agreement, 
the Procedures and the performance by the Company and 
you of its and your respective obligations hereunder 
and thereunder as any of you may from time to time and 
at any time prior to the termination of this Agreement 
reasonably request.

(h) The Company shall, whether or not any sale 
of the Notes is consummated, (i) pay all expenses 
incident to the performance of its obligations under 
this Agreement, including the fees and disbursements 
of its accountants and counsel, the cost of printing 
or other production and delivery of the Registration 
Statement, the Prospectus, all amendments thereof and 
supplements thereto, each Indenture, this Agreement 
and all other documents relating to the offering, the 
cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering 
the Notes, the fees and disbursements, including fees 
of counsel, incurred in compliance with Section 4(f), 
the fees and disbursements of the Trustee and the fees 
of any agency that rates the Notes, (ii) reimburse 
each of you on a monthly basis for all out-of-pocket 
expenses (including without limitation advertising 
expenses) incurred by you in connection with this 
Agreement and (iii) pay the reasonable fees and 
expenses of your counsel incurred in connection with 
this Agreement.

(i) Each acceptance by the Company of an offer 
to purchase Notes will be deemed to be an affirmation 
that its representations and warranties contained in 
this Agreement are true and correct at the time of 
such acceptance, as though made at and as of such 
time, and a covenant that such representations and 
warranties will be true and correct at the time of 
delivery to the purchaser of the Notes relating to 
such acceptance, as though made at and as of such time 
(it being understood that for purposes of the 
foregoing affirmation and covenant such 
representations and warranties shall relate to the 
Registration Statement and Prospectus as amended or 
supplemented at each such time). Each such acceptance 
by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes 
shall be deemed to constitute an additional 
representation, warranty and agreement by the Company 
that, as of the settlement date for the sale of such 
Notes, after giving effect to the issuance of such 
Notes, of any other Notes to be issued on or prior to 
such settlement date and of any other Securities to be 
issued and sold by the Company on or prior to such 
settlement date, the aggregate amount of Securities 
(including any Notes) which have been issued and sold 
by the Company will not exceed the amount of 
Securities registered pursuant to the Registration 
Statement.

(j) Prior to the commencement of the first 
Offering Period subsequent to each time, and 
subsequent to each time during any Offering Period, 
that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is 
amended or supplemented (other than by an amendment or 
supplement relating to any offering of Securities 
other than the Notes or providing solely for the 
specification of or a change in the maturity dates, 
the interest rates, the issuance prices or other 
similar terms of any Notes sold pursuant hereto), the 
Company will deliver or cause to be delivered promptly 
to each of you a certificate of the Company, signed by 
the Chairman of the Board, or the President, or any 
Executive Vice President and the principal financial 
or accounting officer or Treasurer of the Company, 
dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment 
or the date of the filing of such supplement, in form 
reasonably satisfactory to you, of the same tenor as 
the certificate referred to in Section 5(d) but 
modified to relate to the last day of the fiscal 
quarter for which financial statements of the Company 
were last filed with the Commission and to the 
Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended 
and supplemented to the time of the effectiveness of 
such amendment or the filing of such supplement.

(k) Prior to the commencement of the first 
Offering Period subsequent to each time, and 
subsequent to each time during any Offering Period, 
that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is 
amended or supplemented (other than by an amendment or 
supplement (i) relating to any offering of Securities 
other than the Notes, (ii) providing solely for the 
specification of or a change in the maturity dates, 
the interest rates, the issuance prices or other 
similar terms of any Notes sold pursuant hereto or 
(iii) setting forth or incorporating by reference 
financial statements or other information as of and 
for a fiscal quarter, unless, in the case of clause 
(iii) above, in the reasonable judgment of any of you, 
such financial statements or other information are of 
such a nature that an opinion of counsel should be 
furnished), the Company shall furnish or cause to be 
furnished promptly to each of you a written opinion of 
counsel of the Company satisfactory to each of you, 
dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment 
or the date of the filing of such supplement, in form 
satisfactory to each of you, of the same tenor as the 
opinion referred to in Section 5(b) but modified to 
relate to the Registration Statement and the 
Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of 
the effectiveness of such amendment or the filing of 
such supplement or, in lieu of such opinion, counsel 
last furnishing such an opinion to you may furnish 
each of you with a letter to the effect that you may 
rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though 
it were dated the date of such letter authorizing 
reliance (except that statements in such last opinion 
will be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement 
and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the 
time of the effectiveness of such amendment or the 
filing of such supplement).

(l) Prior to the commencement of the first 
Offering Period subsequent to each time that the 
Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or 
supplemented to include or incorporate amended or 
supplemental financial information, and each time 
during any Offering Period that the Registration 
Statement or Prospectus is so amended or supplemented, 
the Company shall cause its independent public 
accountants promptly to furnish each of you a letter, 
dated the date of the commencement of such Offering 
Period or the date of the effectiveness of such 
amendment or the date of the filing of such 
supplement, as the case may be, in form satisfactory 
to each of you, of the same tenor as the letter 
referred to in Section 5(e) with such changes as may 
be necessary to reflect the amended and supplemental 
financial information included or incorporated by 
reference in the Registration Statement and the 
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented to the date of 
such letter; provided, that in no event will the 
Company accept any offer to purchase Notes unless such 
letter shall have been delivered; provided, further, 
that, if the Registration Statement or the Prospectus 
is amended or supplemented solely to include or 
incorporate by reference financial information as of 
and for a fiscal quarter, the Company's independent 
public accountants may limit the scope of such letter, 
which shall be satisfactory in form to each of you, to 
the unaudited financial statements, the related 
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations" and any other 
information of an accounting, financial or statistical 
nature included in such amendment or supplement, 
unless, in the reasonable judgment of any of you, such 
letter should cover other information or changes in 
specified financial statement line items.

(m) During the period from the date of any Terms 
Agreement to the later of (A) the Closing Date with 
respect to such Terms Agreement and (B) the date, if 
any, specified in such Terms Agreement, the Company 
shall not, without the prior consent of the Purchaser 
thereunder, issue or announce the proposed issuance of 
any of its debt securities, including Notes (other 
than the Notes that are to be sold pursuant to such 
Terms Agreement), with terms substantially similar to 
the Notes being purchased pursuant to such Terms 
Agreement, other than borrowings under its revolving 
credit agreements and lines of credit and issuances of 
its commercial paper.

(n) The Company confirms as of the date hereof 
that it has complied with all provisions of Section 1 
of Laws of Florida, Chapter 92-198, An Act Relating to 
Disclosure of Doing Business with Cuba, and the 
Company further agrees that if it commences engaging 
in business with the government of Cuba or with any 
person or affiliate located in Cuba after the date the 
Registration Statement becomes or has become effective 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission or with 
the Florida Department of Banking and Finance (the 
"Department"), whichever date is later, or if the 
information reported in the Prospectus, if any, 
concerning the Company's business with Cuba or with 
any person or affiliate located in Cuba changes in any 
material way, the Company will provide the Department 
notice of such business or change, as appropriate, in 
a form acceptable to the Department.

5. Conditions to the Obligations of the Agents. The 
obligations of each Agent to solicit offers to purchase the 
Notes shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations 
and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as 
of the Execution Time, on the Effective Date, when any 
supplement to the Prospectus is filed with the Commission and 
as of each Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of 
the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions 
hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations 
hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

(a) If filing of the Prospectus, or any 
supplement thereto, is required pursuant to Rule 
424(b), the Prospectus, and any such supplement, shall 
have been filed in the manner and within the time 
period required by Rule 424(b); and no stop order 
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration 
Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings 
for that purpose shall have been instituted or 
threatened.

(b) The Company shall have furnished to each 
Agent the opinion of Edwards & Angell, counsel for the 
Company, dated the Execution Time, to the effect that:

(i) each of the Company, Fleet National 
Bank ("Fleet Bank-RI"), and any other subsidiary 
or subsidiaries which the Agent may reasonably 
request (individually a "Subsidiary" and 
collectively the "Subsidiaries") has been duly 
incorporated and is validly existing as a 
corporation or national association in good 
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in 
which it is chartered or organized, with full 
corporate power and authority to own its 
properties and conduct its business as described 
in the Prospectus; the Company is qualified to do 
business as a foreign corporation under the laws 
of the State of New York; except as stated above, 
none of the Company or Fleet Bank-RI is required 
to be qualified to do business as a foreign 
corporation under the laws of any other 
jurisdiction; and the Company is registered as a 
bank holding company under the Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956, as amended;

(ii) all the outstanding shares of capital 
stock of Fleet Bank-RI and such Subsidiaries have 
been duly and validly authorized and issued and 
are fully paid and (except as provided in 12 
U.S.C. Section 55) nonassessable, and, except as 
otherwise set forth in the Prospectus, all 
outstanding shares of capital stock of Fleet 
Bank-RI and such Subsidiaries are owned by the 
Company free and clear of any perfected security 
interest and, to the knowledge of such counsel, 
after due inquiry, any other security interests, 
claims, liens or encumbrances;

(iii) each Indenture has been duly 
authorized, executed and delivered by the 
Company, has been duly qualified under the Trust 
Indenture Act, and constitutes a legal, valid and 
binding agreement enforceable against the Company 
in accordance with its terms (subject, as to 
enforcement of remedies, to applicable 
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, 
moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' 
rights generally from time to time in effect and 
to the availability of equitable remedies which 
are discretionary with the courts);

(iv) the Notes have been duly authorized as 
a series of Debt Securities under the applicable 
Indenture, are in the forms provided for by 
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the 
Company adopted pursuant to such Indenture, 
conform to the description thereof contained in 
the Prospectus, and, when executed and 
authenticated in accordance with the provisions 
of the applicable Indenture and delivered to and 
paid for by the purchasers, will constitute valid 
and binding obligations of the Company entitled 
to the benefits of the applicable Indenture;

(v) to the best knowledge of such counsel, 
there is no pending or threatened action, suit or 
proceeding before any court or governmental 
agency, authority or body or any arbitrator 
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, 
of a character required to be disclosed in the 
Registration Statement which is not adequately 
disclosed in the Prospectus, and there is no 
franchise, contract or other document of a 
character required to be described in the 
Registration Statement or Prospectus, or to be 
filed as an exhibit, which is not described or 
filed as required;

(vi) the Registration Statement and any 
amendments thereto have become effective under 
the Act; to the best knowledge of such counsel, 
no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the 
Registration Statement, as amended, has been 
issued, no proceedings for that purpose have been 
instituted or threatened, and the Registration 
Statement, the Prospectus and each amendment 
thereof or supplement thereto as of their 
respective effective or issue dates (other than 
the financial statements and other financial data 
contained therein as to which such counsel need 
express no opinion) comply as to form in all 
material respects with the applicable 
requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and 
the respective rules thereunder; and such counsel 
has no reason to believe that the Registration 
Statement, or any amendment thereof, at the time 
it became effective and at the date of this, 
Agreement (or, in the case of any opinion 
delivered pursuant to Section 4(k) or Section 6, 
the date of such subsequently delivered opinion), 
contained any untrue statement of a material fact 
or omitted to state any material fact required to 
be stated therein or necessary to make the 
statements therein not misleading or that the 
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented to the 
date of such opinion, includes any untrue 
statement of a material fact or omits to state a 
material fact necessary to make the statements 
therein, in light of the circumstances under 
which they were made, not misleading;

(vii) this Agreement has been duly 
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;

(viii) no consent, approval, authorization 
or order of any court or governmental agency or 
body is required for the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated herein, except such as 
have been obtained under the Act and such as may 
be required under the blue sky laws of any 
jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and 
distribution of the Notes as contemplated by this 
Agreement and such other approvals (specified in 
such opinion) as have been obtained;

(ix) neither the issue and sale of the 
Notes, nor the consummation of any other of the 
transactions herein contemplated nor the 
fulfillment of the terms hereof will conflict 
with, result in a breach of, or constitute a 
default under the charter or by-laws of the 
Company or the terms of any indenture or other 
agreement or instrument known to such counsel and 
to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries 
is a party or bound, or any order or regulation 
known to such counsel to be applicable to the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries of any court, 
regulatory body, administrative agency, 
governmental body or arbitrator having 
jurisdiction over the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries; and

(x) no holders of securities of the Company 
have rights to the registration of such 
securities under the Registration Statement.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) 
as to matters involving the application of laws of any 
jurisdiction other than the State of Rhode Island or 
the United States, to the extent deemed proper and 
specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other 
counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and 
who are satisfactory to counsel for the Agents and (B) 
as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on 
certificates of responsible officers of the Company 
and public officials. References to the Prospectus in 
this paragraph (b) include any supplements thereto at 
the date such opinion is rendered.

(c) Each Agent shall have received from Cravath, 
Swaine & Moore, counsel for the Agents, such opinion 
or opinions, dated the Execution Time, with respect to 
the issuance and sale of the Notes, each Indenture, 
the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (together 
with any supplement thereto) and other related matters 
as the Agents may reasonably require, and the Company 
shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as 
they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass 
upon such matters.

(d) The Company shall have furnished to each 
Agent a certificate of the Company, signed by the 
Chairman of the Board, or the President, or any 
Executive Vice President and the principal financial 
or accounting officer or Treasurer of the Company, 
dated the Execution Time, to the effect that the 
signers of such certificate have carefully examined 
the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any 
supplement to the Prospectus and this Agreement and 
that:

(i) the representations and warranties of 
the Company in this Agreement are true and 
correct in all material respects on and as of the 
date hereof with the same effect as if made on 
the date hereof and the Company has complied with 
all the agreements and satisfied all the 
conditions on its part to be performed or 
satisfied as a condition to the obligation of the 
Agents to solicit offers to purchase the Notes;

(ii) no stop order suspending the 
effectiveness of the Registration Statement has 
been issued and no proceedings for that purpose 
have been instituted or, to the Company's 
knowledge, threatened; and

(iii) since the date of the most recent 
financial statements included in the Prospectus 
(exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has 
been no material adverse change in the condition 
(financial or other), earnings, business or 
properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, 
whether or not arising from transactions in the 
ordinary course of business, except as set forth 
or contemplated in the Prospectus (exclusive of 
any supplement thereto).

(e) At the Execution Time, KPMG Peat Marwick LLP 
shall have furnished to each Agent a letter or letters 
(which may refer to letters previously delivered to 
the Agents), dated as of the Execution Time, in form 
and substance satisfactory to the Agents, confirming 
that they are independent accountants within the 
meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the 
respective applicable published rules and regulations 
thereunder and stating in effect that:

(i) in their opinion the audited financial 
statements included or incorporated in the 
Registration Statement and the Prospectus and 
reported on by them comply as to form in all 
material respects with the applicable accounting 
requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and 
the related published rules and regulations;

(ii) on the basis of a reading of the 
latest unaudited consolidated financial 
statements made available by the Company; 
carrying out certain specified procedures (but 
not an examination in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards) which would not 
necessarily reveal matters of significance with 
respect to the comments set forth in such letter; 
a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the 
stockholders, directors and executive and audit 
committees of the Company; and inquiries of 
certain officials of the Company who have 
responsibility for financial and accounting 
matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to 
transactions and events subsequent to the date of 
the most recent audited financial statements 
incorporated in the Registration Statement and 
the Prospectus, nothing came to their attention 
which caused them to believe that:

(1) the amounts in the unaudited 
"Summary Consolidated Financial Data", if 
any, included in the Prospectus do not agree 
with the corresponding amounts in the 
audited consolidated financial statements, 
unaudited consolidated financial statements 
or analyses prepared by the Company from 
which such amounts were derived; or

(2) any unaudited financial statements 
included or incorporated in the Registration 
Statement and the Prospectus do not comply 
as to form in all material respects with 
applicable accounting requirements and with 
the published rules and regulations of the 
Commission with respect to financial 
statements included or incorporated in 
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the 
Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial 
statements are not in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles 
applied on a basis substantially consistent 
with that of the audited financial 
statements included or incorporated in the 
Registration Statement and the Prospectus; or

(3) with respect to the period 
subsequent to the date of the most recent 
financial statements (other than capsule 
information), audited or unaudited, 
incorporated in the Registration Statement 
and the Prospectus, there were any changes, 
at a specified date not more than five 
business days prior to the date of the 
letter, in the long-term debt of the Company 
and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
or capital stock of the Company or decreases 
in the stockholders' equity of the Company 
and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
as compared with the amounts shown on the 
most recent consolidated balance sheet or 
capitalization table included or 
incorporated in the Registration Statement 
and the Prospectus, or for the period from 
the date of the most recent financial 
statements incorporated in the Registration 
Statement and the Prospectus to such 
specified date there were any decreases, as 
compared with the corresponding period in 
the preceding year, in net interest income 
or income before income taxes, or in total 
or per share amounts of net income, of the 
Company and its subsidiaries on a 
consolidated basis, except in all instances 
for changes or decreases that the 
Registration Statement has disclosed have 
occurred or may occur, in which case the 
letter shall be accompanied by an 
explanation by the Company as to the 
significance thereof unless said explanation 
is not deemed necessary by the Agents; or

(4) the amounts included in any 
unaudited "capsule" information included or 
incorporated in the Registration Statement 
and the Prospectus do not agree with the 
amounts set forth in the unaudited financial 
statements for the same periods or were not 
determined on a basis substantially 
consistent with that of the corresponding 
amounts in the audited financial statements 
included or incorporated in the Registration 
Statement and the Prospectus;

(iii) they have performed certain other 
specific procedures as a result of which they 
determined that certain information of an 
accounting, financial or statistical nature 
(which is limited to accounting, financial or 
statistical information derived from the general 
accounting records of the Company) set forth in 
the Registration Statement, as amended, and the 
Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, and in 
Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, the 
information included or incorporated in Items 1 
(Guide 3 Statistical Disclosure), 6 and 7 of the 
Company's annual report on Form 10-K incorporated 
therein, and in "Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
operations" included or incorporated in the 
Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q 
incorporated therein agrees with the accounting 
records of the Company and its subsidiaries on a 
consolidated basis, excluding any questions of 
legal interpretation; and

(iv) if pro forma financial statements are 
included or incorporated in the Registration 
Statement and the Prospectus, on the basis of a 
reading of the unaudited pro forma financial 
statements, carrying out certain specified 
procedures, inquiries of certain officials of the 
Company and the acquired company who have 
responsibility for financial and accounting 
matters, and proving the arithmetic accuracy of 
the application of the pro forma adjustments to 
the historical amounts in the pro forma financial 
statements, nothing came to their attention which 
caused them to believe that the pro forma 
financial statements do not comply in form in all 
material respects with the applicable accounting 
requirements of Rule 11-02 of Regulation S-X or 
that the pro forma adjustments have not been 
properly applied to the historical amounts in the 
compilation of such statements.

References to the Prospectus in this paragraph 
(e) include any supplement thereto at the date of the 
letter.

(f) Prior to the Execution Time, the Company 
shall have furnished to each Agent such further 
information, documents, certificates and opinions of 
counsel as the Agents may reasonably request.

The documents required to be delivered by this Section 5 
shall be delivered at the office of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, 
counsel for the Agents, at Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, 
New York, New York, on the date hereof.

6. Conditions to the Obligations of the Purchaser. The 
obligations of the Purchaser to purchase any Notes will be 
subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties 
on the part of the Company herein as of the date of the related

the performance and observance by the Company of all covenants 
and agreements herein contained on its part to be performed and

of the Registration Statement shall have been issued

the Company and the Purchaser in a Terms Agreement, 
the Purchaser shall have received, appropriately 
updated, (i) a certificate of the Company, dated as of

5(d) (except that references to the Prospectus shall 
be to the Prospectus as supplemented as of the date of 
such Terms Agreement), (ii) the opinion of Edwards & 
Angell, counsel for the Company, dated as of the 
Closing Date, to the effect set forth in Section 5(b), 
(iii) the opinion of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, counsel

effect set forth in Section 5(e).

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall 
have furnished to the Purchaser such further 
information, certificates and documents as the 
Purchaser may reasonably request.

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall 
not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as 
provided in this Agreement and an applicable Terms Agreement, 
or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or 
elsewhere in this Agreement or such Terms Agreement and 
required to be delivered to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms 
hereof and thereof shall not be in all material respects 
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Purchaser 
and its counsel, such Terms Agreement and all obligations of 
the Purchaser thereunder and with respect to the Notes subject 
there to may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the 
respective Closing Date by the Purchaser. Notice of such 
cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by 
telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.

7. Right of Person Who Agreed to Purchase to Refuse to 
Purchase. (a) The Company agrees that any person who has agreed 
to purchase and pay for any Note, including a Purchaser and any 
person who purchases pursuant to a solicitation by any of the 
Agents, shall have the right to refuse to purchase such Note if 
(i) at the Closing Date therefor, any condition set forth in 
Section 5 (except that references to the Prospectus shall be to 
the Prospectus as supplemented at the Closing Date) or 6, as 
applicable, shall not be satisfied, (ii) subsequent to the 
agreement to purchase such Note, any change, or any development 
with respect to the Company involving a prospective change, in 
or affecting the business or properties of the Company and its 
subsidiaries shall have occurred the effect of which is, in the 
judgment of the Purchaser or the Agent which presented the 
offer to purchase such Note, as applicable, so material and 
adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed 
with the delivery of such Note or (iii) subsequent to the 
agreement to purchase such Note, (w) there shall have been any 
decrease in the ratings of any of the Company's debt securities 
by Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poor's Corporation 
(each a "Rating Agency") or any such Rating Agency shall 
publicly announce that it has placed any of such debt 
securities on a "watchlist" with negative implications, (x) 
trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended 
by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in 
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have 
been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been 
established on such Exchange, (y) a banking moratorium shall 
have been declared either by Federal, Rhode Island or New York 
State authorities, or (z) there shall have occurred any 
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other calamity or 
crisis the effect of which on the financial markets or the 
United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the 
Purchaser or the Agent which presented the offer to purchase 
such Note, as applicable, impracticable to market such Notes 
(it being understood that under no circumstance shall any Agent 
have any duty or obligation to exercise any judgment permitted 
to be exercised pursuant to this Section 7(a)).

(b The Company further agrees to notify each Agent upon 
the occurrence of any change, condition or development 
contemplated by Section 7(a)(ii) or (iii).

8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company 
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of you and each 
person who controls each of you within the meaning of either 
the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, 
damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which you, they or 
any of you or them may become subject under the Act, the 
Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or 
regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, 
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) 
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged 
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the 
registration statement for the registration of the Securities 
as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the 
Prospectus or any preliminary Prospectus, or in any amendment 
thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based 
upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a 
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to 
make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to 
reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any 
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in 
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, 
claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) 
the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent 
that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or 
is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue 
statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in 
reliance upon and in conformity with written information 
furnished to the Company by any of you specifically for use in 
connection with the preparation thereof, and (ii) such 
indemnity with respect to the Prospectus or any preliminary 
Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any of you (or any 
person controlling any of you) from whom the person asserting 
any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Notes 
which are the subject thereof if such person did not receive a 
copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as supplemented) 
excluding documents incorporated therein by reference at or 
prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Notes to such 
person in any case where such delivery is required by the Act 
and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact 
contained in the Prospectus or any preliminary Prospectus was 
corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as 
supplemented). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to 
any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

(b) Each of you agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the 
Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs 
the Registration Statement and each person who controls the 
Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange 
Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the 
Company to you, but only with reference to written information 
relating to such of you furnished to the Company by such of you 
specifically for use in the preparation of the documents 
referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity 
agreement will be in addition to any liability which you may 
otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements 
set forth in the last sentence of the tenth paragraph under the 
heading "Plan of Distribution" of the Prospectus Supplement 
relating to purchases and sales of Notes in the secondary 
market constitute the only information furnished in writing by 
any of you for inclusion in the documents referred to in the 
foregoing indemnity, and you confirm that such statements are 
correct.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under 
this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, 
such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is 
to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, 
notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement 
thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party 
will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any 
indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. In case 
any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and 
it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, 
the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, 
and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered 
to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid 
notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense 
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; 
provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action 
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party 
and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that 
there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other 
indemnified parties which are different from or additional to 
those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified 
party or parties shall have the right to select separate 
counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise 
participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such 
indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the 
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so 
to assume the defense of such action and approval by the 
indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not 
be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for 
any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such 
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless 
(i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel 
in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in 
accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it 
being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall 
not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate 
counsel (plus any local counsel), approved by you in the case 
of paragraph (a) of this Section 8, representing the 
indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to 
such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have 
employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to 
represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after 
notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying 
party has authorized the employment of counsel for the 
indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and 
except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such 
liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to 
in such clause (i) or (iii).

(d) In order to provide for just and equitable 
contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification 
provided for in paragraph (a) of this Section 8 is due in 
accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court 
to be unavailable from the Company on grounds of policy or 
otherwise, the Company and each of you shall contribute to the 
aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including 
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with 
investigating or defending same) to which the Company and any 
of you may be subject in such proportion so that each of you is 
responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that 
the aggregate commissions received by such of you pursuant to 
Section 2 in connection with the Notes from which such losses, 
claims, damages and liabilities arise (or, in the case of Notes 
sold pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the aggregate commissions 
that would have been received by such of you if such 
commissions had been payable), bears to the aggregate principal 
amount of such Notes sold and the Company is responsible for 
the balance; provided, however, that (y) in no case shall any 
of you be responsible for any amount in excess of the 
commissions received by such of you in connection with the 
Notes from which such losses, claims, damages and liabilities 
arise (or, in the case of Notes sold pursuant to a Terms 
Agreement, the aggregate commissions that would have been 
received by such of you if such commissions had been payable) 
and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation 
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be 
entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of 
such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this 
Section 8, each person who controls any of you within the

as you and each person who controls the Company within the 
meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of

Agreement (including without limitation Section 7 hereof) 
applicable to any purchase of a Note for which an agreement to

Fleet Financial Group, Inc.

Medium-Term Note Administrative Procedures
November 23, 1994

The Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series H and Subordinated 
Medium-Term Notes, Series I (respectively, the "Senior Notes" 
and the "Subordinated Notes"), Due Nine Months or More from 
Date of Issue (collectively, the "Notes") of Fleet Financial 
Group, Inc. (the "Company"), are to be offered on a continuing 
basis. Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill 
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan 
Securities Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc, as agents (each an 
"Agent"), have agreed to solicit purchases of Notes issued in 
fully registered form. In addition, Fleet Bank of 
Massachusetts, National Association, will be acting as an agent 
pursuant to a distribution agreement dated as of the date 
hereof. The Agents will not be obligated to purchase Notes for 
their own account, unless otherwise agreed. The Notes are 
being sold pursuant to a selling agency agreement between the 
Company and the Agents dated the date hereof (the "Agency 
Agreement"). The Senior Notes will be issued under an 
indenture dated as of October 1, 1992, between the Company and 
The First National Bank of Chicago (the "Senior Trustee" or 
"First Chicago"), as trustee (the "Senior Indenture"). The 
Subordinated Notes will be issued under an indenture dated as 
of October 1, 1992, between the Company and First Chicago (the 
"Subordinated Trustee" and collectively with the Senior 
Trustee, the "Trustee") as trustee, as supplemented by a first 
supplemental indenture dated as of November 30, 1992, between 
the Company and the Subordinated Trustee (as so supplemented, 
the "Subordinated Indenture" and collectively with the Senior 
Indenture, the "Indentures"). The Senior Notes will rank 
equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of the 
Company. The Subordinated Notes will be subordinate and junior 
in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness and Other 
Financial Obligations of the Company, to the extent and in the 
manner set forth in the Subordinated Indenture. The Notes have 
been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the "Commission").

The Agency Agreement provides that Notes may also be 
purchased by an Agent acting solely as principal and not as 
agent. In the event of any such purchase, the functions of 
both the Agent and the beneficial owner under the 
administrative procedures set forth below shall be performed by 
such Agent acting solely as principal, unless otherwise agreed 
to between the Company and such Agent acting as principal.

Each Note will be represented by either a Global Security 
(as defined hereinafter) delivered to the Trustee, as agent for 
The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), and recorded in the 
book-entry system maintained by DTC (a "Book-Entry Note") or a 
certificate delivered to the Holder thereof or a Person 
designated by such Holder (a "Certificated Note"). An owner of 
a Book-Entry Note will not be entitled to receive a certificate 
representing such Note.

The procedures to be followed during, and the specific 
terms of, the solicitation of orders by the Agents and the sale 
as a result thereof by the Company are explained below. 
Administrative and record-keeping responsibilities will be 
handled for the Company by its Treasury Department. The 
Company will advise the Agents and the Trustee in writing of 
those persons handling administrative responsibilities with 
whom the Agents and the Trustee are to communicate regarding 
orders to purchase Notes and the details of their delivery.

Administrative procedures and specific terms of the 
offering are explained below. Book-Entry Notes will be issued 
in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth in 
Part I hereof, as adjusted in accordance with changes in DTC's 
operating requirements, and Certificated Notes will be issued 
in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth in 
Part II hereof. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined 
in the applicable Indenture and the Notes shall be used herein 
as therein defined. Notes for which interest is calculated on 
the basis of a fixed interest rate, which may be zero, are 
referred to herein as "Fixed Rate Notes". Notes for which 
interest is calculated on the basis of a floating interest rate 
are referred to herein as "Floating Rate Notes". To the extent 
the procedures set forth below conflict with the provisions of 
the Notes, the applicable Indenture, DTC's operating 
requirements or the Agency Agreement, the relevant provisions 
of the Notes, the applicable Indenture, DTC's operating 
requirements and the Agency Agreement shall control.

PART I

Administrative Procedures for
Book-Entry Notes

In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry 
Notes for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by 
DTC, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control 
and administrative functions described below, in accordance 
with its respective obligations under a Letter of 
Representations from the Company and the Trustee to DTC dated 
as of the date hereof and a Medium-Term Note Certificate 
Agreement between the Trustee and DTC dated as of May 26, 1989, 
and its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's 
Same-Day Funds Settlement system ("SDFS").

Issuance: On any date of settlement (as defined under 
"Settlement" below) for one or more 
Book-Entry Notes, the Company will issue a 
single global security in fully registered 
form without coupons (a "Global Security") 
representing up to $150,000,000 principal 
amount of all such Book-Entry Notes that 
have the same rank (senior or subordinated), 
original issue date, original issue discount 
provisions, if any, Interest Payment Dates, 
Regular Record Dates, Interest Payment 
Period, redemption provisions, if any, 
Maturity Date, and, in the case of Fixed 
Rate Notes, interest rate, or, in the case 
of Floating Rate Notes, initial interest 
rate, Base Rate, Index Maturity, Interest 
Reset Period, Interest Reset Dates, Spread 
and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, minimum 
interest rate, if any, and maximum interest 
rate, if any (collectively, the "Terms"). 
Each Global Security will be dated and 
issued as of the date of its authentication 
by the Trustee. Each Global Security will 
bear an original issue date, which will be 
(i) with respect to an original Global 
Security (or any portion thereof), the 
original issue date specified in such Global 
Security and (ii) following a consolidation 
of Global Securities, with respect to the 
Global Security resulting from such 
consolidation, the most recent Interest 
Payment Date to which interest has been paid 
or duly provided for on the predecessor 
Global Securities, regardless of the date of 
authentication of such resulting Global 
Security. No Global Security will represent 
(i) both Fixed Rate and Floating Rate 
Book-Entry Notes or (ii) any Certificated 
Note.

Identification The Company has arranged with the CUSIP 
Numbers: Service Bureau of Standard & Poor's 
Corporation (the "CUSIP Service Bureau") for 
the reservation of two series of CUSIP 
numbers, each of which consists of 
approximately 900 CUSIP numbers and relates 
to Global Securities representing Book-Entry 
Notes and book-entry medium-term notes 
issued by the Company with other series 
designations. The Company has obtained from 
the CUSIP Service Bureau a written list of 
such reserved CUSIP numbers, which the 
Company shall deliver to the Trustee and 
DTC. The Company will assign CUSIP numbers 
to Global Securities as described below 
under Settlement Procedure "B". DTC will 
notify the CUSIP Service Bureau periodically 
of the CUSIP numbers that the Company has 
assigned to Global Securities. At any time 
when fewer than 100 of the reserved CUSIP 
numbers remain unassigned to Global 
Securities for either series, if it deems 
necessary, the Company will reserve 
additional CUSIP numbers for assignment to 
Global Securities. Upon obtaining such 
additional CUSIP numbers, the Company shall 
deliver a list of such additional CUSIP 
numbers to the Trustee and DTC.

Registration: Global Securities will be issued only in 
fully registered form without coupons. Each 
Global Security will be registered in the 
name of CEDE & CO., as nominee for DTC, on 
the securities register for the Notes 
maintained under the applicable Indenture. 
The beneficial owner of a Book-Entry Note 
(or one or more indirect participants in DTC 
designated by such owner) will designate one 
or more participants in DTC (with respect to 
such Book-Entry Note, the "Participants") to 
act as agent or agents for such owner in 
connection with the book-entry system 
maintained by DTC, and DTC will record in 
book-entry form, in accordance with 
instructions provided by such Participants, 
a credit balance with respect to such 
beneficial owner in such Book-Entry Note in 
the account of such Participants. The 
ownership interest of such beneficial owner 
(or such participant) in such Book-Entry 
Note will be recorded through the records of 
such Participants or through the separate 
records of such Participants and one or more 
indirect participants in DTC.

Transfers: Transfers of a Book-Entry Note will be 
accomplished by book entries made by DTC 
and, in turn, by Participants (and, in 
certain cases, one or more indirect 
participants in DTC) acting on behalf of 
beneficial transferors and transferees of 
such Note.

Exchanges: The Trustee may deliver to DTC and the CUSIP 
Service Bureau at any time a written notice 
of consolidation (a copy of which shall be 
attached to the resulting Global Security 
described below) specifying (i) the CUSIP 
numbers of two or more Outstanding Global 
Securities that represent (A) Fixed Rate 
Book-Entry Notes having the same Terms and 
for which interest has been paid to the same 
date or (B) Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes 
having the same Terms and for which interest 
has been paid to the same date, (ii) a date, 
occurring at least thirty days after such 
written notice is delivered and at least 
thirty days before the next Interest Payment 
Date for such Book-Entry Notes, on which 
such Global Securities shall be exchanged 
for a single replacement Global Security and 
(iii) the single CUSIP number to be assigned 
to such replacement Global Security (which 
shall be the CUSIP number previously 
assigned to the Global Security with the 
earliest date of issuance). Upon receipt of 
such a notice, DTC will send to its 
participants (including the Trustee) a 
written reorganization notice to the effect 
that such exchange will occur on such date. 
Prior to the specified exchange date, the 
Trustee will deliver to the CUSIP Service 
Bureau a written notice setting forth such 
exchange date and such single CUSIP number 
and stating that, as of such exchange date, 
the CUSIP numbers of the individual Global 
Securities not assigned to the replacement 
Global Security will no longer be valid. On 
the specified exchange date, the Trustee 
will exchange such Global Securities for a 
single Global Security bearing the single 
CUSIP number and the CUSIP numbers of the 
individual Global Securities not assigned 
will, in accordance with CUSIP Service 
Bureau procedures, be retired and not 
reassigned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
if the Global Securities to be exchanged 
exceed $150,000,000 in aggregate principal 
amount, one Global Security will be 
authenticated and is sued to represent each 
$150,000,000 of principal amount of the 
exchanged Global Securities and an 
additional Global Security will be 
authenticated and issued to represent any 
remaining principal amount of such Global 
Securities (see "Denominations" below).

Maturities: Each Book-Entry Note will mature on a date 
not less than nine months nor more than 
thirty years after the settlement date for 
such Note.

Denominations: Book-Entry Notes will be issued in principal 
amounts of $1,000 or any integral multiple 
thereof. Global Securities will be 
denominated in principal amounts not in 
excess of $150,000,000. If one or more 
Book-Entry Notes having an aggregate 
principal amount in excess of $150,000,000 
would, but for the preceding sentence, be 
represented by a single Global Security, 
then one Global Security will be 
authenticated and issued to represent each 
$150,000,000 principal amount of such 
Book-Entry Note or Notes and an additional 
Global Security will be authenticated and 
issued to represent any remaining principal 
amount of such Book-Entry Note or Notes. In 
such a case, each of the Global Securities 
representing such Book-Entry Note or Notes 
shall be assigned the same CUSIP number.

Interest: General. Interest, if any, on each 
Book-Entry Note will accrue from the 
original issue date for the first interest 
period or the last date to which interest 
has been paid, if any, for each subsequent 
interest period, on the Global Security 
representing such Book-Entry Note, and will 
be calculated and paid in the manner 
described in such Book-Entry Note and in the 
Prospectus (as defined in the Agency 
Agreement), as supplemented by the 
applicable Pricing Supplement. Unless 
otherwise specified therein, each payment of 
interest on a Book-Entry Note will include 
interest accrued to but excluding the 
Interest Payment Date or to but excluding 
Maturity. Interest payable at the Maturity 
of a Book-Entry Note will be payable to the 
Person to whom the principal of such Note is 
payable. Standard & Poor's Corporation will 
use the information received in the pending 
deposit message described under Settlement 
Procedure "C" below in order to include the 
amount of any interest payable and certain 
other information regarding the related 
Global Security in the appropriate (daily or 
weekly) bond report published by Standard & 
Poor's Corporation.

Regular Record Dates. The Regular Record 
Date with respect to any Interest Payment 
Date for Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes 
shall be the date fifteen calendar days 
immediately preceding such Interest Payment 
Date, and for Fixed Rate Book-Entry Notes 
shall be the April 15 or October 15 next 
preceding such Interest Payment Date, 
whether or not such date shall be a Business 
Day.

Interest Payment Dates on Fixed Rate 
Book-Entry Notes. Interest payments on 
Fixed Rate Book-Entry Notes will be made 
semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each 
year and at Maturity; provided, however, 
that in the case of a Fixed Rate Book-Entry 
Note issued between a Regular Record Date 
and an Interest Payment Date, or on an 
Interest Payment Date, the first interest 
payment will be made on the Interest Payment 
Date following the next succeeding Regular 
Record Date. If any Interest Payment Date 
for a Fixed Rate Book-Entry Note is not a 
Business Day, the payment due on such day 
shall be made on the next succeeding 
Business Day and no interest shall accrue on 
such payment for the period from and after 
such Interest Payment Date.

Interest Payment Dates on Floating Rate 
Book-Entry Notes. Interest payments will be 
made on Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes 
monthly, quarterly, semiannually or 
annually. Unless otherwise agreed upon, 
interest will be payable, in the case of 
Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes with a 
monthly Interest Payment Period, on the 
third Wednesday of each month; with a 
quarterly Interest Payment Period, on the 
third Wednesday of March, June, September 
and December of each year; with a semiannual 
Interest Payment Period, on the third 
Wednesday of the two months specified 
pursuant to Settlement Procedure "A" below; 
and with an annual Interest Payment Period, 
on the third Wednesday of the month 
specified pursuant to Settlement Procedure 
"A" below; provided, however, that if an 
Interest Payment Date for a Floating Rate 
Book-Entry Note would otherwise be a day 
that is not a Business Day with respect to 
such Floating Rate Book-Entry Note, such 
Interest Payment Date will be the next 
succeeding Business Day with respect to such 
Floating Rate Book-Entry Note, except that 
in the case of a Floating Rate Book-Entry 
Note for which the Base Rate is LIBOR, if 
such Business Day is in the next succeeding 
calendar month, such Interest Payment Date 
will be the immediately preceding Business 
Day; and provided further, that, in the case 
of a Floating Rate Book-Entry Note issued 
between a Regular Record Date and an 
Interest Payment Date or on an Interest 
Payment Date, the first interest payment 
will be made on the Interest Payment Date 
following the next succeeding Regular Record 
Date.

Notice of Floating Rate Interest Rates. 
Promptly after each Interest Determination 
Date for Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes, the 
Calculation Agent will notify the Trustee 
and Standard & Poor's Corporation of the 
interest rates determined on such Interest 
Determination Date.

Calculation of Fixed Rate Book-Entry Notes. Interest
Interest: on Fixed Rate Book-Entry Notes (including 
interest for partial periods) will be 
calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of 
twelve 30-day months.

Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes. Interest 
rates on Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes will 
be determined as set forth in the form of 
Notes. Interest on Floating Rate Book-Entry 
Notes, except as otherwise set forth 
therein, will be calculated on the basis of 
actual days elapsed and a year of 360 days, 
except that in the case of a Floating Rate 
Book-Entry Note for which the Base Rate is 
the Treasury Rate, interest will be 
calculated on the basis of the actual number 
of days in the year.

Payments of Payment of Interest Only. Promptly 
Principal and after each Regular Record Date,
Interest: provided, with respect to Floating Rate 
Notes, that the Calculation Agent has 
provided the Trustee with the necessary 
information regarding interest rates, the 
Trustee will deliver to the Company and DTC 
a written notice setting forth, by CUSIP 
number, the amount of interest to be paid on 
each Global Security on the following 
Interest Payment Date (other than an 
Interest Payment Date coinciding with 
Maturity) and the total of such amounts. 
DTC will confirm the amount payable on each 
Global Security on such Interest Payment 
Date by reference to the appropriate (daily 
or weekly) bond reports published by 
Standard & Poor's Corporation. The Company 
will pay to the Trustee, as paying agent, 
the total amount of interest due on such 
Interest Payment Date (other than at 
Maturity), and the Trustee will pay such 
amount to DTC, at the times and in the 
manner set forth below under "Manner of 
Payment".

Payments at Maturity. On or about the last 
Business Day of each month, the Trustee will 
deliver to the Company and DTC a written 
list of principal and interest to be paid on 
each Global Security maturing (on a Maturity 
or Redemption Date or otherwise) in the 
following month. The Trustee, the Company 
and DTC will confirm the amounts of such 
principal and interest payments with respect 
to each such Global Security on or about the 
fifth Business Day preceding the Maturity of 
such Global Security. On or before 
Maturity, the Company will pay to the 
Trustee, as paying agent, the principal 
amount of such Global Security, together 
with interest due at such Maturity. The 
Trustee will pay such amount to DTC at the 
times and in the manner set forth below 
under "Manner of Payment". If any Maturity 
of a Global Security representing Book-Entry 
Notes is not a Business Day, the payment due 
on such day shall be made on the next 
succeeding Business Day and no interest 
shall accrue on such payment for the period 
from and after such Maturity. Promptly 
after payment to DTC of the principal and 
interest due at Maturity of such Global 
Security, the Trustee will cancel such 
Global Security in accordance with the 
applicable Indenture and so advise the 
Company. On the first Business Day of each 
month, the Trustee will deliver to the 
Company a written statement indicating the 
total principal amount of Outstanding Global 
Securities as of the immediately preceding 
Business Day.

Manner of Payment. The total amount of any 
principal and interest due on Global 
Securities on any Interest Payment Date or 
at Maturity shall be paid by the Company to 
the Trustee in immediately available funds 
no later than 9:30 A.M. (New York City time) 
on such date. The Company will make such 
payment on such Global Securities by 
instructing the Trustee to withdraw funds 
from an account maintained by the Company at 
First Chicago or by wire transfer of funds 
available for immediate use to the Trustee. 
The Company will confirm any such 
instructions in writing to the Trustee. 
Prior to 10 A.M. (New York City time) on the 
date of Maturity or as soon as possible 
thereafter, the Trustee will pay by separate 
wire transfer (using Fedwire message entry 
instructions in a form previously specified 
by DTC) to an account at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York previously specified by 
DTC, in funds available for immediate use by 
DTC, each payment of principal (together 
with interest thereon) due on a Global 
Security on such date. On each Interest 
Payment Date (other than at Maturity), 
interest payments shall be made to DTC, in 
funds available for immediate use by DTC, in 
accordance with existing arrangements 
between the Trustee and DTC. On each such 
date, DTC will pay, in accordance with its 
SDFS operating procedures then in effect, 
such amounts in funds available for 
immediate use to the respective Participants 
in whose names the Book-Entry Notes 
represented by such Global Securities are 
recorded in the book-entry system maintained 
by DTC. Neither the Company (as issuer or 
as paying agent) nor the Trustee shall have 
any direct responsibility or liability for 
the payment by DTC to such Participants of 
the principal of and interest on the 
Book-Entry Notes.

Withholding Taxes. The amount of any taxes 
required under applicable law to be withheld 
from any interest payment on a Book-Entry 
Note will be determined and withheld by the 
Participant, indirect participant in DTC or 
other Person responsible for forwarding 
payments and materials directly to the 
beneficial owner of such Note.

Procedure for The Company and the Agents will discuss
Rate Setting and from time to time the aggregate principal
Posting: amount of, the issuance price of, and the 
interest rates to be borne by, Book-Entry 
Notes that may be sold as a result of the 
solicitation of orders by the Agents. If 
the Company decides to set prices of, and 
rates borne by, any Book-Entry Notes in 
respect of which the Agents are to solicit 
orders (the setting of such prices and rates 
to be referred to herein as "posting") or if 
the Company decides to change prices or 
rates previously posted by it, it will 
promptly advise the Agents of the prices and 
rates to be posted.

Acceptance and Unless otherwise instructed by the
Rejection of Company, each Agent will advise the
Orders: Company promptly by telephone of all orders 
to purchase Book-Entry Notes received by 
such Agent, other than those rejected by it 
in whole or in part in the reasonable 
exercise of its discretion. The Company has 
the right to accept orders to purchase 
Book-Entry Notes and may reject any such 
orders in whole or in part.

Preparation of If any order to purchase a Book-Entry
Pricing Note is accepted by or on behalf of the 
Supplement: Company, the Company will prepare a pricing 
supplement (a "Pricing Supplement") 
reflecting the terms of such Book-Entry Note 
and will arrange to have ten copies thereof 
filed with the Commission in accordance with 
the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) 
under the Act and will supply at least ten 
copies thereof (and additional copies if 
requested) to the Agent which presented the 
order (the "Presenting Agent") at the 
address set forth on Schedule I hereto, to 
be delivered by overnight courier or 
telecopy to arrive no later than 11:00 a.m., 
New York City time, on the Business Day 
following the sale date.

The Presenting Agent will cause a Prospectus 
and Pricing Supplement to be delivered to 
the purchaser of such Book-Entry Note.

In each instance that a Pricing Supplement 
is prepared, the Presenting Agent will affix 
the Pricing Supplement to Prospectuses prior 
to their use. Outdated Pricing Supplements 
(other than those retained for files), will 
be destroyed.

Suspension of The Company may instruct the Agents to 
Solicitation; suspend at any time, for any period of 
Amendment or time or permanently, the solicitation of 
Supplement: orders to purchase Book-Entry Notes. Upon 
receipt of such instructions, the Agents 
will forthwith suspend solicitation until 
such time as the Company has advised them 
that such solicitation may be resumed.

In the event that at the time the Company 
suspends solicitation of purchases there 
shall be any orders outstanding for 
settlement, the Company will promptly advise 
the Agents and the Trustee whether such 
orders may be settled and whether copies of 
the Prospectus as in effect at the time of 
the suspension, together with the 
appropriate Pricing Supplement, may be 
delivered in connection with the settlement 
of such orders. The Company will have the 
sole responsibility for such decision and 
for any arrangements that may be made in the

crediting such Note free to the participant 
account of the Trustee and shall notify the 
Trustee and the Company thereof. 
Thereafter, the Trustee (i) will immediately 
notify the Company thereof, once the Trustee 
has confirmed that such Note has been 
credited to its participant account, and the 
Company shall immediately transfer by 
Fedwire (immediately available funds) to 
such Agent an amount equal to the price of 
such Note which was previously credited to 
the account of the Company maintained at 
First Chicago or wire transferred at the 
Company's direction in accordance with 
Settlement Procedure J and (ii) the Trustee 
will deliver the withdrawal message and take 
the related actions described in the 
preceding paragraph. If such failure shall 
have occurred for any reason other than a 
default by the Presenting Agent in the 
performance of its obligations hereunder and 
under the Agency Agreement, then the Company 
will reimburse the Presenting Agent or the 
Trustee, as applicable, on an equitable 
basis for the loss of the use of the funds

accordance with its SDFS operating 
procedures then in effect. In the event of 
a failure to settle with respect to one or 
more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Notes 
to have been represented by a Global 
Security, the Trustee will provide, in 
accordance with Settlement Procedure "E", 
for the authentication and issuance of a

with any payment to the Company, DTC, the 
Agents or the purchaser, it being understood 
by all parties that payments made by the

DTC, the Agents or the purchaser shall be 
made only to the extent that funds are 
provided to the Trustee or First Chicago for 
such purpose.

the specimen signatures of each of the 
Trustee's officers, employees or agents who 
has been authorized by the Trustee to 
authenticate Book-Entry Notes, but no Agent

to the issue and sale by the Company of up to $1,126,900,000 
aggregate principal amount of its Senior Medium-Term Notes, 
Series H and Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series I 
(respectively, the "Senior Notes" and the "Subordinated 
Notes"), Due Nine Months or More from Date of Issue 
(collectively, the "Notes"). The Senior Notes are to be issued 
under an indenture dated as of October 1, 1992 (the 
"Indenture"), between the Company and The First National Bank 
of Chicago, as trustee (the "Senior Trustee" or "First 
Chicago"). The Subordinated Notes are to be issued under an 
indenture dated as of October 1, 1992, between the Company and 
First Chicago as trustee (the "Subordinated Trustee" and, 
collectively with the Senior Trustee, the "Trustee"), as 
supplemented by a first supplemental indenture dated as of 
November 30, 1992, between the Company and the Subordinated 
Trustee (as so supplemented, the "Subordinated Indenture" and 
collectively with the Senior Indenture, the "Indentures"). The 
Notes to be sold by you will be issued in minimum denominations 
of $150,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an 
integral multiple of $1,000, will be issued only in fully 
registered form and will have the annual interest rates, 
maturities and, if appropriate, other terms set forth in a 
supplement to the Prospectus referred to below. The Notes will 
be issued, and the terms thereof established, in accordance 
with the applicable Indenture and the Medium-Term Notes 
Administrative Procedures attached hereto as Exhibits A and B 
(the "Procedures") . The Procedures may only be amended by 
written agreement of the Company and you after notice to, and 
with the approval of, the Trustee.

1. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents 
and warrants to, and agrees with, you as set forth below in 
this Section 1. Certain terms used in this Section 1 are 
defined in paragraph (d) hereof.

(a) The Company meets the requirements for use of 
Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and has 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
"Commission") a registration statement on such Form (File 
Number: 33-55555), including a basic prospectus, which also 
constitutes pursuant to Rule 429 under the Act Post-Effective 
Amendment 5 No. 1 to registration statements on such Form (File 
Numbers: 33-50214 and 33-50216) and which become effective, for 
the registration under the Act of securities (the 
"Securities"), including the Notes, in an aggregate principal 
amount of $1,126,900,000. Such registration statements, as 
amended at the date of this Agreement, meet the requirements 
set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(ix) or (x) under the Act and comply 
in all other material respects with said Rule. The Company has 
included in such registration statements, as amended at the 
date of this Agreement, or has filed or will file with the 
Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) 
under the Act, a supplement to the form of prospectus included 
in such registration statement relating to the Notes and the 
plan of distribution thereof (the "Prospectus Supplement"). In 
connection with the sale of Notes the Company proposes to file 
with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of 
Rule 424(b) under the Act further supplements to the Prospectus 
Supplement specifying the interest rates, maturity dates and, 
if appropriate, other terms of the Notes sold pursuant hereto 
or the offering thereof.

(b) As of the Execution Time, on the Effective Date, 
when any supplement to the Prospectus is filed with the 
Commission, on each day of an Offering Period (referred to 
below) and at the date of delivery by the Company of any Notes 
sold hereunder (a "Closing Date"), (i) the Registration 
Statement, as amended as of any such time, and the Prospectus, 
as supplemented as of any such time, and each Indenture will 
comply in all material respects with the applicable 
requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the 
"Trust Indenture Act") and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the "Exchange Act") and the respective rules thereunder; (ii) 
the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, did 
not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact 
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated 
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein 
not misleading; and (iii) the Prospectus, as supplemented as of 
any such time, will not contain any untrue statement of a 
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in 
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 
provided, however, that the Company makes no representations or 
warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement 
which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and 
Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the 
Trustee or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from 
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or any supplement 
thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with information 
furnished in writing to the Company by you specifically for 
inclusion in connection with the preparation of the 
Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or any supplement 
thereto).

(c) As of the time any Notes are issued and sold 
hereunder, each Indenture will constitute a legal, valid and 
binding instrument enforceable against the Company in 
accordance with its terms and such Notes will have been duly 
authorized, executed, authenticated and, when paid for by the 
purchasers thereof, will constitute legal, valid and binding 
obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the 
applicable Indenture.

(d) The terms which follow, when used in this 
Agreement, shall have the meanings indicated. The term "the 
Effective Date" shall mean each date that the Registration 
Statement and any post-effective amendment or amendments 
thereto became or become effective. "Execution Time" shall 
mean the date and time that this Agreement is executed and 
delivered by the parties hereto. "Basic Prospectus" shall mean 
the form of basic prospectus relating to the Securities 
contained in the Registration Statement at the Effective Date. 
"Prospectus" shall mean the Basic Prospectus as supplemented by 
the Prospectus Supplement. "Registration Statement" shall mean 
the registration statements referred to in paragraph (a) above, 
including incorporated documents, exhibits and financial 
statements, as amended at the Execution Time. "Rule 415" and 
"Rule 424" refer to such rules under the Act. Any reference 
herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the 
Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to 
refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference 
therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under 
the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the 
Registration Statement or the issue date of the Basic 
Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus, as the 
case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend", 
"amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration 
Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or 
the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the 
filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the 
Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date 
of the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the 
Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated 
therein by reference.

2. Appointment of Agent; Solicitation by the Agent of 
Offers to Purchase. Subject to the terms and conditions set 
forth herein, the Company hereby authorizes the Agent to act as 
its agent to solicit offers for the purchase of all or part of 
the Notes from the Company. The Company shall notify the Agent 
from time to time as to the commencement of a period during 
which the Notes may be offered and sold by the Agent (each 
period, commencing with such notification and ending at such 
time as the authorization for offers and sales through the 
Agent shall have been suspended by the Company or the Agent as 
provided hereunder, being referred to as an "Offering Period").

On the basis of the representations and warranties, and 
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Agent 
agrees, solely as agent of the Company, to use its reasonable 
efforts to solicit offers to purchase the Notes during each 
Offering Period from the Company upon the terms and conditions 
set forth in the Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) and in 
the Procedures. Under no circumstances will the Agent be 
obligated to purchase any Notes for its own account.

The Company shall have the sole right to accept offers to 
purchase the Notes and may reject any such offer in whole or in 
part. The Agent shall have the right to reject, in its 
discretion reasonably exercised, any offer received by it to 
purchase the Notes in whole or in part, and any such rejection 
shall not be deemed a breach of its agreements contained herein.

The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to 
instruct the Agent to suspend at any time, for any period of 
time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase the 
Notes. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the 
Agent will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to purchase 
Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has 
advised them that such solicitation may be resumed.

The Company agrees to pay the Agent a commission, on the 
Closing Date with respect to each sale of Notes by the Company 
as a result of a solicitation made by the Agent, in an amount 
equal to that percentage specified in Schedule I hereto of the 
aggregate principal amount of the Notes sold by the Company. 
Such commission shall be payable as specified in the Procedures.

Subject to the provisions of this Section and to the 
Procedures, offers for the purchase of Notes may be solicited 
by the Agent for the Company at such time and in such amounts 
as the Agent deems advisable. The Company may from time to 
time offer Notes for sale otherwise than through the Agent; 
provided, however, that so long as this Agreement shall be in 
effect, the Company shall not solicit or accept offers to 
purchase Notes through the agent other than the Agent, an 
affiliate of the Company, or any of Salomon Brothers Inc, 
Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith 
Incorporated, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities 
Inc., which have entered into a Selling Distribution Agreement 
with the Company providing for the sale of Notes on terms and 
conditions substantially similar to those contained herein, 
unless such solicitation or acceptance is on terms with respect 
to commissions substantially similar to those set forth in 
Schedule I hereto and the Company shall give the Agent 
reasonable notice of the appointment of such agent for the 
purpose of soliciting the Notes.

3. Offering and Sale of Notes. The Agent and the Company 
agree to perform the respective duties and obligations 
specifically provided to be performed by them in the Procedures.

4. Agreements. The Company agrees with you that:

(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the 
Notes, the Company will not file any amendment of the 
Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus (except 
for (i) periodic or current reports filed under the Exchange 
Act, (ii) a supplement relating to any offering of Notes 
providing solely for the specification of or a change in the 
maturity dates, interest rates, issuance prices or other terms 
of any Notes or (iii) a supplement relating to an offering of 
Securities other than the Notes) unless the Company has 
furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and given 
you a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed 
amendment or supplement. Subject to the foregoing sentence, 
the Company will cause each supplement to the Prospectus to be 
filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph 
of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will 
provide evidence satisfactory to you of such filing. The 
Company will promptly advise you (i) when the Prospectus, and 
any supplement thereto, shall have been filed with the 
Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (ii) when, prior to the 
termination of the offering of the Notes, any amendment of the 
Registration Statement shall have been filed or become 
effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any 
amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the 
Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the 
issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the 
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution 
or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of 
the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to 
the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in 
any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any 
proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best 
efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if 
issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.

(b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the 
Notes is required to be delivered under the Act, any event 
occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then supplemented 
would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit 
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements 
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they 
were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend 
the Registration Statement or to supplement the Prospectus to 
comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules 
thereunder, the Company promptly will (i) notify you to suspend 
solicitation of offers to purchase Notes (and, if so notified 
by the Company, you shall forthwith suspend such solicitation 
and cease using the Prospectus as then supplemented), (ii) 
prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first 
sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or 
supplement which will correct such statement or omission or 
effect such compliance and (iii) supply any supplemented 
Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably 
request. If such amendment or supplement, and any documents, 
certificates and opinions furnished to you pursuant to 
paragraph (g) of this Section 4 in connection with the 
preparation or filing of such amendment or supplement are 
satisfactory in all respects to you, you will, upon the filing 
of such amendment or supplement with the Commission and upon 
the effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration 
Statement, if such an amendment is required, resume your 
obligation to solicit offers to purchase Notes hereunder.

(c) The Company, during the period when a prospectus 
relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the 
Act, will file promptly all documents required to be filed with 
the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act and will furnish to you copies of such 
documents. In addition, on the date on which the Company makes 
any announcement to the general public concerning earnings or 
concerning any other event which is required to be described, 
or which the Company proposes to describe, in a document filed 
pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Company will furnish to you 
the information contained or to be contained in such 
announcement. The Company also will furnish to you copies of 
all other press releases or announcements to the general public 
of a financial nature. The Company will immediately notify you 
of (i) any downgrading in the rating of the Notes or any other 
debt securities of the Company, or the announcement that the 
Notes or any other debt securities of the Company have been 
placed on a "watchlist" with negative implications, by any 
"nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as 
defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or (ii) any 
notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such 
rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not 
indicate the direction of the possible change, as soon as the 
Company learns of any such decrease or notice, as soon as the 
Company learns of any such downgrading or announcement.

(d) As soon as practicable, the Company will make 
generally available to its security holders and to you an 
earnings statement or statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) 
of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.

(e) The Company will furnish to you and your counsel, 
without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including 
exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus may 
be required by the Act, as many copies of the Prospectus and 
any supplement thereto as you may reasonably request.

(f) The Company will arrange for the qualification of 
the Notes for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as you 
may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so 
long as required for the distribution of the Notes, and will 
arrange for the determination of the legality of the Notes for 
purchase by institutional investors.

(g) The Company shall furnish to you such 
information, documents, certificates of officers of the Company 
and opinions of counsel for the Company relating to the 
business, operations and affairs of the Company, the 
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, and any amendments 
thereof or supplements thereto, the Indentures, the Notes, this 
Agreement, the Procedures and the performance by the Company 
and you of its and your respective obligations hereunder and 
thereunder as you may from time to time and at any time prior 
to the termination of this Agreement reasonably request.

(h) The Company shall, whether or not any sale of the 
Notes is consummated, (i) pay all expenses incident to the 
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including 
the fees and disbursements of its accountants and counsel, the 
cost of printing or other production and delivery of the 
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, all amendments thereof 
and supplements thereto, each Indenture, this Agreement and all 
other documents relating to the offering, the cost of 
preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Notes, the 
fees and disbursements, including fees of counsel, incurred in 
compliance with Section 4(f), the fees and disbursements of the 
Trustee and the fees of any agency that rates the Notes, (ii) 
reimburse you on a monthly basis for all out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred by you in connection with this Agreement and (iii) pay 
the reasonable fees and expenses of your counsel incurred in 
connection with this Agreement.

(i) Each acceptance by the Company of an offer to 
purchase Notes will be deemed to be an affirmation that its 
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are 
true and correct at the time of such acceptance, as though made 
at and as of such time, and a covenant that such 
representations and warranties will be true and correct at the 
time of delivery to the purchaser of the Notes relating to such 
acceptance, as though made at and as of such time (it being 
understood that for purposes of the foregoing affirmation and 
covenant such representations and warranties shall relate to 
the Registration Statement and Prospectus as amended or 
supplemented at each such time). Each such acceptance by the 
Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes shall be deemed 
to constitute an additional representation, warranty and 
agreement by the Company that, as of the settlement date for 
the sale of such Notes, after giving effect to the issuance of 
such Notes, of any other Notes to be issued on or prior to such 
settlement date and of any other Securities to be issued and 
sold by the Company on or prior to such settlement date, the 
aggregate amount of Securities (including any Notes) which have 
been issued and sold by the Company will not exceed the amount 
of Securities registered pursuant to the Registration Statement.

(j) Prior to the commencement of the first Offering 
Period subsequent to each time, and subsequent to each time 
during any Offering Period, that the Registration Statement or 
the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by an 
amendment or supplement relating to any offering of Securities 
other than the Notes or providing solely for the specification 
of or a change in the maturity dates, the interest rates, the 
issuance prices or other similar terms of any Notes sold 
pursuant hereto), the Company will deliver or cause to be 
delivered promptly to you a certificate of the Company, signed 
by the Chairman of the Board, or the President, or any 
Executive Vice President and the principal financial or 
accounting officer or Treasurer of the Company, dated the date 
of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of the 
filing of such supplement, in form reasonably satisfactory to 
you, of the same tenor as the certificate referred to in 
Section 5(d) but modified to relate to the last day of the 
fiscal quarter for which financial statements of the Company 
were last filed with the Commission and to the Registration 
Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the 
time of the effectiveness of such amendment or the filing of 
such supplement.

(k) Prior to the commencement of the first Offering 
Period subsequent to each time, and subsequent to each time 
during any Offering Period, each time that the Registration 
Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other 
than by an amendment or supplement (i) relating to any offering 
of Securities other than the Notes, (ii) providing solely for 
the specification of or a change in the maturity dates, the 
interest rates, the issuance prices or other similar terms of 
any Notes sold pursuant hereto or (iii) setting forth or 
incorporating by reference financial statements or other 
information as of and for a fiscal quarter, unless, in the case 
of clause (iii) above, in your reasonable judgment, such 
financial statements or other information are of such a nature 
that an opinion of counsel should be furnished), the Company 
shall furnish or cause to be furnished promptly to you a 
written opinion of counsel of the Company satisfactory to you, 
dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment or the 
date of the filing of such supplement, in form satisfactory to 
you, of the same tenor as the opinion referred to in Section 
5(b) but modified to relate to the Registration Statement and 
the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of the 
effectiveness of such amendment or the filing of such 
supplement or, in lieu of such opinion, counsel last furnishing 
such an opinion to you may furnish you with a letter to the 
effect that you may rely on such last opinion to the same 
extent as though it were dated the date of such letter 
authorizing reliance (except that statements in such last 
opinion will be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement 
and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of 
the effectiveness of such amendment or the filing of such 
supplement).

(l) Prior to the commencement of the first Offering 
Period subsequent to each time that the Registration Statement 
or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented to include or 
incorporate amended or supplemental financial information, and 
each time during any Offering Period that the Registration 
Statement or Prospectus is so amended or supplemented, the 
Company shall cause its independent public accountants promptly 
to furnish you a letter, dated the date of the commencement of 
such Offering Period or the date of the effectiveness of such 
amendment or the date of the filing of such supplement, as the 
case may be, in form satisfactory to you, of the same tenor as 
the letter referred to in Section 5(e) with such changes as may 
be necessary to reflect the amended and supplemental financial 
information included or incorporated by reference in the 
Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as amended or 
supplemented to the date of such letter; provided, that in no 
event will the Company accept any offer to purchase Notes 
unless such letter shall have been delivered; provided, 
further, that, if the Registration Statement or the Prospectus 
is amended or supplemented solely to include or incorporate by 
reference financial information as of and for a fiscal quarter, 
the Company's independent public accountants may limit the 
scope of such letter, which shall be satisfactory in form to 
you, to the unaudited financial statements, the related 
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations" and any other information of an 
accounting, financial or statistical nature included in such 
amendment or supplement, unless, in your reasonable judgment, 
such letter should cover other information or changes in 
specified financial statement line items.

(m) The Company confirms as of the date hereof that it has 
complied with all provisions of Section 1 of Laws of Florida, 
Chapter 92-198, An Act Relating to Disclosure of Doing Business 
with Cuba, and the Company further agrees that if it commences 
engaging in business with the government of Cuba or with any 
person or affiliate located in Cuba after the date the 
Registration Statement becomes or has become effective with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission or with the Florida 
Department of Banking and Finance (the "Department"), whichever 
date is later, or if the information reported in the 
Prospectus, if any, concerning the Company's business with Cuba 
or with any person or affiliate located in Cuba changes in any 
material way, the Company will provide the Department notice of 
such business or change, as appropriate, in a form acceptable 
to the Department.

5. Conditions to the Obligations of the Agent. The 
obligations of the Agent to solicit offers to purchase the 
Notes shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations 
and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as 
of the Execution Time, on the Effective Date, when any 
supplement to the Prospectus is filed with the Commission and 
as of each Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of 
the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions 
hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations 
hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

(a) If filing of the Prospectus, or any supplement 
thereto, is required pursuant to Rule 424(b), the Prospectus, 
and any such supplement, shall have been filed in the manner 
and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); and no stop 
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration 
Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that 
purpose shall have been instituted or threatened.

(b) The Company shall have furnished to the Agent the 
opinion of Edwards & Angell, counsel for the Company, dated the 
Execution Time, to the effect that:

(i) each of the Company and Fleet National Bank 
(the "Bank") and any other subsidiary or subsidiaries 
which the Agent may reasonably request (individually a 
"Subsidiary" and collectively the "Subsidiaries") has 
been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a 
corporation or national association in good standing 
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is 
chartered or organized, with full corporate power and 
authority to own its properties and conduct its 
business as described in the Prospectus; the Company 
is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation 
under the laws of the State of New York; except as 
stated above, none of the Company or the Bank is 
required to be qualified to do business as a foreign 
corporation under the laws of any other jurisdiction; 
and the Company is registered as a bank holding 
company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as 
amended;

(ii) all the outstanding shares of capital stock 
of the Bank and such Subsidiaries have been duly and 
validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and 
(except as provided in 12 U.S.C. Section 55) 
nonassessable, and, except as otherwise set forth in 
the Prospectus, all outstanding shares of capital 
stock of the Bank and such Subsidiaries are owned by 
the Company either directly or through wholly owned 
subsidiaries free and clear of any perfected security 
interest and, to the knowledge of such counsel, after 
due inquiry, any other security interests, claims, 
liens or encumbrances;

(iii) each Indenture has been duly authorized, 
executed and delivered by the Company, has been duly 
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and 
constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement 
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its 
terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to 
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, 
moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights 
generally from time to time in effect and to the 
availability of equitable remedies which are 
discretionary with the courts);

(iv) the Notes have been duly authorized as a 
series of Debt Securities under the applicable 
Indenture, are in the forms provided for by 
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company 
adopted pursuant to such Indenture, conform to the 
description thereof contained in the Prospectus, and, 
when executed and authenticated in accordance with the 
provisions of the applicable Indenture and delivered 
to and paid for by the purchasers, will constitute 
valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled 
to the benefits of the applicable Indenture;

(v) to the best knowledge of such counsel, there 
is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding 
before any court or governmental agency, authority or 
body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries, of a character required to be 
disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not 
adequately disclosed in the Prospectus, and there is 
no franchise, contract or other document of a 
character required to be described in the Registration 
Statement or Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit, 
which is not described or filed as required;

(vi) the Registration Statement and any 
amendments thereto have become effective under the 
Act; to the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop 
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration 
Statement, as amended, has been issued, no proceedings 
for that purpose have been instituted or threatened, 
and the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and 
each amendment thereof or supplement thereto as of 
their respective effective or issue dates (other than 
the financial statements and other financial data 
contained therein as to which such counsel need 
express no opinion) comply as to form in all material 
respects with the applicable requirements of the Act 
and the Exchange Act and the respective rules 
thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe 
that the Registration Statement, or any amendment 
thereof, at the time it became effective and at the 
date of this Agreement (or, in the case of any opinion 
delivered pursuant to Section 4(k) or Section 6, the 
date of such subsequently delivered opinion), 
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or 
omitted to state any material fact required to be 
stated therein or necessary to make the statements 
therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as 
amended or supplemented to the date of such opinion, 
includes any untrue statement of a material fact or 
omits to state a material fact necessary to make the 
statements therein, in light of the circumstances 
under which they were made, not misleading;

(vii) this Agreement has been duly authorized, 
executed and delivered by the Company;

(viii) no consent, approval, authorization or 
order of any court or governmental agency or body is 
required for the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated herein, except such as have been obtained 
under the Act and such as may be required under the 
blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with 
the purchase and distribution of the Notes as 
contemplated by this Agreement and such other 
approvals (specified in such opinion) as have been 
obtained;

(ix) neither the issue and sale of the Notes, 
nor the consummation of any other of the transactions 
herein contemplated nor the fulfillment of the terms 
hereof will conflict with, result in a breach of, or 
constitute a default under the charter or by-laws of 
the Company or the terms of any indenture or other 
agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to 
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a 
party or bound, or any order or regulation known to 
such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, 
administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator 
having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries; and

(x) no holders of securities of the Company have 
rights to the registration of such securities under 
the Registration Statement.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to 
matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction 
other than the State of Rhode Island or the United States, to 
the extent deemed proper and specified in such opinion, upon 
the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be 
reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Agent and 
(B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on 
certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public 
officials. References to the Prospectus in this paragraph (b) 
include any supplements thereto at the date such opinion is 
rendered.

(c) [Intentionally omitted]

(d) The Company shall have furnished to the Agent a 
certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the 
Board, or the President, or any Executive Vice President and 
the principal financial or accounting officer or Treasurer of 
the Company, dated the Execution Time, to the effect that the 
signers of such certificate have carefully examined the 
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any supplement to the 
Prospectus and this Agreement and that:

(i) the representations and warranties of the 
Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all 
material respects on and as of the date hereof with 
the same effect as if made on the date hereof and the 
Company has complied with all the agreements and 
satisfied all the conditions on its part to be 
performed or satisfied as a condition to the 
obligation of the Agent to solicit offers to purchase 
the Notes;

(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness 
of the Registration Statement has been issued and no 
proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, 
to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and

(iii) since the date of the most recent 
financial statements included in the Prospectus 
(exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been 
no material adverse change in the condition (financial 
or other), earnings, business or properties of the 
Company and its subsidiaries, whether or not arising 
from transactions in the ordinary course of business, 
except as set forth in or contemplated in the 
Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).

(e) Prior to the Execution Time, the Company shall 
have furnished to the Agent such further information, 
documents, certificates and opinions of counsel as the Agent 
may reasonably request.

The documents required to be delivered by this Section 5 
shall be delivered at the office of Edwards & Angell, 2700 
Hospital Trust Tower, Providence, Rhode Island 02903, on the 
date hereof.

6. Right of Person Who Agreed to Purchase to Refuse to 
Purchase. (a) The Company agrees that any person who has 
agreed to purchase and pay for any Note, shall have the right 
to refuse to purchase such Note if (i) at the Closing Date 
therefor, any condition set forth in Section 5 (except that 
references to the Prospectus shall be to the Prospectus as 
supplemented at the Closing Date) shall not be satisfied, (ii) 
subsequent to the agreement to purchase such Note, any change, 
or any development with respect to the Company involving a 
prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties 
of the Company and its subsidiaries shall have occurred the 
effect of which is, in the judgment of the Agent, so material 
and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed 
with the delivery of such Note or (iii) subsequent to the 
agreement to purchase such Note, (w) there shall have been any 
decrease in the ratings of any of the Company's debt securities 
by Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poor's Corporation 
(each a "Rating Agency") or any such Rating Agency shall 
publicly announce that it has placed any of such debt 
securities on a "watchlist" with negative implications, (x) 
trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended 
by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in 
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have 
been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been 
established on such Exchange, (y) a banking moratorium shall 
have been declared either by Federal, Rhode Island or New York 
State authorities, or (z) there shall have occurred any 
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other calamity or 
crisis the effect of which on the financial markets or the 
United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the 
Agent, impracticable to market such Notes (it being understood 
that under no circumstance shall the Agent have any duty or 
obligation to exercise any judgment permitted to be exercised 
pursuant to this Section 6(a)).

(b) The Company further agrees to notify the Agent 
upon the occurrence of any change, condition or development 
contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii) or (iii).

7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company 
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless you and each person who 
controls you within the meaning of either the Act or the 
Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or 
liabilities, joint or several, to which you, they or any of 
them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or 
other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common 
law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or 
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are 
based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of 
a material fact contained in the registration statement for the 
registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any 
amendment thereof, or in the Prospectus or any preliminary 
Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, 
or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged 
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated 
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not 
misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified 
party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably 
incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending 
any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, 
however, that (i) the Company will not be liable in any such 
case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or 
liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue 
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged 
omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with 
written information furnished to the Company by you 
specifically for use in connection with the preparation 
thereof, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to the Prospectus 
or any preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of 
you (or any person controlling you) from whom the person 
asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased 
the Notes which are the subject thereof if such person did not 
receive a copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as 
supplemented) excluding documents incorporated therein by 
reference at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of such 
Notes to such person in any case where such delivery is 
required by the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a 
material fact contained in the Prospectus or any preliminary 
Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus 
as supplemented). This indemnity agreement will be in addition 
to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

(b) You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the 
Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs 
the Registration Statement and each person who controls the 
Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange 
Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the 
Company to you, but only with reference to written information 
relating to you furnished to the Company by you specifically 
for use in the preparation of the documents referred to in the 
foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in 
addition to any liability which you may otherwise have. The 
Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last 
sentence of the ninth paragraph under the heading "Plan of 
Distribution" of the Prospectus Supplement relating to 
purchases and sales of Notes in the secondary market constitute 
the only information furnished in writing by you for inclusion 
in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and 
you confirm that such statements are correct.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party 
under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any 
action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect 
thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this 
Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the 
commencement thereof; but the omission, without prejudice, so 
to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any 
liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise 
than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought 
against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying 
party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will 
be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it 
may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party 
promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such 
indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel 
satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that 
if the defendants in any such action include both the 
indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the 
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there 
may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified 
parties which are different from or additional to those 
available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or 
parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to 
assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the 
defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or 
parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to 
such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense 
of such action and approval by the indemnified party of 
counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such 
indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other 
expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in 
connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified 
party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with 
the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso 
to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, 
that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the 
expenses of more than one separate counsel (plus any local 
counsel), approved by you in the case of paragraph (a) of this 
Section 7, representing the indemnified parties under such 
paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the 
indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory 
to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party 
within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the 
action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the 
employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense 
of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or 
(iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of 
the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).

(d) If for any reason the indemnification provided 
for in paragraph (a) of this Section 7 is due in accordance 
with its terms but is held by a court to be unavailable from 
the Company on grounds of policy or otherwise, you shall 
contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and 
liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably 
incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to 
which the Company and you may be subject in an amount not in 
excess of the commissions received by you in connection with 
the Notes from which such losses, claims, damages and 
liabilities arise unless you were guilty of fraudulent 
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 
Act). For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls 
you within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to 
contribution as you and each person who controls the Company 
within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each 
officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration 
Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same 
rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to 
clauses (y) and (z) of this paragraph (d).

8. Termination. This Agreement will continue in effect 
until terminated as provided in this Section 8. This Agreement 
may be terminated by either the Company or you, giving written 
notice to the other party of such termination. This Agreement 
shall so terminate at the close of business on the first 
business day following the receipt of such notice by the party 
to whom such notice is given. In the event of such 
termination, no party shall have any liability to the other 
party hereto, except as provided in the fourth paragraph of 
Section 2(a), Section 4(b), Section 4(h), Section 7 and Section 
9. The provisions of this Agreement (including without 
limitation Section 6 hereof) applicable to any purchase of a 
Note for which an agreement to purchase exists prior to the 
termination hereof shall survive any termination of this 
Agreement.

9. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The 
respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities 
and other statements of the Company or its officers and of you 
set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in 
full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by 
or on behalf of you or the Company or any of the officers, 
directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 
hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the 
Notes. The provisions of Sections 4(h) and 7 hereof shall 
survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

10. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in 
writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to you, 
will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to you, 
at the address set forth above, attention of Carl F. Woodbury,

mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at 50 
Kennedy Plaza, Providence, Rhode Island 02903, attention of the 
Senior Vice President and General Counsel.

11. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit 
of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective 
successors and the officers and directors and controlling 
persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other person 
will have any right or obligation hereunder, except for the 
right of a person who has agreed to purchase a Note to refuse 
to purchase such Note as provided in Section 6 hereof.

12. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by 
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New 
York.

If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding 
of our agreement, please sign and return to us the enclosed

EXHIBIT A

Fleet Financial Group, Inc.

Medium-Term Note Administrative Procedures
November 18, 1994

The Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series H and Subordinated 
Medium-Term Notes, Series I (respectively, the "Senior Notes" 
and the "Subordinated Notes"), Due Nine Months or More from 
Date of Issue (collectively the "Notes") of Fleet Financial 
Group, Inc. (the "Company"), are to be offered on a continuing 
basis. Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, National Association, as 
agent (the "Agent"), has agreed to solicit purchases of Notes 
issued in fully registered form. In addition, Salomon Brothers 
Inc, Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith 
Incorporated, Goldman, Sachs & Co., and J.P. Morgan Securities 
Inc. will be acting as agent pursuant to a selling agency 
agreement dated as of the date hereof. The Agent will not be 
obligated to purchase Notes for its own account. The Notes are 
being sold pursuant to a Distribution Agreement between the 
Company and the Agent dated the date hereof (the "Distribution 
Agreement"). The Senior Notes will rank equally with all other 
unsecured and unsubordinated debt of the Company. The 
Subordinated Notes will be subordinate and junior in right of 
payment to all Senior Indebtedness and Other Financial 
Obligations of the Company, to the extent and in the manner set 
forth in the Subordinated Indenture. The Notes have been 
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
"Commission"). The Senior Notes will be issued under an 
indenture dated as of October 1, 1992 (the "Senior Indenture"), 
between the Company and The First National Bank of Chicago, as 
trustee (the "Senior Trustee" or "First Chicago"). The 
Subordinated Notes will be issued under an indenture dated as 
of October 1, 1992, between the Company and First Chicago (the 
"Subordinated Trustee" and collectively with the Senior 
Trustee, the "Trustee) as trustee, as supplemented by a first 
supplemental indenture dated as of November 30, 1992, between 
the Company and the Subordinated Trustee (as so supplemented, 
the "Subordinated Indenture" and collectively with the Senior 
Indenture, the "Indentures"). Unless otherwise provided, the 
Trustee will be the paying agent for the Notes.

Each Note will be represented by a Global Security (as 
defined hereinafter) delivered to the Trustee, as agent for The 
Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), and recorded in the 
book-entry system maintained by DTC (a "Book-Entry Note"). An 
owner of a Book-Entry Note will not be entitled to receive a 
certificate representing such Note.

The procedures to be followed during, and the specific 
terms of, the solicitation of orders by the Agent and the sale 
as a result thereof by the Company are explained below. 
Administrative and record-keeping responsibilities will be 
handled for the Company by its Treasury Department. The 
Company will advise the Agent and the Trustee in writing of 
those persons handling administrative responsibilities with 
whom the Agent and the Trustee are to communicate regarding 
orders to purchase Notes and the details of their delivery.

Administrative procedures and specific terms of the 
offering are explained below. Book-Entry Notes will be issued 
in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth in 
below, as adjusted in accordance with changes in DTC's 
operating requirements. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms 
defined in the applicable Indenture and the Notes shall be used 
herein as therein defined. Notes for which interest is 
calculated on the basis of a fixed interest rate, which may be 
zero, are referred to herein as "Fixed Rate Notes". Notes for 
which interest is calculated on the basis of a floating 
interest rate are referred to herein as "Floating Rate Notes". 
To the extent the procedures set forth below conflict with the 
provisions of the Notes, the applicable Indenture, DTC's 
operating requirements or the Distribution Agreement, the 
relevant provisions of the Notes, the applicable Indenture, 
DTC's operating requirements and the Distribution Agreement 
shall control.

Administrative Procedures for
Book-Entry Notes

In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry 
Notes for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by 
DTC, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control 
and administrative functions described below, in accordance 
with its respective obligations under a Letter of 
Representations from the Company and the Trustee to DTC dated 
as of the date hereof and a Medium-Term Note Certificate 
Agreement between the Trustee and DTC dated as of May 26, 1989, 
and its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's 
Same-Day Funds Settlement system ("SDFS").

Issuance: On any date of settlement (as 
defined under "Settlement" below) 
for one or more Book-Entry Notes, 
the Company will issue a single 
global security in fully 
registered form without coupons 
(a "Global Security") 
representing up to $150,000,000 
principal amount of all such 
Book-Entry Notes that have the 
same rank (senior or 
subordinated), original issue 
date, original issue discount 
provisions, if any, Interest 
Payment Dates, Regular Record 
Dates, Interest Payment Period, 
redemption provisions, if any, 
Maturity Date, and, in the case 
of Fixed Rate Notes, interest 
rate, or, in the case of Floating 
Rate Notes, initial interest 
rate, Base Rate, Index Maturity, 
Interest Reset Period, Interest 
Reset Dates, Spread and/or Spread 
Multiplier, if any, minimum 
interest rate, if any, and 
maximum interest rate, if any 
(collectively , the "Terms"). 
Each Global Security will be 
dated and issued as of the date 
of its authentication by the 
Trustee. Each Global Security 
will bear an original issue date, 
which will be (i) with respect to 
an original Global Security (or 
any portion thereof), the 
original issue date specified in 
such Global Security and (ii) 
following a consolidation of 
Global Securities, with respect 
to the Global Security resulting 
from such consolidation, the most 
recent Interest Payment Date to 
which interest has been paid or 
duly provided for on the 
predecessor Global Securities, 
regardless of the date of 
authentication of such resulting 
Global Security. No Global 
Security will represent (i) both 
Fixed Rate and Floating Rate 
Book-Entry Notes or (ii) any 
Certificated Note.

Identification
Numbers: The Company has arranged with the 
CUSIP Service Bureau of 
Standard & Poor's Corporation 
(the "CUSIP Service Bureau") for 
the reservation of two series of 
CUSIP numbers, each of which 
series consists of approximately 
900 CUSIP numbers and relates to 
Global Securities representing 
Book-Entry Notes and book-entry 
medium-term notes issued by the 
Company with other series 
designations. The Company has 
obtained from the CUSIP Service 
Bureau a written list of such 
reserved CUSIP numbers, which the 
Company shall deliver to the 
Trustee and DTC. The Company 
will assign CUSIP numbers to 
Global Securities as described 
below under Settlement Procedure 
"B". DTC will notify the CUSIP 
Service Bureau periodically of 
the CUSIP numbers that the 
Company has assigned to Global 
Securities. At any time when 
fewer than 100 of the reserved 
CUSIP numbers remain unassigned 
to Global Securities for either 
series, if it deems necessary, 
the Company will reserve 
additional CUSIP numbers for 
assignment to Global Securities. 
Upon obtaining such additional 
CUSIP numbers, the Company shall 
deliver a list of such additional 
CUSIP numbers to the Trustee and 
DTC.

Registration: Global Securities will be issued 
only in fully registered form 
without coupons. Each Global 
Security will be registered in 
the name of CEDE & CO., as 
nominee for DTC, on the 
securities register for the Notes 
maintained under the applicable 
Indenture. The beneficial owner 
of a Book-Entry Note (or one or 
more indirect participants in DTC 
designated by such owner) will 
designate one or more 
participants in DTC (with respect 
to such Book-Entry Note, the 
"Participants") to act as agent 
for such owner in connection with 
the book-entry system maintained 
by DTC, and DTC will record in 
book-entry form, in accordance 
with instructions provided by 
such Participants, a credit 
balance with respect to such 
beneficial owner in such 
Book-Entry Note in the account of 
such Participants. The ownership 
interest of such beneficial owner 
(or such participant) in such 
Book-Entry Note will be recorded 
through the records of such 
Participants or through the 
separate records of such 
Participants and one or more 
indirect participants in DTC.

Transfers: Transfers of a Book-Entry Note 
will be accomplished by book 
entries made by DTC and, in turn, 
by Participants (and, in certain 
cases, one or more indirect 
participants in DTC) acting on 
behalf of beneficial transferors 
and transferees of such Note.

Exchanges: The Trustee may deliver to DTC 
and the CUSIP Service Bureau at 
any time a written notice of 
consolidation (a copy of which 
shall be attached to the 
resulting Global Security 
described below) specifying (i) 
the CUSIP numbers of two or more 
Outstanding Global Securities 
that represent (A) Fixed Rate 
Book-Entry Notes having the same 
Terms and for which interest has 
been paid to the same date or (B) 
Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes 
having the same Terms and for 
which interest has been paid to 
the same date, (ii) a date, 
occurring at least thirty days 
after such written notice is 
delivered and at least thirty 
days before the next Interest 
Payment Date for such Book-Entry 
Notes, on which such Global 
Securities shall be exchanged for 
a single replacement Global 
Security and (iii) the single 
CUSIP number, to be assigned to 
such replacement Global Security 
(which shall be the CUSIP number 
previously assigned to the Global 
Security with the earliest date 
of issuance. Upon receipt of 
such a notice, DTC will send to 
its participants (including the 
Trustee) a written reorganization 
notice to the effect that such 
exchange will occur on such 
date. Prior to the specified 
exchange date, the Trustee will 
deliver to the CUSIP Service 
Bureau a written notice setting 
forth such exchange date and such 
single CUSIP number and stating 
that, as of such exchange date, 
the CUSIP numbers of the 
individual Global Securities not 
assigned to the replacement 
Global Security will no longer be 
valid. On the specified exchange 
date, the Trustee will exchange 
such Global Securities for a 
single Global Security bearing 
the single CUSIP number and the 
CUSIP numbers of the individual 
Global Securities not assigned 
will, in accordance with CUSIP 
Service Bureau procedures, be 
retired and not reassigned. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if 
the Global Securities to be 
exchanged exceed $150,000,000 in 
aggregate principal amount, one 
Global Security will be 
authenticated and issued to 
represent each $150,000,000 of 
principal amount of the exchanged 
Global Securities and an 
additional Global Security will 
be authenticated and issued to 
represent any remaining principal 
amount of such Global Securities 
(see "Denominations" below).

Maturities: Each Book-Entry Note will mature 
on a date not less than nine 
months nor more than thirty years 
after the settlement date for 
such Note.

Denominations: Book-Entry Notes will be issued 
in principal amounts of $150,000 
or any amount in excess thereof 
which is an integral multiple of 
$1,000. Global Securities will 
be denominated in principal 
amounts not in excess of 
$150,000,000. If one or more 
Book-Entry Notes having an 
aggregate principal amount in 
excess of $150,000,000 would, but 
for the preceding sentence, be 
represented by a single Global 
Security, then one Global 
Security will be authenticated 
and issued to represent each 
$150,000,000 principal amount of 
such Book-Entry Note or Notes and 
an additional Global Security 
will be authenticated and issued 
to represent any remaining 
principal amount of such 
Book-Entry Note or Notes. In 
such a case, each of the Global 
Securities representing such 
Book-Entry Note or Notes shall be 
assigned the same CUSIP number.

Interest: General. Interest, if any, on 
each Book-Entry Note will accrue 
from the original issue date for 
the first interest period or the 
last date to which interest has 
been paid, if any, for each 
subsequent interest period, on 
the Global Security representing 
such Book-Entry Note, and will be 
calculated and paid in the manner 
described in such Book-Entry Note 
and in the Prospectus (as defined 
in the Distribution Agreement), 
as supplemented by the applicable 
Pricing Supplement. Unless 
otherwise specified therein, each 
payment of interest on a 
Book-Entry Note will include 
interest accrued to but excluding 
the Interest Payment Date or to 
but excluding Maturity. Interest 
payable at the Maturity of a 
Book-Entry Note will be payable 
to the Person to whom the 
principal of such Note is 
payable. Standard & Poor's 
Corporation will use the 
information received in the 
pending deposit message described 
under Settlement Procedure "C" 
below in order to include the 
amount of any interest payable 
and certain other information 
regarding the related Global 
Security in the appropriate 
(daily or weekly) bond report 
published by Standard & Poor's 
Corporation.

Regular Record Dates. The 
Regular Record Date with respect 
to any Interest Payment Date for 
Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes 
shall be the date fifteen 
calendar days immediately 
preceding such Interest Payment 
Date, and for Fixed Rate 
Book-Entry Notes shall be the 
April 15 or October 15 next 
preceding such Interest Payment 
Date, whether or not such date 
shall be a Business Day.

Interest Payment Dates on Fixed 
Rate Book-Entry Notes. Interest 
payments on Fixed Rate Book-Entry 
Notes will be made semiannually 
on May 1 and November 1 of each 
year and at Maturity; provided, 
however, that in the case of a 
Fixed Rate Book-Entry Note issued 
between a Regular Record Date and 
an Interest Payment Date, or on 
an Interest Payment Date, the 
first interest payment will be 
made on the Interest Payment Date 
following the next succeeding 
Regular Record Date. If any 
Interest Payment Date for a Fixed 
Rate Book-Entry Note is not a 
Business Day, the payment due on 
such day shall be made on the 
next succeeding Business Day and 
no interest shall accrue on such 
payment for the period from and 
after such Interest Payment Date.

Interest Payment Dates on 
Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes. 
Interest payments will be made on 
Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes 
monthly, quarterly, semiannually 
or annually. Unless otherwise 
agreed upon, interest will be 
payable, in the case of Floating 
Rate Book-Entry Notes with a 
monthly Interest Payment Period, 
on the third Wednesday of each 
month; with a quarterly Interest 
Payment Period, on the third 
Wednesday of March, June, 
September and December of each 
year; with a semi-annual Interest 
Payment Period, on the third 
Wednesday of the two months 
specified pursuant to Settlement 
Procedure "A" below; and with an 
annual Interest Payment Period, 
on the third Wednesday of the 
month specified pursuant to 
Settlement Procedure "A" below; 
provided, however, that if an 
Interest Payment Date for a 
Floating Rate Book-Entry Note 
would otherwise be a day that is 
not a Business Day with respect 
to such Floating Rate Book-Entry 
Note, such Interest Payment Date 
will be the next succeeding 
Business Day with respect to such 
Floating Rate Book-Entry Note, 
except that in the case of a 
Floating Rate Book-Entry Note for 
which the Base Rate is LIBOR, if 
such Business Day is in the next 
succeeding calendar month, such 
Interest Payment Date will be the 
immediately preceding Business 
Day; and provided further, that, 
in the case of a Floating Rate 
Book-Entry Note issued between a 
Regular Record Date and an 
Interest Payment Dated or on an 
Interest Payment Date, the first 
interest payment will be made on 
the Interest Payment Date 
following the next succeeding 
Regular Record Date.

Notice of Floating Rate Interest 
Rates. Promptly after each 
Interest Determination Date for 
Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes, 
the Calculation Agent will notify 
the Trustee and Standard & Poor's 
Corporation of the interest rates 
determined on such Interest 
Determination Date.

Calculation of
Interest: Fixed Rate Book-Entry Notes. 
Interest on Fixed Rate Book-Entry 
Notes (including interest for 
partial periods) will be 
calculated on the basis of a 
360-day year of twelve 30-day 
months.

Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes. 
Interest rates on Floating Rate 
Book-Entry Notes will be 
determined as set forth in the 
form of Notes. Interest on 
Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes, 
except as otherwise set forth 
therein, will be calculated on 
the basis of actual days elapsed 
and a year of 360 days, except 
that in the case of a Floating 
Rate Book-Entry Note for which 
the Base Rate is the Treasury 
Rate, interest will be calculated 
on the basis of the actual number 
of days in the year.

Payments of
Principal and
Interest: Payments of Interest Only. 
Promptly after each Regular 
Record Date, provided, with 
respect to Floating Rate Notes, 
that the Calculation Agent has 
provided the Trustee with the 
necessary information regarding 
interest rates, the Trustee will 
deliver to the Company and DTC a 
written notice setting forth, by 
CUSIP number, the amount of 
interest to be paid on each 
Global Security on the following 
Interest Payment Date (other than 
an Interest Payment Date 
coinciding with Maturity) and the 
total of such amounts. DTC will 
confirm the amount payable on 
each Global Security on such 
Interest Payment Date by 
reference to the appropriate 
(daily or weekly) bond reports 
published by Standard & Poor's 
Corporation. The Company will 
pay to the Trustee, as paying 
agent, the total amount of 
interest due on such Interest 
Payment Date (other than at 
Maturity), and the Trustee will 
pay such amount to DTC, at the 
times and in the manner set forth 
below under "Manner of Payment".

Payments at Maturity. On or 
about the last Business Day of 
each month, the Trustee will 
deliver to the Company and DTC a 
written list of principal and 
interest to be paid on each 
Global Security maturing (on a 
Maturity or Redemption or 
otherwise) in the following two 
months. The Trustee, the Company 
and DTC will confirm the amounts 
of such principal and interest 
payments with respect to each 
such Global Security on or about 
the fifth Business Day preceding 
the Maturity of such Global 
Security. On or before Maturity, 
the Company will pay to the 
Trustee, as paying agent, the 
principal amount of such Global 
Security, together with interest 
due at such Maturity. The 
Trustee will pay such amount to 
DTC at the times and in the 
manner set forth below under 
"Manner of Payment". If any 
Maturity of a Global Security 
representing Book-Entry Notes is 
not a Business Day, the payment 
due on such day shall be made on 
the next succeeding Business Day 
and no interest shall accrue on 
such payment for the period from 
and after such Maturity. 
Promptly after payment to DTC of 
the principal and interest due at 
Maturity of such Global Security, 
the Trustee will cancel such 
Global Security in accordance 
with the applicable Indenture and 
so advise the Company. On the 
first Business Day of each 
month, Trustee will deliver to 
the Company a written statement 
indicating the total principal 
amount of Outstanding Global 
Securities as of the immediately 
preceding Business Day.

Manner of Payment. The total 
amount of any principal and 
interest due on Global Securities 
on any Interest Payment Date or 
at Maturity shall be paid by the 
Company to the Trustee in 
immediately available funds no 
later than 9:30 A.M. (New York 
City time) on such date. The 
Company will make such payment on 
such Global Securities by 
instructing the Trustee to 
withdraw funds from an account 
maintained by the Company at 
First Chicago or by wire transfer 
of funds available for immediate 
use to the Trustee. The Company 
will confirm any such 
instructions in writing to the 
Trustee. Prior to 10 A.M. (New 
York City time) on the date of 
Maturity or as soon as possible 
thereafter, the Trustee will pay 
by separate wire transfer (using 
Fedwire message entry 
instructions in a form previously 
specified by DTC) to an account 
at the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York previously specified by 
DTC, in funds available for 
immediate use by DTC, each 
payment of principal (together 
with interest thereon) due on a 
Global Security on such date. On 
each Interest Payment Date (other 
than at Maturity), interest 
payments shall be made to DTC, in 
funds available for immediate use 
by DTC, in accordance with 
existing arrangements between the 
Trustee and DTC. On each such 
date, DTC will pay, in accordance 
with its SDFS operating 
procedures then in effect, such 
amounts in funds available for 
immediate use to the respective 
Participants in whose names the 
Book-Entry Notes represented by 
such Global Securities are 
recorded in the book-entry system 
maintained by DTC. Neither the 
Company (as issuer or as paying 
agent) nor the Trustee shall have 
any direct responsibility or 
liability for the payment by DTC 
to such Participants of the 
principal of and interest on the 
Book-Entry Notes.

Withholding Taxes. The amount of 
any taxes required under 
applicable law to be withheld 
from any interest payment on a 
Book-Entry Note will be 
determined and withheld by the 
Participant, indirect participant 
in DTC or other Person 
responsible for forwarding 
payments and materials directly 
to the beneficial owner of such 
Note.

Procedure for Rate
Setting and Posting: The Company and the Agent will 
discuss from time to time the 
aggregate principal amount of, 
the issuance price of, and the 
interest rates to be borne by, 
Book-Entry Notes that may be sold 
as a result of the solicitation 
of orders by the Agent. If the 
Company decides to set prices of, 
and rates borne by, any 
Book-Entry Notes in respect of 
which the Agent is to solicit 
orders (the setting of such 
prices and rates to be referred 
to herein as "posting") or if the 
Company decides to change prices 
or rates previously posted by it, 
it will promptly advise the Agent 
of the prices and rates to be 
posted.

Acceptance and
Rejection of Orders: Unless otherwise instructed by 
the Company, the Agent will 
advise the Company promptly by 
telephone of all orders to 
purchase Book-Entry Notes 
received by the Agent, other than 
those rejected by it in whole or 
in part in the reasonable 
exercise of its discretion. The 
Company has the right to accept 
orders to purchase Book-Entry 
Notes and may reject any such 
orders in whole or in part.

Preparation of
Pricing Supplement: If any order to purchase a 
Book-Entry Note is accepted by or 
on behalf of the Company, the 
Company will prepare a pricing 
supplement (a "Pricing 
Supplement") reflecting the terms 
of such Book-Entry Note and will 
arrange to have ten copies 
thereof filed with the Commission 
in accordance with the applicable 
paragraph of Rule 424(b) under 
the Act and will supply at least 
ten copies thereof (and 
additional copies if requested) 
to the Agent at the address set 
forth on Schedule I hereto, to be 
delivered by overnight courier or 
telecopy to arrive no later than 
11:00 a.m., New York City time, 
on the Business Day following the 
sale date. The Agent will cause 
a Prospectus and Pricing 
Supplement to be delivered to the 
purchaser of such Book-Entry Note.

In each instance that a Pricing 
Supplement is prepared, the Agent 
will affix the Pricing Supplement 
to Prospectuses prior to their 
use. Outdated Pricing 
Supplements (other than those 
retained for files), will be 
destroyed.

Suspension of
Solicitation;
Amendment or
Supplement: The Company may instruct the 
Agent to suspend at any time, for 
any period of time or 
permanently, the solicitation of 
orders to purchase Book-Entry 
Notes. Upon receipt of such 
instructions, the Agent will 
forthwith suspend solicitation 
until such time as the Company 
has advised it that such 
solicitation may be resumed.

In the event that at the time the 
Company suspends solicitation of 
purchases there shall be any 
orders outstanding for 
settlement, the Company will 
promptly advise the Agent and 
Trustee whether such orders may 
be settled and whether copies of 
the Prospectus as in effect at 
the time of the suspension, 
together with the appropriate 
Pricing Supplement, may be 
delivered in connection with the 
settlement of such orders. The 
Company will have the sole 
responsibility for such decision 
and for any arrangements that may 
be made in the event that the 
Company determines that such 
orders may not be settled or that 
copies of such Prospectus may not 
be so delivered.

If the Company decides to amend 
or supplement the Registration 
Statement (as defined in the 
Distribution Agreement) or the 
Prospectus, it will promptly 
advise the Agent and furnish the 
Agent with the proposed amendment 
or supplement and with such 
certificates and opinions as are 
required, all to the extent 
required by and in accordance 
with the terms of the 
Distribution Agreement. Subject 
to the provisions contained in 
Sections 4(a) and 4(b) of the 
Distribution Agreement, the 
Company may file with the 
Commission any such supplement to 
the Prospectus relating to the 
Notes. The Company will provide 
the Agent and the Trustee with 
copies of any such supplement, 
and confirm to the Agent that 
such supplement has been filed 
with the Commission pursuant to 
the applicable paragraph of Rule 
424(b).

Procedures For
Rate Changes: When the Company has determined 
to change the interest rates of 
Book-Entry Notes being offered, 
it will promptly advise the Agent 
and the Agent will forthwith 
suspend solicitation of orders. 
The Agent will telephone the 
Company with recommendations as 
to the changed interest rates. 
At such time as the Company has 
advised the Agent of the new 
interest rates, the Agent may 
resume solicitation of orders. 
Until such time only "indications 
of interest" may be recorded.

Delivery of
Prospectus: A copy of the Prospectus and a 
Pricing Supplement relating to a 
Book-Entry Note must accompany or 
precede the earliest of any 
written offer of such Book-Entry 
Note, confirmation of the 
purchase of such Book-Entry Note 
and payment for such Book-Entry 
Note by its purchaser. If notice 
of a change in the terms of the 
Book-Entry Notes is received by 
the Agent between the time an 
order for a Book-Entry Note is 
placed and the time written 
confirmation thereof is sent by 
the Agent to a customer or his 
agent, such confirmation shall be 
accompanied by a Prospectus and 
Pricing Supplement setting forth 
the terms in effect when the 
order was placed. Subject to 
"Suspension of Solicitation; 
Amendment or Supplement" above, 
the Agent will deliver a 
Prospectus and Pricing Supplement 
as herein described with respect 
to each Book-Entry Note sold by 
it. The Company will make such 
delivery if such Book-Entry Note 
is sold directly by the Company 
to a purchaser.

Confirmation: For each order to purchase a 
Book-Entry Note solicited by the 
Agent and accepted by or on 
behalf of the Company, the Agent 
will issue a confirmation to the 
purchaser, with a copy to the 
Company, setting forth the 
details set forth above and 
delivery and payment instructions.

Settlement: The receipt by the Company of 
immediately available funds in 
payment for a Book-Entry Note and 
the authentication and issuance 
of the Global Security 
representing such Book-Entry Note 
shall constitute "settlement" 
with respect to such Book-Entry 
Note. All orders accepted by the 
Company will be settled on the 
fifth Business Day following the 
date of sale of such Book-Entry 
Note pursuant to the timetable 
for settlement set forth below 
unless the Company and the 
purchaser agree to settlement on 
another day which shall be no 
earlier than the Business Day 
following the date of sale.

such Global Security pursuant 
to the Medium-Term Note

completed as soon as practicable 
but no later than 11:00 A.M. and 
12:00 Noon on the first Business 
Day after the sale date and no 
later than 2:00 P.M. on the 
Business Day before the 
settlement date, respectively. 
If the initial interest rate for 
a Floating Rate Book-Entry Note 
has not been determined at the 
time that Settlement Procedure 
"A" is completed, Settlement 
Procedures "B" and "C" shall be 
completed as soon as such rate 
has been determined but no later 
than 12:00 Noon and 2:00 P.M., 
respectively, on the second 
Business Day before the 
settlement date. Settlement 
Procedure "I" is subject to 
extension in accordance with any 
extension of Fedwire closing 
deadlines and in the other events 
specified in SDFS operating 
procedures in effect on the 
settlement date.

If settlement of a Book-Entry 
Note is rescheduled or canceled, 
the Trustee will deliver to DTC, 
through DTC's Participant 
Terminal System, a cancellation 
message to such effect by no 
later than 2:00 P.M. on the 
Business Day immediately 
preceding the scheduled 
settlement date.

Failure to Settle: If the Trustee has not entered an 
SDFS deliver order with respect 
to a Book-Entry Note pursuant to 
Settlement Procedure "G", then, 
upon written request (which may 
be by telecopy) of the Company, 
the Trustee shall deliver to DTC, 
through DTC's Participant 
Terminal System, as soon as 
practicable, a withdrawal message 
instructing DTC to debit such 
Book-Entry Note to the Trustee's 
participant account. DTC will 
process the withdrawal message, 
provided that the Trustee's 
participant account contains a 
principal amount of the Global 
Security representing such 
Book-Entry Note that is at least 
equal to the principal amount to 
be debited. If a withdrawal 
message is processed with respect 
to all the Book-Entry Notes 
represented by a Global Security, 
the Trustee will cancel such 
Global Security in accordance 
with the applicable Indenture and 
so advise the Company, and will 
make appropriate entries in its 
records. The CUSIP number 
assigned to such Global Security 
shall, in accordance with CUSIP 
Service Bureau procedures, be 
canceled and not immediately 
reassigned. If a withdrawal 
message is processed with respect 
to one or more, but not all, of 
the Book-Entry Notes represented 
by a Global Security, the Trustee 
will exchange such Book-Entry 
Note for two Global Securities, 
one of which shall represent such 
Book-Entry Notes and shall be 
canceled immediately after 
issuance and the other of which 
shall represent the other 
Book-Entry Notes previously 
represented by the surrendered 
Global Security and shall bear 
the CUSIP number of the 
surrendered Global Security.

If the purchase price for any 
Book-Entry Note is not timely 
paid to the Participants with 
respect to such Note by the 
beneficial purchaser thereof (or 
a Person, including an indirect 
participant in DTC, acting on 
behalf of such purchaser), such 
Participants and, in turn, the 
Agent may enter SDFS deliver 
orders through DTC's Participant 
Terminal System debiting such 
Note to the Agent's participant 
account and crediting the Note 
free to the participant account 
of the Trustee and shall notify 
the Trustee and the Company 
thereof. Thereafter, the Trustee 
(i) will immediately notify the 
Company thereof, once the Trustee 
has confirmed that such Note has 
been credited to its participant 
account, and the Company shall 
immediately transfer by Fedwire 
(immediately available funds) to 
the Agent an amount equal to the 
price of such Note which was 
previously credited to the 
account of the Company maintained 
at First Chicago or wire 
transferred at the Company's 
direction in accordance with 
Settlement Procedure J and (ii) 
the Trustee will deliver the 
withdrawal message and take the 
related actions described in the 
preceding paragraph. If such 
failure shall have occurred for 
any reason other than a default 
by the Agent in the performance 
of its obligations hereunder and 
under the Distribution Agreement, 
then the Company will reimburse 
the Agent or the Trustee, as 
applicable, on an equitable basis 
for the loss of the use of the 
funds during the period when they 
were credited to the account of 
the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
upon any failure to settle with 
respect to a Book-Entry Note, DTC 
may take any actions in 
accordance with its SDFS 
operating procedures then in 
effect. In the event of a 
failure to settle with respect to 
one or more, but not all, of the 
Book-Entry Notes to have been 
represented by a Global Security, 
the Trustee will provide, in 
accordance with Settlement 
Procedure "E", for the 
authentication and issuance of a 
Global Security representing the 
other Book-Entry Notes to have 
been represented by such Global 
Security and will make 
appropriate entries in its 
records.

Trustee and First Chicago
Not to Risk Funds: Nothing herein shall be deemed to 
require the Trustee or First 
Chicago to risk or expend its own 
funds in connection with any 
payment to the Company, DTC, the 
Agent or the purchaser, it being 
understood by all parties that 
payments made by the Trustee or 
First Chicago to the Company, 
DTC, the Agent or the purchaser 
shall be made only to the extent 
that funds are provided to the 
Trustee or First Chicago for such 
purpose.

Authenticity of
Signatures: The Company will cause the 
Trustee to furnish the Agent from 
time to time with the specimen 
signatures of each of the 
Trustee's officers, employees or 
agent who has been authorized by 
the Trustee to authenticate 
Book-Entry Notes, but the Agent 
will have no obligation or 
liability to the Company or the 
Trustee in respect of the 
authenticity of the signature of 
any officer, employee or agent of 
the Company or the Trustee on any 
Book-Entry Note.

Expenses: The Agent shall forward to the 
Company, on a monthly basis, a 
statement of the out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by the Agent 
during that month that are 
reimbursable to it pursuant to

Agreement. The Company will 
remit payment to the Agent 
currently on a monthly basis.

Periodic Statements
from the Trustee: Periodically, upon written 
request, the Trustee will send to 
the Company a statement setting 
forth the principal amount of 
Book-Entry Notes Outstanding as 
of that date and setting forth a 
brief description of any sales of 
Book-Entry Notes which the 
Company has advised the Trustee

interest has been paid, if any, 
for each subsequent interest 
period, and will be calculated

interest payment will be made on 
the Interest Payment Date 
following the next succeeding 
Regular Record Date. If any 
Interest Payment Date for or the 
Maturity of a Fixed Rate 
Certificated Note is not a 
Business Day, the payment due on

the Interest Payment Date 
following the next succeeding 
Regular Record Date.

interest for partial periods) 
will be calculated on the basis 
of a 360-day year of twelve

Certificated Note to the 
Trustee. Such payment, together 
with payment of interest due at

purchase Certificated Notes. 
Upon receipt of such

Trustee whether such orders may 
be settled and whether copies of 
the Prospectus as in effect at 
the time of the suspension,

copies of such Prospectus may not 
be so delivered.

or supplement the Registration 
Statement or the Prospectus, it 
will promptly advise the Agent 
and furnish the Agent with the 
proposed amendment or supplement 
and with such certificates and 
opinions as are required, all to 
the extent required by and in 
accordance with the terms of the 
Distribution Agreement. Subject

of the confirmation of sale or 
delivery of the Note to a 
purchaser or such purchaser's 
agent.

Necessary Caveat: The Agent will advise all 
purchasers of the Notes, in 
writing, that the Notes are

not make loans on, or 
collateralize loans with, the 
Notes it places, or purchase the 
Notes for any account that it 
manages, advises, or for which it 
serves as trustee.

The Agent will not assume the 
liability of a maker or endorser 
of the Notes, nor will the Agent 
enter into any other arrangement 
under which it will assume the 
risk of a change in value of the

Fleet Financial Group. Inc., a Rhode Island corporation (herein called the 
"Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture 
hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to 
, or registered assigns, the Principal 
Amount specified above on the Maturity Date specified above and to pay to the 
registered holder hereof interest on said Principal Amount at a rate per annum 
specified above and upon the terms provided under either the heading "Fixed 
Rate Note" or "Floating Rate Note".

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of notes of the Company 
(herein referred to as the "Notes"), all issued or to be issued in one or more 
series under an Indenture, dated as of October 1, 1992 (herein referred to as 
the "Indenture"), between the Company and The First National Bank of Chicago, 
as trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor 
trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures 
supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the 
respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of 
the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon 
which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Notes of 
this series are limited (except as otherwise provided in the Indenture) to the 
aggregate principal amount established from time to time by the Board of 
Directors of the Company. The Notes of this series may be issued at various 
times with different maturity dates and different principal repayment 
provisions, may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise vary, all 
as provided in the Indenture. The Notes of this series may be subject to 
redemption or entitled to repayment at the option of the Holder thereof, in 
both cases upon notice and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture 
and as indicated on page one hereof. The Company may defease the Notes of 
this series in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

Provisions Applicable to Fixed Rate Notes Only:

If the "Fixed Rate" line on page one of this Note is checked, the Company 
will pay interest semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year (each an 
"Interest Payment Date") and on the Maturity Date or upon earlier redemption 
or repayment to the person to whom principal is payable. Interest shall 
accrue from the Original Issue Date, or from the most recent Interest Payment 
Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on this Note (or any 
Predecessor Note) to, but excluding, the next following Interest Payment Date, 
Maturity Date, or date of redemption or repayment, as the case may be. 
Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year 
consisting of twelve 30-day months.

If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date (or the date of 
redemption or repayment) of a Fixed Rate Note falls on a day that is not a 
Business Day (defined below), the payment will be made on the next Business 
Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will 
accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest 
Payment Date or the Maturity Date (or the date of redemption or repayment), as 
the case may be.

Provisions Applicable to Floating Rate Notes Only:

If the "Floating Rate" line on page one of this Note is checked, the 
Company will pay interest on the Interest Payment Dates shown on page one at 
the Initial Interest Rate shown on page one until the first Interest Reset 
Date shown on page one following the Original Issue Date shown above and 
thereafter at a rate determined in accordance with the provisions hereinafter 
set forth under the headings "Determination of CD Rate", "Determination of CMT 
Rate", "Determination of Commercial Paper Rate", "Determination of Federal 
Funds Rate", "Determination of LIBOR", "Determination of Prime Rate", 
"Determination of Treasury Rate" or "Determination of 11th District Cost of 
Funds Rate", depending on whether the Base Rate is the CD Rate, the CMT Rate, 
the Commercial Paper Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, the Prime Rate, the 
Treasury Rate, the 11th District Cost of Funds Rate or other Base Rate, as 
indicated on page one.

An interest payment shall be the amount of interest accrued from and 
including the Original Issue Date, or from and including the last Interest 
Payment Date to which interest has been paid, to, but excluding, the next 
following Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, or date of redemption or 
repayment, as the case may be (an "Interest Period"). If the "Maximum 
Interest Rate" on page one is checked, the Floating Rate Note is subject to a 
maximum limitation on the rate of interest which may accrue during any 
Interest Period. If the "Minimum Interest Rate" line is checked, the Floating 
Rate Note is subject to a minimum limitation on the rate of interest which may 
accrue during any Interest Period.

If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note would fall on a 
day that is not a Business Day with respect to such Note, such Interest 
Payment Date will be the following day that is a Business Day with respect to 
such Note, except that, in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is 
in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date will be the 
immediately preceding day that is a Business Day with respect to such LIBOR 
Note. If the Maturity Date (or date of redemption or repayment) of any 
Floating Rate Note would fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment 
of interest and principal (and premium, if any) may be made on the next 
succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the 
period from and after the Maturity Date (or the date of redemption or 
repayment).

Commencing with the first Interest Reset Date specified on page one hereof 
following the Original Issue Date, the rate at which interest on this Note is 
payable shall be adjusted daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or 
annually as shown on page one hereof under "Interest Reset Dates". The 
interest rate for each Interest Reset Date shall be the Base Rate (as shown on 
page one hereof and described below) applicable to such Interest Reset Date, 
plus or minus the Spread (defined below), if any, and/or multiplied by the 
Spread Multiplier (defined below), if any (each as indicated on page one 
hereof); provided, however, that the interest rate in effect for the period 
from the Issue Date to the first Interest Reset Date will be the Initial 
Interest Rate.

The "Spread" is the number of basis points (one basis point equals 
one-hundredth of a percentage point) specified on page one hereof as being 
applicable to the interest rate for such Floating Rate Note, and the "Spread 
Multiplier" is the percentage specified on page one hereof as being applicable 
to the interest rate for such Floating Rate Note. Both a Spread and/or a 
Spread Multiplier may be applicable to the Interest Rate for a particular 
Floating Rate Note, as set forth on page one hereof.

Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable on and after the Interest 
Reset Date to which it relates but not including the next succeeding Interest 
Reset Date. If any Interest Reset Date is a day that is not a Business Day, 
such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business 
Day, except that if the rate of interest on this Note shall be determined by 
reference to LIBOR and such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar 
month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business 
Day. Subject to applicable provisions of law (including usury laws) and 
except as specified on this Note, on each Interest Reset Date, the rate of 
interest on this Note shall be the rate determined in accordance with the 
provisions of the applicable heading below.

With respect to a Floating Rate Note, accrued interest shall be calculated 
by multiplying the principal amount of such Floating Rate Note by an accrued 
interest factor. Such accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the 
interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Period or from the 
last date from which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest 
factor for each such day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable 
to such day by 360, in the cases of CD Rate Notes, Commercial Paper Rate 
Notes, Federal Funds Rate Notes, LIBOR Notes, Prime Rate Notes and 11th 
District Cost of Funds Notes or by the number of days in the year, in the 
cases of CMT Rate Notes and Treasury Rate Notes. The interest rate applicable 
to any day that is an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate effective 
on such Interest Reset Date. The interest rate applicable to any other day 
will be the interest rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date 
(or, if none, the Initial Interest Rate, as shown on page one).

The "Calculation Date", where applicable, pertaining to an Interest 
Determination Date will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after 
such Interest Determination Date or, if any such day is not a Business Day, 
the next succeeding Business Day and (ii) the Business Day preceding the 
applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.

The First National Bank of Chicago shall be the Calculation Agent unless 
another Calculation Agent is specified on page one hereof. At the request of 
the Holder, the Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in 
effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on 
the next Interest Reset Date.

Unless otherwise specified on page one hereof, all percentages resulting 
from any calculation of the rate of interest on a Floating Rate Note will be 
rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percent 
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, and 
all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on Floating Rate 
Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded 
upward).

Determination of CD Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on page one 
hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, the CD Rate, unless otherwise 
specified on page one hereof, the "CD Rate", with respect to any Interest 
Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the second 
Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date (a "CD Interest Determination 
Date") and shall be the rate on such date for negotiable certificates of 
deposit having the Index Maturity designated on page one hereof as published 
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in "Statistical 
Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or any successor publication 
("H.15(519)") under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)" or, if not so 
published by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining 
to such CD Interest Determination Date, then the CD Rate shall be the rate on 
such CD Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit 
having the specified Index Maturity as published by the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York in its daily statistical release, "Composite 3:30 P.M. Quotations 
for U.S. Government Securities" or any successor publication ("Composite 
Quotations") under the heading "Certificates of Deposit". If such rate is not 
so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then 
the CD Rate on such CD Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the 
Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market 
offered rates as of 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on such CD Interest 
Determination Date, of three leading nonbank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar 
certificates of deposit in The City of New York selected by the Calculation 
Agent for negotiable certificates of deposit of major United States money 
center banks of the highest credit standing (in the market for negotiable 
certificates of deposit) with a remaining maturity closest to the specified 
Index Maturity in a denomination of U.S. $5,000,000; provided, however, that 
if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting 
as mentioned in this sentence, the CD Rate will be the CD Rate in effect on 
such CD Interest Determination Date.

CD Rate Notes, like other Notes, are not deposit obligations of a bank and 
are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Determination of CMT Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on page one 
hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, the CMT Rate, unless otherwise 
specified on page one hereof, the "CMT Rate" will be determined by the 
Calculation Agent, with respect to any Interest Determination Date (a "CMT 
Interest Determination Date"), and shall be the rate displayed on the 
Designated CMT Telerate Page under the caption "...Treasury Constant 
Maturities...Federal Reserve Board Release H.15...Mondays Approximately 3:45 
P.M.", under the column for the Designated CMT Maturity Index for (i) if the 
Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7055, the rate on such CMT Interest 
Determination Date and (ii) if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7052, the 
week, or the month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week in 
which the related CMT Interest Determination Date occurs. If such rate is no 
longer displayed on the relevant page, or is not displayed by 3:00 P.M., New 
York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for such 
CMT Interest Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate 
for the Designated CMT Maturity Index as published in the relevant H.15(519). 
If such rate is no longer published, or if not published by 3:00 P.M., New 
York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for such 
CMT Interest Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate 
for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (or other United States Treasury rate 
for the Designated CMT Maturity Index) for the CMT Interest Determination Date 
with respect to such Interest Reset Date as may then be published by either 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States 
Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be 
comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page 
and published in the relevant H.15(519). If such information is not provided 
by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the 
CMT Rate for the CMT Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the 
Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity, based on the arithmetic 
mean of the secondary market closing offer side prices as of approximately 
3:30 P.M. (New York City time) on the CMT Interest Determination Date 
reported, according to their written records, by three leading primary United 
States government securities dealers (each, a "Reference Dealer") in The City 
of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference 
Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest 
quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest 
quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for the most 
recently issued direct noncallable fixed rate obligations of the United States 
("Treasury Notes") with an original maturity of approximately the Designated 
CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity of not less than such 
Designated CMT Maturity Index minus one year. If the Calculation Agent cannot 
obtain three such Treasury Note quotations, the CMT Rate for such CMT Interest 
Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a 
yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offer 
side prices as of approximately 3:30 P.M. (New York City time) on the CMT 
Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers in the city of New York 
(from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and 
eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the 
highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the 
lowest)), for Treasury Notes with an original maturity of the number of years 
that is the next highest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining 
term to maturity closest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and in an amount 
of at least $100 million. If three or four (and not five) of such Reference 
Dealers are quoting as described above, then the CMT Rate will be based on the 
arithmetic mean of the offer prices obtained and neither the highest nor the 
lowest of such quotes will be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer 
than three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as 
described herein, the CMT Rate will be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT 
Interest Determination Date. If two Treasury Notes with an original maturity 
as described in the third preceding sentence have remaining terms to maturity 
equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, the quotes for the 
Treasury Note with the shorter remaining term to maturity will be used.

"Designated CMT Telerate Page" means the display on the Dow Jones Telerate 
Service on the page designated on page one hereof (or any other page as may 
replace such page on that service for the purpose of displaying Treasury 
Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519)), for the purpose of displaying 
Treasury Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519). If no such page is 
specified on page one hereof, the Designated CMT Telerate Page shall be 7052, 
for the most recent week.

"Designated CMT Maturity Index" means the original period to maturity of 
the U.S. Treasury securities (either 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, or 30 years) 
specified on page one hereof with respect to which the CMT Rate will be 
calculated, If no such maturity is specified, the Designated CMT Maturity 
Index shall be two years.

Determination of Commercial Paper Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on 
page one hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, the Commercial Paper 
Rate, unless otherwise specified on page one hereof, the "Commercial Paper 
Rate" for each Interest Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent 
as of the second Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date (a "Commercial 
Paper Interest Determination Date") and shall be the Money Market Yield (as 
defined below) on such date of the rate for commercial paper having the Index 
Maturity as indicated on page one hereof, as such rate shall be published in 
H.15(519) under the heading "Commercial Paper". In the event that such rate 
is not published prior to 9:00 A.M. New York City time on the Calculation 
Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate shall be the Money Market Yield on such 
Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date of the rate for commercial paper 
of the specified Index Maturity as published in Composite Quotations under the 
heading "Commercial Paper". If by 3:00 P.M. New York City time on such 
Calculation Date such rate is not yet published in either H.15(519) or 
Composite Quotations, then the Commercial Paper Rate shall be the Money Market 
Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 A.M., New York 
City time, on that Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date, of three 
leading dealers of commercial paper in The City of New York selected by the 
Calculation Agent for commercial paper having the specified Index Maturity 
placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA", or the equivalent, 
from a nationally recognized rating agency; provided, however, that if the 
dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting offered 
rates as mentioned in this sentence, the Commercial Paper Rate will be the 
Commercial Paper Rate in effect on such Commercial Paper Interest 
Determination Date.

"Money Market Yield" shall be a yield calculated in accordance with the 
following formula:

Money Market Yield = D x 360 x 100
360 - (D x M)

where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper quoted 
on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal; and "M" refers to the 
actual number of days in the interest period for which interest is being 
calculated.

Determination of Federal Funds Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on 
page one hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, the Federal Funds Rate, 
unless otherwise specified on page one hereof, the "Federal Funds Rate" with 
respect to each Interest Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation 
Agent as of the second Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date (a 
"Federal Funds Interest Determination Date"), and shall be the rate on that 
date for Federal Funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal 
Funds (Effective)" or, if not so published by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, 
on the Calculation Date pertaining to such Federal Funds Interest 
Determination Date, the Federal Funds Rate will be the rate on such Federal 
Funds Interest Determination Date as published in Composite Quotations under 
the heading "Federal Funds/Effective Rate". If such rate is not so published 
by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such 
Federal Funds Interest Determination Date, the Federal Funds Rate for such 
Federal Funds Reset Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will 
be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight 
Federal Funds arranged by three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions 
in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent as of 9:00 A.M., New 
York City time, on such Federal Funds Interest Determination Date; provided, 
however, that if the brokers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent 
are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate will be 
the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Interest Determination 
Date.

Determination of LIBOR. If the Base Rate, as indicated on page one 
hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, LIBOR, unless otherwise 
specified on page one hereof, "LIBOR" for each Interest Reset Date will be 
determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following 
provisions:

(i) With respect to an Interest Determination Date relating to a 
LIBOR Note or any Floating Rate Note for which the interest rate is 
determined with reference to LIBOR (a "LIBOR" Interest Determination 
Date"), LIBOR will be either: (a) if "LIBOR Reuters" is specified on page 
one hereof, the arithmetic mean of the offered rates (unless the specified 
Designated LIBOR Page by its terms provides only for a single rate, in 
which case such single rate shall be used) for deposits in the Index 
Currency having the Index Maturity designated on page one hereof, 
commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such 
LIBOR Interest Determination Date, that appear on the Designated LIBOR 
Page specified on page one hereof, as of 11:00 A.M. London time, on such 
LIBOR Interest Determination Date, if at least two such offered rates 
appear (unless, as aforesaid, only a single rate is required) on such 
Designated LIBOR Page, or (b) if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on page one 
hereof or if neither "LIBOR Reuters" nor "LIBOR Telerate" is specified as 
the method for calculating LIBOR, the rate for deposits in the Index 
Currency having the Index Maturity designated on page one hereof, 
commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such 
LIBOR Interest Determination Date that appears on the Designated LIBOR 
Page specified on page one hereof as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such 
LIBOR Interest Determination Date. If fewer than two such offered rates 
appear, or if no such rate appears, as applicable, LIBOR in respect of the 
related LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance 
with provisions described in clause (ii) below.

(ii) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which 
fewer than two offered rates appear, or no rate appears, as the case may 
be, on the applicable Designated LIBOR Page as specified in clause (i) 
above, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of 
each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as 
selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide the Calculation Agent with 
its offered quotation for deposits in the Index Currency for the period of 
the Index Maturity designated on page one hereof, commencing on the second 
London Business Day immediately following such LIBOR Interest 
Determination Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at 
approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest 
Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a 
single transaction in such Index Currency in such market at such time. If 
at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on such LIBOR 
Interest Determination Date will the arithmetic mean of such quotations. 
If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on such LIBOR 
Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates 
quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M., in the applicable Principal Financial 
Center, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks in 
such Principal Financial Center selected by the Calculation Agent for 
loans in the Index Currency to leading European banks, having the Index 
Maturity designated on page one hereof and in a principal amount that is 
representative for a single transaction in such Index Currency in such 
market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks so selected by 
the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR 
determined as of such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be LIBOR in 
effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date.

"Index Currency" means the currency (including composite currencies) 
specified on page one hereof as the currency for which LIBOR shall be 
calculated. If no such currency is specified on page one hereof, the Index 
Currency shall be United States dollars.

"Designated LIBOR Page" means either (a) if "LIBOR Reuters" is specified 
on page one hereof, the display on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service for 
the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for the 
applicable Index Currency, or (b) if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on page one 
hereof or neither "LIBOR Reuters" nor "LIBOR Telerate" is specified as the 
method for calculating LIBOR, the display on the Dow Jones Telerate Service 
for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for 
the applicable Index Currency.

"Principal Financial Center" will generally be the capital city of the 
country of the specified Index Currency, except that with respect to United 
States dollars, Deutsche Marks, Dutch Guilders, Italian Lire, Swiss Francs and 
ECUs, the Principal Financial Center shall be The City of New York, Frankfurt, 
Amsterdam, Milan, Zurich and Luxembourg, respectively.

Determination of Prime Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on page one 
hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, the Prime Rate, unless otherwise 
specified on page one hereof, the "Prime Rate" with respect to each Interest 
Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the second 
Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date (a "Prime Interest 
Determination Date") and shall be the rate set forth on such date in H.15(519) 
under the heading "Bank Prime Loan", or if not so published prior to 9:00 
A.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such Prime 
Interest Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be determined by the 
Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest 
publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page 
(as defined below) as such bank's prime rate or base lending rates as in 
effect for that Prime Interest Determination Date. If fewer than four such 
rates but more than one such rate appear on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page for 
the Prime Interest Determination Date, the Prime Rate will be determined by 
the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the prime rate quoted 
on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day 
year as of the close of business on such Prime Interest Determination Date by 
four major money center banks in The City of New York selected by the 
Calculation Agent from a list approved by the Company. If fewer than two such 
rates appear on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page, the Prime Rate will be 
determined by the Calculation Agent on the basis of the rates furnished in The 
City of New York by the appropriate number of substitute banks or trust 
companies organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, or 
any state thereof, having total equity capital of at least U.S. $500,000,000 
and being subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority, 
selected by the Calculation Agent from a list approved by the Company to 
provide such rate or rates; provided, however, that if the banks selected as 
aforesaid are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Prime Rate will 
be the Prime Rate in effect on such Prime Interest Determination Date. 
"Reuters Screen NYMF Page" means the display designated as page "NYMF" on the 
Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the 
NYMF page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base 
lending rates of major United States banks).

Determination of Treasury Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on page 
one hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to the Treasury Rate, unless 
otherwise specified on page one hereof, the "Treasury Rate" for each Interest 
Reset Date will be the rate for the auction held on the Treasury Rate 
Determination Date (as hereinafter defined) of direct obligations of the 
United States ("Treasury bills") having the Index Maturity, as indicated on 
page one hereof, as published in H.15(519) under the heading, "U.S. Government 
Securities - Treasury bills - auction average (investment)", or, if not so 
published by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining 
to such Treasury Rate Determination Date, the auction average rate (expressed 
as a bond equivalent yield, rounded to the nearest one one-hundredth of a 
percent, with five one-thousandths of a percent rounded upward, on the basis 
of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) as 
announced by the United States Department of the Treasury. In the event that 
the results of the auction of Treasury bills having the applicable Index 
Maturity designated on page one hereof are not published or reported as 
provided above by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date or 
if no such auction is held on such Treasury Rate Determination Date, then the 
Treasury Rate shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a 
yield to maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent yield, rounded to the 
nearest one one-hundredth of a percent, with five one-thousandths of a percent 
rounded upward, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and 
applied on a daily basis) of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid 
rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Treasury 
Rate Determination Date, of three leading primary United States government 
securities dealers selected by the Calculation Agent for the issue of Treasury 
bills with a remaining maturity closest to the specified Index Maturity; 
provided, however, that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the 
Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Treasury 
Rate for such Interest Reset Date will be the Treasury Rate in effect on such 
Treasury Rate Determination Date.

The "Treasury Rate Determination Date" for any Interest Reset Date will be 
the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls on which Treasury 
bills would normally be auctioned, but in no event shall the Treasury Rate 
Determination Date be after the related Interest Reset Date. Treasury bills 
are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a 
legal holiday, in which case the auction is normally held on the following 
Tuesday, except such auction may be held on the preceding Friday. If, as the 
result of a legal holiday, an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such 
Friday will be the Treasury Rate Determination Date pertaining to the Interest 
Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week. If no auction is held in 
any week (or on the preceding Friday), the Treasury Rate Determination Date 
shall be the Monday of the week in which the Interest Reset Date falls.

Determination of 11th District Cost of Funds Rate. If the Base Rate, as 
indicated on page one hereof, is, or is calculated with reference to, the 11th 
District Cost of Funds Rate, unless otherwise specified on page one hereof, 
the "11th District Cost of Funds Rate", with respect to any related Interest 
Determination Date, will be determined by the Calculation Agent and shall be 
the rate equal to the monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar 
month immediately preceding the month in which such Interest Determination 
Date falls, as set forth under the caption "11th District" on Telerate Page 
7058 as of 11:00 A.M., San Francisco time, on such Interest Determination 
Date. If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 7058 on any related 
Interest Determination Date, the 11th District Cost of Funds Rate for such 
Interest Determination Date shall be the monthly weighted average cost of 
funds paid by member institutions of the 11th Federal Home Loan Bank District 
that was most recently announced (the "11th District Cost of Funds Index") by 
the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the "FHLB of San Francisco") as 
such cost of funds for the calendar month immediately preceding the date of 
such announcement. If the FHLB of San Francisco fails to announce such rate 
for the calendar month immediately preceding such Interest Determination Date, 
then the 11th District Cost of Funds Rate determined as of such Interest 
Determination Date will be the 11th District Cost of Funds Rate in effect on 
such Interest Determination Date.

Provisions Applicable to Both Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes:

The interest so payable on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to 
certain exceptions in the Indenture hereinafter referred to, be paid to the 
person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the 
Regular Record Date immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date or, if 
the Interest Payment Date is a Maturity Date or date of redemption or 
repayment, to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of 
business on the Maturity Date or date of redemption or repayment; provided, 
however, that if the Original Issue Date is between a Regular Record Date and 
an Interest Payment Date or on an Interest Payment Date, interest for the 
period from and including the Original Issue Date to, but excluding, the 
Interest Payment Date relating to such Regular Record Date shall be paid on 
the next succeeding Interest Payment Date to the person in whose name this 
Note is registered on the close of business on the Regular Record Date 
preceding such Interest Payment Date. The "Regular Record Date" with respect 
to any Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes shall be the date 15 
calendar days immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, and for Fixed 
Rate Notes shall be the April 15 and October 15 next preceding such Interest 
Payment Date, whether or not such date shall be a Business Day.

This Note may be presented for payment of principal and interest in the 
Specified Currency at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such 
purpose in the Place of Payment as indicated above, provided, however, that 
payments of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed 
to the address of such person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on 
the Security Register of this series, except for interest payable at the 
Maturity Date or upon earlier redemption or repayment which will be made in 
immediately available funds upon surrender of this Note. Payments of 
principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if payable in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, will be made from an account at a bank outside the United 
States.

Principal (and premium, if any) and interest will be paid by the Company 
in U.S. dollars based on an Exchange Rate (as defined in the Indenture), even 
if this Note is denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars; 
provided, however, that if permitted as indicated on page one hereof, at the 
written request of the Holder, made not later than the Regular Record Date or 
Special Record Date, as the case may be, immediately preceding the applicable 
Interest Payment Date or the fifteenth day immediately preceding the Maturity 
Date or date of redemption or repayment, as the case may be, and pursuant to 
the terms of the Indenture, payments of principal (and premium, if any) and 
interest in respect of a Note denominated in a Specified Currency other than 
U.S. dollars shall be paid in the Specified Currency and otherwise pursuant to 
the terms of the Indenture, and any costs associated with such conversion will 
be borne by the Holder. If this Note is denominated in a Specified Currency 
other then U.S. dollars on page one hereof, the amount of U.S. dollar payment 
will be determined by a New York clearing house bank designated by the Company 
(the "Exchange Rate Agent") based on the quotation for such Specified Currency 
appearing at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second 
Business Day preceding the applicable date of payment, on the bank composite 
or multi-contributor pages of the Reuters Monitor Foreign Exchange Service 
(or, if such service is not then available to the Exchange Rate Agent, the 
Telerate Monitor Foreign Exchange Service or, if neither is available, on a 
comparable display or in a comparable manner as the Company and the Exchange 
Rate Agent shall agree), bid by one of at least three banks (one of which may 
be the Exchange Rate Agent) agreed to by the Company and the Exchange Rate 
Agent, which will yield the largest number of U.S. dollars upon conversion 
from such Specified Currency. If fewer than three bids are available, then 
such conversion will be based on the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) 
as of the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date or, if the 
Market Exchange Rate for such date is not available, as of the most recent 
date on which the Market Exchange Rate is available. If the principal of, or 
interest on this Note is payable in a Specified Currency other than U.S. 
dollars (whether by reason of the unavailability of such quotations or through 
an election by a Holder) and such Specified Currency is not available to the 
Company for making payments thereof due to the imposition of exchange controls 
or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be 
entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders of this Note by making such 
payment in U.S. dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate on the second 
Business Day prior to such payment date, if available, and if not so 
available, the exchange rate determined in the following order: first, by the 
most recently available Market Exchange Rate; second by the quotations of 
three (or if three are not available, then two) recognized foreign exchange 
dealers (one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent) selected by the Exchange 
Rate Agent and the Company in The City of New York or in the foreign country 
of issue of such currency, and third, by such other quotations as the Company 
deems appropriate. If the Specified Currency is a composite currency, 
payments will be an amount determined by the Exchange Rate Agent by adding the 
results obtained by multiplying the number of units of each component currency 
of such composite currency, as of the most recent day on which such composite 
currency was used, by the most recently available Market Exchange Rate for 
such component currency. Any Payment made under the circumstances described 
above, where the required payment is in a Specified Currency other than U.S. 
dollars or any payment made in the Specified Currency, will not constitute an 
Event of Default under the Indenture. "Market Exchange Rate" means the noon 
buying rate for cable transfers in New York City as determined by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York for such Specified Currency.

"Business Day" means (i) with respect to Notes which are not denominated 
in European Currency Units ("ECUs"), any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, 
that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are 
authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close in 
either The City of New York or (A) with respect to Notes denominated in a 
Specified Currency other than U.S. Dollars, in the city as specified by Fleet 
pursuant to the applicable Indenture and (B) with respect to LIBOR Notes, is 
also a "London Business Day" or (ii) with respect to Notes which are 
denominated in ECUs, any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither 
a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or 
obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close in either the City of 
New York or any day that is not designated as an ECU Non-Settlement Day by the 
ECU Banking Association or otherwise generally regarded in the ECU interbank 
market as a day on which payments in ECUs shall not be made. "London Business 
Day" means any day (i) if the Index Currency as specified on page one hereof 
is other than ECU, on which dealings in such Index Currency are transacted in 
the London interbank market or (ii) if the Index Currency is ECU, that is not 
designated as an ECU Non-Settlement Day by the ECU Banking Association or 
otherwise generally regarded in the ECU interbank market as a day on which 
payments in ECUs shall not be made.

In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to 
Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal amount (or, 
if the Note is an Original Issue Discount Note, such lesser portion of the 
principal amount as may be applicable) of the Notes of this series may be 
declared due and payable, in the manner and with the effect provided in the 
Indenture. If this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note (as defined 
below), in the event of an acceleration of the Maturity hereof, the amount 
payable to the Holder of this Note upon such acceleration will be determined 
by this Note but will be an amount less than the amount payable at the 
Maturity of the principal of this Note. An "Original Issue Discount Note" is 
a Note, including any zero-coupon note, which has a stated redemption price at 
maturity that exceeds its Issue Price by at least 0.25% of its principal 
amount, multiplied by the number of full years from the Original Issue Date to 
the Maturity Date for such Note, and any other Note designated by the Company 
as issued with original issue discount for United States Federal income tax 
purposes.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the 
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the 
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be 
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company with the consent of 
the Holders of 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding 
Securities of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains 
provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate 
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series, on behalf of 
the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the 
Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults 
under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the 
Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon 
all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration 
of transfer hereof, or in exchange herefor, or in lieu hereof whether or not 
any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of 
the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is 
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (premium, if any) and 
interest on this Note, at the times, places and rate and in the coin or 
currency, herein prescribed.

The Notes of this series are issued in fully registered form without 
coupons. Notes of this series denominated in U.S. dollars (as indicated on 
page one hereof) will be issued in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in 
excess thereof which is an integral multiple thereof. Notes of this series 
denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars (as indicated on 
page one hereof) will be issued in the Authorized Denomination as indicated on 
page one hereof.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein 
set forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security 
Register of this series upon surrender of this Note for registration of 
transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, 
The City of New York, State of New York, duly endorsed by or accompanied by, a 
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the 
Security Registrar, duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly 
authorized in writing, and thereupon a new Note or Notes of this series of 
authorized denomination and for the same aggregate principal amount will be 
issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or 
exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any 
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the 
Company, the Trustee, and any Agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat 
the person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner of this Note for 
all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor 
the Trustee nor any such Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

If so specified on page one hereof, this Note will be redeemable at the 
Company's option on a date or dates specified prior to maturity at a price or 
prices, each set forth on page one hereof, together with accrued interest to 
the date of redemption. This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund. 
If so redeemable, the Company may redeem this Note either in whole or from 
time to time in part, upon not less than 30, nor more than 60, days' notice. 
If less than all of the Notes with like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, 
the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the applicable Note Registrar by 
such method as such Note Registrar shall deem fair and appropriate.

The Company may specify that this Note will be repayable at the option of 
the Holder on a date or dates specified prior to maturity at a price or prices 
set forth on page one hereof, together with accrued interest to the date of 
repayment. In order for this Note to be repaid, the Paying Agent must receive 
at least 30, but not more than 45, days, prior to the repayment date (i) this 
Note with the form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" at the end of this 
Note duly completed or (ii) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a 
letter from a member of a national securities exchange of the National 
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company 
in the United States of America setting forth the name of the Holder of this 
Note, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised 
thereby and a guarantee that this Note to be repaid with the form entitled 
"Option to Elect Repayment" at the end of this Note duly completed will be 
received by the Paying Agent not less than five Business Days after the date 
of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter and such Note and 
form duly completed are received by the Paying Agent by such fifth Business 
Day. Exercise of the repayment option by the Holder of this Note shall be 
irrevocable. The repayment option may be exercised by the Holder of this Note 
for less then the entire principal amount of this Note provided that the 
principal amount of this Note remaining outstanding after repayment is an 
authorized denomination.

The Company may at any time purchase this Note at any price in the open 
market or otherwise. Notes so purchased by the Company may be held or resold 
or, at the discretion of the Company, may be surrendered to the Trustee for 
cancellation.

By acceptance of this Note, the holder hereof agrees to be bound by the 
provisions of the Indenture. Terms used herein which are defined in the 
Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.

This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until 
the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on 
behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly

Fleet Financial Group. Inc., a Rhode Island corporation (herein called the 
"Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture 
hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to 
, or registered assigns, the Principal 
Amount specified above on the Maturity Date specified above and to pay to the 
registered holder hereof interest on said Principal Amount at a rate per annum 
specified above and upon the terms provided under either the heading "Fixed 
Rate Note" or "Floating Rate Note".

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of notes of the Company 
(herein referred to as the "Notes"), all issued or to be issued in one or more 
series under an Indenture, dated as of October 1, 1992, as supplemented by a 
First Supplemental Indenture dated as of November 30, 1992 (as supplemented, 
herein referred to as the "Indenture"), between the Company and The First 
National Bank of Chicago, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term 
includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and 
all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement 
of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities 
thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Notes and of the 
terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. 
The Notes of this series are limited (except as otherwise provided in the 
Indenture) to the aggregate principal amount established from time to time by 
the Board of Directors of the Company. The Notes of this series may be issued 
at various times with different maturity dates and different principal 
repayment provisions, may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise 
vary, all as provided in the Indenture. The Notes of this series may be 
subject to redemption or entitled to repayment at the option of the Holder 
thereof, in both cases upon notice and in accordance with the provisions of 
the Indenture and as indicated on page one hereof. The Company may defease 
the Notes of this series in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

Upon any distribution of assets of the Company upon dissolution, winding 
up, liquidation or reorganization, the payment of the principal of, premium, 
if any, and interest on, this Note is to be subordinated in right of payment 
to the extent provided in the Indenture to the prior payment in full of all 
Senior Indebtedness and Other Financial Obligations of the Company (each as 
defined in the Indenture). Each Holder of this Note, by the acceptance 
thereof, agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions of the Indenture.

Provisions Applicable to Fixed Rate Notes Only:

If the "Fixed Rate" line on page one of this Note is checked, the Company 
will pay interest semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year (each an 
"Interest Payment Date") and on the Maturity Date or upon earlier redemption 
or repayment to the person to whom principal is payable. Interest shall 
accrue from the Original Issue Date, or from the most recent Interest Payment 
Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on this Note (or any 
Predecessor Note) to, but excluding, the next following Interest Payment Date, 
Maturity Date, or date of redemption or repayment, as the case may be. 
Interest on Fixed Rate Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year 
consisting of twelve 30-day months.

If any Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date (or the date of 
redemption or repayment) of a Fixed Rate Note falls on a day that is not a 
Business Day (defined below), the payment will be made on the next Business 
Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will 
accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest 
Payment Date or the Maturity Date (or the date of redemption or repayment), as 
the case may be.

Provisions Applicable to Floating Rate Notes Only:

If the "Floating Rate" line on page one of this Note is checked, the 
Company will pay interest on the Interest Payment Dates shown on page one at 
the Initial Interest Rate shown on page one until the first Interest Reset 
Date shown on page one following the Original Issue Date shown above and 
thereafter at a rate determined in accordance with the provisions hereinafter 
set forth under the headings "Determination of CD Rate", "Determination of CMT 
Rate", "Determination of Commercial Paper Rate", "Determination of Federal 
Funds Rate", "Determination of LIBOR", "Determination of Prime Rate", 
"Determination of Treasury Rate" or "Determination of 11th District Cost of 
Funds Rate", depending on whether the Base Rate is the CD Rate, the CMT Rate, 
the Commercial Paper Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, the Prime Rate, the 
Treasury Rate, the 11th District Cost of Funds Rate or other Base Rate, as 
indicated on page one.

An interest payment shall be the amount of interest accrued from and 
including the Original Issue Date, or from and including the last Interest 
Payment Date to which interest has been paid, to, but excluding, the next 
following Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date, or date of redemption or 
repayment, as the case may be (an "Interest Period"). If the "Maximum 
Interest Rate" on page one is checked, the Floating Rate Note is subject to a 
maximum limitation on the rate of interest which may accrue during any 
Interest Period. If the "Minimum Interest Rate" line is checked, the Floating 
Rate Note is subject to a minimum limitation on the rate of interest which may 
accrue during any Interest Period.

If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note would fall on a 
day that is not a Business Day with respect to such Note, such Interest 
Payment Date will be the following day that is a Business Day with respect to 
such Note, except that, in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is 
in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date will be the 
immediately preceding day that is a Business Day with respect to such LIBOR 
Note. If the Maturity Date (or date of redemption or repayment) of any 
Floating Rate Note would fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment 
of interest and principal (and premium, if any) may be made on the next 
succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the 
period from and after the Maturity Date (or the date of redemption or 
repayment).

Commencing with the first Interest Reset Date specified on page one hereof 
following the Original Issue Date, the rate at which interest on this Note is 
payable shall be adjusted daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or 
annually as shown on page one hereof under "Interest Reset Dates". The 
interest rate for each Interest Reset Date shall be the Base Rate (as shown on 
page one hereof and described below) applicable to such Interest Reset Date, 
plus or minus the Spread (defined below), if any, and/or multiplied by the 
Spread Multiplier (defined below), if any (each as indicated on page one 
hereof); provided, however, that the interest rate in effect for the period 
from the Issue Date to the first Interest Reset Date will be the Initial 
Interest Rate.

The "Spread" is the number of basis points (one basis point equals 
one-hundredth of a percentage point) specified on page one hereof as being 
applicable to the interest rate for such Floating Rate Note, and the "Spread 
Multiplier" is the percentage specified on page one hereof as being applicable 
to the interest rate for such Floating Rate Note. Both a Spread and/or a 
Spread Multiplier may be applicable to the Interest Rate for a particular 
Floating Rate Note, as set forth on page one hereof.

Each such adjusted rate shall be applicable on and after the Interest 
Reset Date to which it relates but not including the next succeeding Interest 
Reset Date. If any Interest Reset Date is a day that is not a Business Day, 
such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business 
Day, except that if the rate of interest on this Note shall be determined by 
reference to LIBOR and such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar 
month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the immediately preceding Business 
Day. Subject to applicable provisions of law (including usury laws) and 
except as specified on this Note, on each Interest Reset Date, the rate of 
interest on this Note shall be the rate determined in accordance with the 
provisions of the applicable heading below.

With respect to a Floating Rate Note, accrued interest shall be calculated 
by multiplying the principal amount of such Floating Rate Note by an accrued 
interest factor. Such accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the 
interest factors calculated for each day in the Interest Period or from the 
last date from which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest 
factor for each such day is computed by dividing the interest rate applicable 
to such day by 360, in the cases of CD Rate Notes, Commercial Paper Rate 
Notes, Federal Funds Rate Notes, LIBOR Notes, Prime Rate Notes and 11th 
District Cost of Funds Notes or by the number of days in the year, in the 
cases of CMT Rate Notes and Treasury Rate Notes. The interest rate applicable 
to any day that is an Interest Reset Date will be the interest rate effective 
on such Interest Reset Date. The interest rate applicable to any other day 
will be the interest rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Date 
(or, if none, the Initial Interest Rate, as shown on page one).

The "Calculation Date", where applicable, pertaining to an Interest 
Determination Date will be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after 
such Interest Determination Date or, if any such day is not a Business Day, 
the next succeeding Business Day and (ii) the Business Day preceding the 
applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.

The First National Bank of Chicago shall be the Calculation Agent unless 
another Calculation Agent is specified on page one hereof. At the request of 
the Holder, the Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in 
effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on 
the next Interest Reset Date.

Unless otherwise specified on page one hereof, all percentages resulting 
from any calculation of the rate of interest on a Floating Rate Note will be 
rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percent 
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, and 
all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation on Floating Rate 
Notes will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded 
upward).

Determination of CD Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on page one 
hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, the CD Rate, unless otherwise 
specified on page one hereof, the "CD Rate", with respect to any Interest 
Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the second 
Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date (a "CD Interest Determination 
Date") and shall be the rate on such date for negotiable certificates of 
deposit having the Index Maturity designated on page one hereof as published 
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in "Statistical 
Release H.15(519), Selected Interest Rates" or any successor publication 
("H.15(519)") under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)" or, if not so 
published by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining 
to such CD Interest Determination Date, then the CD Rate shall be the rate on 
such CD Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit 
having the specified Index Maturity as published by the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York in its daily statistical release, "Composite 3:30 P.M. Quotations 
for U.S. Government Securities" or any successor publication ("Composite 
Quotations") under the heading "Certificates of Deposit". If such rate is not 
so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, then 
the CD Rate on such CD Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the 
Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market 
offered rates as of 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on such CD Interest 
Determination Date, of three leading nonbank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar 
certificates of deposit in The City of New York selected by the Calculation 
Agent for negotiable certificates of deposit of major United States money 
center banks of the highest credit standing (in the market for negotiable 
certificates of deposit) with a remaining maturity closest to the specified 
Index Maturity in a denomination of U.S. $5,000,000; provided, however, that 
if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting 
as mentioned in this sentence, the CD Rate will be the CD Rate in effect on 
such CD Interest Determination Date.

CD Rate Notes, like other Notes, are not deposit obligations of a bank and 
are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Determination of CMT Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on page one 
hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, the CMT Rate, unless otherwise 
specified on page one hereof, the "CMT Rate" will be determined by the 
Calculation Agent, with respect to any Interest Determination Date (a "CMT 
Interest Determination Date"), and shall be the rate displayed on the 
Designated CMT Telerate Page under the caption "...Treasury Constant 
Maturities...Federal Reserve Board Release H.15...Mondays Approximately 3:45 
P.M.", under the column for the Designated CMT Maturity Index for (i) if the 
Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7055, the rate on such CMT Interest 
Determination Date and (ii) if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7052, the 
week, or the month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week in 
which the related CMT Interest Determination Date occurs. If such rate is no 
longer displayed on the relevant page, or is not displayed by 3:00 P.M., New 
York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for such 
CMT Interest Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate 
for the Designated CMT Maturity Index as published in the relevant H.15(519). 
If such rate is no longer published, or if not published by 3:00 P.M., New 
York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for such 
CMT Interest Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate 
for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (or other United States Treasury rate 
for the Designated CMT Maturity Index) for the CMT Interest Determination Date 
with respect to such Interest Reset Date as may then be published by either 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States 
Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be 
comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page 
and published in the relevant H.15(519). If such information is not provided 
by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then the 
CMT Rate for the CMT Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the 
Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity, based on the arithmetic 
mean of the secondary market closing offer side prices as of approximately 
3:30 P.M. (New York City time) on the CMT Interest Determination Date 
reported, according to their written records, by three leading primary United 
States government securities dealers (each, a "Reference Dealer") in The City 
of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (from five such Reference 
Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest 
quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest 
quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for the most 
recently issued direct noncallable fixed rate obligations of the United States 
("Treasury Notes") with an original maturity of approximately the Designated 
CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity of not less than such 
Designated CMT Maturity Index minus one year. If the Calculation Agent cannot 
obtain three such Treasury Note quotations, the CMT Rate for such CMT Interest 
Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a 
yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offer 
side prices as of approximately 3:30 P.M. (New York City time) on the CMT 
Interest Determination Date of three Reference Dealers in the city of New York 
(from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and 
eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the 
highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the 
lowest)), for Treasury Notes with an original maturity of the number of years 
that is the next highest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining 
term to maturity closest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and in an amount 
of at least $100 million. If three or four (and not five) of such Reference 
Dealers are quoting as described above, then the CMT Rate will be based on the 
arithmetic mean of the offer prices obtained and neither the highest nor the 
lowest of such quotes will be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer 
than three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as 
described herein, the CMT Rate will be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT 
Interest Determination Date. If two Treasury Notes with an original maturity 
as described in the third preceding sentence have remaining terms to maturity 
equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, the quotes for the 
Treasury Note with the shorter remaining term to maturity will be used.

"Designated CMT Telerate Page" means the display on the Dow Jones Telerate 
Service on the page designated on page one hereof (or any other page as may 
replace such page on that service for the purpose of displaying Treasury 
Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519)), for the purpose of displaying 
Treasury Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519). If no such page is 
specified on page one hereof, the Designated CMT Telerate Page shall be 7052, 
for the most recent week.

"Designated CMT Maturity Index" means the original period to maturity of 
the U.S. Treasury securities (either 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, or 30 years) 
specified on page one hereof with respect to which the CMT Rate will be 
calculated, If no such maturity is specified, the Designated CMT Maturity 
Index shall be two years.

Determination of Commercial Paper Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on 
page one hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, the Commercial Paper 
Rate, unless otherwise specified on page one hereof, the "Commercial Paper 
Rate" for each Interest Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent 
as of the second Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date (a "Commercial 
Paper Interest Determination Date") and shall be the Money Market Yield (as 
defined below) on such date of the rate for commercial paper having the Index 
Maturity as indicated on page one hereof, as such rate shall be published in 
H.15(519) under the heading "Commercial Paper". In the event that such rate 
is not published prior to 9:00 A.M. New York City time on the Calculation 
Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate shall be the Money Market Yield on such 
Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date of the rate for commercial paper 
of the specified Index Maturity as published in Composite Quotations under the 
heading "Commercial Paper". If by 3:00 P.M. New York City time on such 
Calculation Date such rate is not yet published in either H.15(519) or 
Composite Quotations, then the Commercial Paper Rate shall be the Money Market 
Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 A.M., New York 
City time, on that Commercial Paper Interest Determination Date, of three 
leading dealers of commercial paper in The City of New York selected by the 
Calculation Agent for commercial paper having the specified Index Maturity 
placed for an industrial issuer whose bond rating is "AA", or the equivalent, 
from a nationally recognized rating agency; provided, however, that if the 
dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting offered 
rates as mentioned in this sentence, the Commercial Paper Rate will be the 
Commercial Paper Rate in effect on such Commercial Paper Interest 
Determination Date.

"Money Market Yield" shall be a yield calculated in accordance with the 
following formula:

Money Market Yield = D x 360 x 100
360 - (D x M)

where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper quoted 
on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal; and "M" refers to the 
actual number of days in the interest period for which interest is being 
calculated.

Determination of Federal Funds Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on 
page one hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, the Federal Funds Rate, 
unless otherwise specified on page one hereof, the "Federal Funds Rate" with 
respect to each Interest Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation 
Agent as of the second Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date (a 
"Federal Funds Interest Determination Date"), and shall be the rate on that 
date for Federal Funds as published in H.15(519) under the heading "Federal 
Funds (Effective)" or, if not so published by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, 
on the Calculation Date pertaining to such Federal Funds Interest 
Determination Date, the Federal Funds Rate will be the rate on such Federal 
Funds Interest Determination Date as published in Composite Quotations under 
the heading "Federal Funds/Effective Rate". If such rate is not so published 
by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such 
Federal Funds Interest Determination Date, the Federal Funds Rate for such 
Federal Funds Reset Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will 
be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight 
Federal Funds arranged by three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions 
in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent as of 9:00 A.M., New 
York City time, on such Federal Funds Interest Determination Date; provided, 
however, that if the brokers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent 
are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal Funds Rate will be 
the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Interest Determination 
Date.

Determination of LIBOR. If the Base Rate, as indicated on page one 
hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, LIBOR, unless otherwise 
specified on page one hereof, "LIBOR" for each Interest Reset Date will be 
determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following 
provisions:

(i) With respect to an Interest Determination Date relating to a 
LIBOR Note or any Floating Rate Note for which the interest rate is 
determined with reference to LIBOR (a "LIBOR" Interest Determination 
Date"), LIBOR will be either: (a) if "LIBOR Reuters" is specified on page 
one hereof, the arithmetic mean of the offered rates (unless the specified 
Designated LIBOR Page by its terms provides only for a single rate, in 
which case such single rate shall be used) for deposits in the Index 
Currency having the Index Maturity designated on page one hereof, 
commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such 
LIBOR Interest Determination Date, that appear on the Designated LIBOR 
Page specified on page one hereof, as of 11:00 A.M. London time, on such 
LIBOR Interest Determination Date, if at least two such offered rates 
appear (unless, as aforesaid, only a single rate is required) on such 
Designated LIBOR Page, or (b) if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on page one 
hereof or if neither "LIBOR Reuters" nor "LIBOR Telerate" is specified as 
the method for calculating LIBOR, the rate for deposits in the Index 
Currency having the Index Maturity designated on page one hereof, 
commencing on the second London Business Day immediately following such 
LIBOR Interest Determination Date that appears on the Designated LIBOR 
Page specified on page one hereof as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such 
LIBOR Interest Determination Date. If fewer than two such offered rates 
appear, or if no such rate appears, as applicable, LIBOR in respect of the 
related LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance 
with provisions described in clause (ii) below.

(ii) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which 
fewer than two offered rates appear, or no rate appears, as the case may 
be, on the applicable Designated LIBOR Page as specified in clause (i) 
above, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of 
each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as 
selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide the Calculation Agent with 
its offered quotation for deposits in the Index Currency for the period of 
the Index Maturity designated on page one hereof, commencing on the second 
London Business Day immediately following such LIBOR Interest 
Determination Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at 
approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest 
Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a 
single transaction in such Index Currency in such market at such time. If 
at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on such LIBOR 
Interest Determination Date will the arithmetic mean of such quotations. 
If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on such LIBOR 
Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates 
quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M., in the applicable Principal Financial 
Center, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks in 
such Principal Financial Center selected by the Calculation Agent for 
loans in the Index Currency to leading European banks, having the Index 
Maturity designated on page one hereof and in a principal amount that is 
representative for a single transaction in such Index Currency in such 
market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks so selected by 
the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR 
determined as of such LIBOR Interest Determination Date will be LIBOR in 
effect on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date.

"Index Currency" means the currency (including composite currencies) 
specified on page one hereof as the currency for which LIBOR shall be 
calculated. If no such currency is specified on page one hereof, the Index 
Currency shall be United States dollars.

"Designated LIBOR Page" means either (a) if "LIBOR Reuters" is specified 
on page one hereof, the display on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service for 
the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for the 
applicable Index Currency, or (b) if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on page one 
hereof or neither "LIBOR Reuters" nor "LIBOR Telerate" is specified as the 
method for calculating LIBOR, the display on the Dow Jones Telerate Service 
for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for 
the applicable Index Currency.

"Principal Financial Center" will generally be the capital city of the 
country of the specified Index Currency, except that with respect to United 
States dollars, Deutsche Marks, Dutch Guilders, Italian Lire, Swiss Francs and 
ECUs, the Principal Financial Center shall be The City of New York, Frankfurt, 
Amsterdam, Milan, Zurich and Luxembourg, respectively.

Determination of Prime Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on page one 
hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to, the Prime Rate, unless otherwise 
specified on page one hereof, the "Prime Rate" with respect to each Interest 
Reset Date will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the second 
Business Day prior to such Interest Reset Date (a "Prime Interest 
Determination Date") and shall be the rate set forth on such date in H.15(519) 
under the heading "Bank Prime Loan", or if not so published prior to 9:00 
A.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining to such Prime 
Interest Determination Date, then the Prime Rate will be determined by the 
Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest 
publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page 
(as defined below) as such bank's prime rate or base lending rates as in 
effect for that Prime Interest Determination Date. If fewer than four such 
rates but more than one such rate appear on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page for 
the Prime Interest Determination Date, the Prime Rate will be determined by 
the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the prime rate quoted 
on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day 
year as of the close of business on such Prime Interest Determination Date by 
four major money center banks in The City of New York selected by the 
Calculation Agent from a list approved by the Company. If fewer than two such 
rates appear on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page, the Prime Rate will be 
determined by the Calculation Agent on the basis of the rates furnished in The 
City of New York by the appropriate number of substitute banks or trust 
companies organized and doing business under the laws of the United States, or 
any state thereof, having total equity capital of at least U.S. $500,000,000 
and being subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority, 
selected by the Calculation Agent from a list approved by the Company to 
provide such rate or rates; provided, however, that if the banks selected as 
aforesaid are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Prime Rate will 
be the Prime Rate in effect on such Prime Interest Determination Date. 
"Reuters Screen NYMF Page" means the display designated as page "NYMF" on the 
Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the 
NYMF page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base 
lending rates of major United States banks).

Determination of Treasury Rate. If the Base Rate, as indicated on page 
one hereof, is, or is calculated by reference to the Treasury Rate, unless 
otherwise specified on page one hereof, the "Treasury Rate" for each Interest 
Reset Date will be the rate for the auction held on the Treasury Rate 
Determination Date (as hereinafter defined) of direct obligations of the 
United States ("Treasury bills") having the Index Maturity, as indicated on 
page one hereof, as published in H.15(519) under the heading, "U.S. Government 
Securities - Treasury bills - auction average (investment)", or, if not so 
published by 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining 
to such Treasury Rate Determination Date, the auction average rate (expressed 
as a bond equivalent yield, rounded to the nearest one one-hundredth of a 
percent, with five one-thousandths of a percent rounded upward, on the basis 
of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) as 
announced by the United States Department of the Treasury. In the event that 
the results of the auction of Treasury bills having the applicable Index 
Maturity designated on page one hereof are not published or reported as 
provided above by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Calculation Date or 
if no such auction is held on such Treasury Rate Determination Date, then the 
Treasury Rate shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be a 
yield to maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent yield, rounded to the 
nearest one one-hundredth of a percent, with five one-thousandths of a percent 
rounded upward, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and 
applied on a daily basis) of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid 
rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Treasury 
Rate Determination Date, of three leading primary United States government 
securities dealers selected by the Calculation Agent for the issue of Treasury 
bills with a remaining maturity closest to the specified Index Maturity; 
provided, however, that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the 
Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Treasury 
Rate for such Interest Reset Date will be the Treasury Rate in effect on such 
Treasury Rate Determination Date.

The "Treasury Rate Determination Date" for any Interest Reset Date will be 
the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls on which Treasury 
bills would normally be auctioned, but in no event shall the Treasury Rate 
Determination Date be after the related Interest Reset Date. Treasury bills 
are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a 
legal holiday, in which case the auction is normally held on the following 
Tuesday, except such auction may be held on the preceding Friday. If, as the 
result of a legal holiday, an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such 
Friday will be the Treasury Rate Determination Date pertaining to the Interest 
Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week. If no auction is held in 
any week (or on the preceding Friday), the Treasury Rate Determination Date 
shall be the Monday of the week in which the Interest Reset Date falls.

Determination of 11th District Cost of Funds Rate. If the Base Rate, as 
indicated on page one hereof, is, or is calculated with reference to, the 11th 
District Cost of Funds Rate, unless otherwise specified on page one hereof, 
the "11th District Cost of Funds Rate", with respect to any related Interest 
Determination Date, will be determined by the Calculation Agent and shall be 
the rate equal to the monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar 
month immediately preceding the month in which such Interest Determination 
Date falls, as set forth under the caption "11th District" on Telerate Page 
7058 as of 11:00 A.M., San Francisco time, on such Interest Determination 
Date. If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 7058 on any related 
Interest Determination Date, the 11th District Cost of Funds Rate for such 
Interest Determination Date shall be the monthly weighted average cost of 
funds paid by member institutions of the 11th Federal Home Loan Bank District 
that was most recently announced (the "11th District Cost of Funds Index") by 
the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the "FHLB of San Francisco") as 
such cost of funds for the calendar month immediately preceding the date of 
such announcement. If the FHLB of San Francisco fails to announce such rate 
for the calendar month immediately preceding such Interest Determination Date, 
then the 11th District Cost of Funds Rate determined as of such Interest 
Determination Date will be the 11th District Cost of Funds Rate in effect on 
such Interest Determination Date.

Provisions Applicable to Both Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes:

The interest so payable on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to 
certain exceptions in the Indenture hereinafter referred to, be paid to the 
person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the 
Regular Record Date immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date or, if 
the Interest Payment Date is a Maturity Date or date of redemption or 
repayment, to the person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of 
business on the Maturity Date or date of redemption or repayment; provided, 
however, that if the Original Issue Date is between a Regular Record Date and 
an Interest Payment Date or on an Interest Payment Date, interest for the 
period from and including the Original Issue Date to, but excluding, the 
Interest Payment Date relating to such Regular Record Date shall be paid on 
the next succeeding Interest Payment Date to the person in whose name this 
Note is registered on the close of business on the Regular Record Date 
preceding such Interest Payment Date. The "Regular Record Date" with respect 
to any Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes shall be the date 15 
calendar days immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, and for Fixed 
Rate Notes shall be the April 15 and October 15 next preceding such Interest 
Payment Date, whether or not such date shall be a Business Day.

This Note may be presented for payment of principal and interest in the 
Specified Currency at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such 
purpose in the Place of Payment as indicated above, provided, however, that 
payments of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed 
to the address of such person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on 
the Security Register of this series, except for interest payable at the 
Maturity Date or upon earlier redemption or repayment which will be made in 
immediately available funds upon surrender of this Note. Payments of 
principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if payable in a currency other 
than U.S. dollars, will be made from an account at a bank outside the United 
States.

Principal (and premium, if any) and interest will be paid by the Company 
in U.S. dollars based on an Exchange Rate (as defined in the Indenture), even 
if this Note is denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars; 
provided, however, that if permitted as indicated on page one hereof, at the 
written request of the Holder, made not later than the Regular Record Date or 
Special Record Date, as the case may be, immediately preceding the applicable 
Interest Payment Date or the fifteenth day immediately preceding the Maturity 
Date or date of redemption or repayment, as the case may be, and pursuant to 
the terms of the Indenture, payments of principal (and premium, if any) and 
interest in respect of a Note denominated in a Specified Currency other than 
U.S. dollars shall be paid in the Specified Currency and otherwise pursuant to 
the terms of the Indenture, and any costs associated with such conversion will 
be borne by the Holder. If this Note is denominated in a Specified Currency 
other then U.S. dollars on page one hereof, the amount of U.S. dollar payment 
will be determined by a New York clearing house bank designated by the Company 
(the "Exchange Rate Agent") based on the quotation for such Specified Currency 
appearing at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second 
Business Day preceding the applicable date of payment, on the bank composite 
or multi-contributor pages of the Reuters Monitor Foreign Exchange Service 
(or, if such service is not then available to the Exchange Rate Agent, the 
Telerate Monitor Foreign Exchange Service or, if neither is available, on a 
comparable display or in a comparable manner as the Company and the Exchange 
Rate Agent shall agree), bid by one of at least three banks (one of which may 
be the Exchange Rate Agent) agreed to by the Company and the Exchange Rate 
Agent, which will yield the largest number of U.S. dollars upon conversion 
from such Specified Currency. If fewer than three bids are available, then 
such conversion will be based on the Market Exchange Rate (as defined below) 
as of the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date or, if the 
Market Exchange Rate for such date is not available, as of the most recent 
date on which the Market Exchange Rate is available. If the principal of, or 
interest on this Note is payable in a Specified Currency other than U.S. 
dollars (whether by reason of the unavailability of such quotations or through 
an election by a Holder) and such Specified Currency is not available to the 
Company for making payments thereof due to the imposition of exchange controls 
or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the Company will be 
entitled to satisfy its obligations to Holders of this Note by making such 
payment in U.S. dollars on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate on the second 
Business Day prior to such payment date, if available, and if not so 
available, the exchange rate determined in the following order: first, by the 
most recently available Market Exchange Rate; second by the quotations of 
three (or if three are not available, then two) recognized foreign exchange 
dealers (one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent) selected by the Exchange 
Rate Agent and the Company in The City of New York or in the foreign country 
of issue of such currency, and third, by such other quotations as the Company 
deems appropriate. If the Specified Currency is a composite currency, 
payments will be an amount determined by the Exchange Rate Agent by adding the 
results obtained by multiplying the number of units of each component currency 
of such composite currency, as of the most recent day on which such composite 
currency was used, by the most recently available Market Exchange Rate for 
such component currency. Any Payment made under the circumstances described 
above, where the required payment is in a Specified Currency other than U.S. 
dollars or any payment made in the Specified Currency, will not constitute an 
Event of Default under the Indenture. "Market Exchange Rate" means the noon 
buying rate for cable transfers in New York City as determined by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York for such Specified Currency.

"Business Day" means (i) with respect to Notes which are not denominated 
in European Currency Units ("ECUs"), any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, 
that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are 
authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close in 
either The City of New York or (A) with respect to Notes denominated in a 
Specified Currency other than U.S. Dollars, in the city as specified by Fleet 
pursuant to the applicable Indenture and (B) with respect to LIBOR Notes, is 
also a "London Business Day" or (ii) with respect to Notes which are 
denominated in ECUs, any day other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither 
a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or 
obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close in either the City of 
New York or any day that is not designated as an ECU Non-Settlement Day by the 
ECU Banking Association or otherwise generally regarded in the ECU interbank 
market as a day on which payments in ECUs shall not be made. "London Business 
Day" means any day (i) if the Index Currency as specified on page one hereof 
is other than ECU, on which dealings in such Index Currency are transacted in 
the London interbank market or (ii) if the Index Currency is ECU, that is not 
designated as an ECU Non-Settlement Day by the ECU Banking Association or 
otherwise generally regarded in the ECU interbank market as a day on which 
payments in ECUs shall not be made.

In case an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to 
Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal amount (or, 
if the Note is an Original Issue Discount Note, such lesser portion of the 
principal amount as may be applicable) of the Notes of this series may be 
declared due and payable, in the manner and with the effect provided in the 
Indenture. If this Note is an Original Issue Discount Note (as defined 
below), in the event of an acceleration of the Maturity hereof, the amount 
payable to the Holder of this Note upon such acceleration will be determined 
by this Note but will be an amount less than the amount payable at the 
Maturity of the principal of this Note. An "Original Issue Discount Note" is 
a Note, including any zero-coupon note, which has a stated redemption price at 
maturity that exceeds its Issue Price by at least 0.25% of its principal 
amount, multiplied by the number of full years from the Original Issue Date to 
the Maturity Date for such Note, and any other Note designated by the Company 
as issued with original issue discount for United States Federal income tax 
purposes.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the 
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the 
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be 
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company with the consent of 
the Holders of 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding 
Securities of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains 
provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate 
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series, on behalf of 
the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the 
Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults 
under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the 
Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon 
all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration 
of transfer hereof, or in exchange herefor, or in lieu hereof whether or not 
any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of 
the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is 
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (premium, if any) and 
interest on this Note, at the times, places and rate and in the coin or 
currency, herein prescribed.

The Notes of this series are issued in fully registered form without 
coupons. Notes of this series denominated in U.S. dollars (as indicated on 
page one hereof) will be issued in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in 
excess thereof which is an integral multiple thereof. Notes of this series 
denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars (as indicated on 
page one hereof) will be issued in the Authorized Denomination as indicated on 
page one hereof.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein 
set forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security 
Register of this series upon surrender of this Note for registration of 
transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, 
The City of New York, State of New York, duly endorsed by or accompanied by, a 
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the 
Security Registrar, duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly 
authorized in writing, and thereupon a new Note or Notes of this series of 
authorized denomination and for the same aggregate principal amount will be 
issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or 
exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any 
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the 
Company, the Trustee, and any Agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat 
the person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner of this Note for 
all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor 
the Trustee nor any such Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

If so specified on page one hereof, this Note will be redeemable at the 
Company's option on a date or dates specified prior to maturity at a price or 
prices, each set forth on page one hereof, together with accrued interest to 
the date of redemption. This Note will not be subject to any sinking fund. 
If so redeemable, the Company may redeem this Note either in whole or from 
time to time in part, upon not less than 30, nor more than 60, days' notice. 
If less than all of the Notes with like tenor and terms are to be redeemed, 
the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the applicable Note Registrar by 
such method as such Note Registrar shall deem fair and appropriate.

The Company may specify that this Note will be repayable at the option of 
the Holder on a date or dates specified prior to maturity at a price or prices 
set forth on page one hereof, together with accrued interest to the date of 
repayment. In order for this Note to be repaid, the Paying Agent must receive 
at least 30, but not more than 45, days, prior to the repayment date (i) this 
Note with the form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" at the end of this 
Note duly completed or (ii) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a 
letter from a member of a national securities exchange of the National 
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company

thereby and a guarantee that this Note to be repaid with the form entitled 
"Option to Elect Repayment" at the end of this Note duly completed will be 
received by the Paying Agent not less than five Business Days after the date 
of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter and such Note and 
form duly completed are received by the Paying Agent by such fifth Business 
Day. Exercise of the repayment option by the Holder of this Note shall be 
irrevocable. The repayment option may be exercised by the Holder of this Note 
for less then the entire principal amount of this Note provided that the 
principal amount of this Note remaining outstanding after repayment is an 
authorized denomination.

The Company may at any time purchase this Note at any price in the open 
market or otherwise. Notes so purchased by the Company may be held or resold 
or, at the discretion of the Company, may be surrendered to the Trustee for 
cancellation.

By acceptance of this Note, the holder hereof agrees to be bound by the 
provisions of the Indenture. Terms used herein which are defined in the 
Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.

This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until 
the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on 
behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly 
executed under its corporate seal.
