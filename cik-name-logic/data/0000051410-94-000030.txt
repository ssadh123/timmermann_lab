Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On August 22, 1994, Multifoods Distribution, Inc., a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of International Multifoods Corporation (the "Company"), 
purchased, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of July 29, 
1994, substantially all of the assets of Leprino Foods Company's 
specialty foodservice distribution business. The Asset Purchase 
Agreement also provided for the purchase of three distribution 
warehouses from James G. Leprino, the principal shareholder of Leprino 
Foods Company. Leprino Foods Company is a privately held manufacturer 
and distributor of products to the foodservice industry, with its 
principal offices located in Denver, Colorado. The assets purchased 
include an aggregate of seven distribution warehouses and leasehold 
interests in two distribution warehouses and substantially all of the 
furniture, furnishings, leasehold improvements, fixtures, equipment, 
machinery, motor vehicles, spare parts, inventory, supplies, accounts 
and notes receivable, intellectual property rights, interests in 
personal property leases, contracts and agreements and interests in 
purchase orders of Leprino Foods Company used primarily in, or otherwise 
primarily related to or necessary for, the specialty foodservice 
distribution business. The Company also assumed certain liabilities of 
Leprino Foods Company. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, 
Leprino Foods Company and Mr. Leprino and their affiliates have agreed 
not to compete with any business in which the specialty foodservice 
distribution business of Leprino Foods Company was engaged within one 
year prior to the purchase of such business by the Company for a term of 
five years.

The purchase price paid to Leprino Foods Company for the assets and 
the covenant not to compete was $99,513,191 and the purchase price paid 
to Mr. Leprino for the three distribution warehouses and his covenant 
not to compete was $12,125,000, which amounts were paid in cash on the 
closing date. The aggregate purchase price of $111,638,191 was arrived 
at by negotiation among the Company, Leprino Foods Company and 
Mr. Leprino. The Company received the majority of the funds for the 
purchase price pursuant to a Credit Agreement, dated as of December 17, 
1990, among the Company, Chemical Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce, Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, Morgan 
Guaranty Trust Company of New York, Continental Bank N.A., First Bank 
National Association and Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. The Company also 
borrowed additional funds from National Westminster Bank PLC and 
Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A. The Company previously had reduced its 
debt obligations by approximately $136,000,000 in June 1994 upon receipt 
of the proceeds from the divestiture of the Company's Frozen Specialty 
Foods business.

The assets purchased by the Company were used by Leprino Foods 
Company to serve customers in the foodservice industry through a 
full-line foodservice distribution network which supplies primarily 
pizza and select limited menu establishments. The Company intends to 
continue using such assets in the same manner as they were being used 
prior to the transaction and to integrate the Company's Pueringer
distribution business with the business acquired. The Company intends
to lease space in Denver, Colorado for administrative offices for
the specialty foodservice distribution business acquired.

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related

respects, the financial position of Leprino Foodservice Distribution (a 
division of Leprino Foods Company) at June 4, 1994 and October 30, 1993 
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 31 weeks

conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Division's 
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of 
these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,

estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable 
basis for the opinion expressed above.

(A DIVISION OF LEPRINO FOODS COMPANY)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:

General Information

Leprino Foodservice Distribution (FSD, a division of Leprino Foods 
Company) serves customers in the foodservice industry through a full-
line foodservice distribution network which supplies primarily pizza and 
select limited menu multi-unit establishments.

On June 17, 1994, Leprino Foods Company (LFC) and its principal 
shareholder (Shareholder) signed an agreement in principle (Agreement) 
providing for the sale of substantially all of the net assets of LFC's 
foodservice distribution business to a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
International Multifoods Corporation. The Agreement also calls for the 
sale by the Shareholder of three distribution warehouses owned by the 
Shareholder and currently leased by FSD. Additionally, the Agreement 
provides for certain other definitive agreements which include a cheese 
supply agreement that sets forth the buyer's minimum purchase 
obligations for LFC's cheese products over a five-year period and a non-
compete agreement precluding LFC from re-entering the foodservice 
distribution business in the United States for a minimum of five years.

Sales to a significant franchise concept represented 23.5% of FSD's 
sales in 1994 and 25.0% in 1993. No individual franchisee accounted for 
sales in excess of 10% in any period presented.

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation: The accompanying financial statements present 
FSD as if it had existed as a company separate from LFC and includes the 
historical assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that are directly 
related to LFC's foodservice distribution business.

FSD's financial statements include all the direct costs of operating the 
business. General and administrative expenses specifically incurred by 
LFC on behalf of FSD were included while costs which were not incurred 
specifically for any of LFC's divisions were allocated to FSD based on 
relative assets employed during each period. Management believes the 
foregoing allocations were made on a reasonable basis. Nonetheless, the 
financial information included herein may not necessarily reflect the 
financial position and results of operations of FSD in the future or 
what the financial position or results of operations of FSD would have 
been as a separate, stand-alone company during the periods presented.

Fiscal year: LFC and FSD utilize a 52 or 53 week convention, with each 
year ending on the Saturday nearest October 31. Fiscal year 1993 was 52 
weeks. Financial information presented for 1994 is for the 31 week 
period ended June 4, 1994. Due to the seasonal nature of FSD's 
business, the results of operations for the 31 weeks ended June 4, 1994 
are not necessarily representative of such results for a full fiscal 
period.

Accounts receivable and accounts payable: The carrying amount of the 
accounts receivable and accounts payable balances approximate their fair 
value.

Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, 
with cost determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

Interdivisional payable: The interdivisional payable balance reflects 
the interdivisional financing requirements necessary to reflect FSD as a 
separate entity assuming no interdivisional balances were outstanding at 
June 4, 1994. No provision for interest has been made on such 
interdivisional balances.

Property, plant and equipment: Land, building, and equipment are 
capitalized at cost. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line 
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Ordinary repair 
and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Debt: None of the indebtedness of LFC has been secured or 
collateralized by the assets employed in FSD, and accordingly, there 
were no debt instruments or interest costs reflected.

Cash: The only cash allocated to FSD were the nominal petty cash 
balances maintained at the distribution centers.

NOTE 2 - Receivables

Receivables consist of the following (in thousands):

June 4, October 30,
1994 1993

Trade $23,076 $20,112
Other 761 1,114
Allowance for doubtful accounts (1,111) (1,084)

$22,726 $20,142

In 1991, FSD established a $2.4 million reserve for the possible bad 
debt from a major customer. Due to improved circumstances, a portion of 
this reserve was reversed in 1993, resulting in an increase to net 
income of $1.9 million.

NOTE 3 - Inventories

Inventories consist of the following (in thousands):

June 4, October 30,
1994 1993

Resale products $22,057 $21,249
Supplies 313 295

$22,370 $21,544

NOTE 4 - Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):

June 4, October 30,
1994 1993

Land $1,519 $1,519
Building and improvements 8,787 8,656
Machinery and equipment 9,714 9,445
Furniture and fixtures 2,308 2,321
Transportation equipment 7,050 7,516
Construction in progress 2,212 47

31,590 29,504

Less - accumulated depreciation (12,507) (11,756)

$19,083 $17,748

NOTE 5 - Income taxes

LFC is taxed as an S Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code. As 
such, it is not directly liable for federal and, with certain 
exceptions, state income taxes. Rather, LFC's income, deductions, 
losses and credits pass directly through to its stockholders and such 
amounts are included in their individual income tax returns. The 
provision for income taxes for FSD is based upon managements' estimate 
of those state income taxes applicable to FSD.

NOTE 6 - Commitments

LFC leases certain transportation equipment, distribution warehouses, 
and computer equipment applicable to FSD. These leases are accounted 
for as operating leases. The transportation equipment leases expire at 
various times over the next one to seven years and provide for month-to-
month renewals at the end of the primary terms. The facility leases 
generally contain renewal options and escalation clauses and expire over 
the next three years. Minimum gross rental commitments under these 
leases at October 30, 1993 are as follows (in thousands):

1994 $2,905
1995 1,620
1996 1,142
1997 901
1998 503
Thereafter 109

$7,180

Three of the FSD warehouses are leased from the Shareholder. These 
leases expire in 1994. Rental expense under these leases was $516,000 
in 1994 and $906,000 in 1993. 

Aggregate rental expense under all operating leases was $1,541,000 in 
1994 and $2,484,000 in 1993.

NOTE 7 - Employee benefit plans

All full-time employees who have at least one year of continuous 
employment are eligible to participate in the LFC's profit sharing plan. 
LFC's contribution is determined annually by its Board of Directors. 
The portion of the contribution allocated to the employees supporting 
FSD was $1,214,000 in 1993. FSD has accrued $510,000 in the 1994 
results of operations. LFC's policy is to fund amounts accrued. The 
Company may terminate this plan at any time.

LFC has a deferred compensation plan for certain key employees which 
provides long-term incentives and an opportunity to participate in the 
equity appreciation of LFC. Awards under the plan are based upon a 
combination of measured individual performance and financial performance 
of LFC. Vested benefits at the time of retirement, death, disability or 
severance of employment are payable in ten annual installments at the 
time of retirement. The expense for this plan associated with the 
eligible employees engaged directly in FSD totaled $76,000 in 1994 and 
$129,000 in 1993. Such amounts have not been funded. The deferred 
compensation plan has specific provisions for the sale of a division. 
Upon completion of the sale of FSD, the affected key employees will no 
longer be participants of the plan and their balances will be fully 
vested and the associated liability may be funded. LFC has not 
determined the additional cost of this occurrence but the amount is not 
expected to be significant.

LFC established a retirement savings plan (401(k) Plan) on January 1, 
1993, under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees who 
are at least 21 years old and who have completed one year of eligible 
service may become "participants" in the 401(k) Plan. LFC matches 50% 
of the participant's contribution to the 401(k) plan not to exceed 3% of 
the participant's annual compensation or $1,500, if less. The amounts 
expensed for LFC's matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan for 
employees supporting FSD were $129,000 in 1994 and $173,000 for 1993.

The financial statements for the 31 weeks ended June 4, 1994 include 
charges for the portion of LFC's annual budgeted expenses related to the 
profit sharing plan, deferred compensation plan, 401(k) Plan and 
employee bonuses applicable to this period.

In December 1990, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (FAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement 
Benefits Other Than Pensions". There is no postretirement benefit 
obligation associated with the foodservice distribution business.

In November 1992, the FASB issued FAS No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for 
Postemployment Benefits". LFC does not believe that the amount of the 
liability, if any, will be material.

NOTE 8 - Related party transaction

FSD purchases mozzarella cheese products from LFC. During 1994 and 1993 
FSD purchased $17.9 million and $27.1 million, respectively, for resale 
to customers.

INTERNATIONAL MULTIFOODS CORPORATION
Introduction to Pro Forma Consolidated
Condensed Financial Information (Unaudited)

As described in Item 2, on August 22, 1994, the Company completed 
the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Leprino Foods 
Company's specialty foodservice distribution business ("Leprino 
Distribution Business").

As discussed in the Company's Form 8-K dated June 1, 1994, the 
Company completed the divestiture of its Frozen Specialty Foods business 
on June 1, 1994 and its Meats business on May 2, 1994. The divestiture 
of the Frozen Specialty Foods business resulted in a net gain which 
will be reported in the Company's results of operations in the quarter 
ended August 31, 1994.

The following unaudited pro forma financial statements reflect the 
impact of the transactions described above, in the manner described in 
the accompanying notes, to the historical statement of earnings for the 
three months ended May 31, 1994, the statement of operations for the 
year ended February 28, 1994 and the balance sheet as of May 31, 1994.

The pro forma financial information is not intended to reflect the 
results of operations or financial position of the Company which 
actually would have resulted had these transactions occurred on the 
assumed dates.

The pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction 
with the accompanying notes which follow and the historical financial 
statements of the Company included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for 
the year ended February 28, 1994 and its quarterly report on Form 10-Q 
for the three months ended May 31, 1994.

</TABLE>

(a) The pro forma adjustments assume that the Frozen Specialty Foods 
divestiture and the Leprino Distribution Business acquisition took place 
on May 31, 1994. The Meats business divestiture was completed on May 2, 
1994 and, accordingly, the historical balance sheet reflects the effects 
of this transaction. The Frozen Specialty Foods divestiture adjustments 
reflect the application of proceeds, the elimination of assets 
transferred to and liabilities assumed by the buyer, and accruals for 
estimated additional costs directly attributable to the divestiture. 
The application of proceeds from the divestiture are assumed to reduce
debt obligations. The Leprino Distribution Business acquisition adjustments
reflect the purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities, the use of the
Frozen Specialty Foods divestiture proceeds to fund the purchase and the
recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets.

(b) Goodwill and other assets represent an estimate of the intangible 
assets associated with the acquisition.

the elimination of net sales and expenses of the businesses. The net 
gain on the divestiture of the Frozen Specialty Foods business has not 
been included. The pro forma acquisition adjustments include the net 
sales and expenses of the acquired business for the three months ended

integration of the acquired business and the Company's pizza restaurant
distribution business. The pro forma adjustments also do not include 
charges the Company will report in the second quarter ended 
August 31, 1994 for integrating these businesses. The Company is 
currently in the process of estimating the costs associated with the 
integration, which will include the closing of duplicate facilities of 
the Company.

(b) The pro forma adjustment to reduce interest expense from the 
divestitures is the result of net proceeds which were used to reduce debt 
obligations. Net proceeds represent the aggregate sales price reduced by 
additional costs directly attributable to the divestiture transactions, 
including taxes.

(c) The acquisition pro forma adjustment results in an increase to 
interest expense as a result of debt obligations incurred to fund the 
purchase price.

divestitures and the Leprino Distribution Business acquisition took 
place on March 1, 1993. The pro forma divestitures adjustments include 
the elimination of net sales and expenses of the businesses. The impact 
on the net loss per share from the write-down of the Meats business net 
assets was $.67 which is included in the historical statement of 
operations and has not been eliminated in the pro forma results. The pro 
forma acquisition adjustments include the net sales and expenses of the 
acquired business for the fiscal year ended November 30, 1993, 
amortization of goodwill, depreciation and other adjustments based on 
the allocated purchase price of net assets acquired, and calculation of 
income taxes based on the Company's tax rate. The pro forma adjustments 
do not include the benefits from synergies the Company anticipates 
realizing in the future from the integration of the acquired business 
and the Company's pizza restaurant distribution business. The pro forma 
adjustments also do not include charges the Company will report 
in the second quarter ended August 31, 1994 for integrating

(the "Allocation") and that the Allocation shall be used to satisfy the 
requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations for the 
preparation of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594. Each party to this 
Agreement agrees not to assert any allocation of the Purchase Price that 
differs from the Allocation in connection with any income, transfer or 
gains tax return or tax audit or similar proceeding or in connection 
with any other judicial or administrative filing or proceeding before 
any court or any governmental agency charged with the collection of any 
such tax, provided, however, that a party shall not be bound by the 
Allocation in the event the Internal Revenue Service or another tax 
authority successfully challenges the Allocation. If, subsequent to the 
Closing, Seller and Buyer adjust the Purchase Price for any reason, then 
the parties hereto agree to adjust the Allocation in conformity with 
Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
The Purchase Price for the Shareholder's Purchased Assets shall be 
allocated to each parcel of the Shareholder's Owned Real Property in 
accordance with Schedule 3.03; provided, however, that a party shall not 
be bound by such allocation in the event the Internal Revenue Service or 
another tax authority successfully challenges such allocation. In the 
event of any challenge to an allocation by the Internal Revenue Service 
or another tax authority, the parties will give each other notice of the 
challenge and advise each other periodically of the status of such 
challenge and reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to such 
challenge.

3.04 Closing Statement. 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall prepare, with Buyer's 
full participation, a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth 
the Net Assets (as hereinafter defined) of the Distribution Business 
("Closing Net Assets") as of the close of business on the last business 
day immediately preceding the Closing Date. Subject to Section 3.04(f) 
the Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles consistent with those followed in the 
preparation of Seller's audited financial statements, the financial 
statements described in Section 13.01(y) and the Audited Distribution 
Business Financial Statements described in Section 15.01(k), it being 
understood that they shall not include Excluded Assets and prepaid 
expenses in the categories included in Schedule 1.01(l), all Receivables 
shall be valued net of any valid offsets thereto claimed by customers 
and all Inventory shall be valued at the lower of cost or market on a 
first-in, first-out basis consistent with past practice. A physical 
inventory of the Distribution Business shall be conducted by Seller, 
commencing on the second Saturday (or in the case of Phoenix, Arizona; 
the third Saturday) immediately preceding the Closing Date, consistent 
with past practice (and in accordance with the written inventory 
policies of the Distribution Division, copies of which have been 
delivered to Buyer) and brought forward to the close of business on the 
last business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and Buyer 
shall have the right to observe the taking of such physical inventory 
and the reconciliation thereof. The value of the Inventory shown on the 
Closing Statement and included in the determination of the Closing Net 
Assets shall be based on such physical inventory. 

(b) If there are any disputes between Seller and Buyer with 
respect to any matters regarding Closing Net Assets, Seller and Buyer 
shall use all reasonable efforts to resolve such disputes prior to the 
scheduled time of Closing, which resolutions shall be reflected in the 
determination of Closing Net Assets and shall be final and binding and 
not subject to any post- Closing adjustment except as may be necessary 
to correct computational errors.

(c) If there are any disputes between Seller and Buyer with 
respect to matters regarding Closing Net Assets which Seller or Buyer 
conclude they will be unable to resolve prior to the scheduled time of 
Closing, then promptly after either such party reaching such conclusion, 
each party, acting in good faith and exercising reasonable judgment, 
shall prepare a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail 
such matters which remain in dispute and the Closing Net Assets 
determined by such party, and shall submit copies of the same to the 
other party. If the Closing Net Assets set forth in Seller's written 
statement exceed the Closing Net Assets set forth in Buyer's written 
statement by Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) or less, then 
the Closing shall proceed as scheduled based on the average of the 
Closing Net Assets set forth in Seller's and Buyer's written statements, 
which Closing Net Assets (based on the average of the Closing Net Assets 
set forth in Seller's and Buyer's written statements) shall be final and 
binding and not subject to any post-Closing adjustment except as may be 
necessary to correct computational errors. If the Closing Net Assets 
set forth in Seller's written statement exceed the Closing Net Assets 
set forth in Buyer's written statement by more than Two Hundred Fifty 
Thousand Dollars ($250,000), then Seller and Buyer shall immediately 
submit copies of their written statements to Deloitte & Touche or, if 
Deloitte & Touche is unable or unwilling to act, such nationally 
recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by 
Seller and Buyer in writing (the "Arbitrator"). The Arbitrator shall 
review all matters which remain in dispute and endeavor to render in 
writing decisions resolving such matters at or prior to the scheduled 
time of Closing, which decisions shall be reflected in the determination 
of Closing Net Assets (provided that the Closing Net Assets so 
determined shall in no event be less than those set forth in Buyer's 
written statement nor more than those set forth in Seller's written 
statement) and shall be final and binding and not subject to post-
Closing adjustment except as may be necessary to correct computational 
errors. If the Arbitrator informs Seller and Buyer that it is unable at 
or prior to the scheduled time of Closing to render a decision resolving 
all matters which remain in dispute, then, except as set forth in 
Section 3.04(d) hereof, the Closing shall be delayed until such time as 
the parties shall agree or the first business day to occur following the 
date on which all remaining disputes have been resolved, subject to the 
provisions of Section 5.02 hereof, provided that the Arbitrator shall in 
all events render its decision within five (5) business days after the 
previously scheduled time of Closing.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Arbitrator informs 
Seller and Buyer that it is unable at or prior to the scheduled time of 
Closing to render a decision only as to any dispute regarding the value 
of Inventory, then the Closing shall proceed as scheduled based on a 
determination of Closing Net Assets that reflects the average of the 
value of such disputed Inventory set forth in Seller's and Buyer's 
written statements (the "Closing Inventory Amount"). If the value of 
such disputed Inventory set forth in Seller's written statement exceeds 
the value of such disputed Inventory set forth in Buyer's written 
statement by Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) or less in 
the aggregate, then the Closing Inventory Amount shall be the final and 
binding value of such Inventory for purposes of determining Closing Net 
Assets and not subject to any post-Closing adjustment except as may be 
necessary to correct computational errors. If the value of such 
disputed Inventory set forth in Seller's written statement exceeds the 
value of such disputed Inventory set forth in Buyer's written statement 
by more than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) in the 
aggregate, then the Arbitrator shall promptly (but in any event within 
thirty (30) days after the Closing) render in writing a decision 
resolving all remaining disputes regarding such Inventory and Seller or 
Buyer, as the case may be, shall, within ten (10) business days after 
the Arbitrator renders such written decision, make payment to Buyer or 
Seller, as the case may be, by wire transfer in immediately available 
federal funds of the amount, if any, by which the Closing Inventory 
Amount differs from the value of such Inventory determined by the 
Arbitrator (provided that the value determined by the Arbitrator shall 
in no event be more than the value of such Inventory set forth in 
Seller's written statement or less than the value of such Inventory set 
forth in Buyer's written statement), together with interest thereon at a 
rate of 4% per annum from the Closing Date to the date of payment.

(e) The procedures for any arbitration pursuant to this 
Section 3.04 shall be determined by the Arbitrator, provided that all 
disputed matters shall be resolved by the Arbitrator in accordance with 
the provisions of paragraph (f) hereof. A fraction of the fees and 
disbursements of the Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 3.04, the 
numerator of which is the amount by which Seller's determination of 
Closing Net Assets (or Inventory) exceeds the Arbitrator's determination 
and the denominator of which is the difference between Seller's and 
Buyer's determination of Closing Net Assets (or Inventory) set forth in 
their written statements, shall be borne by Seller and the remainder of 
such fees and disbursements of the Arbitrator shall be borne by Buyer. 

(f) As used in this Section 3.04, the term "Net Assets" shall 
mean (i) the book value (net of appropriate reserves) of all of Seller's 
Purchased Assets owned by Seller, less (ii) the book value of all 
Assumed Liabilities (as hereinafter defined); which book value of 
Seller's Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities shall be determined on 
a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles applied 
by Seller in the preparation of Seller's audited financial statements, 
the financial statements described in Section 13.01(y) and Section 
15.01(k) and the methodology set forth in the Statement of Principles 
and Methodology attached as Exhibit B hereto (the "Statement of 
Principles") except for inconsistencies which arise from the methodology 
set forth in Schedule 13.01(y). 

4. Assumption of Certain Liabilities.

to Seller or the Shareholder, to take the benefit of the lease, 
contract, agreement or purchase order, provided that no such election 
shall limit Buyer's rights or remedies arising out of such 
misrepresentation);

(8) any liability or obligation of Seller (a) under any of

the hiring of any such person by Buyer), for which Buyer is not liable 
under Section 10 of this Agreement; 

(9) any liability or obligation of Seller, including without 
limitation worker's compensation claims, (a) arising from any claim made

condition occurring, commencing or in existence during the term of 
employment or engagement by Seller of any employee, former employee, 
agent or representative of Seller, whether or not such person is later

4.02 Nonassumption of Certain Contracts. Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary stated in this Agreement, if (i) any Contract 
is not capable of being sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed without 
the approval, consent or waiver of another party thereto or if such 
sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance without such approval, consent 
or waiver would constitute a violation of or default under the terms of 
a Contract or result in any Lien on any of the Purchased Assets or 
enable another party to a Contract to terminate the Contract or impose a 
penalty or additional payment obligations or accelerate any obligation 
of Seller or Buyer under the Contract, and (ii) all necessary approvals, 
consents and waivers of all parties to such Contract have not been 
obtained on or prior to the Closing, then Buyer shall not be obligated 
to assume such Contract (and if Buyer does not assume such Contract, 
such Contract shall not be included in the Purchased Assets), provided 
that Buyer may, at its sole discretion (so long as Buyer's elected 
conduct is not prohibited by the Contract), elect to assume the 
obligations and liabilities of Seller under such Contract (but not such 
Contract itself), in which event (unless such Contract would have been 
an Excluded Asset regardless of whether such approval, consent or waiver 
was obtained) the claims, rights and benefits of Seller arising under 
such Contract or resulting therefrom (but not such Contract itself) 
shall be included in the Purchased Assets and transferred to Buyer 
hereunder and any such payments or other benefits received by Seller 
therefrom after the Closing shall immediately be transferred by Seller 
to Buyer, and Seller shall, following the Closing, use all reasonable 
efforts to assist Buyer in attempting to obtain the necessary approvals, 
consents and waivers (but shall not be obligated to make any payment in 
exchange for such approval, consent or waiver), and shall promptly 
execute all documents necessary to complete the transfer of such 
Contract if such approvals, consents and waivers are obtained. Nothing 
stated in this Section 4.02 shall affect the right of Buyer to elect not

improvements, parking spaces, encroachments, if any, and utility lines 
to their point of connection with public systems, together with the 
legal description of the Land, which conform to the minimum standard 
detail requirements for land title surveys adopted by ALTA and ACSM in 
1992. Except as noted in Schedule 8.02, the Surveys have been certified 
to Buyer and the Title Company by the respective Registered Land 
Surveyors preparing the Surveys, pursuant to certifications satisfactory 
to Buyer and the Title Company. Seller and/or the Shareholder have paid 
or shall pay the costs of the Surveys.

9. Property Taxes and Utilities.

9.01 Property Taxes. All real estate Taxes and personal 
property Taxes assessed against either the Purchased Assets (including 
without limitation the Owned Real Property) or, to the extent Seller is 
obligated to pay the same under the Middletown Lease or the Phoenix 
Lease, the Leased Real Property, or any amounts assessed against the 
Purchased Assets or the Leased Real Property in lieu thereof 
(collectively the "Property Taxes"), with respect to the tax year (of 
the applicable taxing authority) in which the transactions contemplated 
by this Agreement are consummated, shall be apportioned by and between 
Seller or the Shareholder, as the case may be, and Buyer as of the 
Closing Date, so that Seller or the Shareholder, as the case may be, 
shall be responsible for that portion of the full amount of the Property 
Taxes assessed with respect to such tax year determined by multiplying 
the full amount of such Property Taxes assessed with respect to such tax 
year times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in 
such tax year occurring prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of 
which is the total number of days in such tax year. If the Property 
Taxes assessed with respect to the tax year in which the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated are unknown at the 
Closing Date, then for purposes of the apportionment between Seller or 
the Shareholder and Buyer provided above, such Property Taxes shall be 
deemed to be equal in amount to the Property Taxes assessed with respect 
to the prior tax year. That portion of the full amount of the Property 
Taxes assessed with respect to the tax year in which the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated which Seller or the 
Shareholder shall be responsible for, as provided above, shall be offset 
by Buyer against the amount Buyer would otherwise be obligated to pay 
hereunder for the Seller's Purchased Assets or the Shareholder's 
Purchased Assets, as the case may be, and Buyer shall thereafter be 
obligated to pay such amount to the appropriate taxing authorities when 
the same becomes due and owing. In the event Property Tax statements 
are sent directly to Seller or the Shareholder, Seller or the 
Shareholder, as the case may be, shall cause such statements to be 
forwarded promptly to Buyer. Seller or the Shareholder (i) shall pay, 
at or prior to the Closing, all Property Taxes, including all penalties 
and interest thereon, assessed by the taxing authorities with respect to 
all tax years prior to the tax year in which the transactions 
contemplated in this Agreement are consummated and (ii) shall pay, at or 
prior to the Closing, or accrue on the Closing Statement, all remaining 
installments of special assessments assessed or pending prior to the 
Closing and payable in any tax year (whether such tax year commences or 
ends before or after the Closing Date) with respect to the Owned Real 
Property and (to the extent Seller is obligated to pay the same at any 
time under the Middletown Lease or the Phoenix Lease) the Leasehold 
Estates. 

9.02 Agreements. Seller and Buyer shall prorate, as of the 
Closing Date, based upon the number of days in the applicable period 
occurring before, on and after the Closing Date, all charges and 
payments based on performance over a period of time under each lease or 
other Contract to which Seller is a party that is included in the 
Purchased Assets and shall credit deposits or prepayments to Seller.

9.03 Utilities. Seller, the Shareholder and Buyer will use 
reasonable efforts so that all providers of utility services to the 
Owned Real Property and, to the extent that Seller is being billed 
directly therefor, the Leased Real Property, will bill Seller or the 
Shareholder, as the case may be, for all costs incurred prior to the 
Closing Date and will bill Buyer for all costs incurred on or after the 
Closing Date. If the providers do not submit separate bills, there will 
be such prorations as of the Closing Date respecting such utility costs 
as are equitable. In the event of any such utility prorations, Seller 
or the Shareholder, as the case may be, and Buyer shall read the 
applicable meter(s), if any, and make a written report of each 
respective reading as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary contained above in this paragraph, Seller or the 
Shareholder, as the case may be, shall be responsible for all costs of 
utility services to the Owned Real Property and, to the extent that 
Seller is being billed directly therefor, the Leased Real Property 
incurred prior to the Closing Date. Should the actual costs for such 
period be different from the sum of the utility prorations made at the 
Closing, Seller or the Shareholder, as the case may be, shall promptly 
reimburse Buyer, or the Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller or the 
Shareholder, as the case may be, for any overpayment made thereby, as 
appropriate. 

9.04 Accrued Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary stated herein, no Property Tax, charge, payment or cost shall 
be prorated pursuant to this Section to the extent such Property Tax, 
charge, payment or cost has been reflected on the Seller's Closing 
Statement as an Accrued Liability of Seller and required to be assumed 
by Buyer under Section 4.01 hereof, and in such event any proration 
provided herein shall be made only to the extent the obligation provided 
for in this Section 9 exceeds, or is exceeded by, the amount reflected 
on the Seller's Closing Statement as an Accrued Liability of Seller and 
required to be assumed by Buyer under Section 4.01 hereof. 

9.05 Transfer, Sales and Use Taxes. Seller shall pay all real 
estate transfer Taxes, if any, in connection with the sale and 
conveyance of the Seller's Owned Real Property and the Leasehold Estates 
to Buyer, and all transfer (including, without limitation motor vehicle 
transfer), sales and use Taxes, if any, applicable to the sale and 
transfer of the Seller's Purchased Assets to Buyer. The Shareholder 
shall pay all real estate transfer Taxes, if any, in connection with the 
sale and conveyance of the Shareholder's Owned Real Property to Buyer, 
and all transfer, sales and use Taxes, if any, applicable to the sale 
and transfer of the Shareholder's Purchased Assets to Buyer. Buyer 
agrees to provide Seller with all necessary resale certificates relative 
to such Inventory. 

10. Seller's Employees.

10.01 No Required Offers of Employment. Seller shall, to the 
extent permitted by law, deliver to Buyer, promptly following the 
execution of this Agreement, a list identifying and summarizing the 
employment history of all employees engaged in the Distribution Business 
(including employees at Seller's corporate headquarters whose time is 
primarily dedicated to the Distribution Business) who are active 
employees of Seller immediately prior to the Closing ("Seller's 
Employees") and a summary of the employee benefits currently provided to 
each such employee by Seller, as prepared by Seller, including 
specifically but not limited to the earned (but not taken) and accrued 
vacation, if any, of each of Seller's Employees. To the extent 
permitted by law, Seller shall promptly deliver to Buyer updated lists 
and summaries of the foregoing information as Seller's Employees are 
hired and terminate employment with Seller prior to Closing. Buyer in 
its discretion may determine the Seller's Employees to whom it offers 
employment but shall use reasonable efforts to deliver to Seller at 
least fifteen (15) days prior to Closing a list of all Seller's 
Employees to whom it intends to offer employment. With respect to those 
offers of employment made by Buyer to Seller's Employees, such offered 
employment shall in each case be made at a base salary or hourly rate, 
as the case may be, substantially equivalent to the base salary or 
hourly rate paid to each such employee by Seller immediately prior to 
the Closing Date. Nothing in this Section 10.01 shall obligate Buyer to 
continue the employment of any such employee for any specific period 
following the Closing Date or prevent Buyer from reducing the salary, 
wages and benefits or modifying the duties or working conditions of any 
such employee following the Closing Date or from terminating or 
modifying Employee Plans, as hereinafter defined, or policies of Buyer 
following the Closing Date except as otherwise expressly provided in 
this Section 10. 

10.02 Wages, Salaries, Bonuses, Accrued Vacation and 
Severance. Seller will pay all wages, salaries, bonuses and accrued 
vacation, if any, of the Seller's Employees accrued through the Closing 
Date, and all severance and other amounts, if any, which may become 
payable to or receivable by the Seller's Employees (by contract, as a 
matter of law or otherwise) as a result of the termination of their 
employment with Seller (whether or not such employees are offered or 
accept employment with Buyer), and, as provided in Section 4.01, Buyer 
shall not assume or be responsible for the payment of any such amounts. 
On the Closing Date, Seller shall pay Buyer with respect to each 
Seller's Employee who accepts employment with Buyer an amount equal to 
the earned (but not taken) and accrued vacation, if any, of such person 
(based upon the level of compensation paid by Seller to such person 
immediately prior to the Closing Date) except to the extent such amount 
is reflected as an accrued liability on the Closing Statement, and Buyer 
will recognize entitlement to such accrued vacation of each such 
employee. 

10.03 Buyer's Employee Plans. On the Closing Date, Buyer 
shall establish the Employee Plans (as hereinafter defined) of the 
nature described in Schedule 10.03 or which, in the aggregate, are at 
least substantially as beneficial to such employees as the Employee 
Plans described in Schedule 10.03, subject to the right of Buyer to 
terminate or modify such Employee Plans in its discretion after the 
Closing. Buyer shall not be obligated to establish plans entitling 
employees or former employees of Seller to post-retirement health, 
dental or life insurance benefits or to establish for Seller's Employees 
employed by Buyer after the Closing Employee Plans comparable to any of 
Seller's Employee Plans described in Schedule 13.01(u). To the extent 
such expenses are covered by Buyer's Employee Plans, Buyer will pay, or 
cause the applicable Buyer's Employee Plan to pay, as the case may be, 
any expenses incurred on or after the Closing Date by Seller's Employees 
who become employees of Buyer immediately after Closing and their 
dependents resulting from injuries, disabilities, illnesses or 
conditions incurred by such employees or their dependents prior to the 
Closing Date, other than workers' compensation benefits. Seller shall 
be responsible and liable to pay or make provision for pension, profit 
sharing and welfare benefit amounts under any of Seller's Employee Plans 
through the Closing Date with respect to the Seller's Employees. Buyer 
shall succeed to no rights of Seller under any of Seller's Employee 
Plans and shall neither assume nor incur any liability, including 
liability under Title IV of ERISA (as hereinafter defined), with respect 
to any of Seller's Employee Plans or any entity aggregated with Seller 
under Section 414(b), (c), (m), (n) or (o) of the Code. As used herein, 
the term "Employee Plans" shall mean bonus, incentive compensation, 
deferred compensation, pension, profit-sharing, retirement, stock 
purchase, stock option, life, health, accident, disability, workers' 
compensation, and other employee benefit plans, practices, policies and 
arrangements of any kind, whether written or oral, including, but not 
limited to, employee benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(3) of 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended 
("ERISA"). Buyer shall, solely for eligibility and vesting purposes, 
but not for benefit accrual purposes, or any other purposes whatsoever, 
recognize under Buyer's Employee Plans all past services with Seller of 
Seller's Employees who become employees of Buyer immediately after the 
Closing. 

10.04 Seller's Employees Claims. Without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing, Seller shall pay or cause the applicable 
Seller's Employee Plan to pay, as the case may be, all amounts payable 
in the form of health, dental, sick pay or disability payments, life 
insurance benefits, or otherwise by reason of or in connection with (i) 
any claims filed or expenses incurred resulting from injuries, 
disabilities, illnesses or conditions incurred by Seller's Employees and 
their dependents prior to the Closing Date under any of Seller's 
Employee Plans covering Seller's Employees and their dependents other 
than workers' compensation benefits, (ii) the death of Seller's 
Employees or their dependents prior to the Closing Date or (iii) any 
claims subject to COBRA or any comparable state law relating to 
continuation of such benefits with respect to any individual who had a 
"qualifying event" as defined in COBRA prior to the Closing Date, 
including any claims for such benefits made on or after the Closing 
Date. Seller shall pay all such amounts when due (before or after the 
Closing Date) in accordance with the provisions of any such Seller's 
Employee Plan and the prior practices of Seller.

10.05 Workers' Compensation Benefits. Without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing, Seller shall pay or cause the applicable 
Seller's Employee Plan to pay, as the case may be, all amounts payable 
in the form of workers' compensation benefits in connection with any 
claims resulting from injuries, disabilities, illnesses or conditions 
incurred by Seller's Employees (including without limitation a 
recurrence after the Closing of such an injury, disability, illness or 
condition incurred prior to the Closing) or the death of Seller's 
Employees prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 
10.05, a claim shall be deemed to have been "incurred" on the date of 
occurrence of an injury, or the onset of an illness or condition, or any 
other event giving rise to such claims or series of related claims, and 
any disputes concerning the date of such an occurrence, onset or event 
shall be resolved by determination of a medical expert knowledgeable and 
qualified as to workers' compensation matters acceptable to both Seller 
and Buyer and confirmed by a medical certificate, provided however, that 
Buyer agrees not to assert after the second anniversary of the Closing 
Date that any injury, disability, illness or condition was incurred 
prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if 
with respect to any workers' compensation claim filed after the Closing, 
the medical expert selected by the parties determines that the expense 
of such claim shall be equitably apportioned between Seller and Buyer, 
such claim shall be apportioned as specified in the medical certificate 
delivered by the medical expert. Seller shall pay all such amounts when 
due (before or after the Closing Date) in accordance with the provisions 
of any such Seller's Employee Plan and the prior practices of Seller.

10.06 Non-assumption of Liabilities. Without limiting the 
generality of Section 4.01, Seller acknowledges that in making offers of 
employment to Seller's Employees, Buyer is not assuming any of the 
liabilities of Seller to such Seller's Employees except as set forth in 
Section 10.02. 

10.07 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Without limiting the 
generality of Section 35 hereof, nothing stated in this Section 10 shall 
give any rights, remedies or benefits to any person or entity other than 
the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. 

11. Noncompetition Agreement.

On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, 
at the Closing Seller, the Shareholder and Buyer will execute and 
deliver a noncompetition agreement in substantially the form attached 
hereto as Exhibit H (the "Noncompetition Agreement").

12. Supply Agreement, Transition Services Agreement and 
Cheese Storage Agreement.

On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, 
at the Closing Seller, the Shareholder and Buyer and, in the case of the 
Supply Agreement, Parent will execute and deliver (i) a supply agreement 
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "Supply 
Agreement"), (ii) a transition services agreement in substantially the 
form attached hereto as Exhibit J (the "Transition Services Agreement") 
and (iii) a cheese storage agreement in substantially the form attached 
hereto as Exhibit J-1 (the "Cheese Storage Agreement").

13. Representations and Warranties of Seller and the 
Shareholder.

13.01 Representations and Warranties. Seller and the 
Shareholder hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyer 
and Parent as follows: 

(a) Organization and Qualification of Seller. Seller is a 
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under 
the laws of the State of Colorado. Seller is duly qualified or licensed 
to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the 
operation of its business or ownership of its assets makes such 
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so 
qualified or licensed would not have a material adverse effect upon the 
business, assets, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, 
results of operations or prospects of the Distribution Business or upon 
the enforceability by Seller of any Contract. Each jurisdiction in 
which Seller is qualified to do business is listed in Schedule 13.01(a). 
Seller has the corporate power and authority to own its properties, to 
carry on the Distribution Business as now being conducted by it, and to 
execute, deliver and perform this Agreement, the Noncompetition 
Agreement, the Supply Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the 
Cheese Storage Agreement, the License Agreement, the Livermore Lease (as 
defined in Section 15.01(o)) and the Seller's Conveyance Documents.

(b) Legal Capacity of the Shareholder. The Shareholder has 
the legal capacity to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement, the 
Noncompetition Agreement and the Shareholder's Conveyance Documents.

(c) Authority of Seller. The execution, delivery and 
performance by Seller of this Agreement, the Noncompetition Agreement, 
the Supply Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Cheese 
Storage Agreement, the License Agreement, the Livermore Lease and the 
Seller's Conveyance Documents, and the transactions contemplated herein 
and therein, have been duly and effectively authorized by all necessary 
and required corporate action of Seller.

(d) Due Execution by Seller. This Agreement has been duly 
executed and delivered by Seller and is the valid and binding obligation 
of Seller enforceable against it in accordance with its terms (subject, 
as to enforcement of remedies, to bankruptcy, reorganization, 
insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting 
creditors' rights generally and to general equitable principles). Upon 
due execution and delivery by Seller at the Closing of the 
Noncompetition Agreement, the Supply Agreement, the Transition Services 
Agreement, the Cheese Storage Agreement, the License Agreement, the 
Livermore Lease and the Seller's Conveyance Documents, each such 
agreement or instrument will constitute the valid and binding obligation 
of Seller enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms 
(subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to bankruptcy, reorganization, 
insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting 
creditors' rights generally and to general equitable principles).

(e) Due Execution by the Shareholder. This Agreement has 
been duly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and is the valid and 
binding obligation of the Shareholder enforceable against him in 
accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to 
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and other similar 
laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and to general 
equitable principles). Upon due execution and delivery by the 
Shareholder at the Closing of the Noncompetition Agreement and the 
Shareholder's Conveyance Documents, each such agreement or instrument 
will constitute the valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder 
enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms 
(subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to bankruptcy, reorganization, 
insolvency, moratorium, and other similar laws relating to or affecting 
creditors' rights generally and to general equitable principles).

(f) No Conflict - Seller. The execution, delivery and 
performance by Seller of this Agreement, the Noncompetition Agreement, 
the Supply Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Cheese 
Storage Agreement, the License Agreement, the Livermore Lease and the 
Seller's Conveyance Documents do not and will not violate, conflict 
with, result in a breach or termination of, or constitute a default 
under (or an event which with due notice or lapse of time, or both, 
would constitute a breach of or default under), or require a notice or 
consent under, or result in the creation of any Lien under, or result in 
any penalty or additional payment obligations or the acceleration of any 
obligations under, (i) the charter or bylaws, as amended to date, of 
Seller, (ii) any note, agreement, contract, license, instrument, 
mortgage, deed of trust, lease or other obligation to which Seller is a 
party or by which Seller or any of the Purchased Assets is bound (except 
as set forth in Schedule 13.01(f)), (iii) any judgment, order, writ, 
decree, ruling or injunction of any governmental official, agency, 
instrumentality or other authority applicable to Seller or any of the 
Purchased Assets, or (iv) any statute, law, regulation or rule of any 
governmental agency, instrumentality or other authority applicable to 
Seller or any of the Purchased Assets other than bulk sales laws, 
provided that the parties hereto acknowledge that a filing and the 
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act") is required to 
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) No Conflict - the Shareholder. The execution, delivery 
and performance by the Shareholder of this Agreement, the Noncompetition 
Agreement and the Shareholder's Conveyance Documents, do not and will 
not violate, conflict with, result in a breach or termination of, or 
constitute a default under (or an event which with due notice or lapse 
of time, or both, would constitute a breach of or default under), or 
require a notice or consent under, or result in the creation of any Lien 
under, or result in any penalty or additional payment obligations or the 
acceleration of any obligations under, (i) any note, agreement, 
contract, license, instrument, mortgage, deed of trust, lease or other 
obligation to which the Shareholder is a party or by which the 
Shareholder or any of the Purchased Assets is bound, (ii) any judgment, 
order, writ, decree, ruling or injunction of any governmental official, 
agency, instrumentality or other authority applicable to the Shareholder 
or any of the Purchased Assets, or (iii) any statute, law, regulation or 
rule of any governmental agency, instrumentality or other authority 
applicable to the Shareholder or any of the Purchased Assets. 

(h) Real Property. Seller uses and occupies the Owned Real 
Property and the Leased Real Property, and has good and marketable title 
in fee simple to the Seller's Owned Real Property and a good and 
marketable leasehold interest in the Leasehold Estates free and clear of 
any and all Liens other than Permitted Title Exceptions. The 
Shareholder has good and marketable title in fee simple to the 
Shareholder's Owned Real Property free and clear of any and all Liens 
other than Permitted Title Exceptions. Except as set forth in Schedule 
13.01(h), there are no current or pending special assessments against 
the Owned Real Property. Neither Seller nor the Shareholder has granted 
to any person or entity any right of first refusal, right of first 
opportunity, option or similar rights to purchase the Owned Real 
Property or any interest therein or part thereof or any interest in the 
Leasehold Estates or any Leased Real Property. Neither Seller nor the 
Shareholder has received notice since June 30, 1992 from any insurance 
company that it will require alteration of any Owned Real Property or 
Leased Real Property for continuance of a policy insuring the Owned Real 
Property or Leased Real Property or the maintenance of rates with 
respect thereto nor have either of them entered into any, and to the 
knowledge of Seller or the Shareholder, there is no, development 
agreement or agreement that limits either of their ability to protest 
taxes, fixes minimum taxes or requires continued business operations. 
All water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone, drainage and other utility 
equipment, facilities and services now used for the operation of the 
Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property are adequate to service 
Seller's use of such properties. Except as shown on the Surveys, each 
principal building, improvement or structure on each parcel of real 
estate constituting a part of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real 
Property is located within the boundary lines of such parcel and does 
not encroach onto any easement area or extend beyond any set-back line. 
Except with respect to Environmental Laws, as to which separate 
representations and warranties are made in Section 13.01(l), the Owned 
Real Property and the Leased Real Property are in compliance in all 
material respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws, 
ordinances, rules, bylaws and regulations, and all applicable insurance 
requirements, including, but not limited to, laws, ordinances, rules, 
bylaws and regulations pertaining to zoning matters, and conform to all 
such requirements on a current basis without reliance on any so-called 
"grandfather" or other exception and without reliance on any variance or 
other special limitation or condition or special use permit, including 
without limitation the Americans with Disabilities Act. Except as set 
forth in the Title Commitments or Surveys, the buildings and 
improvements constituting a part of the Owned Real Property and the 
Leased Real Property do not rely on any facilities (other than the 
facilities of the public utility and community water and sewer 
companies) not located on the Land or the real estate subject to the 
Middletown Lease or the Phoenix Lease (i) to fulfill any zoning, 
building code or other municipal or governmental requirement, (ii) for 
structural support or the furnishing to such buildings and improvements 
of any essential buildings systems utilities, including, but not limited 
to, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, heating, ventilating and air 
conditioning systems, or (iii) to fulfill requirements of any lease. 
There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Seller or the Shareholders, 
threatened actions or proceedings regarding condemnation or other 
eminent domain actions or proceedings with respect to the Owned Real 
Property or the Leased Real Property, or any part or parts thereof. 
Except for the Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property, 
customers' places of business and warehouses used to make deliveries to 
customers, and public roads, no real property is regularly used in the 
operation of the Distribution Business. 

(i) Personal Property. Seller possesses and has good title 
to the Equipment, Inventory, Receivables and all other personal property 
included in the Purchased Assets free and clear of any and all Liens. 
Schedule 1.01(c) hereto correctly lists and describes all material 
Equipment. Except for the motor vehicles and other personal property 
leased by Seller pursuant to leases which are listed in Schedule 1.01(i) 
hereto, no personal property is used in the operation of the 
Distribution Business or is located on the Land or the real estate 
constituting a part of the Leased Real Property other than the personal 
property included in the Purchased Assets or included in the Excluded 
Assets. Except for personal property included within the definition of 
the Shareholder's Owned Real Property or the Excluded Assets, the 
Shareholder neither owns nor has any interest in the Equipment 
identified in Section 1.01(c) or any other personal property used in the 
operation of the Distribution Business or located on the Land or the 
real estate constituting a part of the Leased Real Property. EXCEPT AS 
SET FORTH EXPRESSLY IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER AND THE SHAREHOLDER 
DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASED 
ASSETS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS, 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 

(j) Proceedings. Except as disclosed on Schedule 13.01(j) 
attached hereto and made a part hereof, there is no action, suit, 
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Seller or 
the Shareholder, threatened against Seller, the Shareholder or any of 
the Purchased Assets (and, to the knowledge of Seller and the 
Shareholder, no claim has been asserted against Seller, the Shareholder 
or any of the Purchased Assets) which, if decided adversely to such 
person or any of the Purchased Assets, may (i) prevent the consummation 
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date, 
or (ii) place a Lien before, on or after the Closing Date upon the 
Purchased Assets or any item or part thereof, or (iii) have an adverse 
effect upon the Distribution Business. None of Seller, the Shareholder 
or the Purchased Assets are subject to any judicial or administrative 
judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or restraint, or in violation 
of any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, ordinance or code, 
with respect to the use, occupancy or right to sell and convey the 
Purchased Assets or the operation of the Distribution Business or which 
would otherwise have an adverse effect upon the Distribution Business.

(k) Notices. No notices have been issued and served upon 
Seller or the Shareholder by any governmental authority having 
jurisdiction over the Purchased Assets ordering Seller or the 
Shareholder to make any alterations or repairs to the Purchased Assets 
alleged by such governmental authority to be required by any ordinance, 
rule, regulation or law, or to correct any condition of the Purchased 
Assets alleged by such governmental authority not to comply with any 
ordinance, rule, regulation or law, which have not been made or 
corrected.

(l) Environmental Matters. No Hazardous Substances (as 
hereinafter defined) have been released, emitted or disposed of, or 
otherwise deposited, on or in any of the Owned Real Property or the 
Leased Real Property by Seller or the Shareholder or, to the knowledge 
of Seller or the Shareholder, by any other person which have been in 
quantities, or involved methods of containment or use, that violate any 
Environmental Laws.

Neither the Owned Real Property nor the Leased Real Property 
is being used, or, to the knowledge of Seller or the Shareholder, has 
ever been primarily used, in connection with the business of 
manufacturing, storing, transporting, handling, disposing or treating 
Hazardous Substances.

Neither Seller nor the Shareholder has generated at or 
transported from any of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real 
Property any Hazardous Substances at any time which have been 
transported to or disposed of in any landfill or other facility, which 
transportation or disposal (under laws applicable as of the date hereof 
to the landfill or other facility) could create liability to any unit of 
government or any third party. 

Except as disclosed in Schedule 13.01(l), there is no 
Environmental Claim (as hereinafter defined) pending or, to the 
knowledge of Seller or the Shareholder, threatened against Seller or the 
Shareholder or against any person or entity whose liability for such 
Environmental Claim Seller or the Shareholder have or may have retained 
or assumed either contractually or by operation of law. 

Except as disclosed in Schedule 13.01(l), there are no present 
or, to the knowledge of Seller or the Shareholder, past actions, 
activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents, that could 
form the basis of any Environmental Claim against Seller or the 
Shareholder or against any person or entity whose liability for such 
Environmental Claim Seller or the Shareholder have or may have retained 
or assumed either contractually or by operation of law. 

Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
(a) all underground storage tanks or other containment facilities of any 
kind deposited, placed or buried by, or pursuant to authorization of, 
Seller or any of its affiliates on the Owned Real Property or the Leased 
Property (whether currently or formerly located on the Owned Real 
Property or the Leased Real Property) or, to the knowledge of Seller or 
the Shareholder, otherwise currently or otherwise formerly located on 
the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property are identified in

of others that are distributed by Seller) and, to the knowledge of 
Seller and the Shareholder, there has been no infringement by any third

(u) Seller's Employee Plans. Schedule 13.01(u) attached 
hereto and made a part hereof lists and generally describes all Employee 
Plans covering the Seller's Employees ("Seller's Employee Plans"). 
Seller has furnished to Buyer with respect to each of such Employee 
Plans a copy thereof and the most recent summary plan description. The 
provisions and operation of such Employee Plans are not in violation in 
any material respect of any provision of ERISA, the Code, or any other 
statute, rule, regulation, agreement or instrument by which they are 
governed. All applicable ERISA requirements as to the filing of 
reports, documents and notices regarding such Employee Plans with the 
Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service and the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the furnishing of such documents to 
participants and beneficiaries, have been complied with in all material 
respects. Except as disclosed in Schedule 13.01(j), there are no

claims, lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted 
against such Employee Plans or any fiduciaries thereof respecting their

such plans or respecting any benefits payable under such plans. Since 
January 1, 1989, neither Seller nor any entity affiliated with Seller

ERISA or contributed on behalf of Seller's Employees to any multi-
employer plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

(v) Taxes. Seller has duly and timely filed all state and 
local Tax returns and reports required to be filed by it that relate in 
whole or part to the Distribution Business, and has paid all Taxes 
(including all interest, penalties, assessments and deficiencies) due or 
claimed to be due under such duly filed tax returns, or has made 
provision therefor. The Shareholder has duly and timely filed all 
Property Tax returns and reports required to be filed by it relating to 
the Shareholder's Owned Real Property and has paid all Property Taxes 
(including all interest, penalties, assessments and deficiencies) due 
under such duly filed tax returns, or has made provision therefor. 
Seller is not delinquent, and there are no material asserted or assessed 
deficiencies that have not been settled, with respect to the payment of 
any sales, use and withholding Taxes, other employee benefit Taxes or 
Property Taxes, if any, payable by it with respect to the Distribution 
Business, the Purchased Assets or Seller's Employees (collectively 
"Seller's Covered Taxes") (whether or not shown on any filed tax return) 
and the Shareholder is not delinquent with respect to the payment of any 
Property Taxes payable by it with respect to the Shareholder's Owned 
Real Property (whether or not shown on any filed tax return). Seller 
has made a valid and effective election to be treated as an S 
corporation for income tax purposes and such election has not been 
revoked or terminated. None of the Purchased Assets constitutes "tax

and Seller is not a party to any lease relating to the Distribution 
Business that is made pursuant to Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954, as amended. There are no alleged material Tax 
deficiencies of Seller proposed or discussed by the IRS or other 
appropriate tax authority with Seller (whether or nor such matters have 
been settled) that involve the Distribution Business, Seller's Purchased 
Assets or Seller's Employees that are likely to be proposed or asserted 
against Buyer or the Purchased Assets if Buyer continues to operate the 
Distribution Business after the Closing in substantially the same manner 
as it has been operated by Seller. To the knowledge of Seller and the 
Shareholder, no tax returns of Seller with respect to such issues (and 
no Property Tax returns of the Shareholder or Seller with respect to 
Seller's Owned Real Property, the Equipment or the Shareholder's Owned 
Real Property or other Tax returns of Seller relating to Seller's 
Covered Taxes or other state and local Tax returns of Seller) filed or 
required to be filed are being examined (nor has any action, audit, 
proceeding or investigation been threatened, to the knowledge of Seller 
or the Shareholder) by the Internal Revenue Service or other appropriate 
taxing authority that is out of the ordinary course of business of 
Seller or the Distribution Business or that has the possibility of a 
material adverse effect on Seller or the Distribution Business if 
decided adversely to Seller. There has been no waiver or extension of 
any applicable statute of limitations for the assessment or collection 
of any Seller's Covered Taxes or state or local Taxes granted by Seller 
(or for the assessment or collection of any Property Taxes with respect 
to the Shareholder's Owned Real Property granted by the Shareholder).

Shareholder is a "foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445 of

than $5,000,000 of revenues for fiscal 1993 or $3,000,000 of revenues

Seller's suppliers or customers intends to cancel or otherwise modify 
its relationship with Seller in any manner which individually or in the 
aggregate with respect to all such parties, if any, would have a 
material adverse effect on the business, assets, condition (financial or 
otherwise), operations, results of operations or prospects of the 
Distribution Business; and the purchase of the Purchased Assets by Buyer 
will not, to the knowledge of Seller or the Shareholder, materially and 
adversely affect the relationship of any supplier or customer with the 
Distribution Business.

balance sheet of the Distribution Business as of June 4, 1994, and 
unaudited statements of earnings of the Distribution Business for the

respects the financial position of the Distribution Business as of its 
date and the results of operations of the Distribution Business for the 
period then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles consistently applied except as disclosed in Schedule 
13.01(y). Other than as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against 
in the most recent balance sheet of the Distribution Business referred

had in effect since October 30, 1993, and Seller has received no 
payments, other than payments disclosed in writing to Buyer, under, any

remedies, to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and 
other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally 
and to general equitable principles). Upon due execution and delivery 
by Buyer and Parent at the Closing of the Supply Agreement and by Buyer 
of the Noncompetition Agreement, the Cheese Storage Agreement, the 
Transition Services Agreement, the Seller's Bill of Sale and Assumption 
Agreement, the License Agreement, the Livermore Lease and the 
Assignments of Lease, each such agreement will constitute the valid and 
binding obligation of Buyer enforceable against it in accordance with 
its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to bankruptcy, 
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws relating 
to or affecting creditors' rights generally and to general equitable 
principles).

(d) No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by 
Buyer and Parent of this Agreement and the Supply Agreement and by Buyer 
of the Noncompetition Agreement, the Cheese Storage Agreement, the 
Transition Services Agreement, the Seller's Bill of Sale and Assumption 
Agreement, the License Agreement, the Livermore Lease and the 
Assignments of Lease do not and will not violate, conflict with, result 
in a breach of, or constitute a default under (or an event which with 
due notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a breach of or 
default under), or require a consent under, (i) the charter or bylaws, 
as amended to date, of Buyer or Parent, (ii) any note, agreement, 
contract, license, instrument, mortgage, deed of trust, lease or other 
obligation to which Buyer or Parent is a party or by which Buyer or 
Parent is bound, (iii) any judgment, order, writ, decree, ruling or 
injunction of any governmental official, agency, instrumentality or 
other authority applicable to Buyer or Parent or (iv) any statute, law, 
rule or regulation of any governmental agency, instrumentality or other 
authority applicable to Buyer or Parent, provided that the parties 
hereto acknowledge that a filing and the expiration or termination of 
the waiting period under the HSR Act is required to consummate the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Proceedings. There is no action, suit, proceeding or 
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer or Parent, 
threatened against Buyer or Parent which, if decided adversely to Buyer 
or Parent, may prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated 
by this Agreement on the Closing Date.

(f) Brokers; Finders. Neither Buyer nor Parent is under any 
commitment or obligation to any broker or agent whereby a finder's, 
brokerage or other middleman's commission is payable or whereby any 
claim therefor may be validly made with respect to the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) Sole Shareholder. Parent is the sole shareholder of 
Buyer and will receive a significant benefit from Buyer's execution and 
performance of this Agreement. 

(h) Disclosure. None of the foregoing representations and 
warranties contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to 
state any material fact necessary to make any such representations and 
warranties not misleading. The term "knowledge of Buyer or Parent" and 
its grammatical equivalents means the actual present knowledge of any 
director or officer of Buyer or Parent. 

14.02 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The 
liability of Buyer or Parent for the representations and warranties made 
to Seller and the Shareholder in Section 14.01 shall survive the Closing 
and shall not merge with and into any instrument or document required to 
be executed by Buyer or Parent and delivered to Seller or the 
Shareholder pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property shall not have 
been damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty to such a 
substantial extent as to materially and adversely affect the occupancy 
thereof by Buyer or the contemplated use thereof by Buyer in the 
operation of the Distribution Business and there shall have been no

statements and the Statement of Principles (except as disclosed in 
Schedule 13.01(y)), which Audited Distribution Business Financial 
Statements shall be certified by Price Waterhouse, whose opinion 
regarding the Audited Distribution Business Financial Statements shall 
be unqualified. Seller and Buyer each shall pay one-half of the cost of 
preparing the Audited Distribution Business Financial Statements and 
reasonable and necessary costs incidental to their preparation such as 
conferences with the accountants of Buyer and Parent, and Buyer and 
Parent shall have the right to approve the engagement letter for such 
audit. Buyer, Parent and their accountants shall have the right to

representation and warranty by the Shareholder shall be to his 
knowledge) that each of the Audited Distribution Business Financial 
Statements presents fairly the financial position of the Distribution 
Business as of its date and the results of operations of the 
Distribution Business for the period then ended, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied except as 
disclosed in Schedule 13.01(y). The representations and warranties 
contained in the certificate shall be deemed to constitute 
representations and warranties under this Agreement. In no event shall 
Buyer or Parent be obligated to consummate this Agreement, and the 
transactions contemplated hereunder, unless (i) the Audited Distribution 
Business Financial Statements as of, and for the fiscal years ended on, 
the same dates as the unaudited financial statements of the Distribution 
Business described in Section 13.01(y) are, in Buyer's and Parent's 
reasonable judgment, no less favorable in all material respects than 
such respective unaudited financial statements described in Section 
13.01(y), and (ii) the income before provision for income taxes of 
Seller for the thirty-one week period ended June 4, 1994 and fiscal 
years ended October 30, 1993 and October 31,1992, as shown on the 
Audited Distribution Business Financial Statements, is at least 
$2,950,000, $6,900,000 and $4,800,000, respectively.

(l) Buyer shall have conducted at its cost such environmental 
site investigations, assessments and tests of the Owned Real Property 
and the Leased Real Property as Buyer shall determine to be necessary or 
advisable, which environmental site investigations, assessments and 
tests shall disclose no environmental conditions which could result in 
any liability, cost or expense to Buyer or any other past, present or 
future owner, user or occupant of the Owned Real Property or such Leased 
Real Property other than those disclosed in Schedule 13.01(l).

(m) No injunction or order of any court or administrative 
agency of competent jurisdiction shall be in effect as of the Closing 
Date which restrains or prohibits the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement. 

(n) Seller and the Shareholder shall have delivered to Buyer 
an affidavit (a so-called "FIRPTA affidavit") in form and substance 
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer duly executed and acknowledged, 
certifying facts that would exempt the transactions contemplated hereby 
from the provisions of the Foreign Investors Real Property Tax Act. 

(o) Seller and Buyer shall have entered into a lease in 
substantially the form of Exhibit L hereto (the "Livermore Lease") 
providing for the lease by Buyer to Seller of a portion of Seller's Land 
in Livermore, California. 

(p) The parties shall have complied with the HSR Act and the 
waiting period thereunder shall have expired or been terminated.

15.02 Effect of Failure to Satisfy. If any or all of the 
conditions precedent to Buyer's and Parent's obligation hereunder set 
forth in this Section 15 have not been satisfied or fulfilled to Buyer's 
and Parent's satisfaction at or before the Closing or any extension 
thereof pursuant to Section 5.02, and Buyer and Parent have not 
expressly waived, in writing, any such unsatisfied condition at or 
before the Closing or any extension thereof pursuant to Section 5.02, 
then this Agreement and the obligations and rights of the parties under 
this Agreement shall terminate and be cancelled, and none of Seller, the 
Shareholder, Buyer or Parent shall have any further obligations or 
liabilities to the others, except for any claims of default under this 
Agreement by any of them against any of the others which shall have 
accrued prior to the effective date of termination and cancellation of 
this Agreement.

16. Conditions Precedent to Seller's and the Shareholder's

16.01 Conditions Precedent. The obligation of Seller and the 
Shareholder to consummate this Agreement, and the transactions

hereunder set forth in this Section 16 have not been satisfied or

Seller and the Shareholder have not expressly waived, in writing, any 
such unsatisfied condition at or before the Closing or any extension

against any of the others which shall have accrued prior to the 
effective date of the termination and cancellation of this Agreement.

17. Indemnification of Buyer and Parent by Seller and the 
Shareholder.

Seller and the Shareholder hereby jointly and severally 
agree to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and Parent and all directors 
and officers thereof (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees" and 
individually a "Buyer Indemnitee") against and with respect to:

(a) Any and all liabilities and obligations of Seller or the 
Shareholder, contingent or otherwise, that are not expressly assumed and 
agreed to be paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 4 hereof, including 
without limitation all liabilities and obligations of Seller and the 
Shareholder for Taxes except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 
4.01 and Section 9.01; 

(b) Any and all losses, injuries, damages, deficiencies, 
liabilities and obligations directly or indirectly resulting or arising 
from the ownership or condition of the Purchased Assets, the operation 
of the Distribution Business, or from incidents or occurrences relating 
to the Distribution Business or the Purchased Assets, prior to the 
Closing, whether or not reflected in the books and records of Seller or 
the Shareholder, except to the extent expressly assumed and agreed to be 
paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 4 hereof;

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any and 
all losses, injuries, damages, deficiencies, liabilities and obligations 
directly or indirectly resulting or arising from (i) products liability 
or similar claims in respect to products purchased, manufactured or sold 
by Seller prior to the Closing or (ii) any litigation, proceeding or 
investigation with respect to Seller required to be disclosed in any 
Schedule hereto;

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any and 
all losses, injuries, damages, deficiencies, liabilities and obligations 
directly or indirectly resulting or arising from (i) subject to Sections 
10.02 and 10.03, claims by employees, former employees, agents or 
representatives of Seller with respect to their employment or engagement 
by Seller prior to or after Closing or the termination thereof by Seller 
at, prior to or after Closing, and (ii) subject to Section 10.05, 
worker's compensation claims of employees or former employees of Seller 
arising out of incidents, occurrences or conditions occurring, 
commencing or existing prior to Closing;

(e) Any and all losses, injuries, damages, deficiencies, 
liabilities and obligations directly or indirectly resulting or arising 
from any misrepresentation or breach of warranty on the part of Seller 
or the Shareholder under this Agreement or any certificate given 
pursuant hereto;

(f) Any and all losses, injuries, damages, deficiencies, 
liabilities and obligations directly or indirectly resulting or arising 
from any non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of 
Seller or the Shareholder under this Agreement (including without 
limitation such covenants of Seller under Section 10 hereof); 

(g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any and 
all losses, injuries, damages, deficiencies, liabilities and obligations 
directly or indirectly resulting or arising from any failure to comply 
fully with any applicable bulk transfer laws, except to the extent 
assumed and agreed to be paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 4 hereof;

(h) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any and 
all rebate or discount payments made by Buyer to any customer of Seller 
pursuant to any trade allowance, billback, rebate, discount or similar 
program which Seller has in effect with respect to its customers but 
which Seller has failed to disclose on Schedule 13.01(aa) hereto;

(i) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any and 
all losses, injuries, damages, deficiencies, liabilities and obligations 
directly or indirectly resulting or arising from any release or emission 
of Hazardous Substances on, in or from Owned Real Property or Leased 
Real Property during such person's (whether Seller's or the 
Shareholder's) ownership or lease of such Owned Real Property or Leased 
Real Property;

(j) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any and 
all losses, injuries, damages, deficiencies, liabilities and obligations 
directly or indirectly resulting or arising from the Manufacturing 
Business or the LTC Business or any other operations of Seller other 
than the Distribution Business; and 

(k) Any and all demands, claims, actions, suits, proceedings, 
assessments, judgments, costs and reasonable legal and other expenses 
incident to the foregoing, to the extent such person, whether Seller or 
the Shareholder, has indemnification obligations for the foregoing.

The indemnification obligations of Seller and the Shareholder hereunder 
relate to indemnification for all losses, injuries, damages, 
deficiencies, liabilities, obligations, costs or expenses to a Buyer 
Indemnitee, regardless of whether such loss, injury, damage, deficiency, 
liability, obligation, cost or expense arises from a third-party claim 
against such Buyer Indemnitee or otherwise.

If a third-party claim is made against a Buyer Indemnitee and 
if such Buyer Indemnitee believes that such claim could give rise to a 
right of indemnification under any of Section 17(a) through (j) against 
Seller and/or the Shareholder, then such Buyer Indemnitee shall given 
written notice to Seller and/or the Shareholder, as the case may be, of 
such claim as soon as reasonably practicable after such Buyer Indemnitee 
has received notice thereof (provided that failure to give timely notice 
shall not limit the indemnification obligations of Seller and the 
Shareholder hereunder except to the extent that the delay in giving, or 
failure to give, such notice has a material adverse effect upon the 
ability of Seller and the Shareholder to defend against the claim). 
Such Buyer Indemnitee shall give Seller and the Shareholder an 
opportunity to defend such claim, at Seller's and the Shareholder's own 
expense and with counsel selected by them and reasonably satisfactory to 
such Buyer Indemnitee, provided that such Buyer Indemnitee shall at all 
times also have the right to fully participate in the defense at its own 
expense (and may retain its own counsel at the expense of Seller and/or 
the Shareholder, as the case may be, if it shall reasonably conclude 
that representation of it and Seller or the Shareholder by the same 
counsel would present a conflict). Failure of Seller and the 
Shareholder to give a Buyer Indemnitee written notice of their election 
to defend such claim within ten (10) days after notice thereof shall 
have been given by such Buyer Indemnitee to Seller and the Shareholder 
shall be deemed a waiver by Seller and the Shareholder of their right to 
defend such claim. If Seller and the Shareholder shall elect not to 
assume the defense of such claim (or if Seller and the Shareholder shall 
be deemed to have waived their right to defend such claim by failure to 
make an election within the ten (10) day time period) or shall not 
diligently pursue such defense, such Buyer Indemnitee shall have the 
right, but not the obligation, to undertake the defense of, and to 
compromise or settle (exercising reasonable business judgment), the 
claim on behalf, for the account, and at the risk and expense (including 
without limitation the payment of the reasonable attorneys' fees of such 
Buyer Indemnitee regardless of whether the Buyer Indemnitee prevails 
against the third party claim), of Seller and the Shareholder. If 
Seller and the Shareholder assume the defense of such claim, the 
obligation of Seller and the Shareholder hereunder as to such claim 
shall include taking all steps necessary in the defense or settlement of 
such claim.

Neither Seller nor the Shareholder shall consent to the entry 
of any judgment or settle or compromise any third-party demands, claims, 
actions, suits or proceedings for which a Buyer Indemnitee has sought 
indemnification from Seller or the Shareholder unless it shall have 
given such Buyer Indemnitee not less than fifteen (15) days prior 
written notice of the proposed consent, settlement or compromise, and 
afforded such Buyer Indemnitee an opportunity to consult with Seller and 
the Shareholder regarding the proposed consent, settlement or 
compromise, and shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter 
into any settlement or compromise without the approval of such Buyer 
Indemnitee. A Buyer Indemnitee shall not unreasonably withhold or delay 
its approval of a proposed consent, settlement or compromise; in 
determining whether to give its approval, a Buyer Indemnitee may 
consider whether the proposed consent, settlement or compromise (1) 
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant to 
such Buyer Indemnitee of a release from all liability in respect of such 
claim except the liability satisfied by Seller or the Shareholder or (2) 
would have a material adverse effect upon Buyer's future conduct of the 
Distribution Business.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided elsewhere in 
this Agreement:

(i) the obligations of Seller and the Shareholder under this 
Agreement to indemnify a Buyer Indemnitee shall be joint and several; 
provided, however, that (a) Buyer and Parent agree to include Seller in 
any claim brought against the Shareholder and (b) Seller and the 
Shareholder shall be liable to the Buyer Indemnitee for amounts payable 
only under Section 17 (other than claims of the nature described in 
clause (ii) hereof) only to the extent such amounts in the aggregate 
exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and in no event shall 
Seller and the Shareholder be liable to the Buyer Indemnitee under 
Section 17 (other than for claims of the nature described in any of 
clause (ii)(A) and (ii)(B) inclusive hereof and third-party claims) for 
amounts which exceed $50,000,000 in the aggregate;

(ii) except with respect to (A) claims based upon a breach of 
any representation or warranty of Seller or the Shareholder pertaining 
to unencumbered title to the Purchased Assets, (B) claims based upon 
fraud or intentional misrepresentations by Seller or the Shareholder 
(all of which claims and obligations described in clauses (A) and (B) 
shall survive indefinitely), (C) claims based upon a breach of any 
representation or warranty of Seller or the Shareholder pertaining to 
compliance with Environmental Laws or other breaches of Section 13.01(l) 
or indemnification claims under Section 17(i) (which claims described in 
this clause (C) shall be of no force unless a Buyer Indemnitee has given 
Seller and the Shareholder written notice prior to the third anniversary 
date of the Closing Date), and (D) the representations and warranties 
under Section 13.01(q), which shall not survive the Closing, the 
obligations of Seller and the Shareholder under this Agreement to 
indemnify Buyer Indemnitees shall be of no force with respect to claims 
as to which a Buyer Indemnitee has not given Seller and the Shareholder 
written notice prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; and

(iii) without limiting rights to indemnification for claims 
arising from punitive damages attributable to third party claims, Buyer 
and Parent agree that they will not assert direct claims for punitive 
damages against Seller or the Shareholder.

18. Indemnification of Seller and the Shareholder by Buyer 
and Parent.

Buyer and Parent hereby jointly and severally agree to 
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and the Shareholder and all directors 
and officers of Seller (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees" and 
individually, a "Seller Indemnitee") against and with respect to:

(a) Any and all Assumed Liabilities set forth in Section 4 of 
this Agreement;

(b) Any and all losses, injuries, damages, deficiencies, 
liabilities and obligations directly or indirectly resulting or arising 
from any misrepresentation or breach of warranty on the part of Buyer or 
Parent under this Agreement or any certificate given pursuant hereto;

(c) Any and all losses, injuries, damages, deficiencies, 
liabilities and obligations directly or indirectly resulting or arising 
from any non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of 
Buyer or Parent under this Agreement (including without limitation such 
covenants of Buyer under Section 10 hereof); 

(d) Any and all demands, claims, actions, suits, proceedings, 
assessments, judgments, costs and reasonable legal and other expenses 
incident to the foregoing.

The indemnification obligations of Buyer and Parent hereunder relate to 
indemnification for all losses, injuries, damages, deficiencies, 
liabilities, obligations, costs or expenses to a Seller Indemnitee, 
regardless of whether such loss, injury, damage, deficiency, liability, 
obligation, cost or expense arises from a third-party claim against such 
Seller Indemnitee or otherwise.

If a third-party claim is made against a Seller Indemnitee, 
and if such Seller Indemnitee believes that such claim could give rise 
to a right of indemnification under any of Section 18(a) through (c) 
against Buyer and Parent, then such Seller Indemnitee shall give written 
notice to Buyer and Parent of such claim as soon as reasonably 
practicable after such Seller Indemnitee has received notice thereof 
(provided that failure to give timely notice shall not limit the 
indemnification obligations of Buyer and Parent hereunder except to the 
extent that the delay in giving, or failure to give, such notice has a 
material adverse effect upon the ability of Buyer and Parent to defend 
against the claim). Such Seller Indemnitee shall give Buyer and Parent 
an opportunity to defend such claim, at Buyer's and Parent's own expense 
and with counsel selected by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to such 
Seller Indemnitee, provided that such Seller Indemnitee shall at all 
times also have the right to fully participate in the defense at its own 
expense (and may retain its own counsel at the expense of Buyer and 
Parent if it shall determine that representation of it and Buyer or 
Parent by the same counsel would present a conflict). Failure of Buyer 
and Parent to give a Seller Indemnitee written notice of their election 
to defend such claim within ten (10) days after notice thereof shall 
have been given by such Seller Indemnitee to Buyer and Parent shall be 
deemed a waiver by Buyer and Parent of their right to defend such claim. 
If Buyer and Parent shall elect not to assume the defense of such claim 
(or if Buyer and Parent shall be deemed to have waived their right to 
defend such claim by failure to make an election within the ten (10) day 
period) or shall not diligently pursue such a defense, such Seller 
Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to undertake 
the defense of, and to compromise or settle (exercising reasonable 
business judgment), the claim on behalf, for the account, and at the 
risk and expense (including without limitation the payment of the 
reasonable attorneys' fees of such Seller Indemnitee regardless of 
whether the Seller Indemnitee prevails against the third party claim), 
of Buyer and Parent. If Buyer and Parent assume the defense of such 
claim, the obligation of Buyer and Parent hereunder as to such claim 
shall include taking all steps necessary in the defense or settlement of 
such claim.

Neither Buyer nor Parent shall consent to the entry of any 
judgment or settle or compromise any third-party demands, claims, 
actions, suits or proceedings for which a Seller Indemnitee has sought 
indemnification from Buyer and Parent unless it shall have given such 
Seller Indemnitee not less than fifteen (15) days prior written notice 
of the proposed consent, settlement or compromise, and afforded such 
Seller Indemnitee an opportunity to consult with Buyer and Parent 
regarding the proposed consent, settlement or compromise, and shall not 
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or 
compromise without the approval of such Seller Indemnitee. A Seller 
Indemnitee shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its approval of a 
proposed consent, settlement or compromise; in determining whether to 
give its approval, a Seller Indemnitee may consider whether the proposed 
consent, settlement or compromise (1) includes as an unconditional term 
thereof the giving by the claimant to such Seller Indemnitee of a 
release from all liability in respect of such claim except the liability 
satisfied by Buyer or Parent or (2) would have a material adverse effect 
upon Seller's future conduct of its operations.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided elsewhere in 
this Agreement, the obligations of Buyer and Parent under this Agreement 
to indemnify a Seller Indemnitee shall be joint and several; provided, 
however, that Buyer and Parent shall be liable to the Seller Indemnitees 
for amounts payable under Section 18(b) (and with respect to any and all 
demands, claims, actions, suits, proceedings, assessments, judgments, 
costs and reasonable legal and other expenses incident thereto) only to 
the extent such amounts in the aggregate exceed One Hundred Thousand 
Dollars ($100,000), other than claims based on fraud or intentional 
misrepresentations or misconduct by Buyer or Parent and in no event 
shall Buyer and Parent be liable to the Seller Indemnitees for amounts 
payable under Section 18(b) (or demands, claims, actions, suits, 
proceedings, assessments, judgments, costs and reasonable legal and 
other expenses incident thereto) which exceed $50,000,000 in the 
aggregate, except with respect to third-party claims and claims based on 
fraud or intentional misrepresentations or misconduct by Buyer or 
Parent. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided elsewhere in 
this Agreement, the obligations of Buyer and Parent to indemnify the 
Seller Indemnitees shall be of no force or effect with respect to claims 
under Section 18(b) and any and all demands, claims, actions, suits, 
proceedings, assessments, judgments, costs and reasonable legal and 
other expenses incident thereto as to which a Seller Indemnitee has not 
given Buyer and Parent written notice prior to the fifth anniversary of 
the Closing Date unless such claims are based on fraud or intentional 
misrepresentation or misconduct by Buyer or Parent. Without limiting 
rights to indemnification for claims arising from punitive damages 
attributable to third party claims, Seller and the Shareholder agree 
that they will not assert direct claims for punitive damages against 
Buyer or Parent.

19. Effect of Taxes on Indemnification.

The amount of any loss, injury, damage, deficiency, liability, 
obligation, cost or expense for which indemnification is provided under 
Section 17 or 18, and the indemnification payment therefor, shall be 
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price of the Purchased Assets 
for tax purposes, unless a final determination (which shall include the 
execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to the 
indemnified party causes any such payment not to constitute an 
adjustment to the purchase price for federal income tax purposes.

20. Covenants of Seller and the Shareholder.

In addition to any other covenants of Seller and the 
Shareholder in this Agreement, Seller and the Shareholder each covenant 
and agree that from and after the date of this Agreement to the Closing 
as follows:

(a) Buyer and its designated employees, agents, 
representatives (including, without limitation, counsel and 
accountants), contractors and engineers may have access to the 
personnel, books and records and affairs of Seller relating to the 
Distribution Business and to the Purchased Assets and Leased Real 
Property of Seller at all reasonable times after notice to Seller, 
provided that they do not unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the 
conduct of the Seller's operations during any such visit.

(b) Seller will maintain its corporate existence in good 
standing.

(c) To the extent Seller or the Shareholder has in force any 
policies of property and casualty insurance insuring any of the 
Purchased Assets (including the Owned Real Property) or the Leased Real 
Property, any proceeds of insurance payable in respect of any event 
which occurs from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the 
Closing Date shall be received by Seller or the Shareholder in trust for 
Buyer and, to the extent the damage to the Purchased Assets to which the 
proceeds pertain has not been repaired or restored, shall be paid over 
to Buyer at the Closing or, if no proceeds have been received prior to 
the Closing Date, Seller and the Shareholder shall assign any of their 
claims thereto to Buyer at the Closing, but only if Seller, the 
Shareholder and Buyer shall complete the sale and purchase of the 
Purchased Assets, including the Purchased Assets to which the insurance 
proceeds pertain (it being understood that nothing stated herein shall 
affect the right of Buyer to elect not to consummate the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement in the event the conditions set forth in 
Section 15 hereof are not satisfied in full on or before Closing). In 
addition to paying over or assigning to Buyer proceeds of any policy of 
property and casualty insurance as provided above, Seller or the 
Shareholder shall pay to Buyer at the Closing any related deductible 
amount provided under any such policy of insurance. Nothing herein 
shall be construed to require Seller or the Shareholder to maintain such 
policies in force beyond the Closing Date. 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Seller 
and the Shareholder will not, without the prior written consent of 
Buyer: 

(i) enter into any agreement (other than in the ordinary 
course of business) materially affecting or in any way pertaining to the 
Purchased Assets or the Distribution Business;

(ii) sell, transfer, dispose of, encumber or abandon any 
material Purchased Assets or enter into any agreement to do any of the 
foregoing, provided that Seller may sell Inventory in the ordinary 
course of operating the Distribution Business consistent with past 
practice; or

(iii) take any other action of the nature described in Section 
13.01(bb).

(e) Seller and the Shareholder will maintain their respective 
tangible Purchased Assets and the Leased Real Property in good condition 
and repair.

(f) Seller will use all reasonable efforts to preserve for 
Buyer the good will of suppliers, customers and others having 
relationships with Seller relating to the Distribution Business. Seller 
will maintain its books and records relating to the Distribution 
Business in a manner consistent with past practice.

(g) Seller will use reasonable efforts to keep available the 
services of Seller's Employees. 

(h) Seller will take all actions described in Schedule 20(h) 
to remediate Seller's Owned Real Property and the Shareholder will take, 
or cause the Seller to take, all actions described in Schedule 20(h) to 
remediate the Shareholder's Owned Real Property. 

(i) Seller will maintain inventory and supplies that are 
usable and merchantable in the ordinary course of business at levels 
sufficient for Seller, and immediately after the Closing, Buyer to 
conduct the Distribution Business in the ordinary course of business in 
the manner in which it has been conducted by Seller.

(j) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller 
will in all other respects operate the Distribution Business in the 
ordinary course.

21. Mutual Pre-Closing Covenants. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
each party will take all necessary action and use all reasonable efforts 
as promptly as practicable to satisfy all conditions to Closing set 
forth in this Agreement that are within such party's control. 

(b) The parties hereto will as promptly as practicable file 
or cause to be filed with the United States Federal Trade Commission 
(the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") any 
supplemental information requested in connection with the notification 
and report forms filed by the parties on June 24, 1994. Such 
notification and report form and all such supplemental information filed 
or caused to be filed by the parties will be in substantial compliance 
with the requirements of the HSR Act. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, each of Seller and Buyer will use all 
reasonable efforts to make or cause to be made all such other filings 
and submissions, if any, as may be required under applicable laws and 
regulations for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by 
this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall furnish to the others 
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the others may 
request in connection with the preparation of any of the foregoing 
filings or submissions. The parties hereto shall keep each other 
apprised of the status of any communications with, and inquiries or 
requests for additional information from, the FTC or the DOJ, and shall 
use all reasonable efforts to comply promptly with any such inquiry or 
request. Each of the parties hereto will request the acceleration of 
the termination of the waiting period required under the HSR Act as a 
condition to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets. 

(c) The Shareholder shall promptly notify Buyer if the 
Shareholder determines to exchange any portion of the Shareholder's 
Owned Real Property pursuant to a deferred exchange subject to Section 
1031 of the Code. In such event, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to 
cooperate with the Shareholder in order to permit the Shareholder to 
effect such exchange pursuant to documents in form and substance 
satisfactory to Buyer and its legal counsel, if such exchange does not 
require Buyer to take title to any exchange property and does not 
adversely effect in any manner Buyer's rights under this Agreement and 
its acquisition of all of the Shareholder's Owned Real Property at the 
Closing and Buyer incurs no costs, expenses or liabilities that would 
not have been incurred by Buyer in the absence of such an exchange and 
Buyer is indemnified against the risk of any of the same to its 
satisfaction. 

22. Assignment.

None of the parties hereto shall assign this Agreement, in 
whole or in part, without the prior written authorization and consent of 
the others, except that Buyer may assign all of its right, title and 
interest under this Agreement to Parent or any direct or indirect 
wholly-owned subsidiary thereof (whose obligations under this Agreement 
are assured by Parent) at any time on or prior to, or after, the Closing 
Date without the prior written consent of Seller or the Shareholder.

23. Notices.

Any notice required or permitted to be given by any of the 
parties hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been 
given when personally served, or delivered by overnight messenger 
service, or three (3) days after the same shall have been deposited in 
the United States Mail, by registered or certified mail, postage 
prepaid, addressed as follows:

24. Expenses.

Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement 
are consummated on the Closing Date, the parties shall pay their own 
costs and expenses incident to the preparation and execution of this 
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement.

25. Further Assurances.

Seller, the Shareholder and Buyer agree from time to time upon 
request of any other party hereto, whether on or after the Closing Date 
and without additional consideration, to execute and to deliver such 
further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such other 
action as such other party may reasonably request to further confirm 
title to the Purchased Assets in Buyer or further confirm, and at no 
cost to the party of whom the request is made, the assumption by Buyer 
of the obligations to be assumed by Buyer pursuant to Section 4 hereof. 
Seller further covenants that it will take such actions at its expense 
at the end of the current term, or early termination, of that certain 
lease between PJ Food Service, Inc. and Seller, dated March 1, 1993, of 
a portion of the property in Kissimmee, Florida included in the Owned 
Real Property as may be necessary to satisfy the obligations under the 
lease of PJ Food Service, Inc. upon vacating the leased premises to 
restore the leased premises.

26. Public Announcements.

The timing and content of any pre-Closing announcements, press 
releases and public statements concerning the transactions contemplated 
by this Agreement shall be subject to the prior written approval of 
Seller and Buyer, which approval by either of such parties shall not be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence, Seller or Buyer may disclose the terms of this Agreement if 
either deems the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are 
material with respect to its or Parent's business and if disclosure to 
the public, to the New York Stock Exchange (with respect to Buyer and 
Parent) or to any Federal, state or local governmental agency may be 
required under applicable law or exchange regulation, without the prior 
written approval of the other party hereto, in which case the party 
required to make the disclosure shall, if practical under the 
circumstances, allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on the 
proposed disclosure in advance of such disclosure. Any party hereto may 
disclose part or all of this Agreement to its employees and public 
accountants whose assistance is necessary to consummate the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement dated 
December 10, 1993 between Seller and Parent (the "Confidentiality 
Agreement") will continue in full force and effect prior to Closing. 

27. Specific Performance.

Seller and the Shareholder each hereby acknowledge and agree 
that the Purchased Assets are special and unique and that money damages 
payable to Buyer may be impossible to ascertain and an inadequate remedy 
in respect of a breach or non-performance of this Agreement by Seller 
and the Shareholder, so it is mutually agreed that, in addition to any 
other remedies available to Buyer under this Agreement or at law or in 
equity, Buyer shall have the right to require specific performance of 
this Agreement by Seller and the Shareholder and to enforce this 
Agreement by injunctive or other equitable relief.

28. Entire Agreement.

This Agreement, including the Schedules and Exhibits attached 
hereto and made a part hereof, and, prior to Closing, the 
Confidentiality Agreement, contain a complete expression of the 
agreements between the parties with respect to the obligations and 
rights of the parties set forth in this Agreement and supersedes all 
prior written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to the 
transactions contemplated hereby. There are no other agreements, 
promises, representations or inducements made by the parties with 
respect to the subject matter hereof, except as set forth in this 
Agreement.

29. Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any 
such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, 
illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent 
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not 
affect any other provision hereof. 

30. Governing Law.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Colorado applicable to 
agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state, without 
regard to the conflicts of law principles of such state. 

31. Schedules

In no event shall the mere listing in any Schedule hereto of a 
document or other item be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a 
representation or warranty made herein (unless the representation or 
warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other item 
itself or the mere listing of the document or item in the Schedule 
otherwise reasonably informs Buyer of an exception to such 
representation or warranty). 

32. Waiver of Compliance; Consents. 

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of 
any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or 
condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits 
thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such 
waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with 
such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a 
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 
Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of 
any party hereto, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner 
consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth 
in this Section 32.

33. Remedies Cumulative. 

Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights and remedies 
provided herein shall be cumulative and the assertion by a party of a 
right or remedy hereunder shall not preclude the assertion by such party 
of any other rights or remedies against another party provided herein. 

34. Amendments. 

This Agreement may be amended, changed or modified only by an 
agreement, in writing, signed by the parties hereto. 

35. Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Beneficiaries. 

Subject to the provisions of Section 22 hereof, this Agreement 
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and 
their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall 
be for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective 
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein expressed or 
implied shall give or be construed to give to any person or entity, 
other than the parties thereto and such successors and permitted 
assigns, any legal or equitable rights under this Agreement. 

36. Interpretation. 

In this Agreement and the Schedules and Exhibits annexed 
hereto: 

(a) Words denoting the singular include the plural and vice 
versa and words denoting any gender include all genders; 

(b) The word "including" shall mean "including without 
limitation"; 

(c) The use of headings is for convenience of reference only 
and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or 
the Schedules or any Exhibits annexed hereto;

(d) When calculating the period of time within which or 
following which any act is to be done or step taken, the date which is 
the reference day in calculating such period shall be excluded and, if 
the last day of such period is not a business day (meaning for all 
purposes of this Agreement any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a 
day which is a statutory holiday under the laws of the United States or 
the States of Minnesota or Colorado), the period shall end on the next 
day which is a business day; 

(e) All dollar amounts are expressed in United States funds; 

(f) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, money shall 
be tendered by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds; 

(g) As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliate" shall 
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and 
Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and 

(h) As used in this Agreement, the term "person" shall mean 
and include an individual, a partnership, a joint venture, a 
corporation, a trust, an unincorporated organization and a government or 
any department or agency thereof. 

37. Retention of Records. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this 
Agreement, if Buyer desires to destroy, seven (7) years or more after 
the Closing, any information to which Seller or the Shareholder is 
otherwise entitled to post-Closing access under this Agreement, it may 
do so if it first gives notice to such party offering to send such 
information to such party and such party does not accept such offer 
within thirty (30) days after such notice. 

38. Divisibility. 

The rights of Seller and the Shareholder, on the one hand, to 
sell the Purchased Assets, and Buyer and Parent, on the other hand, to 
purchase the Purchased Assets under this Agreement are not divisible. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto, intending to be 
legally bound, have caused this Agreement to be executed and delivered 
as of the day and year first above written.
