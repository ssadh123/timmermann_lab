NEW YORK, NEW YORK -- April 21, 1994 -- RJR Nabisco Holdings
Corp. (NYSE: RN) today announced results for the first quarter
ending March 31, 1994. Net income for the quarter, before an
extraordinary item, was $194 million, down 8 percent from net
income of $210 million in the first quarter of 1993. Net income
per common share before the extraordinary item on a fully diluted
basis was $.12 for the quarter, down 25 percent from $.16 of fully
diluted net income per common share recorded in the first quarter
of 1993.

Results for the 1994 first quarter are before a $1 million
after-tax extraordinary gain for early retirement of debt and the
results for the 1993 first quarter are before a $47 million after-
tax extraordinary charge for early retirement of debt.

Before the extraordinary items in 1993 and 1994, cash net
income (net income before after-tax amortization of trademarks and
goodwill) for the 1994 first quarter was $328 million, down 5
percent from cash net income of $344 million in the comparable
quarter of the prior year. Before the extraordinary items in 1993
and 1994, cash net income per fully diluted common share for the
quarter, was $.22, a decline of 15 percent from $.26 recorded in

"We're very pleased with our overall performance in the first
quarter," said Charles M. Harper, RJR Nabisco's chairman and chief
executive officer. "Results clearly show significant improvement
in the domestic tobacco business. First quarter 1994 worldwide
tobacco operating profits were down just 13% compared to the prior
year, a strong performance given that last year's first quarter
does not reflect the price reductions that prevailed throughout the
remainder of 1993," said Mr. Harper.

Operating income in the first quarter of 1994 was $632 million,
down 7 percent from 1993 first quarter operating income of $683
million. Net sales for the 1994 first quarter were $3.57 billion,
down 4 percent from net sales of $3.74 billion in the same quarter
last year.

"Our international tobacco and worldwide food businesses
delivered strong gains in volume, sales and earnings," said Mr.
Harper. "These businesses, combined with the cash generated by
domestic tobacco, should enable us to pursue the growth that is
central to achieving our objective of 15 percent average trendline
growth annually in cash earnings per share."

Tobacco Results: Domestic Margins Restored

For the first quarter of 1994, worldwide tobacco volume rose 2
percent compared to the prior year's quarter. Net sales for
worldwide tobacco operations were $1.86 billion, a 12 percent
decline from net sales of $2.10 billion in last year's first
quarter.

Worldwide operating company contribution (operating income
before amortization of trademarks and goodwill) for tobacco in the
first quarter declined 13 percent to $572 million from $659 million
in the comparable 1993 period.

"Both our international and domestic tobacco results show clear
signs of strengthening and a trend towards renewed profit growth.
Domestic tobacco margins, after experiencing severe reductions in
1993, have rebounded during the 1994 first quarter to a level close
to our 1993 first quarter," Mr. Harper said.

"Our margin improvement is due primarily to restructuring
efforts to cut costs and right-size the company for today's
competitive conditions," said Mr. Harper. "Domestic tobacco's
results are tracking well against objectives."

For international tobacco, operating company contribution in
the first quarter of $179 million gained 13 percent compared to the
prior year's period. Net sales of $727 million rose 4 percent and
volume increased 12 percent versus 1993.

International tobacco reported strong demand and share gains in
most key markets, with particularly strong performance from
operations in Western Europe, the former Soviet Union and Canada.
In Eastern Europe, the company recently announced plans for a
manufacturing operation in the Czech Republic, scheduled for start-
up at mid-year, that will allow the company to serve this market
more profitably and efficiently.

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the domestic tobacco business,
reported quarterly net sales of $1.13 billion, 19 percent less than
the net sales reported in the first quarter of 1993. Operating
company contribution of $393 million was 21 percent less than the
comparable quarter last year.

Domestic tobacco sales and profits benefited from stabilized
pricing across the board. Domestic tobacco also reported that
profits show the impact of a more favorable product mix overall.

The company noted that the spread between retail prices for
premium and savings brands has remained firm, contributing to
stable retail market shares for the more profitable full- and mid-
price brands and enhancing profitability in the savings category.

Domestic tobacco volume in the first quarter declined 9 percent
versus the prior year's quarter. The company said its volume
comparisons are influenced by industry shifts in wholesale buying
patterns in the year-ago quarter. The company also said that its
full-price volume is approximately the same as the prior year's
quarter and that its volume decline is chiefly attributable to
savings brands, reflecting the company's emphasis on profitability.

Food Results: Operating Company Contribution Increases 13%

Worldwide first quarter net sales for the Nabisco Foods Group
were $1.71 billion, up 5 percent from net sales of $1.63 billion
last year. Operating company contribution was $230 million, 13
percent higher than the $203 million reported in the 1993 period.

North American Group net sales were up 6 percent and operating
company contribution increased 19 percent compared to the first
quarter of 1993. Nabisco Biscuit Company, in particular, turned in
a very strong sales and unit volume performance, continuing its
momentum from industry-leading volume gains achieved during 1993
into the first quarter. Nabisco recently announced a significant
new product effort in North America, with the introduction of
reduced-fat versions of six major cookie and cracker brands.
Regional and national roll-outs of the new products will commence
in late April.

Regarding its international operations, Nabisco reported that
sales in Latin America continue to grow, although first quarter
volumes were lower in Brazil and Mexico due to unfavorable economic
conditions. The company announced in April 1994 that it enhanced
its position in this market with the acquisition of a 71 percent
interest in Argentina-based Terrabusi, which has approximately 25
percent of that country's cookie and cracker market. In Europe,
operations in Spain and Portugal posted strong sales growth.

RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. is the parent company of RJR
Nabisco, Inc., an international consumer products company. RJR
Nabisco's major operating units are R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco International, Inc. and the Nabisco Foods Group.
