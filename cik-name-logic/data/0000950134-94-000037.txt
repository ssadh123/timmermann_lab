ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

THE MERGER

On December 14, 1993, Adobe Gas Pipeline Company ("AGPC") was merged
(the "Merger") with and into Hadson Corporation (the "Company") pursuant to an
Agreement of Merger dated as of July 28, 1993, as amended (the "Merger
Agreement"), among the Company, Santa Fe Energy Resources, Inc. ("Santa Fe")
and AGPC. Prior to the Merger, AGPC was an indirect-wholly owned subsidiary of
Santa Fe engaged, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, in the gathering,
processing, transmission and marketing of natural gas, with interests in 10
natural gas pipeline systems located in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Montana
(of which six were operated by AGPC) and three natural gas processing plants
(collectively, and including the various contracts associated with such
facilities, the "AGPC Assets").

Prior to the Merger, AGPC entered into a gas contract with Santa Fe
and Santa Fe Energy Operating Partners, L.P. ("SFEOP") (the "Gas Contract").
As a result of the Merger, the Company succeeded to the rights and obligations
of AGPC under the Gas Contract. Following the Merger, with the consent of
Santa Fe and SFEOP, the Company assigned such contract to Hadson Gas Systems,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company through which the majority of
the Company's natural gas marketing operations are conducted. The Gas Contract
has a term of approximately seven years and provides for the purchase by the
Company of essentially all of Santa Fe's and SFEOP's existing domestic natural
gas production as well as natural gas production that either Santa Fe or SFEOP
has the right to market. In addition, the Company has the right to purchase
new production from certain development properties of Santa Fe and SFEOP. The
price to be paid by the Company for purchases of natural gas under the Gas
Contract will fluctuate from month to month based on generally recognized
published price indices. Under other provisions of the Gas Contract, the
Company will be responsible for analyzing and recommending to Santa Fe and
SFEOP alternatives for the gathering, processing and marketing of natural gas
production from exploratory drilling activities of Santa Fe and SFEOP in the
United States. Accordingly, while production from such exploratory drilling
activities will not be dedicated to the Company under the Gas Contract, the
Company expects to have the opportunity to market significant amounts of any
such new production. In addition, the Company expects to have the opportunity
to acquire or construct and operate additional natural gas gathering and
processing facilities as a result of this relationship.

The term of the Gas Contract will run from the effective date of the
contract (i.e., no later than the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective
Time")) until March 31, 2001. However, either the Company or Santa Fe and
SFEOP will have the right to terminate the contract upon a material breach of
the contract or the occurrence of certain governmental actions. In addition,
Santa Fe and SFEOP will have the right to terminate the contract upon the
occurrence of certain other events, including (i) the failure of the Company to
purchase specified percentages of available production from Santa Fe and SFEOP
(other than as a result of force majeure), including the failure to purchase at
least 90% of available gas in any period of six consecutive months, and (ii)
the occurrence of an event of default under any debt or credit agreement of the
Company for borrowed money if such event results in the acceleration of any
obligation in excess of $10 million.

The Company will be required to release production dedicated under the
Gas Contract under certain circumstances, including (i) if Santa Fe or SFEOP
reasonably believe such production should be released to avoid any penalties
and costs that would otherwise be incurred by Santa Fe or SFEOP related to
production attributable to third parties, (ii) upon the sale or exchange of
wells by Santa Fe or SFEOP, as the case may be, if the average consideration to
be received by Santa Fe or SFEOP attributable to its interests in such wells is
less than $250,000 per well and (iii) if pipeline transportation imbalance
penalties incurred by Santa Fe or SFEOP as a result of sales under the Gas
Contract for gas produced from non-operated wells become excessive in the
reasonable opinion of Santa Fe and SFEOP. Santa Fe and SFEOP may also have gas
released from the Gas Contract if the Company's financial condition changes
materially and adversely and the Company

-1-
<PAGE> 3
does not provide financial assurances (such as letters of credit) acceptable to
Santa Fe and SFEOP for the value of such gas. In addition, Santa Fe and SFEOP
will retain the right to limit, curtail or shut-in dedicated production for any
reason (including inadequate price or unacceptable market conditions), subject
to certain notice requirements and certain other parameters.

In addition to effecting the acquisition by the Company of AGPC, the
Merger also effected a restructuring of the Company's current debt and equity
capitalization. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement:

BUSINESS PROPERTIES OF AGPC

General. As a result of the Merger, the Company has succeeded to the
business and properties of AGPC. AGPC was involved in the gathering,
transmission, processing and marketing of natural gas, primarily in the Permian
Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. These operations are conducted
through three subsidiaries of AGPC (now subsidiaries of the Company): Adobe
Gas Gathering and Processing Co., Adobe Gas Marketing Co. and Adobe Gas Co.
(the "AGPC Subsidiaries"). The AGPC Subsidiaries own undivided interests in
the AGPC Assets or equity interests in joint ventures or partnerships which in
turn own undivided interests in the AGPC Assets (see "-- Properties" below).
In addition, prior to the Merger, Santa Fe transferred to AGPC or one of the
AGPC Subsidiaries an undivided interest in two gathering systems, West Caddo
and Britt Ranch (see "-- Properties" below) which, as a result of the Merger,
were acquired by the Company.

Gas Gathering and Transportation. The AGPC Subsidiaries have
interests in 10 gas pipeline systems, of which six are operated by the AGPC
Subsidiaries. Natural gas is acquired at the well-head for resale, generally
under short-term contracts at the point the gathering system connects with a
major interstate pipeline. In certain circumstances, natural gas is
transported for others in return for a transportation fee. In some cases,
natural gas is sold directly to end-users who are physically connected to the
pipeline systems under long-term contracts. During 1992, an average of 87 MMCF
per day of natural gas (net to AGPC's interest) was purchased or transported
through these pipeline systems.

Gas Processing. The AGPC Subsidiaries have interests in three gas
processing plants. During 1992, such plants produced an average of 47,000
gallons per day (net to AGPC's interest) of natural gas liquids ("NGLs").
These facilities are capable of processing approximately 74 MMCF per day of
natural gas. One of these facilities has been essentially out of operation for
the past several years. This facility is currently being refurbished and
connected to the Company's Llano pipeline system and is expected to be in
operation by the fourth quarter of 1993. NGLs produced by these facilities are
generally transported via pipeline to common fractionation points where such
liquids are sold into wholesale markets.

Gas Marketing. The AGPC Subsidiaries have also been involved in the
marketing of natural gas which is not transported through their pipeline
systems, although such activities have not been significant in comparison to
their gathering, transmission and processing operations. These activities have
been conducted via a limited number of long-term contracts and a variety of
short- term "spot" contracts. During 1992, an average of 66 MMCF per day was
marketed under such arrangements.

-5-
<PAGE> 7
Competition. The AGPC Subsidiaries compete with a number of gas
pipelines and processors that are active in the area of its facilities. Such
competition is on the basis of service, reliability and market responsive
pricing for gathering, transmission and processing services.

Environmental Matters and Governmental Regulation. The AGPC
Subsidiaries are generally subject to the same environmental and regulatory
factors as is the Company. Under the Natural Gas Act, natural gas gathering
facilities are exempt from jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (the "FERC"), while interstate transmission facilities are subject
to FERC jurisdiction. The FERC has historically distinguished between these
types of activities on a very fact-specific basis which makes it difficult to
predict with certainty the status of the AGPC gathering facilities. While the
FERC has not issued any order or opinion declaring AGPC's facilities as
gathering rather than transmission facilities, Santa Fe has represented to the
Company that it believes that these systems meet the traditional tests that the
FERC has used to establish a pipeline status as a gatherer. Members of the
FERC have recently expressed the intention to reassess the FERC's traditional
gathering criteria in light of the implementation of Order No. 636. The
Company cannot predict what, if any, changes such reassessment might cause in
the traditional gathering test applied by the FERC. Further, while some states
provide for the rate regulation of pipelines engaged in the intrastate
transportation of natural gas, such regulation has not generally been applied
against gatherers of natural gas. However, Oklahoma has recently enacted
legislation that prohibits the imposition of unjustly or unlawfully
discriminatory gathering rates, and permits the Oklahoma Corporation Commission
to adopt corrective action to remedy complaints regarding such rates. The
gathering systems included in the AGPC Assets could be adversely affected
should they be subjected in the future to the application of such state or
federal regulation. See "-- Properties" below.

Certain activities involving the AGPC Subsidiaries are subject to the
jurisdiction of the Railroad Commission of Texas (the "RRC"). The RRC has the
authority, under the Texas Gas Utility Regulatory Act and other statutes, to
regulate the rates, services and operations of gas utilities in Texas. Santa
Fe has represented to the Company that it believes that the activities of the
AGPC Subsidiaries subject to such regulation comply with all applicable laws
and regulations of the RRC and that such laws and regulations do not affect
materially the financial condition or results of operations of the AGPC
Subsidiaries.

Number of Persons Employed. AGPC had no employees. As of September
30, 1993, approximately 41 employees of Santa Fe were involved in conducting
AGPC's operations. In connection with the Merger, 24 of such Santa Fe
employees accepted offers of employment with the Company.

Properties. The following table sets forth the percentage ownership
interest of the AGPC Subsidiaries in the listed natural gas gathering,
transmission and processing facilities. Santa Fe has represented to the
Company that it is aware of certain defects in AGPC's title to certain of the
AGPC Assets, but based on the information currently available to it, the
Company does not believe that those defects would have a material adverse
effect on the AGPC Assets taken as a whole.

<PAGE> 9
Plant. In return, Parker & Parsley has agreed to (i) dedicate certain
natural gas production to Adobe Gas (including certain production
currently being gathered and processed through the Sale Ranch
facilities and certain other production which is currently being
processed elsewhere), (ii) assign to Adobe Gas a gathering system in
Eddy County, New Mexico (the "Loving System"), (iii) dedicate to Adobe
Gas for processing all natural gas currently connected to the Loving
System and (iv) make a cash payment to Adobe Gas of $2.5 million.
Santa Fe and the Company have agreed in principle that if such
agreement is not consummated, Santa Fe will compensate the Company by
(i) entering into certain amendments to certain gas purchase contracts
between Santa Fe and Adobe Gas which will make such contracts more
advantageous to Adobe Gas and (ii) amend the Gas Contract to adjust
the pricing on certain amounts of production to specified amounts
which will be more advantageous to the Company.

MANAGEMENT CHANGES

The Merger also resulted in certain amendments to the Company's
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Restated Certificate") and bylaws
that, among other things, increased the number of directors constituting the
entire Board of Directors of the Company to eight and divided the Company's
Board of Directors into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, which
classes shall be as nearly equal in number of directors as possible. The
directors first elected or appointed to Class I shall serve for an initial term
expiring at the annual meeting following the end of the Company's 1993 fiscal
year, the directors first elected or appointed to Class II shall serve for an
initial term expiring at the second annual meeting following the end of the
Company's 1993 fiscal year and the directors first elected or appointed to
Class III shall serve for an initial term expiring at the third annual meeting
following the end of the Company's 1993 fiscal year. All of the directors of

December 14, 1993. Mr. Jenkins became employed with the Company on October 1,

The Company has instigated a search for a new Chief Executive Officer
to replace Mr. Adcock in that post after the Merger. It is expected that the
person chosen to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company following the
Merger will be appointed to fill the sole remaining vacancy on the Company's
Board of Directors.

CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

The following summary of the material federal income tax consequences
to the Company resulting from the Transactions is based upon provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and the judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, all as in effect as of the date hereof, and all of
which are subject to change (possibly on a retroactive basis) or different
interpretation. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service
(the "Service") will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences
described herein, and the Company has not obtained, nor does it intend to
obtain, a ruling from the Service with respect to the federal income tax
consequences of the Transactions.

In General. The Merger should be treated as a tax-free reorganization
under section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, and the Company's basis in the assets
of AGPC acquired pursuant to the Merger should be equal to the basis of such
assets in the hands of AGPC prior to the Merger. The exchange of Old Senior
Secured Notes for Senior Secured Notes, the conversion of Old Senior Preferred
Stock into Common Stock and the right to receive a percentage of Prudential's
interest in the H/P Trust initially representing beneficial ownership of all of
the Trust shares (the "P Interest") and Senior Secured Notes, the conversion of
Class B Common Stock into the right to receive a percentage of the P Interest
in the H/P Trust, the conversion of Class C Common Stock into Common Stock and
the conversion of Old Junior Preferred Stock into Common Stock and Junior
Preferred Stock should all be treated as tax-free recapitalizations to the
Company and should not give rise to any taxable gain or loss to the Company.
Also, the exchange of Common Stock for Old

-11-
<PAGE> 13
Common Stock pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split and the issuance of shares of
Junior Preferred Stock to holders of Common Stock should not give rise to
taxable gain or loss to the Company.

Limitation on Use of NOLs. On its federal income tax return for its
taxable year ended December 31, 1991, the Company reported net operating losses
("NOLs") on a consolidated basis of approximately $96 million. Although the
Company has not filed its federal income tax return for the calendar year ended
December 31, 1992, the Company estimates that for such taxable year it incurred
an additional NOL of approximately $21 million. In addition, the Company
anticipates reporting adjustments which will decrease the amount of NOLs
reported in its 1991 federal income tax return by approximately $12 million.
These NOLs will expire between the years 1999 and 2008. If a corporation with
NOLs (a "loss corporation") undergoes an "ownership change" (as defined below),
the use of its NOLs is generally thereafter limited under section 382 of the
Code to an annual amount (the " Section 382 Limitation") equal to the product
of the long-term tax-exempt rate prescribed monthly by the Service (5.4% for
ownership changes occurring during August 1993) and the value of the loss
corporation's outstanding stock immediately before the ownership change (taking
into account redemptions occurring in connection with the ownership change, but
excluding certain capital contributions). Any portion of this Section 382
Limitation that is not used in a taxable year following the ownership change
can be carried forward to subsequent taxable years until the NOLs expire.

In general, an "ownership change" occurs if the percentage of the
value of the loss corporation's stock owned by one or more direct or indirect
"5-percent shareholders" has increased by more than 50 percentage points over
the lowest percentage of that value owned by those 5-percent shareholders at
any time during a "testing period," which is generally the shorter of the
three-year period preceding the ownership change or the period since the most
recent prior ownership change. Stock owned by less than 5- percent
shareholders is treated in the aggregate as owned by one or more groups, each
of which is treated as a 5-percent shareholder. In applying this test, certain
option, entity and family attribution rules are taken into account.

In connection with its 1992 pre-packaged bankruptcy (the "1992
Restructuring"), the Company experienced an ownership change under section 382.
Two alternative elective rules apply to an ownership change that occurs
pursuant to a Chapter 11 Case. Under section 382(l)(5) of the Code, the
Section 382 Limitation does not apply, provided stockholders and qualifying
creditors of the loss corporation receive at least 50% of the voting power and
value of the stock of the reorganized corporation in exchange for their debt or
equity interests. However, because one of the prices that must be paid for
this benefit is a zero Section 382 Limitation in the event of a subsequent
ownership change within two years, the Company will elect not to have the
special bankruptcy rule of section 382(1)(5) of the Code apply to the ownership
change that occurred in connection with the 1992 Restructuring.

By electing not to have section 382(1)(5) of the Code apply to the
Company, its Section 382 Limitation resulting from the 1992 Restructuring must
be determined under section 382(1)(6) of the Code by taking into account the
increase in the value of the Company's stock resulting from the cancellation of
debt obligations pursuant to the 1992 Restructuring. The Company has
determined that this Section 382 Limitation will allow it to offset taxable
income equal to approximately $4,500,000 each year.

The Company intends to take the position that the Transactions did not
cause an ownership change to occur on or before the closing of such
Transactions. However, due to uncertainties as to law and fact, there can be
no assurance that this will be the case. If the Transactions were deemed to
result in an ownership change, the Company's ability to utilize NOLs would be
subject to further restriction due to the imposition of a lower Section 382
Limitation than that resulting from the 1992 Restructuring. Furthermore, the
Company believes that, in connection with the Transactions, certain 5-percent
shareholders of the Company will increase their ownership of the Company's
"stock" (as defined for purposes of section 382(g) of the Code) by
approximately 40 percentage points, as such increases are measured for purposes
of section 382(g) of the Code. This 40 percentage-point increase in turn will
increase the risk that the Company will experience an

-12-
<PAGE> 14
ownership change in the future. A future ownership change could produce a
Section 382 Limitation lower than that resulting from the 1992 Restructuring.
