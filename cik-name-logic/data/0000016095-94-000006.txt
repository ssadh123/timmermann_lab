Item 5. Other Events

On February 22, 1994, Registrant issued the following press release:

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA -- Caesars World, Inc. (NYSE: CAW) today 
announced net income for the fiscal 1994 second quarter was $21,960,000, 
or 90 cents per share, compared with $25,527,000, or $1.05 per share, in the 
fiscal 1993 second quarter. Revenue for the quarter ended January 31, 1994, 
totaled $257,981,000, compared with $264,473,000 in the prior-year quarter.

Net income for the first six months of fiscal 1994 was a record
$49,808,000, or $2.04 per share, compared with $40,494,000, or $1.66 per 
share, in the comparable fiscal 1993 period. Revenue for the six months of 
fiscal 1994 amounted to $527,064,000, compared with $497,035,000 in the 
same prior-year period. 

Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that a major
contributor to the decline in the quarterly comparisons was lower table-game
win percentages in the company's Nevada operations. "We are nevertheless
pleased that Caesars Palace in Las Vegas continued to maintain its strong
casino play in spite of the opening of three mega-resorts and the ensuing
nationwide publicity and marketing programs that are part of all major
openings," he said. 

Gluck pointed out that improved results throughout the company accounted
for the fiscal 1994 six-month performance which established records in revenue,
net income and earnings per share for any comparable period in Caesars 
World's history. 

In the company's Nevada operations, the table-game win percentage for the
fiscal 1994 second quarter, although above historical averages, was still below
the prior-year quarter and was the principal contributor to declines in both
revenue and contributions to operating income. The level of table-game
activity was about the same during both quarters. Slot machine activity in
Nevada was about 5 percent higher in the 1994 quarter but this was offset by a
lower slot win percentage resulting in a relatively flat quarterly slot revenue
comparison. Higher marketing and staffing expenses were partially offset by a
lower provision for doubtful accounts during the 1994 second quarter.

Six-month results from Nevada in fiscal 1994 reflected all-time record
table-game activity and win, a higher table-game win percentage compared with
the same 1993 six months, and a 7 percent rise in slot win over the comparable
1993 period. The fiscal 1994 six-month results were partially offset by 
increased marketing expenses and a higher provision for doubtful accounts.
In New Jersey, the lower results during fiscal 1994 can be primarily 
attributed to increased competition and recent bad weather. Caesars Atlantic 
City's lower casino revenue during the fiscal 1994 reporting periods was due to 
a decline in table-game and slots activity, offset in part by an increase in 
table-game win percentages and the opening late in October of a Simulcast
Casino. This new area features high-tech horse race betting, a poker
section and additional casino table games. Caesars Atlantic City's
contributions to operating income in fiscal 1994 benefited from a reduction in
expenses.

Caesars World's net interest expenses have decreased due to lower
outstanding debt and a debt refinancing which was substantially completed
during the fiscal 1993 first quarter.

(a) Other revenue is primarily from merchandising operations. Other expenses
include the contribution from merchandising operations and corporate
expenses.

(b) The effective income tax rate during the six months ended January 31, 1994,
was 1.4 percentage points higher than the same period in 1993. The higher
tax rate reflects the impact of two non-recurring tax charges. In August
1993, the Federal tax rate increased, retroactive to January 1, 1993, from
34 to 35 percent. The company also changed its method for income tax
accounting by adopting FASB 109 effective August 1, 1993. The impact of
this cumulative change in accounting and the retroactive change in the
corporate tax rate aggregated a net charge of approximately $750,000 in the
first quarter of fiscal 1994.
