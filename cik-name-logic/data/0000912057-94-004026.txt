ITEM 2 ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

ACQUISITION OF TUCSON APARTMENTS

BRE Properties, Inc. ("BRE" or "the company") has entered into an Agreement for
Purchase and Sale of Real Property, Loan Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions
to acquire 1,301 units in seven apartment communities in Tucson, Arizona
("Tucson Apartments"). The sellers are affiliates of The Schomac Group
("Schomac"), a privately held apartment and self-storage developer headquartered
in Tucson which is not affiliated with BRE. In connection with the purchase,
the company has agreed, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, to
provide $3,000,000 in loans to entities affiliated with the seller.

The purchase price is $51,637,000, subject to $28,160,000 of first mortgage
financing on six of the properties. Accordingly, BRE's cash portion of the
purchase price is approximately $23,477,000. The following summarizes the seven
apartment communities:

</TABLE>

MATERIAL FACTORS CONSIDERED BY THE REGISTRANT

Prior to acquiring the Tucson Apartments, BRE considered general regional and
local economic conditions, as well as the Tucson apartment market and the Tucson
Apartments' competitive posture within that market.

Arizona Overview

Between 1980 and 1989, Arizona's population grew 43.4% compared with a national
growth of 9.6%. Averaging increases of 2.2% over the past five years, the
population of Arizona exceeded 4 million for the first time at the end of 1993.
Despite its reputation as a retirement center, Arizona's population is slightly
younger than the national average, or 32.2 years compared with 32.9 years.

-2-

<PAGE>

The reasons cited for Arizona's growth include affordable housing, a strong
university system and high quality of life. Businesses favor Arizona because
of low labor costs, a well educated work force and the low cost of land and
factory space. The state provides a major transportation hub for the southwest
with international air connections, cross country rail lines and inter-city
trucking operations. Employers consider Arizona to have a positive business
climate, an improving economy and a stable political environment. The state has
been somewhat generous in granting tax incentives to companies to encourage the
location of facilities there. Arizona is also a "right to work" state.

The Arizona Department of Economic Security (DES) presents employment growth
rates for Arizona since 1985 as well as projections through 1995. Arizona has
experienced employment gains in all recent years except 1991 when it was
impacted most by the national recession. Even then, it posted a year of growth.
Arizona's economy showed considerable improvement in 1993 over 1991 and 1992.
Non-farm wage and salary employment grew by more than 54,000 or 3.6%. With the
exception of mining, all eight of the state's major industry groups showed
employment gains, with healthy increases reported in construction. In addition,
throughout 1993, the state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate declined
steadily, dropping from 7.7% in January to 5.7% in December. Unemployment
averaged 6.2% for the year, 1.2% lower than 1992's average. By comparison, the
national economy showed modest improvement over the same period, reporting an
average 6.8% unemployment rate and 1.5% employment growth. In March of this
year, unemployment in Arizona was 5.5% compared with 6.5% nationally.

The DES two-year forecast calls for Arizona's economy to create 63,000 jobs in
1994 and 67,500 in 1995, representing a 4% increase each year. All eight of the
major industry groups are expected by DES to add jobs in these years, with
construction leading the way.

Arizona's construction industry continues to gain momentum. In 1992,
construction employment increased by 3.2% or by 2,500 jobs, after five prior
years of losses. In 1993, construction employment increased by 11.2%, or nearly
9,000 jobs. The DES forecast calls for continued strength, with 11,000 and
11,700 new jobs forecasted in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Single-family
residential construction is expected to provide most of the gains although
increasing demand for apartment, commercial and industrial property should also
boost job growth. DES suggests that rises in interest rates as the Federal
Reserve attempts to head off inflation will, at some point, slow this robust
activity.

While certain of Arizona's manufacturing sectors, such as lumber and wood
products, are improving because of increased construction, other manufacturing
gains are expected on the high technology side. For 1994, DES predicts an
increase of 2.2%, or 3,900 manufacturing jobs.

-3-

<PAGE>

The University of Arizona predicts that population gains will increase in the
short term. As economic opportunities improve locally and as homes become
easier to sell in other parts of the country, migration inflow will improve as
in prior expansions. It predicts that, after adding less than 90,000 persons
last year, the number of new residents will surge to almost 125,000 per year by
1995. This represents nearly 3% population growth in 1995.

TUCSON

The City of Tucson, located in eastern Pima County about 65 miles north of the
Mexican border, is the second largest city in Arizona. Incorporated Tucson
covers a land area of 162 square miles (1993) within an urbanized area of over
400 square miles. Downtown Tucson lies at 2,490 feet above sea level in a
desert valley surrounded by eight mountain ranges. The closest of these are the
Santa Catalina Mountains to the north, rising to 9,200 feet, the Rincon
Mountains to the west and the Santa Rita and Sierrita Mountains to the south.
There is little history of recent seismic activity.

Population and Demographics

Pima County grew in population by 25.8% from 1980 to 1990, well above the
national average of 10% for the period but below the 34.9% growth rate for the
State of Arizona. During that time, Tucson grew by 22.6% while the growth rate
for the unincorporated areas of the county grew by 28.3%. The City of Tucson
grew from the 45th largest U. S. city to the 33rd largest by 1990.

-4-

<PAGE>

The University of Arizona projects the population of Pima County to grow by
24,000 residents in 1994, or by approximately 3.4%.

Examples of major employers that have come to the Tucson area in the 1990s
include American Airlines Reservation Center, American Home Furnishings, AT & T
Directory Assistance Center, Cheetah Systems, ChipSoft, Confed Admin Services,
Lockheed Aeromod, Southwest Airlines, Muscular Dystrophy Association, Quantas
Airways Reservation Center, Quality Rubber Products, Rail Car America, Vanguard
Automation and Weiser Locks.

Multi-family Residential Real Estate Market

The total Tucson multi-family residential inventory consisted of 84,637 units,
or about 28% of the total housing stock, at March 31, 1994. The University of
Arizona's "Metropolitan Tucson Land Use Study" reports 3.85 % vacancy for those
units. RealData, Inc., which tracks properties of 40 units or more, reports an
inventory of 54,196 units with a 3.35% vacancy at March 31, 1994.

Peak construction of multi-family properties was seen in the mid 1980s, as
permit levels ranged from 5,525 to 8,289 units between 1983 and 1986. 37% of
Tucson's entire apartment inventory was permitted during those four years. Not
surprisingly, vacancy rates soared to almost 20% in 1988 as employment growth
declined from its high in 1986 in a severely overbuilt market.

Apartment permit levels declined sharply from 1989 through 1993 due to high
vacancy and the recession. This reduced construction coupled with the improving
economy has resulted in the low marketwide vacancy rates reported today.
Projected absorption in 1994 of over 2,500 units will drive vacancy rates even
lower. The size and income levels of the Tucson market have resulted in the
apartment supply generally being developed as a "B" quality market. Of 204
properties having 100 or more units, only 27 of these would be considered "A"
quality by institutional investors.

The Tucson Apartments Being Acquired

As mentioned, there are seven properties containing 1,301 units. Fountain Plaza
was built in 1975. The other six communities were built between 1983 and 1987.
Spring Hill was built of reinforced concrete and steel. The other six
properties consist of one, two and three story structures built of wood frame
and stucco. They range in quality from "A" to "C" and from 144 to 250 units.

Project amenities include pools, spas, activities clubhouses and free covered
parking. Except for Fountain Plaza and Hacienda del Rio, all units have washers
and dryers.

BRE purchased Casas Lindas for $7,557,000 cash on August 18, 1994. The other
six properties are subject to mortgage loans insured by governmental agencies.
Four of the six (Camino Seco Village, Colonia del Rio, Oracle Village and
Spring Hill) mortgages are insured by the Federal National Mortgage Association
("FNMA").

-5-

<PAGE>

The other two (Fountain Plaza and Hacienda del Rio) are insured by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"). Both FNMA and HUD require
that each property be held in a single-asset entity, so BRE has established six
wholly owned, single asset subsidiaries, all Delaware corporations, as follows:

BRE Camino Seco Village, Inc.
BRE Colonia del Rio, Inc.
BRE Fountain Plaza, Inc.
BRE Hacienda del Rio, Inc.
BRE Oracle Village, Inc.
BRE Spring Hill, Inc.

BRE will purchase each of the six properties as FNMA and HUD approve BRE's
assumption of the related mortgage loans. Through the date of this report, BRE
has completed the purchases of Colonia del Rio, Fountain Plaza, Oracle Village
and Spring Hill.

With a weighted average interest rate of 7.75% on the $28,160,000 of mortgage
loans, BRE expects to achieve positive leverage on this transaction, allowing a
return on the equity portion of the investment of above 10%, an attractive
return in this market for apartments. The per unit price of $39,690 compares
very favorably with comparable sales in Tucson and represents an estimated 91%
of the properties' current replacement value.

ESTIMATED EFFECT ON THE REGISTRANT'S FINANCIAL STATEMENT

The financial effect of the acquisition of the Tucson Apartments is expected to
be positive during the first year of operations, with the Tucson Apartments
increasing BRE's net income before depreciation expense by approximately
$1,643,000 ($.15 per share). This amount is calculated as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Annual Results
--------------
<S> <C> <C>
Purchase price $ 51,637,000 at 9.00% yield = $ 4,647,000
Less: Interest on mortgages payable 28,160,000 at 7.75% rate = (2,182,000)

-----------
Income before depreciation $ 1,643,000
-----------
-----------
Per share $.15
-----------
-----------
</TABLE>

The 3.50% yield on short-term investments represents BRE's actual yield for the
fiscal year ended July 31, 1994, consistent with information included in BRE's
audited financial statements.

After reasonable inquiry, BRE is not aware of any material factors relating to
the Tucson Apartments, other than those set forth above, that would cause the
reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future
operating results.

PRO FORMA CONDENSED STATEMENTS

BRE has entered into an agreement to purchase 1,301 units in seven apartment
communities in Tucson, Arizona. The purchase price was $51,637,000, consisting
of $23,477,000 in cash and the assumption of $28,160,000 of existing first
mortgage financing on six of the properties, with a weighted average interest
rate of 7.75%.

Set forth below are unaudited pro forma condensed statements of income of BRE
Properties, Inc. for the year ended July 31, 1994, which give effect to the
acquisition of the Tucson Apartments as if the acquisition had occurred on
August 1, 1993. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information
and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The unaudited
pro forma condensed statements of income are not necessarily indicative of the
results of the company's operations that would have actually occurred had the
acquisition taken place on the dates assumed, nor do such statements purport to
indicate the future results of operations.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors
The Schomac Group, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying Combined Statement of Gross Income and Direct
Operating Expenses of The Schomac Multifamily Properties listed in Note 1 (the
"Properties"), for the year ended December 31, 1993 ("Combined Historical
Summary"). This Combined Historical Summary is the responsibility of the
Properties' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this
Combined Historical Summary based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the Combined Historical Summary is free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the Combined Historical Summary. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Combined
Historical Summary. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

The accompanying Combined Historical Summary was prepared for the purpose of
complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission as described in Note 1 and is not intended to be a complete
presentation of the Properties' revenues and expenses.

In our opinion, the Combined Historical Summary of the Properties referred to
above presents fairly, in all material respects, the gross income and direct
operating expenses on the basis described in Note 1, for the year ended December
31, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the Combined
Historical Summary taken as a whole. The individual property information
included on Schedules 1 through 7 is presented for purposes of additional
analysis and is not a required part of the Combined Historical Summary. Such
information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit
of the Combined Historical Summary, and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all
material respects in relation to the Combined Historical Summary taken as a
whole.

Notes to Combined Statement of Gross Income and Direct Operating Expenses

For the Year Ended December 31, 1993

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Combined Statement of Gross Income and Direct Operating Expenses
("Combined Historical Summary") includes the operations of seven
multifamily properties (the "Properties") controlled by The Schomac
Group, Inc. and is prepared in contemplation of an acquisition by a
publicly held company. Certain expenses which would not be comparable
to the proposed future operations of the Properties have been excluded
from the Combined Historical Summary in accordance with Rule 3-14 of
Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The primary

subject to the condition that Sellers, at Buyer's election, shall (1) cure and
correct any existing defects or reasonable objections to the physical,
environmental, or title condition of the Properties, or any of them, identified
in any Disapproval Notice (as defined in SECTION 3.4) to Sellers, or (2) give
Buyer a credit against the Purchase Price for the actual cost of any such cure
or correction.

documents provided pursuant to SECTION 3.1 and listed on EXHIBIT C as soon as
they are received by Buyer. Buyer also agrees to review the Title Reports, the

specifying a particular objection, then such objection and all the items
described above and enumerated as (1)-(5) together with all exceptions reflected
in either the Title Report or Surveys not objected to shall be considered to be

object thereto or to terminate this Agreement as a result thereof. Except as

construed to require Sellers to undertake, any action or proceeding or otherwise
to incur expense either to remove any title defect or exception or to render
title to the Properties either acceptable to Buyer or marketable, indefeasible
or insurable.

3.5 SELLERS' CURE OF DISAPPROVED ITEMS. Upon Sellers' receipt of any

faith best efforts to remove or otherwise cure to Buyer's satisfaction the

otherwise fail to cure one or more of the Disapproved Items by the expiration of

Close of Escrow Buyer receives any supplement to any of the Title Reports, to
the Survey or to any other report regarding the Real Property (collectively, a
"Supplemental Report"), then Buyer and Seller shall have the right to deliver
the notices described in SECTIONS 3.4, 3.5 AND 3.6, for that Property only, and
the Closing Date for the transactions as contemplated herein shall be extended
to the date which is five (5) business days after the Cure Period pertaining to
the Supplemental Report.

3.8 COSTS TO REPAIR. Attached hereto as Exhibit M is a list for each of
the Properties of repairs which Sellers have agreed to make to Buyer's
reasonable satisfaction, together with an agreed estimate of cost for each such
repair. If any of the listed repairs have not been completed prior to Closing,
the amount shown on Exhibit M for such repair (the "holdback") shall be withheld
from the purchase price otherwise payable for that Property and retained in
escrow until the repair has been completed to Buyer's reasonable satisfaction.

such repairs have not been completed by Sellers within 90 days after Closing,

shall have no further obligation to complete the repair. Any disputes as to the
adequacy of the repair work which cannot be resolved through negotiation shall

6.6 PRORATIONS.

6.6.1 Real property taxes and assessments, personal property taxes
(if any), rent received (whether prepaid or applicable to the current rental
period), income received from tenant services and all other items of income
received with respect to the Properties shall be prorated between Sellers and
Buyer as of the Closing Date on a pro rata basis by allocating to the proper
party a credit or debit as the case may be for an amount which equals the
percentage of the applicable period during which that party held or will hold
title to the Properties multiplied by the amount of the item to be prorated.
Assessments, the payment of which have been elected to be paid in annual
installments, shall be prorated based only on the annual installment payment due
for the year during which the Closing occurs, and all subsequent annual
installments shall be the sole obligation of Buyer. If the actual amount of
such taxes and assessments is not known at the time of Closing, such proration
shall be estimated based on the most recent available information. As soon as
the actual amount of such taxes and assessments for such year is known, Sellers
and Buyer shall readjust such taxes and assessments to be paid by each party
with the result that Sellers shall pay for those taxes and assessments (or
annual installment thereof, if applicable), attributable to the period of time
prior to the Closing, and Buyer shall pay for those attributable to the period
of time commencing with the Closing. If Sellers have engaged a tax consulting
entity to protest or appeal the assessed value of any of the Properties for tax
purposes and an assessed value has not been established as of the Closing Date
based upon such protest or appeal, then Buyer may assume all of the obligations
and benefits of Sellers under and pursuant to the contract with such tax
consulting entity to the extent the contract relates to the Properties and the
result of such protest or appeal shall not be subject to proration hereunder.

6.6.2 All items of expense shall be prorated on an accrual basis as
of the Closing Date. The cost to Sellers of any leasing commissions and/or
tenant improvements or other tenant concessions (the "Tenant Concessions")
payable in connection with any Lease approved by Buyer pursuant to SECTION 5.2.2
the initial term of which commences during the Contract Period shall be prorated
between Buyer and Sellers based on the period from the date of execution of the
Lease to the expiration date of the initial term thereof. Sellers shall be
responsible for all Tenant Concessions for any Leases the initial term of which
commenced prior to the commencement of the Contract Period. Buyer shall be
responsible for all such Tenant Concessions for any Leases the

26.
<PAGE>

initial term of which commences after the expiration of the Contract Period.
Buyer shall receive a credit in Escrow in the amount of any deposits under
Leases in effect on the Closing Date, or any portion thereof, which are in each
Sellers' possession and refundable to the tenant as of the Closing Date plus the
amount of any prepaid rent for periods from and after the Closing Date. Buyer
shall not be entitled to any interest on such deposits which may have accrued
prior to the Closing Date unless such interest, under the terms of the
applicable Lease, accrues for the benefit of the tenant. Sellers shall receive
a credit in Escrow for any refundable deposits and/or bonds held by any utility,
governmental agency or service contractor with respect to the Properties,
provided that such utility, agency or contractor is obligated to refund the
deposit to Buyer, rather than to Sellers, following the Close of Escrow. Sellers
shall cause all utility meters to be read one business day prior to the Closing,
shall cause the transfer of all utility service for the Properties to Buyer's
name as of the Closing Date, and Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers in
connection therewith. Sellers shall pay utility charges incurred or accrued up
to the reading of such utility meters. If any utility services have not been
transferred to Buyer's name as of the Closing Date, then at the Closing, any
such charges with respect to services not transferred shall be provided based on
the per diem charges obtained by using the most recent period (having similar
weather) for which readings of such services are available.

6.6.3 Any rent collected by Buyer after the Closing Date shall be
applied first to pay any rent then due and owing for any period subsequent to
the Closing Date, and then to pay any rent owing for any period prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall remit such latter amounts immediately upon receipt to
Sellers. Except as specified above, if either Buyer or Sellers receive any
revenues attributable to the period during which it is not the owner of the
Property, said party shall promptly forward such amounts to the other party (if
such revenues are only partially attributable to the period during which said
party is not the owner of the Property, the amount paid to the other party shall
be based upon proration as of the Closing Date as set forth above). Buyer shall
use reasonable efforts, at no expense to Buyer, to collect and assist Sellers in
collecting any revenue which is owed to Sellers as of the Closing Date or which
comes due thereafter.

6.6.4 Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate to produce on or before the
Closing Date a schedule of prorations for each Property which is as complete and
accurate as reasonably possible. All prorations which can be reasonably
estimated as of the Closing Date shall be made in Escrow on the Closing Date.
All other prorations and any adjustments to initial estimated prorations, shall
be made by Buyer and Sellers within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date
or such later time as may be re-

27.
<PAGE>

quired, in the exercise of due diligence, to obtain the necessary information
for proration. Any net credit due one party from the other as a result of such
post-closing prorations and adjustments shall be paid to the other in cash
immediately upon the parties' written agreement to a final schedule of post-
closing adjustments and prorations.

6.7 INSURANCE. Sellers' existing liability and property insurance
pertaining to the Property shall be canceled as of the Closing Date, and Sellers
shall receive any premium refund due thereon.

6.8 DELIVERY OF ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS AND KEYS. Sellers agree to deliver to
Buyer on or immediately following the Closing Date all original Leases,
Contracts, plans and specifications, plot plans, surveys, soils reports,
Permits, Lease applications, and copies of other documents reasonably required
by Buyer in each Seller's possession pertaining to each Property, as well as all
keys and master keys to all locks on its Property, at a location designated by
Buyer.

6.9 FILING OF REPORTS. Title Company shall be solely responsible for the
timely filing of any reports or returns required pursuant to the provisions of
Section 6045(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (and any similar reports or
returns required under any state or local laws) in connection with the closing
of the transaction contemplated in this Agreement.

8.1 CONTRACT PERIOD DAMAGE. If, during the Contract Period, there occurs
any damage to or destruction of any Property ("Contract Period Damage"), Sellers
shall immediately notify Buyer in writing of the nature and extent of such
Contract Period Damage. Buyer shall have ten (10) business days from the
receipt of Sellers' written notice in which to inspect and appraise the damaged
portion of the Property and to deliver a Disapproval Notice to Sellers with
respect to the Contract Period Damage demanding that Sellers repair the Contract
Period Damage. Buyer's failure to respond shall be deemed a waiver of its right
to require that Sellers repair the Contract Period Damage. If Sellers refuse
to repair the Contract Period Damage pursuant to Buyer's Disapproval Notice, or
fail to commence repairs within a reasonable period of time, Buyer may elect in
writing to terminate this Agreement.

8.2 BUYER'S ELECTION TO PROCEED. If Buyer elects to proceed with the

collected with respect to such Contract Period Damage to repair, replace or
restore the damaged Property to the extent reasonably feasible prior to the
Closing Date. Sellers' election to commence the repair, replacement or
restoration of any Property prior to the Closing Date shall in no way imply that
Sellers have made any representation or warranty with respect to any work
performed in connection with such repair, replacement or restoration ("Sellers'
Repairs"). The plans, materials, choice of contractor and all other material
aspects of the performance of Sellers' Repairs shall be subject to Buyer's
review and approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and to the

Buyer may have at law, in equity or otherwise, including, without limitation,
the right to seek specific performance subject to the limited liability of each
Seller for a breach relating to its Property only. If Buyer defaults under this
Agreement, and such default continues for five (5) days after written notice
thereof, Each Seller's sole and exclusive remedy shall be to terminate this
Agreement and to retain its allocable share of the Deposit, if the Deposit has
been made, and if not, to sue to recover liquidated damages in the amount of its
allocable share of the Deposit, in accordance with SECTION 9.2. The foregoing
notwithstanding, no grace period, either as provided for in this SECTION 9.1 or
otherwise, shall apply to extend either the Inspection Period, the deadline for
making the Deposit, or the Closing Date.

9.2 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. BUYER AND SELLERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (1)
IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE SELLERS' ACTUAL
DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF BUYER'S DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, AND (2) TAKING
INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING ON THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT,
THE DEPOSIT IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SELLERS' ACTUAL DAMAGES IN SUCH EVENT.
CONSEQUENTLY, IN THE EVENT OF BUYER'S DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, SELLERS'
SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE TO

31.
<PAGE>

TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND TO RETAIN THE DEPOSIT IF THEN MADE, AND IF NOT, TO
RECOVER THE SAME AMOUNT FROM BUYER AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.
