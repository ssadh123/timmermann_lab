REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Grace-Sierra Horticultural Products Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of 
Grace-Sierra Horticultural Products Company and its subsidiaries as 
of December 16, 1993 and the related consolidated statements of 
operations, changes in common shareholders deficit, and cash flows 
for the period from January 1, 1993 to December 16, 1993. These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audit. The consolidated financial 
statements of Grace-Sierra Horticultural Products Company as of and 
for the year ended December 31, 1992 were audited by other auditors 
whose report thereon dated February 17, 1993 expressed an 
unqualified opinion on those statements.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, all 
of the Company's common stock was acquired by a third party 
effective on the close of business December 16, 1993.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial 
position of Grace-Sierra Horticultural Products Company and its 
subsidiaries as of December 16, 1993 and the consolidated results of 
their operations and their cash flows for the period from January 1, 
1993 to December 16, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and 
the related consolidated statement of operations, of 
shareholders' deficit and of cash flows present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of Grace-Sierra 
Horticultural Products Company and its subsidiaries at 
December 31, 1992, and the results of their operations and 
their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these 
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made 
by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable 
basis for the opinion expressed above.

GRACE-SIERRA HORTICULTURAL PRODUCTS COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS:

Grace-Sierra Horticultural Products Company ("Grace-Sierra" or 
the "Company") develops, manufactures and markets special-purpose 
controlled-release and water-soluble fertilizers, pesticides, and 
growing media for commercial markets and consumers. It markets its 
products in the United States and, through wholly-owned 
subsidiaries, to various international market areas. Manufacturing 
is conducted in facilities in the United States and The Netherlands.

Formation of Grace-Sierra

Grace-Sierra was formed on October 25, 1989 upon the combination of:

[ Sierra Chemical Company ("Sierra"), a corporation in which 
W. R. Grace & Co. ("Grace") previously held a 29% common 
stock interest, and

[ Certain business and assets of the former Grace 
Horticultural Products business ("GHP").

On October 25, 1989 Grace contributed to a newly-formed 
corporation, the business and assets, subject to certain 
liabilities, of GHP and Grace's common stock interest in 
Sierra. The newly-formed corporation then merged into Sierra 
and the name Sierra was changed to Grace-Sierra. Concurrently, 
Sierra's former shareholders, other than Grace, received 
$67,492,662 in cash from Grace-Sierra for their shares of 
common stock of Sierra. Grace received shares of mandatorily 
redeemable cumulative preferred stock ("Redeemable Preferred 
Stock") of Grace-Sierra having a redemption value on the date 
of issue of $46,400,000 and 49% of the Grace-Sierra common 
stock ("Common Stock") issued. 1001 Yosemite Limited 
("Yosemite"), a limited partnership in which several former 
principal shareholders of Sierra are partners, and Merrill 
Lynch Interfunding, Inc. acquired 30% and 21% of the Common 
Stock, respectively. Financing required to buy out Sierra's 
former shareholders other than Grace was provided by the sale 
of $65,000,000 of 10.28% Senior Notes to a group of 
institutional lenders. Since these transactions represented a 
restructuring of a majority of ownership interests, they were 
accounted for at historical costs.

Subsequent Event

Effective at the close of business on December 16, 1993, 
Grace-Sierra was acquired by O. M. Scott & Sons ("OMS"), a 
subsidiary of The Scotts Company. The acquisition was 
structured as a merger of a subsidiary of OMS into 
Grace-Sierra, with Grace-Sierra surviving and changing its name to Scotts-
Sierra Horticultural Products Company ("Scotts-Sierra").

F-7

The purchase price of $120,000,000 included the acquisition of all 
of the outstanding Common Stock of Grace-Sierra and the retirement 
of the Redeemable Preferred Stock and substantially all the 
outstanding long-term indebtedness of the Company.

These consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
have been prepared based on the financial position of Grace-Sierra 
as of December 16, 1993, prior to the merger transaction described 
above. Therefore, certain disclosures provided therein are 
substantially impacted by the transaction described above and should 
be read in consideration thereof.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 
Grace-Sierra and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which have been 
recorded on the predecessor historical cost basis after giving 
effect to the formation transactions described in Note 1. All 
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been 
eliminated.

Capital deficit

The difference between: (A) the sum of (i) the debt assumed by 
Grace-Sierra on October 25, 1989, (ii) the redemption value of the 
cumulative redeemable preferred stock and (iii) the retained 
earnings and foreign currency translation adjustment of Sierra and 
(B) the net assets of Sierra and GHP at predecessor historical cost, 
all as of October 25, 1989, has been reflected as capital deficit.

Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognized when products are shipped. A significant 
portion of sales are made under deferred payment terms.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is 
determined using the last-in, first-out method for U.S. inventories 
and the first-in, first-out method for other inventories and 
includes materials, labor and manufacturing overhead.

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and are 
depreciated by the straight-line method over their estimated useful 
lives, which range from three to ten years for machinery and 
equipment and up to 40 years for buildings.

Intangible assets

Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with financing the 
transaction described in Note 1 are accounted for as a deferred 
charge and amortized by the interest method over the terms of the 
debt agreements. Accumulated amortization of debt issuance costs 
and other intangible assets totalled $1,010,000 and $674,000 as of 
December 16, 1993 and December 31, 1992, respectively.

F-8

Foreign currency translation

The local currencies of Grace-Sierra's foreign subsidiaries have 
been designated as functional currencies. Accordingly, assets and 
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the period end 
rates of exchange, and statements of operations are translated at 
average rates of exchange for the respective period. Gains or 
losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial 
statements are accumulated as a separate component of common 
shareholders' deficit. Gains or losses resulting from foreign 
currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other 
than the entity's local currency) are included in results of 
operations.

Income taxes

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for 
Income Taxes", which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and 
liabilities for expected future tax consequences of events that have 
been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. Under 
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined 
based on the difference between the financial statement and tax 
bases of the assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. The 
cumulative effect of adopting this new accounting principle did not 
have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

Prior to fiscal 1993, the Company's deferred income tax provision 
was based on differences between financial reporting and taxable 
income.

approximately $1,277,000 and $1,674,000, respectively, less than 
current replacement cost.

On July 2, 1992, Company inventories sustained fire damage due to a 
lightning strike. Damage from the fire of approximately $1,268,000 
was covered under the Company's insurance policies, the final 
proceeds of which were collected during 1993.

and 1999 - $13,000.

The Senior Notes require annual payments of $13,000,000 commencing 
on October 31, 1995 and become due in full on October 31, 1999. At 
its option, Grace-Sierra, may make prepayments on the Senior Notes. 
Optional prepayments are subject to a premium, determined by a 
specified calculation. On October 14, 1993, Grace acquired all of 
the Company's outstanding Senior Notes from the group of 
institutional lenders.

The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for an initial loan 
commitment of $15,000,000 which declines to $11,000,000 in 1994, 
$6,000,000 in 1995 and terminates in 1996. The Revolving Credit 
Agreement provides Grace-Sierra the option to choose between various 
forms of loans, all of which have interest rates approximating prime plus 
5/8 of 1%. The prime rate at December 16, 1993 and December 31,
1992 was 6%. The average daily amount of the unused portion of the 
loan commitment is subject to a commitment fee of 3/8 of 1%.

The mortgage note payable is with an agency of The Netherlands 
Government, is due in equal annual installments including interest, 
and is collateralized by land and a building with a net book value of 
$1,224,000 at December 16, 1993.

The Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Agreement contain 
restrictive covenants including the maintenance of net worth, 
current ratio, interest coverage and limitations on indebtedness, 
investments, liens and encumbrances, payment of dividends and the 
sale of assets. The Company was in default of various restrictive 
covenants of the Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Agreement as 
of and throughout the period ended December 16, 1993. The Company 
received waivers from the Senior Notes holder and the bank issuing 
the Revolving Credit Agreement. At December 16, 1993, there were no 
earnings free of restrictions for the payment of cash dividends.

The Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Agreement are classified 
in the accompanying balance sheets according to their scheduled 
maturities. In connection with the acquisition of the Company (see 
Note 1), these credit facilities were retired by the acquirer.

Grace-Sierra occupies its Milpitas, California facilities under an 
operating lease expiring in 1998 under which rent is due at 
specified minimum rates. Future minimum lease commitments are as

NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

On October 25, 1989, Grace-Sierra granted Grace options to purchase 
4,100,000 shares of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock 
at a purchase price of $1.30 per share, exercisable for ten years 
commencing October 25, 1992. These options become immediately 
exercisable if there is an initial public offering of the Common 
Stock, or if either substantially all the assets or outstanding 
shares of Common Stock are sold or Grace-Sierra is merged with 
another corporation and is not the surviving company. Grace has not 
exercised its option to purchase these shares.

On October 25, 1989, Merrill Lynch Interfunding, Inc. entered into 
an agreement with Grace-Sierra which provides that if and when it 
disposes of its 210,000 shares of Common Stock it would provide 
Grace-Sierra with the initial $3,000,000 of proceeds of such sale or 
sales.

In 1984, Sierra sold its Milpitas, California facility to Yosemite. 
The gain recognized by Sierra on the sale of the facility amounted 
to $2,715,000 and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over 
ten years, the original lease term. As of December 16, 1993 and 
December 31, 1992, the unrealized portion of the gain amounted to 
$237,000 and $497,000, respectively. In 1988, Yosemite constructed 
a second facility which was also leased to Sierra. The amended 
lease agreement covering both facilities ("Facilities") expires in 
1998 and provides for scheduled minimum rent increases.

On October 25, 1989, Grace-Sierra and Yosemite amended the lease for 
the Facilities. This amendment provides Grace-Sierra an option to 
purchase the Facilities at the greater of the fair market value of 
the Facilities at the date the option is exercised or $6,350,000, as 
adjusted for inflation to the date the option is exercised. The 
option provides that in 1995 Yosemite would at its option either (1) 
sell to Grace-Sierra the 300,000 shares of Common Stock it owns for 
$780,000, (2) sell the Facilities to Grace-Sierra for $780,000 with 
Grace-Sierra assuming mortgage indebtedness on the Facilities up to 
$4,000,000, subject to adjustment or (3) grant to Grace-Sierra an 
option to purchase the Facilities in January 1997 for $780,000 with 
Grace-Sierra assuming mortgage indebtedness on the Facilities up to 
$4,000,000, subject to adjustment. This option terminates on the 
earlier of the date Grace-Sierra declines to exercise its right of 
first refusal to purchase the Facilities under the lease or July 31, 
1997.

On October 25, 1989, Grace-Sierra and Grace entered into six year 
supply agreements, subject to renewal thereafter, under which 
Grace-Sierra is required to purchase from Grace, at prices 
determined by formulas, 90% of its requirements for vermiculite. 
Grace shall also make available to Grace-Sierra certain quantities 
of soil mixes, vermiculite soil amendments and pesticide products at 
annually agreed-upon prices. Such purchases totalled $ 3,511,000 
and $2,942,000 for the periods ended December 16, 1993 and 
December 31, 1992, respectively. Grace-Sierra and Grace also 
entered into a services agreement under which Grace-Sierra may 
purchase certain administrative and technical support services from 
Grace. Charges for these services amounted to approximately 
$298,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992; there were no such 

F-12

charges for the period from January 1 to December 16, 1993. At 
December 16, 1993 and December 31, 1992, $741,000 and $451,000, 
respectively, was due to Grace, and is included in trade accounts 
payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying balance sheets.

Sales of Grace-Sierra products to Grace during the periods ended 
December 16, 1993 and December 31, 1992 were $279,000 and 
$1,130,000, respectively. As of December 16, 1993 and December 31, 
1992, the related receivable balance from Grace was $74,000 and 
$129,000, respectively and is included in accounts receivable on the 
accompanying balance sheets.

NOTE 7 - MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK:

Grace-Sierra has authorized 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock at 
$0.001 par value, of which 700,000 shares authorized are Redeemable 
Preferred Stock. Of the authorized Redeemable Preferred Stock, 
635,011 shares are issued and outstanding at December 16, 1993, at a 
redemption value of $100 per share.

Dividends on Redeemable Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue at 
an annual rate of $12 per share and are payable when and as declared 
in equal semiannual payments on June 30 and December 31 in each 
year. For each dividend payment date prior to June 30, 1992, the 
dividend was paid by issuing additional shares of Redeemable 
Preferred Stock on the basis of one full share for each $100 of such 
dividend. 67,608 shares accrued as dividends for the year ended 
December 31, 1992. For each payment date after June 30, 1992 the 
dividend is to be paid in cash. At December 16, 1993, an amount of 
$7,620,000 has been recorded as payable to shareholders of 
Redeemable Preferred Stock.

Grace-Sierra is required to redeem all shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock 
outstanding on June 30, 2004 by paying in cash the $100 per share redemption 
value, plus an amount per share equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends 
thereon. Grace-Sierra, at its option, may redeem the Redeemable Preferred 
Stock at any time prior to June 30, 2004 at redemption value plus accrued and 
unpaid dividends.

Furthermore, Grace-Sierra cannot declare or pay dividends, or make other 
distributions, on any shares of Common Stock until all accrued and unpaid 
dividends of the Redeemable Preferred Stock have been paid in full. Upon
liquidation, the holders of the Redeemable Preferred Stock shall be

F-13

entitled to receive an amount of $100 per share, plus an amount per 
share equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends. The remaining 
assets, if any, shall be distributed ratably among the holders of 
the Common Stock.

Deferred income taxes for fiscal 1993 reflect the impact of 
"temporary differences" between the amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as 
determined by tax regulations. These temporary differences are 
determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109 and are more inclusive in 
nature than "timing differences" as determined under previously 
applicable accounting principles. No deferred taxes were recognized 
in 1993 and 1992.

Upon adoption of SFAS 109, the Company recorded a net deferred tax 
asset of $4,500,000, offset by a valuation allowance of $4,500,000 
due to the uncertainty that the asset will be realized. During 
1993, the net deferred tax asset and the corresponding valuation 
allowance were increased by $1,408,000.

The differences between income tax at the federal statutory rate and 
the effective rate provided in the financial statements are

Undistributed earnings intended to be reinvested indefinitely in 
foreign subsidiaries were approximately $19,600,000 at December 16, 
1993. The determination of unrecognized deferred tax liability is 
not practicable. At December 16, 1993, the Company had net 
operating loss carryforwards of $9,700,000 for U.S. federal income 
tax purposes available to reduce future taxable income; such 
carryforwards expire in 2007. Foreign tax credit carryforwards as 
of December 16, 1993 amounted to approximately $700,000; such 
carryforwards expire beginning in years 1994 to 1997. If certain 
substantial changes in the Company's ownership should occur, there 
would be an annual limitation on the amount of the net operating 
loss carryforwards which can be utilized.

NOTE 10 - PENSION AND SAVINGS PLANS:

On October 25, 1989, Grace-Sierra adopted non-contributory defined benefit 
pension plans that cover its eligible U.S. employees. The benefits under 
these plans are based on years of service and final average compensation 
levels for salaried employees and stated amounts for hourly employees. The 
Company's funding policy, consistent with statutory requirements and tax 
considerations, is based on actuarial computations using the Projected Unit 
Credit method.

The Company also sponsors a savings and investment plan ("401K plan") for 
certain salaried U.S. employees. Participants may make voluntary 
contributions to the plan between 2% and 16% of their compensation (as 
defined). The Company contributes the lesser of 50% of each 
participant's contribution or 3% of each participant's compensation (as 
defined). Company contributions during the periods ended December 16, 
1993 and December 31, 1992 were $275,000 and $313,000, respectively.

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 
No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which 
changes the prevalent method of accounting for benefits provided after 
employment but before retirement. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 
No. 112 no later than 1995. Management is currently evaluating the 
provisions of SFAS No. 112 and, at this time, the effect of adopting SFAS 
No. 112 has not been determined.

NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is involved in various lawsuits and claims that arise in the 
normal course of business. In the opinion of management, these claims 
individually and in the aggregate are not expected to result in a 
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of 
operations, however, there can be no assurance that future results will 
not be materially affected by the final resolution of the matters.

Grace-Sierra has been named as a Potentially Responsible Party ("PRP") in 
an environmental contamination action in connection with a landfill near 
Allentown, Pennsylvania. Based on estimates of the clean-up costs and 
that the Company denies any liability in connection with this matter, 
management believes that the ultimate outcome will not have a material 
impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

The Company has been named as a PRP at a location in Newark, California 
where commercial barrels were cleaned. A voluntary effort has been 
implemented by the Company and other PRP's to remediate the location. 
Under the current plan, the remediation costs are to be allocated based 
upon the pro-rata share of barrels sent to the location. The cost to the 
Company is expected to be approximately $75,000, which has been accrued 
in the financial statements.

In addition to being named as PRP's in the above noted situations, the 
Company is subject to potential fines in connection with certain EPA 
labeling violations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and 
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The fines for such violations are based upon 
formulas as stated in FIFRA. As determined by these formulas the 
Company's maximum exposure for the violations is approximately $810,000. 
The formulas allow for certain reductions of the fines based upon 
achievable levels of compliance. Based upon management's anticipated 
levels of compliance, they estimate the Company's ultimate liability to 
be $200,000, which has been accrued in the financial statements.
