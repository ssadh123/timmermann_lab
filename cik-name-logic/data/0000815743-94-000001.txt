Item 5. Other Events.

The Board of Directors of Sears DC Corp. ("SDC") declared a $167
million dividend on December 20, 1993 to its sole stockholder, Sears,
Roebuck and Co. ("Sears"), payable on December 30, 1993. The Board also 
approved payment to Sears on December 30, 1993 of $319 million out of
capital in excess of par value, such payment is characterized as a
dividend under the Delaware General Corporation Law. Payment was
effected by a $486 million reduction in SDC's investment in the notes 
of Sears and reduces capital at SDC to $5 million at December 31, 1993. 
The Net Worth Maintenance Agreement between Sears and SDC, which
provides for Sears to maintain ownership of and positive stockholder's
equity in SDC, remains in full force and effect. The reduction in
capital was made possible as a result of Sears strategic repositioning
that was completed in November 1993, with the sale of its Sears Mortgage 
Banking operations.
