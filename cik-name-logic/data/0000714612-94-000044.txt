CCB FINANCIAL ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO PURCHASE SHARES OF
SECURITY CAPITAL BANCORP COMMON STOCK

Durham, North Carolina-----CCB Financial
Corporation announced today that, prior to and in connection
with its previously announced combination
with Security Capital Bancorp (Nasdaq:SCBC), it
intends to purchase on the open market shares of
Security Capital's outstanding common stock.

Ernest C. Roessler, President and Chief
Executive Officer of CCB explained: "CCB
previously announced that it began a program to
repurchase shares of its own common stock on the
open market or in private transactions. Purchases of
Security Capital stock are the equivalent of
purchases of CCB stock and will serve the same
purpose."

The CCB-Security Capital combination is
expected to be consummated, subject to shareholder
and regulatory approvals, during the second quarter
of 1995. CCB will issue .50 of a share of its common
stock for each Security Capital Bancorp share.

Mr. Roessler stated that: "CCB and
Security Capital are moving along on schedule with
the combination. We will keep our respective
shareholders advised of all material events as they
occur."
