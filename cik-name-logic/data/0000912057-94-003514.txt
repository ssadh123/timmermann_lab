NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

DEBT SECURITIES

UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT
----------------------

1. INTRODUCTORY. Northrop Grumman Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Company"), proposes to issue and sell from time to time certain of its debt
securities registered under the registration statement referred to in Section
2(a) ("Registered Securities"). The Registered Securities will be issued under
an indenture, dated as of October 15, 1994 ("Indenture"), between the Company
and Chase Manhattan Bank, National Association, as Trustee, in one or more
series, which series may vary as to interest rates, maturities, redemption
provisions, selling prices and other terms, with all such terms for any
particular series of the Registered Securities being determined at the time of
sale. Particular series of the Registered Securities will be sold pursuant to a
Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, for resale in accordance with terms of
offering determined at the time of sale.

The Registered Securities involved in any such offering are hereinafter
referred to as the "Securities". The firm or firms which agree to purchase the
Securities are hereinafter referred to as the "Underwriters" of such Securities,
and the representative or representatives of the Underwriters, if any, specified
in a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3 are hereinafter referred to as the
"Representatives"; provided, however, that if the Terms Agreement does not
specify any representative of the Underwriters, the term "Representatives", as
used in this Agreement (other than in Sections 2(b), 5(c) and 6 and the second
sentence of Section 3), shall mean the Underwriters.

2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. The Company represents
and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:

(a) A registration statement (No. 33-55143), including a prospectus,
relating to the Registered Securities has been filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("Commission") and has become effective; no order
preventing or suspending the use of such Prospectus has been issued by the
Commission and no proceeding for that purpose has been threatened or
initiated by the Commission. Such registration statement, as amended at
the time of any Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, is hereinafter
referred to as the "Registration Statement", and the prospectus included in
such Registration Statement, as supplemented as contemplated by Section 3
to reflect the terms of the Securities and the terms of offering thereof,
as first filed with the Commission pursuant to and in accordance with Rule
424(b) ("Rule 424(b)") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the
"Act"), including all material filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and incorporated by reference
therein, is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus."

(b) On the effective date of the registration statement relating to
the Registered Securities, such registration statement conformed in all
respects to the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
as amended, (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the rules and regulations of
the Commission ("Rules and Regulations") and did not include any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or

<PAGE>

necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and on the date of
each Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, the Registration Statement
and the Prospectus will conform in all respects to the requirements of the
Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the Rules and Regulations, and neither of
such documents will include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, except that the foregoing does
not apply to (i) statements in or omissions from any of such documents
based upon written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter
through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein and (ii)
that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the
Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) of the Trustee under
the Trust Indenture Act.

(c) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when
they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may
be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and
the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the Rules and Regulations, and none of
such documents contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading.

(d) Each of the Company and its significant subsidiaries listed on
Schedule A hereto (each, a "Subsidiary" and, collectively, the
"Subsidiaries") has been duly organized, is validly existing as a
corporation in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry
on its business as currently being conducted, to own, lease and operate its
properties, and each is duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation authorized to do business in each jurisdiction where the
operation, ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified
would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
the properties, business, results of operations, condition (financial or
otherwise), affairs or prospects of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole (a "Material Adverse Effect").

(e) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other ownership interest in, each Subsidiary have been duly and validly
authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and not subject
to any preemptive rights, and all of the shares of capital stock of, or
other ownership interests in, each Subsidiary are owned, directly or
through Subsidiaries, by the Company. Except as set forth in the
Prospectus, all such shares of capital stock are owned free and clear of
any security interest, mortgage, pledge, claim, lien or encumbrance (each,
a "Lien"). There are no outstanding subscriptions, rights, warrants,
options, calls, convertible securities, commitments or sale or Liens
related to or entitling any person to purchase or otherwise to acquire any
shares of the capital stock of, or other ownership interest in, any
Subsidiary.

(f) The Indenture has been duly authorized by the Company, and, when
duly executed and delivered in accordance with its terms, will be a valid
and legally binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, by

2

<PAGE>

general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) or by any implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, and will conform to the description thereof
in the Prospectus. The Securities have been duly authorized by the Company
and, on the Closing Date, will have been duly executed by the Company and
will conform to the description thereof in the Prospectus. When the
Securities are issued, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the
Indenture and paid for in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Securities will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and
entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.

(g) Each of the firms of accountants that has certified or shall
certify the applicable consolidated financial statements and supporting
schedules of the Company and/or Grumman Corporation ("Grumman"), as the
case may be, filed or to be filed with the Commission as part of the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus or incorporated by reference
therein are independent public accountants with respect to the Company and
its consolidated subsidiaries and Grumman and its consolidated
subsidiaries, as the case may be, as required by the Act. The consolidated
historical and PRO FORMA financial statements, together with related
schedules and notes, set forth in the Prospectus and the Registration
Statement or incorporated by reference therein comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Act. Such historical
financial statements fairly present the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and Grumman and its
consolidated subsidiaries, as the case may be, at the respective dates
indicated and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
respective periods indicated, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied throughout such
periods. Such PRO FORMA financial statements have been prepared on the
basis consistent with such historical statements, except for the PRO FORMA
adjustments specified therein, and give effect to assumptions made on a
reasonable basis and present fairly the historical and proposed
transactions contemplated by the Prospectus and this Agreement. The other
financial and statistical information and data included in the Prospectus
and in the Registration Statement, historical and PRO FORMA, are, in all
material respects, accurately presented and prepared on a basis consistent
with such financial statements and the books and records of the Company and
Grumman.

3. PURCHASE AND OFFERING OF SECURITIES. The obligation of the
Underwriters to purchase the Securities will be evidenced by an exchange of
telegraphic or other written communications ("Terms Agreement") at the time the
Company determines to sell the Securities. The Terms Agreement will incorporate
by reference the provisions of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided
therein, and will specify the firm or firms which will be Underwriters, the
names of any Representatives, the principal amount to be purchased by each
Underwriter, the purchase price to be paid by the Underwriters and the terms of
the Securities not already specified in the Indenture, including, but not
limited to, interest, maturity, any redemption provisions, any sinking fund
requirements, any conversion rights or provisions and whether any of the
Securities may be sold to institutional investors pursuant to Delayed Delivery
Contracts (as defined below). The Terms Agreement will also specify the time
and date of delivery and payment (such time and date, or such other time not
later than seven full business days thereafter as the Representatives and the
Company agree as the time for payment and delivery, being herein and in the
Terms Agreement referred to as the "Closing Date"), the place of delivery and
payment and any details of the terms of offering that should be reflected in the
prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Securities. The
obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities will be several and
not joint. It is

3

<PAGE>

understood that the Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale as set
forth in the Prospectus. The Securities delivered to the Underwriters on the
Closing Date will be in definitive, fully registered form, in such denominations
and registered in such names as the Underwriters may request.

If the Terms Agreement provides for sales of Securities pursuant to
delayed delivery contracts, the Company authorizes the Underwriters to solicit
offers to purchase Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts
substantially in the form of Annex I attached hereto ("Delayed Delivery
Contracts") with such changes therein as the Company may authorize or approve.
Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors, including
commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment
companies and educational and charitable institutions. On the Closing Date the
Company will pay, as compensation, to the Representatives for the accounts of
the Underwriters, the fee set forth in such Terms Agreement in respect of the
principal amount of Securities to be sold pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts
("Contract Securities"). The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in
respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. If
the Company executes and delivers Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Contract
Securities will be deducted from the Securities to be purchased by the several
Underwriters and the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased by
each Underwriter will be reduced pro rata in proportion to the principal amount
of Securities set forth opposite each Underwriter's name in such Terms
Agreement, except to the extent that the Representatives determine that such
reduction shall be otherwise than pro rata and so advise the Company. The
Company will advise the Representatives not later than the business day prior to
the Closing Date of the principal amount of Contract Securities.

4. CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OF THE COMPANY. The Company agrees with the
several Underwriters that it will furnish to Latham & Watkins, counsel for the
Underwriters, one signed copy of the registration statement relating to the
Registered Securities, including all exhibits, in the form it became effective
and of all amendments thereto and that, in connection with each offering of
Securities:

(a) The Company will file the Prospectus with the Commission pursuant
to and in accordance with Rule 424(b)(2) or, if applicable and if consented
to by the Representatives, subparagraph (5), not later than the second
business day following the execution and delivery of the Terms Agreement.

(b) The Company will advise the Representatives promptly of any
proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus and will afford the Representatives a reasonable opportunity to
comment on any such proposed amendment or supplement; and the Company will
also advise the Representatives promptly of the filing of any such
amendment or supplement and of the institution by the Commission of any
stop order proceedings in respect of the Registration Statement or of any
part thereof and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any
such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued.

(c) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is
required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of
which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under

4

<PAGE>

which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to
amend the Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Company promptly will
prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will
correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such
compliance. Neither the Representatives' consent to, nor the Underwriters'
delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of
any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.

(d) As soon as practicable following the issuance and sale of any of
the Registered Securities, the Company will make generally available to its
security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will comply with the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.

(e) The Company will furnish to the Representatives copies of the
Registration Statement, including all exhibits, any related Prospectus, any
related preliminary prospectus supplement, the Prospectus and all
amendments and supplements to such documents, in each case as soon as
available and in such quantities as are reasonably requested.

(f) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities
for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives
designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as
required for the distribution.

(g) During the period of 5 years after the date of any Terms
Agreement, the Company will furnish to the Representatives and, upon
request, to each of the other Underwriters, if any, as soon as practicable
after the end of each fiscal year a copy of its annual report to
stockholders for such year, and the Company will furnish to the
Representatives (i) as soon as available, a copy of each report or
definitive proxy statement of the Company filed with the Commission under
the Exchange Act or mailed to stockholders, and (ii) from time to time,
such other information concerning the Company as the Representatives may
reasonably request.

(h) The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of
its obligations under this Agreement and will reimburse the Underwriters
for any expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by
them in connection with qualification of the Registered Securities for sale
and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of
such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate pursuant to Section
4(f) hereof and the printing of any memorandum relating thereto, for any
fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the
Securities, for fees charged by the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. and for expenses incurred in distributing the Prospectus, any
preliminary prospectuses and any preliminary prospectus supplements to the
Underwriters. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this
Section, Section 6 and Section 8 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of
their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer
taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising
expenses connected with any offers they may make.

(i) For a period beginning at the time of execution of the Terms
Agreement and ending on the later of (x) the termination of the syndicate
of Underwriters in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities
or (y) the Closing Date, without the prior consent of the

5

<PAGE>

Representatives, the Company will not offer, sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of United States dollar-denominated debt securities
issued or guaranteed by the Company and having a maturity of more than one
year from the date of issue.

5. CONDITIONS OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE UNDERWRITERS. The obligations of
the several Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Securities will be subject

(iii) on the basis of the procedures referred to in (ii)

officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and
accounting matters, (x) nothing came to their attention that caused
them to believe that such unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects

accounting matters whether the unaudited condensed consolidated

Statement (X) are in conformity with generally accepted accounting

the audited consolidated financial statements of Grumman and its
subsidiaries incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement
and (y) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable

<PAGE>

All financial statements and schedules included in material incorporated by
reference into such prospectus shall be deemed included in such prospectus
for purposes of this subsection.

(c) On or prior to the date of the Terms Agreement, the
Representatives shall have received a letter, dated the date of delivery
thereof, of Ernst & Young confirming that they are independent public
accountants within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published
Rules and Regulations thereunder and stating in effect that (i) they
audited the consolidated balance sheets of VAC Acquisition Corp.("VAC")

the VAC Financial Statements and have found such dollar amounts and other
financial information to be in agreement with such results.

(d) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations and Section 4(a) of this
Agreement. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or of any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceedings
for that purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the
Company or any Underwriter, shall be contemplated by the Commission.

(e) Subsequent to the execution of the Terms Agreement, there shall
not have occurred (i) any change, or any development involving a
prospective change, in or affecting particularly the business or properties

impairs the investment quality of the Securities or the Registered
Securities; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities or
preferred stock of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical
rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the
Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under
surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities or preferred stock
of the Company (other than an announcement with positive implications of a
possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such
rating); (iii) any suspension or limitation of trading in securities
generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices
for trading on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of any
securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter
market; (iv) any banking moratorium declared by Federal or New York
authorities; or (v) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in
which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by Congress or
any other substantial national or international calamity or emergency if,
in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Underwriters, including
any Representatives, the effect of any such outbreak, escalation,
declaration, calamity or emergency makes it impractical or inadvisable to
proceed with completion of the sale of and payment for the Securities.

(f) The Representatives shall have received an opinion, dated the
Closing Date, of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton, counsel for the
Company, to the effect that:

8

<PAGE>

(i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been duly
incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the
laws of the State of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with corporate
power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as
described in the Prospectus; and, to the best of such counsel's
knowledge, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all other
jurisdictions in which it owns or leases substantial properties or in
which the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect;

(ii) The Company has authorized capitalization as set forth in
the Prospectus;

(iii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company and has been duly qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act; the Securities have been duly authorized; the
Securities other than any Contract Securities have been duly executed,
authenticated, issued and delivered; the Indenture and the Securities
other than any Contract Securities constitute, and any Contract
Securities, when executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in the
manner provided in the Indenture and sold pursuant to Delayed Delivery
Contracts, will constitute, valid and legally binding obligations of
the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law) or by any implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing; and the Securities other than any Contract
Securities conform, and any Contract Securities, when so issued and
delivered and sold, will conform, to the description thereof contained
in the Prospectus;

(iv) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing
with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement
(including the provisions of this Agreement) in connection with the
issuance or sale of the Securities by the Company, except such as have
been obtained and made under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and
such as may be required under state securities laws;

(v) The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture,
the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and
any Delayed Delivery Contracts and the issuance and sale of the
Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will
not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions
of, or constitute a default under, any Federal, California or Delaware
statute or any rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or
body or any court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its
properties or any material agreement or instrument to which the
Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of
the properties of the Company is subject, or the charter or by-laws of
the Company, and the Company has the power and authority to

9

<PAGE>

authorize, issue and sell the Securities as contemplated by the Terms
Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement);

(vi) After due inquiry, such counsel does not know of any legal
or governmental proceeding pending or threatened to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their
respective property is subject which is required to be described in
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and is not so described;

(vii) The Registration Statement has become effective under
the Act, the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the
subparagraph of Rule 424(b) specified in such opinion on the date
specified therein, and, to the best of the knowledge of such counsel,
no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or of any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings
for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated
under the Act, and the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
(other than the financial statements and notes thereto and supporting
schedules and other financial and statistical information contained
therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion) complied as
to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act, the
Trust Indenture Act and the Rules and Regulations; and

(viii) The Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this
Agreement) and any Delayed Delivery Contracts have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.

Such counsel shall also state that on the basis of their involvement
in the preparation of the Registration Statement and although they have not
verified the accuracy or completeness of the statements contained therein
or in any amendment thereto, nothing has come to the attention of such
counsel which causes them to believe that the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus (other than the financial statements and notes thereto and
supporting schedules and other financial and statistical information
contained therein) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and such counsel
does not know of any contracts or documents of a character required to be
described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or to be filed as
exhibits to the Registration Statement which are not described and filed as
required; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as
to the financial statements or other financial data contained in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel shall opine as to the effect
of the federal laws of the United States, the internal laws of the States
of California and New York and the General Corporation Laws of the State of
Delaware. As to matters involving application of the laws of the State of
New York, to the extent specified in such opinion, such counsel may rely on
the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable and
who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters.

(i) The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture,
the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and
any Delayed Delivery Contracts and the issuance and sale of the
Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will
not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions
of, or constitute a default under, any Federal, California or Delaware
statute or any rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or
body or any court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its
properties or any agreement or instrument to which the Company is a
party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of its
properties is subject, or the charter or by-laws of the Company, and
the Company has the power and authority to authorize, issue and sell
the Securities as contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including the

Statement or the Prospectus and is not so described, or of any
contract or other document which is required to be described in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus or is required to be filed as
an exhibit to the Registration Statement which is not described or
filed as required.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel shall opine as to the effect
of the federal laws of the United States, the internal laws of the State of
California and the General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware.

(h) The Representatives shall have received from Latham & Watkins,
counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing
Date, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the

counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to
pass upon such matters.

(i) The Representatives shall have received a certificate, dated the
Closing Date, of the President or any Vice-President and a principal
financial or accounting officer of the Company in which such officers, to
the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state
that the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement
are true and correct, that the Company has complied with all agreements and
satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder
at or prior to the Closing Date, that no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof has been

adverse change in the financial position or results of

11

<PAGE>

operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries except as set forth in or
contemplated by the Prospectus or as described in such certificate.

(j) The Representatives shall have received a letter , dated the
Closing Date, of Deloitte & Touche L.L.P. , which reconfirms the matters
set forth in their letter delivered pursuant to subsection (a) of this
Section and which states in effect that:

(i) in their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and
schedules examined by them and incorporated by reference in the

(iii) on the basis of the procedures referred to in (ii)
above, and inquiries of officials of the Company who have
responsibility for financial and accounting matters, nothing came to
their attention that caused them to believe that: any modifications
should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement for

Regulations;

(iv) on the basis of reading the unaudited pro forma condensed

officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and
accounting matters, (x) nothing came to their attention that caused
them to believe that such unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable accounting requirements of Rule 11-02 of
Regulation S-X and (y) they have proven the arithmetic accuracy of the
application of the pro forma adjustments to the historical amounts in

(v) on the basis of the review referred to in (ii) above, a
reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the
Company, inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility
for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures,
nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:

12

(A) the unaudited financial statements, if any, included in

Prospectus;

(C) at the date of the latest available balance sheet read

than five days prior to the Closing Date, there was any change in
the capital stock or any increase in short-term indebtedness or
long-term debt of the Company and consolidated Subsidiaries or,
at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such

statement included in the Prospectus to the closing date of the
latest available income statement read by such accountants there
were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period of
the previous year and with the period of corresponding length
ended the date of the latest income statement included in the
Prospectus, in consolidated net sales, net operating income,
income before extraordinary items or net income or in the ratio
of earnings to fixed charges;

except in all cases set forth in clauses (C) and (D) above for
changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have

(vi) they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages
derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information
included in the Prospectus and not covered by their letter delivered
pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section (in each case to the extent
that such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information
are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of the Company's
accounting system or are derived directly from such records by
analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a
reading of such general accounting records and other procedures
specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts,

<PAGE>

The Company will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of
such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as they reasonably request.

6. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.

(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against
any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such
Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or
preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred;
provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the
extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged
omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the
Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein.

(b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which
the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or
preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in
each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such
Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein,
and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the
Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under
subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement
thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than
under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against
any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement
thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to
the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party will not be liable to such

15

<PAGE>

indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In any such action, any
indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party
unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually
agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such
action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and
the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between
them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the
legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any action or related
actions in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more
than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such
indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as
they are incurred. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written
consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or
threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have
been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified
party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter
of such action.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or
insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b)
above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the
one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities
or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by
applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the
relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of
the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with
the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters
on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net
proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company
bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the
Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified
party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in
the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal
or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection
with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this
subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no
Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount
by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and
distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any
damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in
this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective
underwriting obligations and not joint.

16

<PAGE>

(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition
to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the
same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter
within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under
this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective
Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and
conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who
has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls
the Company within the meaning of the Act.

7. DEFAULT OF UNDERWRITERS. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default
in their obligations to purchase Securities under the Terms Agreement and the
aggregate principal amount of the Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or
Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total
principal amount of the Securities, the Representatives may make arrangements
satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other
persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made
by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated
severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under this Agreement
and the Terms Agreement, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting
Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters
so default and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities with respect to
which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount
of the Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the
Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within
36 hours after such default, such Terms Agreement will terminate without
liability on the part of any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as
provided in Section 8. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter"
includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing
herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
The respective commitments of the several Underwriters for the purposes of this
Section shall be determined without regard to reduction in the respective
Underwriters' obligations to purchase the principal amounts of the Securities
set forth opposite their names in the Terms Agreement as a result of Delayed
Delivery Contracts entered into by the Company.

The foregoing obligations and agreements set forth in this Section will not
apply if the Terms Agreement specifies that such obligations and agreements will
not apply.

8. SURVIVAL OF CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND OBLIGATIONS. The respective
indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the
Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made
pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of
any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf
of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives,
officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and
payment for the Securities. If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Securities by the
Underwriters under the Terms Agreement is not consummated, the Company shall
remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to
Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters
pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Securities
by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7 or the occurrence of
any event specified in clause (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 5(c), the Company
will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees
and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the
offering of the Securities.

them at their addresses furnished to the Company in writing for the purpose of

or telegraphed and confirmed to it at Northrop Grumman Corporation, 1840 Century
Park East, Los Angeles, California 90067, Attention: John R. Rettberg,

10. SUCCESSORS. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Company and such Underwriters as are identified in Terms
Agreements and their respective successors and the officers and directors and
controlling persons referred to in Section 6, and no other person will have any
right or obligation hereunder.

11. APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement and the Terms Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.

action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered
to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such
instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced
thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing
such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of
a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this
Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and
the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.

The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such
instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such
execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by
law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing
such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where
such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual
capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof
of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or
writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved
in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security
Register.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder
of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the
registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in
respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the
Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon
such Security.

The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of
determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to
give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be
given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided that the
Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph
shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice,
declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any
record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding
Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders,
shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders
remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be
effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date
by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such
series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a
record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the
record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person
be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed
to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal
amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action
is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the
Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the
proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the
Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in
the manner set forth in Section 106.

The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of
determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join
in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of
acceleration referred to in Section 502, (iii) any request to institute
proceedings referred to in Section 507(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in
Section 512, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any
record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding
Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be
entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or
not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such
action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable
Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding
Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall
be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any
action for which

-12-
<PAGE>

a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the
record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person
be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed
to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal
amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action
is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the
Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the
proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the
Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in
the manner set forth in Section 106.

With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the
party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any date as the
"Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any
earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless
notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in
writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner
set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an
Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant
to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record date shall be deemed to
have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration
Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as
provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date
shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.

Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to give
or take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so
with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by
one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such
appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.

Section 105. NOTICES, ETC., TO TRUSTEE AND COMPANY.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this
Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,

(1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be
sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed
in writing to or with the Trustee at 4 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, New
York 11245, Attn: Corporate Trust Department,

-13-
<PAGE>

(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be
sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly
provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the
Company addressed to it at the address of its principal office specified
in the first paragraph of this instrument or at any other address
previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company.

Section 106. NOTICE TO HOLDERS; WAIVER.

Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event,
such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly
provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder
affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register,
not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date
(if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to
Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any
defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the
sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture
provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the
Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and
such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by
Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a
condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver.

In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by
reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail,
then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall
constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

Section 107. CONFLICT WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT.

If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a
provision of the Trust Indenture Act that is required under such Act to be a
part of and govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall control. If any
provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust
Indenture Act that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be
deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case
may be.

Section 109. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall
bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

Section 110. SEPARABILITY CLAUSE.

In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.

Section 111. BENEFITS OF INDENTURE.

Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied,
shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors
hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy
or claim under this Indenture.

Section 112. GOVERNING LAW.

This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws.

Section 113. LEGAL HOLIDAYS.

In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or
Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of
Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the
Securities (other than a provision of any Security that specifically states that
such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section)) payment of interest or
principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on
such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of
Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date
or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, provided, that no interest shall
accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after such Interest
Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be.

Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with
such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60
days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The
foregoing

enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon
on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the

(13) if the principal of or any premium or interest on any
Securities of the series is to be payable, at the election of the Company
or the Holder thereof, in one or more currencies or currency units other

(16) whether either or both of Section 1302 and Section 1303 shall
not apply to the Securities of the series;

Securities and, in such case, the respective Depositaries for such Global
Securities, the form of any legend or legends which shall be borne by any
such Global Security in addition to or in lieu of that set forth in
Section 204 and any circumstances in addition to or in lieu of those set
forth in Clause (2) of the last paragraph of Section 305 in which any such

to the Board Resolution referred to above and (subject to Section 303) set

referred to above or in any such indenture supplemental hereto. All Securities
of any one series need not be issued at one time and, unless otherwise provided,
a series may be reopened for issuances of additional Securities of such series.

Unless otherwise provided with respect to the Securities of any
series, at the option of the Company,

-27-
<PAGE>

interest on the Securities of any series that bears interest may be paid by
mailing a check to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address
shall appear in the Security Register.

If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken
pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action
shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and
delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers'
Certificate setting forth the terms of the series.

Section 302. DENOMINATIONS.

The Securities of each series shall be issuable only in registered
form without coupons and only in such denominations as shall be specified as
contemplated by Section 301. In the absence of any such specified denomination
with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series
shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.

Section 303. EXECUTION, AUTHENTICATION, DELIVERY AND DATING.

The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its
Chairman of the Board, its Vice Chairman of the Board, its President or one of
its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its
Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these
officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.

Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals
who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not
hold such offices at the date of such Securities.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery
of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by
the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for
the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in
accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such
Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been
established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by
Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the
additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities,
the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be
fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,

-28-
<PAGE>

(1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or
pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form
has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;

(2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or
pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms
have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
and

(3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any
conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and
legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with
their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity
principles [and, if applicable, to provisions of law which may require
that a judgment for money damages rendered by a court in the United States
be expressed in United States dollars].

If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be
required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities
pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or
immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner
which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding
paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one
time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise
required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel
otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the
authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered
at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security
of such series to be issued.

Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or
be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a
certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein,
executed by the

-29-
<PAGE>

Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be
conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly
authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued
and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the
Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this
Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and
delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this
Indenture.

Section 304. TEMPORARY SECURITIES.

Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the
Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination,
substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they
are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and
other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as
evidenced by their execution of such Securities.

If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will
cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable
delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the
temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive
Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such
series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that
series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any
one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more
definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of
like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary
Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits
under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.

Section 305. REGISTRATION, REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE.

The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of
the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other
office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes
collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company

-30-
<PAGE>

shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities.
The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of
registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a
series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that
series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more
new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like
tenor and aggregate principal amount.

At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be
exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized
denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender
of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any
Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making
the exchange is entitled to receive.

All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange
of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same
debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer
or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly
endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the
Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than
exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer.

If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified
tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (A) to
issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of
that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning
at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of
redemption of any such Securities

-31-
<PAGE>

selected for redemption under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business
on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any
Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed
portion of any Security being redeemed in part.

The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) below shall
apply only to Global Securities:

(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall
be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global
Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a
nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall
constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.

(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no
Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities
registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may
be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for
such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i)
has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
Depositary for such Global Security or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing
agency registered under the Exchange Act, (B) there shall have occurred
and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security
or (C) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in
lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as
contemplated by Section 301.

(3) Subject to the provisions of Clause (2) above, the rights of
holders of such Global Securities shall be exercised only through the
Depositary and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements
between such holders and the Depositary and or the Depositary
participants. The initial Depositary will make book-entry transfers among
the Depositary participants and receive and transmit distributions of
principal and interest on the Global Securities to such Depositary
participants.

The Depositary may be treated by the Company and the Trustee, and
any of their respective agents, employees, officers and directors, as the
absolute owner of the Global Securities for all purposes whatsoever.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Indenture shall prevent the
Company and the Trustee, or any of their respective agents, from giving
effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization
furnished by

-32-
<PAGE>

the Depositary, or shall impair the operation of customary practices
governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Global Security.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, any holder may grant
proxies and otherwise authorize any person to take any action which a
holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Global Securities.

(4) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security
for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities
issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be
registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall
direct.

(5) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration
of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any
portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 304, 306, 906
or 1107 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of,
and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the
name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a
nominee thereof.

Section 306. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN SECURITIES.

If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company
shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal
amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i)
evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security
and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of
them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to
the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security
of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number
not contemporaneously outstanding.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has
become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may,
instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the
Company may require the payment of a sum

-33-
<PAGE>

sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the
Trustee) connected therewith.

Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in
lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed,
lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be
entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with
any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to
the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement
or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

Section 307. PAYMENT OF INTEREST; INTEREST RIGHTS PRESERVED.

Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable,
and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall
be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor
Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date
for such interest.

Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is
not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein
called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder
on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and
such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each
case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted
Interest to the Persons in whose name the Securities of such series (or
their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of
business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted
Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall
notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed
to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed
payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee
an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in
respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory
to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed

-34-
<PAGE>

payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of
the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause
provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the
payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days
and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and
not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of any notice of
the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of
such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the
Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted
Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class
postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series, not less
than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed
payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor
having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the
Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective
Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such
Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the
following Clause (2).

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the
Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with
the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may
be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if,
after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment
pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed
practicable by the Trustee.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security
delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange
for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued
and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

Section 308. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS.

Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer,
the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat
the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such
Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium
and (subject to Section 307) any interest on such Security and for all other
purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the
Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be
affected by notice to the contrary.

-35-
<PAGE>

Section 309. CANCELLATION.

All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of
transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if
surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee
and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to
the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and
delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner
whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery
to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated
hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so
delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be
authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided
in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled
Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of as directed by a Company
Order.

Section 310. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST.

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

ARTICLE FOUR
SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE

Section 401. SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE.

This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect
(except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of
Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of
the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture, when

(1) either

(A) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered
(other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen
and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 306 and
(ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company
and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust,

-36-
<PAGE>

(B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation

(i) have become due and payable, or

(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated
Maturity within one year, or

(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year
under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense,
of the Company,

and the Company, in the case of (i) (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused
to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose money
(either in United States dollars or such other currency or currency units in
which the securities of any series may be payable) in an amount sufficient to
pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and
interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have
become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the
case may be;

(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable hereunder by the Company; and

(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers'

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture,
the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations
of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall
have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Clause (1) of
this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last
paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive.

Section 402. APPLICATION OF TRUST MONEY.

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all
money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust
and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this
Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any

-37-
<PAGE>

Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the
Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any
premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the
Trustee.

ARTICLE FIVE
REMEDIES

Section 501. EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

"Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Securities
of any series, means any of the following events (whatever the reason for such
Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected
by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or
any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):

default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section
specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this
Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that
series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days
after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the
Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of
at least 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that
series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it
to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default"
hereunder; or

(5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of
(A) a decree or order for relief in respect of

<PAGE>

the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any
applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or

bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of
the Company under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a
custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other
similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its

decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive
days; or

(6) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or
proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency,

involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the
commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against
it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking
reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the
consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or
taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee,
sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any
substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for
the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its
inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of
corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or

(7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities
of that series.

Section 502. ACCELERATION OF MATURITY; RESCISSION AND ANNULMENT.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in
Section 501(5) or 501(6)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time
Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities
of that series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of that
series (or, if any Securities of

-39-
<PAGE>

that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the
principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) to
be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to
the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal
amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an
Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) with respect to
Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of
all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are
Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such
Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and
without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any
Holder, become immediately due and payable.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to
Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the
Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay;

(A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any
Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such
declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Securities,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful,
interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in
such Securities, and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel; and

(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that
series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that
series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration,
have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.

-40-
<PAGE>

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

Section 503. COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT BY TRUSTEE.

The Company covenants that if:

(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security
when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for
a period of 30 days; or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or
premium, if any, on) any Security whether at the Maturity or upon
acceleration or otherwise thereof;

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such
Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that
payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue
principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further
amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection,
including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect
and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such
series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most
effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific
enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

Section 504. TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any
other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act
in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such
proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and
receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims
and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee,
liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each

-41-
<PAGE>

Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee
shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to
the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other
amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.

No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the
Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder
any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to
vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided,
however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election
of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors'
or other similar committee.

Section 505. TRUSTEE MAY ENFORCE CLAIMS WITHOUT POSSESSION OF SECURITIES.

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the
Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession
of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating
thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in
its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall,
after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the
ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such
judgment has been recovered.

Section 506. APPLICATION OF MONEY COLLECTED.

applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and,
in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium
or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the
payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section
607; and

SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for
principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities in respect of

-42-
<PAGE>

amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium
and interest, respectively.

THIRD: To the Company or any other Person or Persons entitled
thereto.

Section 507. LIMITATION ON SUITS.

No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to
institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture,
or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy
hereunder, unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee
of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that
series;

(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to
the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default
in its own name as Trustee hereunder;

indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in
compliance with such request;

(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice,
request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such
proceeding; and

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been
given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have
any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of
such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any
other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in
the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such
Holders.

Section 508. UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM AND
INTEREST AND TO CONVERT.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of
any Security shall have the right,

-43-

which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and
any premium and (subject to Section 307) interest on such Security on the
respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of
redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to convert such Security in accordance
with the provisions in the form of Security of any particular series pursuant to
Section 301(9) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and
right to convert, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of
such Holder.

Section 509. RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to
enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to
the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any
determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall
be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and
thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue
as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

Section 510. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph
of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the
Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or
remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or
employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the
concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Section 511. DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER.

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any
Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default
shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event
of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this
Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to
time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders,
as the case may be.

place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or

Securities of such series, provided that:

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law
or with this Indenture; and

Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

on any Security of such series, or

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under
Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any
Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every
purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Section 514. UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS.

In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to
file an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and may assess costs against
any such party litigant, in the manner and to the extent provided in the Trust
Indenture Act; provided that neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act
shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make
such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company.

Section 515. WAIVER OF USURY, STAY OR EXTENSION LAWS.

The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so)
that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever

wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the
covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent
that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of
any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the
execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit
the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

ARTICLE SIX
THE TRUSTEE

Section 601. CERTAIN DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and
after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred,
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default to the actual knowledge of
a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has occurred, has not been waived and is
continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in
it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their
exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the
conduct of his own affairs.

No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent actions, its own negligent failure
to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:

(a) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after
the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default which may have
occurred;

(i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be
determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and
the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such
duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this
Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read
into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

-46-
<PAGE>

(ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee,
the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements
and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any
statements, certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and
conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of
any such statements, certificates or opinions which by any provision
hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the
Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine
whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture;

(b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of
judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible
Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was
negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with
the direction of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal
amount of the Securities at the time outstanding relating to the time,
method and place of conducting a proceeding for any remedy available to
the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee,
under this Indenture.

None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the
Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of
its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable ground for believing that the
repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such liability is not
reasonably assured to it.

This Section is in furtherance of and subject to Sections 315 and
316 of the Trust Indenture Act.

Section 602. NOTICE OF DEFAULTS.

If a default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any
series, the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities of such series notice
of such default as and to the extent provided by the Trust Indenture Act;
provided, however, that in the case of any default of the character specified in
Section 501(4) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to
Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. For
the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or
after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with
respect to Securities of such series.

the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,

Authenticating Agent or Security Registrar hereunder, the rights and
protections afforded to the Trustee pursuant to this Indenture shall also
be afforded to such Paying Agent, Authenticating Agent or Registrar;

(9) the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of an Event of
Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee obtains actual
knowledge of such event or the Trustee receives written notice of such
event from the Company or form Holders of Securities of any series so
affected evidencing no less than 51 % of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of Securities of such series; and

(10) when the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in
connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or Section
501(6), such expenses (including the fees and expenses of its counsel) and
the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of
administration under any bankruptcy or insolvency law.

Section 604. NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR RECITALS OR ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES.

The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the
Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of
the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any
responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as

the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or
application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof.

Section 605. MAY HOLD SECURITIES.

The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any
Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any
other capacity, may become

-49-
<PAGE>

the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 608 and 613, may
otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were
not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such
other agent.

Section 606. MONEY HELD IN TRUST.

Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated
from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be
under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as
otherwise agreed with the Company.

Section 607. COMPENSATION AND REIMBURSEMENT.

The Company agrees:

(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable
compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation
shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation

(2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse
the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements
and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any

expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence
or bad faith; and

If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within
the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such
interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to
the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. To the extent
permitted by such Act, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting
interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to
Securities of more than one series.

Section 609. CORPORATE TRUSTEE REQUIRED; ELIGIBILITY.

There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder, which may be
Trustee hereunder for Securities of one or more other series. Each Trustee
shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as
such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and has its
Corporate Trust Office in the City of New York. If any such Person publishes
reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements
of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section
and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and
surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as
set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time
the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign
immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this
Article.

Section 610. RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR.

No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a
successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the
applicable requirements of Section 611.

The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of
one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the
instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall
not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such
notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the
Securities of such series.

-51-
<PAGE>

The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the
Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to
the Company.
If at any time:

(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after
written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a
bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months,

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and
shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by
any such Holder, or

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be
adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its
property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or
control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;

then, in any such case, (A) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the
Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (B) subject to Section 514, any
Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months
may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court
of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all
Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.

If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of
acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with
respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board
Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect
to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such
successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more
or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with
respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the
applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such
resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a
successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be
appointed by act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring
Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance
of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section
611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series

-52-
<PAGE>

and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If
no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have
been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the
manner required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of
himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the
Securities of such series.

The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal
of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment
of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all
Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 106.
Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the
Securities of such series and the address of its corporate trust office.

Section 611. ACCEPTANCE OF APPOINTMENT BY SUCCESSOR.

In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request
of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon
payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such
successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and
shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property
and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the
retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of
one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto
wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall
contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and
confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that
or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2)
if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall
contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm

-53-
<PAGE>

that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with
respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and
(3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts
hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or
in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the
same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts
hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by
any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental
indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become
effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor
Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such
retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor
Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with
respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of
such successor Trustee relates.

Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall
execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred
to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.

No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time
of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under
this Article. No trustee hereunder shall be liable for the acts or omissions of
any successor Trustee.

Section 612. MERGER, CONVERSION, CONSOLIDATION OR SUCCESSION TO BUSINESS.

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business
of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such
corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the

-54-
<PAGE>

Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to
such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the
Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee
had itself authenticated such Securities.

Section 613. PREFERENTIAL COLLECTION OF CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY.

If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company
(or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the
provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against
the Company (or any such other obligor).

Section 614. APPOINTMENT OF AUTHENTICATING AGENT.

The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with
respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on
behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon
original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption
thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be
entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for
all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference
is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by
the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall
be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an
Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of
the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be
acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and

segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a
sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due

The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of
Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an
instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to
the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (1) comply with the
provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (2)
during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon
the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the
Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith
pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in
respect of the Securities of that series.

satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or
by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in
trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee
upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or
such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee,

or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years
after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be
paid to the Company on Company request, or (if then held by the Company) shall
be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter,
as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof,
and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust
money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon
cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being
required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company

the Company may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection
therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided,

any series, omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision
or condition set forth in any covenant provided pursuant to Section 301(19),

time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount
of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by act of such Holders,
either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with
such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect

-69-
<PAGE>

Restricted Subsidiary to such person, unless (a) the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled, pursuant to the provisions of Section
1009, to issue, assume or guarantee Debt secured by a Mortgage upon such
Principal Property at least equal in the amount to the Attributable Debt in
respect of such arrangement without equally and ratably securing the Outstanding
Securities; provided, however, that from and after the date on which such

ARTICLE ELEVEN
REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES

Section 1101. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE.

Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated
Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities) in
accordance with this Article.

Section 1102. ELECTION TO REDEEM; NOTICE TO TRUSTEE.

The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be
evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated
by Section 301 for such Securities. In case of any redemption at the election
of the Company of less than all the Securities of any series (including any such
redemption affecting only a single Security), the Company shall, at least 60
days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice
shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee in writing of such
Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be
redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In
the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any
restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or
elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an
Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction.

Section 1103. SELECTION BY TRUSTEE OF SECURITIES TO BE REDEEMED.

If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed
(unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be
redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the
particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days
prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of
such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee
shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for
redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series,
provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security
shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum
authorized denomination) for

-71-
<PAGE>

such Security. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a
specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single
Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more
than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding
Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for
redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the
Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities
selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed.

The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with
respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such
Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such
redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the
Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than
the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security.

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise
requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate,
in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the
portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be
redeemed.

Section 1104. NOTICE OF REDEMPTION.

Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption
Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in
the Security Register.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date,

(2) the Redemption Price,

(3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series
consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the
identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such
Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be
redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series
consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the principal amount
of the particular Security to be redeemed,

-72-
<PAGE>

(4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become
due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable,
that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,

(5) the place or places where each such Security is to be
surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price, and

(6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the
case.

Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of
the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the
Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.

Section 1105. DEPOSIT OF REDEMPTION PRICE.

Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the
Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying
Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of
money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption
Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities
which are to be redeemed on that date.

Section 1106. SECURITIES PAYABLE ON REDEMPTION DATE.

Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities
so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the
Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the
Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued
interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any
such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall
be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest
to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is
on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such
Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the
close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the
provisions of Section 307.

If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon
surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until
paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in
the Security.

-73-
<PAGE>

Section 1107. SECURITIES REDEEMED IN PART.

Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be
surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee
so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof
or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security
without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of
like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in
aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion
of the principal of the Security so surrendered.

ARTICLE TWELVE
SINKING FUNDS

Section 1201. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE.

The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking
fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities.

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the
terms of any Securities is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund
payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the
terms of such Securities is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund
payment". If provided for by the terms of any Securities, the cash amount of
any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section
1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of
Securities as provided for by the terms of such Securities.

Section 1202. SATISFACTION OF SINKING FUND PAYMENTS WITH SECURITIES.

The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series
(other than any previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as a credit
Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the
Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of
permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such
Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund
payment with respect to any Securities of such series required to be made
pursuant to the terms of such Securities as and to the extent provided for by
the terms

-74-
<PAGE>

of such Securities; provided that the Securities to be so credited have not been
previously so credited. The Securities to be so credited shall by received and
credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price, as specified
in the Securities so to be redeemed, for redemption through operation of the
sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced
accordingly.

Section 1203. REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES FOR SINKING FUND.

Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for
any Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such
Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if
any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if
any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to
Section 1202 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so
delivered. Not less than 30 days prior to each such sinking fund payment date,
the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund
payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the
redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the
Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly
given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in
the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.

Section 1301. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE; COMPANY'S OPTION TO EFFECT DEFEASANCE
OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE.

Unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 301, this Article

with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the
date

-75-
<PAGE>

the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called
"Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall
be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by
such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such
Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the
Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments
acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until
otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder; (1) the rights of Holders of such

and 1007 (and any other Sections or covenants applicable to such Securities that
are determined pursuant to Section 301 to be subject to this provision), and any
covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(19), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit

be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such
Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set
forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance").
For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such
Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in
respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified
Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 501(4)), whether
directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such
Section or Article or by reason of any reference in any such Section or Article

The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section
1302 or Section 1303 to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case
may be:

(1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee which satisfies the
requirements contemplated by Section 609 and agrees to comply with the
provisions of this Article applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for
the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as

with respect to any specific payment of principal of or interest on any
U.S. Government Obligation which is so specified and held, provided that
(except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any
deduction from the amount payable to the holder of

-77-
<PAGE>

such depositary receipt from any amount received by the custodian in
respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific payment of
principal or interest evidenced by such depositary receipt or (B) in the
case of Securities of such series denominated in a currency other than the
U.S. dollar, (i) money in such currency in an amount, or (ii) Foreign

currency in an amount, or (iii) a combination thereof, in each case
sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered
to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the
Trustee (or any such other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, the
principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of such series
on the respective Stated Maturities, in accordance with the terms of this
Indenture and the Securities of such series. As used herein, "Foreign

obligation of the government that issued such currency for the payment of
which full faith and credit of such government is pledged or (ii) an

such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount
payable to the holder of such depositary receipt from any amount received
by the custodian in respect of the Foreign Government Obligation or the
specific payment of principal or interest evidenced by such depositary
receipt.

(2) In the event of an election to have Section 1302 apply to any
Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company
shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A)
the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the
Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date of

-78-

tax law, in either case (A) or (B) to the effect that, and based thereon
such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Securities will not
recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the
deposit, Defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to such
Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount,
in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such
deposit, Defeasance and discharge were not to occur.

(3) In the event of an election to have Section 1303 apply to any
Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company
shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for
Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and Covenant

Certificate to the effect that neither such Securities nor any other
Securities of the same series, if then listed on any securities exchange,
will be delisted as a result of such deposit.

would become, an Event of Default with respect to such Securities or any
other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such
deposit or, with regard to any such event specified in Sections 501(5) and
(6), at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such
deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed
satisfied until after such 90th day).

(6) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the
Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust
Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning
of such Act).

(7) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a
breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement
or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound.

(8) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the
trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within
the meaning of the Investment

-79-
<PAGE>

Company Act unless such trust shall be registered under such Act or exempt
from registration thereunder.

(9) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been
complied with.

Section 1305. DEPOSITED MONEY AND U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS TO BE HELD IN
TRUST; MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all
money and U.S. Government Obligations or Foreign Government Obligations
(including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee or other qualifying
trustee (solely for purposes of this Section and Section 1306, the Trustee and
any such other trustee are referred to collectively as the "Trustee") pursuant
to Section 1304 in respect of any Securities shall be held in trust and applied
by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this
Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent
(including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may
determine, to the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due
thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but money so held
in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required
by law.

The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee
or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations
or Foreign Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the
principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee
or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding
Securities.

Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company
Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in
Section 1304 with respect to any Securities that, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written
certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of an amount
thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or
Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities.

-80-
<PAGE>

Section 1306. REINSTATEMENT.

If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in
accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any
order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining
or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this
Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or
released pursuant to Section 1302 or 1303 shall be revived and reinstated as
though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such
Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply
all money held in trust pursuant to Section 1305 with respect to such Securities
in accordance with this Article; provided, however, that if the Company makes
any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security
following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated
to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment
from the money so held in trust.

This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to
be duly executed, and their respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed
and attested, all as of the day and year first above written.

for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or
interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

NET INCOME UP 50%

NORTHROP GRUMMAN REPORTS SHARP INCREASE IN SALES,
BUSINESS BACKLOG FOLLOWING GRUMMAN, VOUGHT ACQUISITIONS

LOS ANGELES -- Oct. 19, 1994 -- Northrop Grumman Corporation today
reported third quarter sales of $1.93 billion, up 58 percent from the
$1.22 billion recorded in the third quarter of 1993. Net income during the
quarter was $39 million, up 50 percent from the $26 million recorded in the
third quarter of 1993. Earnings per share totaled 79 cents, compared with
54 cents per share in the corresponding quarter of 1993.

Last year's third quarter included a pretax loss provision of
$14 million for the AGM-137 Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile (TSSAM) program
and an $18 million retroactive tax increase enacted in August 1993. The benefit
in this year's third quarter from the delivery of two B-2 bombers to the Air
Force was largely offset by a $20 million pretax loss provision on TSSAM, due to
increased costs to complete the development program. The company also recorded
a $1 million loss on the 747 jetliner program as a result of a cumulative margin
rate adjustment on existing 747 production contracts. The one-time adjustment
was made principally to cover increased costs allocated to the contracts as a
result of establishing a separate commercial aircraft operating element.

Northrop Grumman's business backlog at Sept. 30, 1994, was
$12.4 billion versus $7.2 billion reported a year earlier.

NET INCOME UP 50%

NORTHROP GRUMMAN REPORTS SHARP INCREASE IN SALES,
BUSINESS BACKLOG FOLLOWING GRUMMAN, VOUGHT ACQUISITIONS

Following its acquisition of the Grumman Corporation last April, the
company completed its purchase of the Vought Aircraft Company during the
third quarter of 1994. Northrop Grumman results for the third quarter and the
first nine months of 1994 include Grumman activity for only the second and
third quarters, and Vought for August and September. Comparative results for
1993 do not include Vought or Grumman data.

Without the Grumman and Vought acquisitions, the company's
third quarter sales would have declined 6 percent due primarily to lower B-2
revenues and fewer 747 shipset deliveries. F/A-18E/F development revenues rose
during the quarter.

The company said the Grumman acquisition was basically neutral to
earnings in the third quarter, while Vought was accretive.

Net income for the first nine months of 1994 totaled $156 million, up
19 percent from the $131 million in the same period of 1993. Earnings per share
in the first nine months of 1994 were $3.17 compared to $2.74 in the first
nine months of last year. The increase in net income for the first nine months
of 1994 resulted from the same factors cited for the improvement in
third quarter net income.

Sales for the first three quarters of 1994 were $4.8 billion versus
$3.8 billion the first three quarters of 1993. The increase achieved from
including Grumman and Vought's post-acquisition sales and higher F/A-18E/F
revenue was partially offset by lower B-2 revenue and fewer F/A-18C/D shipset
deliveries.
