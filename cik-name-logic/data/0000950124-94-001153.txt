Item 5. Other Events

On June 15, 1994, Yellow Corporation (the company) announced that it expects
to report a loss of between $23 and $25 million, or between $.80 and $.90 per
share, for the second quarter of 1994. This loss is entirely due to the 23 day
strike during April by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) against
Yellow Freight System, Inc., the company's largest motor carrier subsidiary.
Comparatively, in the second quarter of 1993, the company lost $1.9 million, or
$.07 per share, after an $11.2 million after-tax, or $.40 per share,
restructuring charge.

Yellow Freight System is experiencing better-than-anticipated return to
pre-strike business levels. The return of business is running about 90 to 95
percent of pre-strike levels, a more rapid return of business than originally
anticipated. Yellow Freight System showed a profit for the month of May and
is winning back business with an intensive marketing effort aimed at restoring
customer confidence. They are signing business without additional discounting
and are working aggressively to make sure that this trend continues through
1994 and 1995.

With pricing stability and a healthy economy, the company's primary
subsidiary stands to benefit later this year from the flexibility gained in the
industry's new four-year agreement with the IBT. Final second quarter results
will be available on July 21, 1994.
