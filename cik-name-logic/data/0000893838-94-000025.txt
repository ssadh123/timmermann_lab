AMERICAN BRANDS ANNOUNCES DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
TO SELL FRANKLIN LIFE INSURANCE

Old Greenwich, CT, November 30 -- American Brands, Inc. announced
today that it has executed a definitive agreement for the sale of
its Franklin Life Insurance business to American General
Corporation for which American Brands will receive $1.17 billion
in cash, which will be tax free. The transaction, which is
subject to antitrust and insurance regulatory approvals and other
customary conditions, is expected to close during the first
quarter of 1995.
In connection with this transaction, the Board has
authorized the purchase in the open market and in privately
negotiated transactions of up to 10 million shares of Common
stock, following the closing of the transaction. Such purchases
may be effected from time to time subject to market conditions.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William J. Alley said: 
"We have been aggressively restructuring our operations to
enhance American Brands' presence as a consumer powerhouse with
leading market positions. Today's agreement marks another
dramatic milestone in that restructuring. In April, we announced
an agreement to sell The American Tobacco Company for $1 billion,
and clearance to proceed with that transaction is currently
before the courts. In July, we sold the Dollond & Aitchison
optical group for $146 million. Underlying these transactions is
a strategy focused on increasing shareholder value and enhancing
our long-term growth prospects.
"While Franklin Life does not fit with our sharpened focus
on branded consumer products, it is an outstanding company that
has performed well and has been very profitable. Thus, we are
particularly pleased that Franklin will become associated with a
quality organization focused exclusively on financial services. 
"For American Brands and its stockholders, this is an
excellent deal, representing about 14 times Franklin's projected
1994 net income. We anticipate that, depending on market
conditions, the proceeds will provide funds to purchase shares
and, initially, to reduce debt. As opportunities arise, we
intend to further enhance the competitiveness and growth
prospects of American Brands through strategic acquisitions,
focusing on our long-term growth businesses -- hardware and home
improvement products, office products and golf and leisure
products -- and on distilled spirits. In the event that the
American Tobacco transaction closes, the Company would consider
similar redeployment of the proceeds. 
"We further anticipate that, even though Franklin has been a
strong contributor to our consolidated income, the transaction
will have no material impact on the ability of the Company to pay
dividends. Effective with the June 1, 1994 payment, the dividend
on the Common stock was increased to an indicated annual rate of
$2.00.
"In connection with this agreement, our life insurance
business will be accounted for as a discontinued operation, and
prior periods' results will be restated. The estimated book loss
to be recorded in 1994, including provision for net income during
the phase-out period from November 30 through the anticipated
closing of the transaction, will be in the range of $220 million. 
"Although a book loss will be recorded, the sale price of
$1.17 billion compares with an investment when we completed our
acquisition of Franklin in 1979 of approximately $645 million. 
Through last year, Franklin had contributed a total of over $2
billion to operating income, and we had taken about $650 million
in cash dividends. 
"If this sale and the proposed sale of The American Tobacco
Company are consummated, the new American Brands would consist of
profitable, strongly positioned companies that have performed
well. For the first nine months of this year, each of the major
businesses that would constitute the new American Brands achieved
increases in operating company contribution, and each is solidly
positioned with leadership positions in its markets. For the
year 1994, we now anticipate that even though earnings per share
including discontinued operations will show a decline reflecting
the book loss, earnings per share from continuing operations will
be comfortably ahead of 1993 earnings per share from continuing
operations (before accounting changes) of $2.67.
