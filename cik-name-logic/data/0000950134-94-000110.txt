VALHI REPORTS 1993 RESULTS

DALLAS, TEXAS . . February 11, 1994 . . Valhi, Inc. reported a net
loss for 1993 of $79.1 million, or $.69 per share, compared to a net loss of
$98.3 million, or $.86 per share, for 1992. The Company's fourth quarter net
loss was $9.7 million compared to a net loss of $26.4 million in the fourth
quarter of 1992. Valhi's wholly-owned consolidated operations were profitable
in both 1992 and 1993 with the net losses in both years resulting from losses
attributable to the Company's interest in unconsolidated publicly-held
affiliates, NL Industries, Inc. (49%-owned) and Tremont Corporation
(48%-owned).

Operating income increased 34% to $26 million in the fourth quarter
and increased 15% to $91 million for the year. Refined sugar sales prices and
volumes, while below 1992 levels for the year, strengthened in the last half of
1993. In the forest products segment, medium density fiberboard volumes were a
Company record, higher log volumes and selling prices contributed to increased
earnings and the closure of the Company's plywood operations in January 1993
reduced sales but aided earnings comparisons. Fast food sales were a new
record resulting in near-record earnings, and the hardware products segment
reported record sales and earnings.

Both NL and Tremont reported significantly increased losses in 1993.
Lower selling prices for titanium dioxide pigments ("TiO2"), NL's principal
product, contributed significantly to the deterioration in NL's 1993 operating
results. Tremont's titanium metals business, conducted by its TIMET
subsidiary, continues to operate in a difficult economic environment as
military and commercial aircraft demand for titanium waned and producers in the
former Soviet Union expanded their shipments to the rest of the world. The
Company's losses attributable to these affiliates also included charges for
other than temporary impairment of market value amounting to $22 million in the
fourth quarter of 1992 (Tremont) and $84 million in the first quarter of 1993
(NL). At the end of 1993, the Company's net carrying value of its investments
in these affiliates was $60 million, or $2.43 per NL share, and $15 million, or
$4.17 per Tremont share.

During 1993, the Company completed its program, begun over two years
ago, to repay or refinance approximately $575 million of high-cost debt. The
redemption in 1993 of the final $235 million of the Company's 12 1/2% Senior
Subordinated Notes, funded in part using proceeds from lower cost subsidiary
borrowings, was a significant factor in reducing interest expense by 25% in
1993.

In response to the outlook for prolonged TiO2 price weakness, NL
commenced a program in early 1993 to reduce debt levels, extend maturities and
increase liquidity. This program was completed in October 1993 when NL joint
ventured its recently commissioned plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, sold $350
million in new long-term notes and reduced and extended outstanding bank debt.
In December 1993, the holders of $75 million of TIMET debentures converted them
into a 25% equity ownership of TIMET.

Extraordinary items in both 1992 and 1993 relate to prepayments of
indebtedness and in 1993 includes $10 million attributable to NL's refinancings
referred to above. Changes in accounting for marketable securities as of the
end of 1993 resulted in a $42 million increase in the Company's equity,
substantially all of which was recorded as a direct credit to stockholders'
equity with only a nominal amount included in earnings. The almost $70 million
charge to earnings for accounting changes in 1992 relates to retiree benefits
and income taxes, over 90% of which charge was attributable to NL and Tremont.

Valhi, Inc., headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a diversified
industrial management company engaged in the refined sugar, forest products,
fast food and hardware products industries. Valhi is also engaged in the
chemicals and titanium metals industries through its equity interests in NL and
Tremont. Valhi's common stock is traded on the New York and Pacific Stock
Exchanges under the symbol "VHI."
