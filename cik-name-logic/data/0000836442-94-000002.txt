Item 5. Other Events

In March 1994, Oryx Energy Company (Company) adopted plans
designed
to achieve significant future cost reductions (Restructuring). 
Components of the Restructuring include asset disposals and staff
reductions. Associated therewith, the Company will recognize a
$161 million pretax ($103 million after tax) charge in the first
quarter of 1994. Management expects the Restructuring to result
in
a minimum of $61 million annual cost reductions in 1995.

The Properties included in the divestment plan make up 52-percent
and 31-percent of the Company's U.S. onshore fields and
properties. 
During 1993, however, these properties accounted for less than
three percent of the Company's worldwide oil and gas production
and
at December 31, 1993, they accounted for less than four percent
of
the Company's worldwide proved reserves and net investment in
properties, plants and equipment. The staff reductions will
affect
about 20-percent of the Company's workforce.
