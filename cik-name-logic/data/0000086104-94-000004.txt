SAFECO EXPECTS EARTHQUAKE LOSSES OF
APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION AFTER REINSURANCE

SEATTLE--(March 1, 1994)--SAFECO Corporation (OTC: SAFC) announced today
that it expects its losses from the January 17 earthquake in Southern
California to be approximately $60 million after reinsurance, according to
Boh A. Dickey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
On February 3, the company stated, based on preliminary information,
that it expected its losses to exceed $50 million, the threshold at which 
reinsurance would be triggered. "At that time, we lacked sufficient
information to estimate a range of the gross amount of the losses," Dickey
said.
The company expects about 8,000 claims from the catastrophe. Based on
current information, SAFECO estimates its gross losses will range from $150
to $175 million before reinsurance. Under its catastrophe reinsurance
program, SAFECO is reimbursed for 90 percent of losses between $50 and $200
million.
SAFECO has more than 400 staff in the Los Angeles area dedicated to
handling claims for customers affected by the earthquake.
