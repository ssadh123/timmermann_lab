Item 5. Other Events

HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES, INC. RECEIVES STATE COURT
APPROVAL OF LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT

On April 6, 1994, Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) received
state court approval for the out-of-court agreement between HEI and the Hawaii
Insurance Commissioner, stemming from the commissioner's April 1993 lawsuit
over the December 1992 discontinuance of HEI's property-casualty insurance
subsidiary.

The agreement calls for HEI to pay $32 million to the commissioner as
rehabilitator/liquidator of the Hawaiian Insurance Group in return for
dismissal of the lawsuit and release of claims against HEI, its affiliates and
their past and present officers and directors. HEI will fund the settlement,
which was announced February 10, 1994, from available cash and/or short-term
borrowings. The $32 million settlement amount is to be deposited in an escrow
account by April 20, 1994 and will be disbursed upon dismissal of the lawsuit
and expiration of appeal periods with no appeals having been taken.

The settlement resulted in a $15 million, or 58 cents per share,
after-tax charge to HEI's 1993 earnings.
