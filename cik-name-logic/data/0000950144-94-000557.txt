ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

Effective February 15, 1994, Kentucky Community Bancorp, Inc.
("Kentucky Community") merged with and into Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc.
("Trans Financial") and each of the outstanding shares of common stock of
Kentucky Community were converted into 5.3 shares of common stock of Trans
Financial for an aggregate issuance of approximately 1,374,985 shares of Trans
Financial common stock. Holders of shares of Kentucky Community common stock
received cash, without interest, in lieu of fractional shares of Trans
Financial common stock.

The transaction was effected pursuant to a an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganizaton and related Plan of Merger (collectively, the "Merger Agreement")
dated November 9, 1993, as amended January 6, 1994, between Trans Financial and
Kentucky Community, and was approved by the shareholders of Kentucky Community
at a special meeting held on February 15, 1994. Kentucky Community, a bank
holding company headquartered in Maysville, Kentucky, owned one hundred
percent (100%) of the outstanding capital stock of State National Bank,
Maysville, Kentucky, Farmers Liberty Bank, Augusta, Kentucky, and Peoples Bank
of Morehead, Morehead, Kentucky. At September 30, 1993, Kentucky Community
reported total consolidated assets of approximately $ 171 million. The
consideration given by Trans Financial for the acquisition of Kentucky
Community was determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

The only material relationship between any of Kentucky Community or
its shareholders and Trans Financial or any of its affiliates, any director or
officer of Trans Financial or any associate of any such director or officer was
as follows: Kentucky Community granted Trans Financial concurrently with the
execution of the Merger Agreement the option to purchase 85,840 shares of
Kentucky Community's authorized but unissued shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $84.80 per share.

The assets acquired by Trans Financial in the transaction consisted of
Kentucky Community's three subsidiary banks, State National Bank, Maysville,
Kentucky, Farmers Liberty Bank, Augusta, Kentucky, and Peoples Bank of
Morehead, Morehead, Kentucky. It is anticipated that the physical assets of
the three banking subsidiaries of Kentucky Community will continue to be used
by them for general banking purposes.

Independent Auditor's Report

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Kentucky Community Bancorp, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kentucky
Community Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1992.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kentucky Community
Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1992, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

KENTUCKY COMMUNITY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 1992, 1991 and 1990

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
------------------------------------------

Basis of Presentation
---------------------

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kentucky
Community Bancorp, Inc. (the Corporation) and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, The State National Bank of Maysville (State
National), Farmers Liberty Bank (Farmers Liberty) and Peoples
First Bank of Morehead (Peoples), collectively (the Banks). 
Significant intercompany items have been eliminated in
consolidation. In preparing the consolidated financial
statements, management is required to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and
expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The accounting policies and methods of applying those
policies which have a significant effect on the financial
statements are summarized below. Certain prior year amounts have
been reclassified for comparability with 1992 presentation.

Securities
----------

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the
time of purchase. If management has the intent and the
Corporation has the ability at the time of purchase to hold
securities until maturity or on a long-term basis, they are
classified as investments and carried at amortized historical
cost. Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and
not intended to be held to maturity or on a long-term basis are
classified as available for sale and carried at the lower of
aggregate cost or market value. Securities held for indefinite
periods of time include securities that management intends to use
as part of its asset/liability management strategy and that may
be sold in response to changes in interest rates, resultant
prepayment risk and other factors related to interest rate and
prepayment risk changes. The specific identification method is
used to determine the cost of securities sold. Amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts is recorded by a method
approximating level yield. Marketable equity securities are
carried at the lower of cost or market value with unrealized
losses recorded as a reduction of stockholders' equity, unless it
is determined that market declines are other than temporary, in
which case, losses are recognized as securities losses.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued

Loans
- -----

Loans are stated at the unpaid principal balance. Interest income on loans is
recorded on the accrual basis except for those loans in a non-accrual
income status. The accrual of interest income is discontinued on
loans, except consumer loans, which become 90 days past due as to
principal or interest unless they are well-secured and in the process
of collection. Such loans remain on a non-accrual status until factors
indicating doubtful collectibility no longer exist. Consumer loans
which become 120 days past due are charged to the allowance for loan
losses unless they are well-secured and in the process of collection.
Unearned income, arising principally from consumer installment loans,
is reflected as a reduction of loans and is recognized as income using
a method which approximates the interest method.

Allowance for Loan Losses
- -------------------------

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb
probable losses in the loan portfolio. Management determines the
adequacy of the allowance based upon reviews of individual credits,
recent loss experience, current economic conditions and such other
factors that, in management's judgment, deserve current recognition in
estimating loan losses. The allowance for loan loses is increased by
the provision for loan losses and reduced by net loan charge-offs.

Premises and Equipment
- ----------------------

Premises and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Other Assets
- ------------

Included in other assets is real estate acquired in settlement of loans and
loans classified as in-substance foreclosures which are carried at the
lower of fair value minus estimated selling costs or cost. Any
write-downs to fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the
allowance for loan losses. Expenses incurred in maintaining
(Continued)

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued

assets, subsequent write-downs to reflect declines in value and
realized gains or losses are reflected in income for the period. Also
included in other assets is accrued interest receivable and the excess
of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations
(goodwill) which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
twenty years. Unamortized amounts of goodwill were $1,824,000 and
$1,960,000 at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Income Taxes
- ------------

Deferred income taxes are provided for income or expenses recognized in
different periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax
purposes. The Corporation accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 96, "Accounting
for Income Taxes," which requires the use of an asset and liability
approach. The amounts provided for income taxes are based upon the
amounts of current and deferred taxes payable or refundable at the date
of the financial statements as measured by the provisions of enacted
laws and tax rates.

SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, supersedes SFAS No. 96 and is
required to be adopted in 1993. SFAS No. 109 retains the asset and
liability approach but changes the procedure to measure deferred tax
assets and liabilities. The Corporation plans to adopt SFAS No. 109 on
a prospective basis and expects that the implementation of this new
accounting standard will not be significant to financial condition or
results of operations.

Net Income Per Share
- --------------------

On December 17, 1991, the Corporation's Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1
stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend, payable
January 15, 1992. All per share information in these financial
statements has been restated to give effect to this stock split. The
weighted average number of shares outstanding, after giving effect to
this stock split was 257,264 in 1992, 257,226 in 1991 and 257,113 in
1990.

Statement of Cash Flows
-----------------------

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Corporation considers
cash and due from banks to be cash equivalents.

(2) Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks
---------------------------------------

The Banks are required to maintain average reserve balances relating to
customer deposits either with the Federal Reserve Bank or in
the Banks' vaults. At December 31, 1992, the amount of those
required and maintained reserve balances was approximately
$1,695,000.

The amount of non-accrual and restructured loans at December 31, 1992
and 1991 totaled approximately $714,000 and $1.76 million,
respectively. Interest that would have been recorded if all
such loans were on a current status in accordance with their
original terms was approximately $90,000 in 1992 and $139,000
in 1991. The amount of interest income that was recorded for
such loans was approximately $33,000 and $98,000 in 1992 and
1991, respectively.

Loans to directors and their associates, including loans to affiliated
companies of which directors are principal owners, and
executive officers amounted to approximately $898,000 and
$1,006,000 at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively. These
loans were made on substantially the same terms, including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time
for other customers, and do not, in the opinion of management,
involve more than normal credit risk.

Loans outstanding and related unfunded commitments are primarily
concentrated within the Banks' markets which encompass
Northeast Kentucky. The Banks' credit exposure is
diversified, with secured and unsecured loans to consumers,
small businesses, farmers and corporations. Although the
Banks have diversified loan portfolios, a customer's ability
to honor contracts is reliant upon the economic stability of 
the geographic region and/or industry in which they do 
business. No single industry concentration exceeds 10% of
loans.

notes due and payable. The secured notes are collateralized 
by all the issued and outstanding common stock of State 
National.

Maturities of the notes payable for the years ending December 31, are
$315,000 in 1993, $318,000 in 1994 and $608,000 in 1995.

State National has entered into an agreement with the Federal Home Loan 
Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB) which enables State National to 
borrow up to $2,228,000. Advances from the FHLB would be 
collateralized by certain first mortgage loans under a 
blanket mortgage collateral agreement and stock in the FHLB.

Subordinated debentures (see note 8) and preferred stock of the 
Corporation are subordinated to all notes payable.

(8) Subordinated Debentures
-----------------------
On October 30, 1989 the corporation made an offer to exchange one 10% 
subordinated debenture due December 31, 2009 (new debenture) 
in exchange for each 25-year escalating rate debenture due 
December 31, 2007 (old debenture). The purpose of the 
exchange was to restructure the Corporation's $3,509,000 
subordinated debenture debt and to reduce the Corporation's 
total debt service obligations by a reduction in the 
interest rate. Effective January 1, 1990, the exchange 
occured and debentures which were not exchanged were called 
on February 1, 1990. Repayment of these debentures was 
financed by the unsecured note payable discussed in note 7. 
The new debentures are subordinated to all indebtedness of 
the Corporation to financial institutions as were the old 
debentures.

(10) Stockholders' Equity
--------------------
Preferred Stock
---------------
Preferred stock was issued to the directors of Farmers Liberty and
Peoples as qualifying shares. Dividends were paid at the
same rate per share as on common stock; however, holders of
the preferred shares waived the right to receive dividends.
In the event of termination or liquidation of the Corporation,
the preferred shares have priority over common shares to the
extent of the stated value of the preferred shares. Each
preferred share carries voting rights equal to one share of
common stock. The preferred stock is not convertible or
redeemable. During 1991, all outstanding preferred stock was
retired.

Dividend Restriction
--------------------
The Corporation's principal source of funds for dividend and interest
payments is dividends received from the Banks. Under
applicable banking laws, bank requlatory authorities must
approve the declaration of dividends in any year in an amount
in excess of the sum of net income of that year, as defined,
and retained earnings of the preceding two years. At December
31, 1992, retained earnings of the Corporation's subsidiary
banks were approximately $7,668,000 of which, at Januay 1,
1993, approximately $879,000 was available for the payment of
dividends without approval by bank regulatory authorities.

(11) Employee Benefit Plans
----------------------
The Corporation has a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan
covering all full-time employees who meet certain requirements
as to age and length of service. During 1991, the plan was
amended to include employees of all subsidiaries of the
Corporation. Prior to the amendment only employees of State
National were included in the plan. The Corporation's funding
policy is to contribute at least the minimum amount required
by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

The assumptions used to develop the projected benefit obligation
included a discount rate of 7.75% for 1992 and 8.0% for 1991,
and an expected rate of increase in compensation levels of
5.5% in 1992 and 4.0% in 1991. The expected long-term rate
of return on assets was 8% in 1992 and 8.5% in 1991.

Effective June 1, 1989, the Corporation established a 401 (k) Plan, in
accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,
in which all employees qualify for participation.
Participants may elect to make contributions to the 401(k)
Plan up to 15% of compensation. The Corporation contributes
$1 for each $3 contributed by a participant, up to 6% of each
participant's compensation. The Corporation's contribution
during 1992, 1991 and 1990 totaled approximately $29,000,
$26,000, and $20,000, respectively.

(12) Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
--------------------------------------
As of December 31, 1992, the Banks had outstanding various commitments
and contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of
business, such as standby letters of credit and commitments to
extend credit, which are properly not reflected in the
consolidated financial statements. In management's opinion,
these commitments to extend credit of $12,696,000, including
standby letters of credit totaling approximately $1,058,000,
represent normal banking transactions and no significant
losses are anticipated to result therefrom. The Banks'
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
other party to these commitments is represented by the
contractual amount of these instruments. The Banks use the
same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and 
conditional guarantees as they do for on balance sheet 
instruments.

(Continued)

<PAGE> 27
KENTUCKY COMMUNITY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as
long as there is no violation of any condition established in
the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration
dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of
a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Banks
evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case
basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary
by the Banks upon extension of credit, is based on
management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral
held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory,
property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial
properties.

Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written are
conditional commitments issued by the Banks to guarantee a
third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support
private borrowing arrangements.

Also as of December 31, 1992, there were various pending legal actions
and proceedings in which claims for damages are asserted.
Management, after discussion with legal counsel and after
consideration of possible recourse to third parties, believes
the ultimate result of these legal actions and proceedings
will not have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated
financial position of the Corporation.

(13) Stock Options
-------------
The Board of Directors adopted an amended stock option plan effective
September 1, 1992. Stock options remaining under the prior
plan expired. Under the amended stock option plan, options
for 2,120 shares of the common stock of the Corporation were
granted to the president of the Corporation and the Banks at
$32.50 per share. The options are currently exercisable and
expire five years from date of grant.

(14) Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments
----------------------------------------------------- 
The estimated fair value of the Corporation's financial instruments 
are as follows:

<TABLE> 
<CAPTION> 
December 31, 1992 
(In thousands) 
Carrying Fair 
Amount Value
--------------- -------------
<S> <C> <C> 
Financial assets:

Loans 100,468 101,988

Financial liabilities: 
Deposits 150,889 151,230
Notes payable and debentures 3,589 3,589
========= ========
</TABLE> 

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate that value:

Cash and Short-Term Investments
-------------------------------
For those short-term investments, the carrying amount is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

Securities
----------
For securities, fair value equals quoted market price, if available.
If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is 
estimated using quoted market prices for similar 
securities or dealer quotes.

(Continued)

22
<PAGE> 29
KENTUCKY COMMUNITY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued

Loans
-----
The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash 
flows using the current rates at which similar loans would 
be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for 
the same remaining maturities.

Deposits
--------
The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money
market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the 
reporting date. The fair value of fixed-maturity 
certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the 
future cash flows using the rates currently offered for 
deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Notes Payable and Debentures
----------------------------
Rates currently available to the Corporation for debt with similar 
terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair 
value of existing debt.

Limitations
-----------
The fair value estimates are made at a discrete point in time based on
relevant market information and information about the 
financial instruments. Because no market exists for a 
significant portion of the Corporation's financial 
instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments 
regarding future expected loss experience, current economic 
conditions, risk characteristics of various financial 
instruments, and such other factors. These estimates are
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with
precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly 
affect the estimates.

The fair value estimates are based on financial instruments without
attempting to estimate the value of assets and liabilities 
that are not financial instruments, such as premises and 
equipment and other assets and liabilities. Accordingly, 
the fair value estimates do not represent what the 
Corporation is worth on a fair value basis.
