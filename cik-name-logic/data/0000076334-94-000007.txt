Item 5. Other Events.

On April 14, 1994 Parker-Hannifin Corporation announced that it will record 
a charge of $52.7 million or $1.08 per share in the third quarter, ended 
March 31, 1994, to reduce the value of certain long-term assets and to 
recognize downsizing and relocation activities.

At the beginning of this fiscal year the Parker management team embarked upon 
an extensive review of strategic goals and challenges. Two challenges became 
immediately clear: the need to adjust the business to the structural changes 
that have occurred in the aerospace industry, and to deal with the impact of 
the continuing economic problems in Europe and South America.

Management has measured the effect of these changes on certain Parker units 
and has concluded that there has been an impairment of the value of certain 
long-lived assets, requiring the following specific accounting adjustments.

Charges affecting the Aerospace segment total $38.8 million or $.80 per 
share. The largest charge of $27.8 million or $.57 per share relates to 
goodwill and permanently impaired assets of the continuing operations of the 
aerospace heat-transfer components product line. The completion of major 
contracts and the decline of aerospace markets has caused management to 
anticipate future cash flows to be less than the value of the assets related 
to that line. The goodwill was incurred with the purchase of this line in 
1987, during a period of heavy defense spending, and has been determined to 
be without value in the current environment. These charges will have no 
cash impact.

In addition, downsizing activities over the past several years have caused 
aerospace manufacturing operations to be consolidated, leaving several idle 
facilities in weak real estate markets such as southern California. 
Management has made the decision to sell these facilities. Careful analysis 
of the current recoverable value of these properties has resulted in a charge 
for their impairment of $7.7 million or $.16 per share. This charge has no 
negative cash impact and the sale of these properties will provide cash 
proceeds.

On March 31, 1994 the Company sold its Metal Bellows operations, which 
manufactured welded and formed bellows, accumulators and other fabricated 
assemblies, principally for the aerospace market. The sale of this product 
line resulted in proceeds of $14 million, and a loss on disposition of 
$.8 million or $.02 per share.

<PAGE>
Aerospace management will be implementing further reductions in employment 
and relocation of facilities over the next twelve months which will result 
in a charge of $2.5 million or $.05 per share. The completion of this 
downsizing will position Parker to maintain its leadership role in its core 
flight control and fuel systems businesses.

Charges affecting the Industrial segment total $11.4 million or $.23 per 
share. A charge of $5.2 million or $.11 per share was taken to recognize 
permanently impaired assets for continuing industrial product lines in 
Germany and Brazil and a small joint venture in Asia. These operations have 
been producing losses and anticipated future cash flow is not expected to 
fully recover the value of the related long-lived assets or investments. 
This charge has no cash impact.

The recession in Europe, particularly in Germany, is causing the Company to 
further downsize operations. This will result in charges of $1.6 million or 
$.03 per share in this quarter.

North American Industrial consolidations have caused certain buildings and 
equipment to be idled and become impaired, causing a $1.4 million or $.03 per 
share write-down to current market value. Further Industrial North America 
downsizing and relocation charges total $3.2 million or $.06 per share.

A charge of $2.5 million or $.05 per share has also been recorded for various
investment impairment and litigation matters.

The effect on cash of these restructuring actions is estimated to be 
$3.8 million in the fourth quarter and $8.7 million during fiscal 1995; 
however, it will be more than offset by the proceeds of the divestiture and 
facility sales. Anticipated savings from these actions are expected to be
approximately $.10 per share in fiscal 1995 and $.15 per share in fiscal 1996.

As a result of these significant charges, Parker will be recording a net loss 
for the third quarter. However, with the strong operating profits in the 
third quarter, which are anticipated to continue through the fourth quarter, 
Parker expects to report positive net income for the nine months ended 
March 31, 1994, and the fiscal year ending June 30, 1994."

Current Report
by Parker-Hannifin Corporation

Cleveland, Ohio, April 14, 1994 -- Parker Hannifin Corporation (PH-NYSE) 
announced today that it will record a charge of $52.7 million or $1.08 per 
share in the third quarter, ended March 31, 1994, to reduce the book value of 
certain long-term assets and to recognize downsizing and relocation activities.

President and Chief Executive Officer Duane E. Collins said, "At the beginning 
of this fiscal year the Parker management team embarked upon an extensive 
review of strategic goals and challenges. Two challenges became immediately 
clear: the need to adjust the business to the structural changes that have 
occurred in the aerospace industry, and to deal with the impact of the 
continuing economic problems in Europe and South America.

"Management has measured the effect of these changes on certain Parker units 
and has concluded that there has been an impairment of the value of certain 
long-lived assets, requiring the following specific accounting adjustments.

"Charges affecting the Aerospace segment total $38.8 million or $.80 per

goodwill and permanently impaired assets of the continuing operations of the 
aerospace heat-transfer components product line. The goodwill was incurred 
with the purchase of this line in 1987, during a period of heavy defense 
spending, and has been determined to be without value in the current 
environment. These charges will have no cash impact.

"In addition, Aerospace management continues to downsize and relocate 
facilities in response to the changed business climate. This has resulted 
in charges totaling $10.2 million or $.21 per share to write assets down to 
recoverable values and provide for the reduction of employees and relocation 
of facilities. Further, the Company divested its Metal Bellows operation, 
resulting in a loss of $.8 million or $.02 per share. The completion of 
this restructuring will position Parker to maintain its leadership role in 
its core flight control and fuel systems businesses.

"Charges affecting the Industrial segment total $11.4 million or $.23 per 
share. A charge of $5.2 million or $.11 per share was taken to recognize 
permanently impaired assets for continuing industrial product lines in 
Germany and Brazil and a small joint venture in Asia. This charge has no 
cash impact. Other charges for Industrial downsizing and asset impairment 
total $6.2 million or $.12 per share.

"A charge of $2.5 million or $.05 per share has also been recorded for 
various investment impairment and litigation matters.

components and systems for a wide range of industrial and aerospace markets.
