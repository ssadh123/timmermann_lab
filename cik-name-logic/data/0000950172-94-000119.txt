ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On June 27, 1994, North Fork Bancorporation,
Inc. ("North Fork") and Metro Bancshares Inc. ("Metro")
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger
Agreement") providing, among other things, for the merger
(the "Merger") of Metro with and into North Fork, with
North Fork surviving the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation"). Immediately after the Merger, Bayside
Federal Savings Bank ("Bayside Federal"), Metro's
federally chartered savings bank subsidiary, will merge
(the "Subsidiary Merger") with and into North Fork Bank
("New York Bank"), North Fork's New York chartered bank
subsidiary.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of
the common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Metro
Common Stock"), of Metro outstanding on the date of the
Merger (except for shares of Metro Common Stock held by
Metro as treasury stock or shares held by North Fork or
any of its subsidiaries, but including shares of Metro
Common Stock (i) held directly or indirectly by North
Fork or Metro or any of their respective subsidiaries in
trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or
otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity that are
beneficially owned by third parties ("Trust Account
Shares") and (ii) held by North Fork or Metro or any of
their respective subsidiaries in respect of a debt
previously contracted ("DPC Shares")) will be converted
into a number of shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the
common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of North Fork
("North Fork Common Stock"), determined by dividing
$25.50 by the "Average Closing Price," provided, however,
that (I) if the Average Closing Price is equal to or
greater than $15.50, the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.645
and (II) except as described in the next sentence, if the
Average Closing Price is equal to or less than $14.50,
the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.759. If the Average
Closing Price is less than $12.50, Metro may terminate
the Merger Agreement unless North Fork increases the
Exchange Ratio such that the shares of North Fork Common
Stock issued in exchange for each share of Metro Common
Stock have a nominal value (valued at the Average Closing
Price) of $21.99. The Average Closing Price is defined
as the average closing sales price of the North Fork
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the 20
consecutive trading days ending on the 5th business day
prior to the date on which the last required regulatory
approval for the Merger, the Subsidiary Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
is obtained, without regard to any requisite waiting
periods in respect thereof. 

The shares of North Fork Common Stock Common
Stock issued in the Merger will include the corresponding
number of rights attached to such shares pursuant to
North Fork's shareholder rights plan. No fractional
shares of North Fork Common Stock will be issued in the
Merger, and Metro stockholders who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share of North Fork
Common Stock will receive a cash payment in lieu thereof.

Consummation of the Merger is subject to
certain conditions, including, but not limited to,
approval of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of
each of Metro and North Fork and the receipt of all
required regulatory approvals. In addition, Metro may
terminate the Merger Agreement during the first 30 days
following its execution if Metro reasonably determines in
good faith that the business or financial condition of
North Fork and its subsidiaries taken as a whole has
materially and adversely changed from that described in
North Fork's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended on December 31, 1993. 

As a condition to the execution and delivery of
the Merger Agreement, North Fork and Metro entered into a
stock option agreement, dated as of June 27, 1994 (the
"Stock Option Agreement"), pursuant to which Metro
granted North Fork an option to purchase up to 557,795
shares of Metro Common Stock at a purchase price of
$21.00 per share, subject to adjustment. The option is
exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events
described therein, none of which has occurred. In
addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the
occurrence of any such event, Metro will pay North Fork a
termination fee of $2,000,000. 

The Merger Agreement and the Stock Option
Agreement are attached hereto as exhibits and
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The
foregoing summaries of the Merger Agreement and the Stock
Option Agreement do not purport to be complete and are
qualified in their entirety by reference to such
exhibits.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June
27, 1994, by and among North Fork Bancorporation, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Buyer") and Metro Bancshares Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). (Buyer and the
Company are herein sometimes collectively referred to
herein as the "Constituent Corporations".)

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Buyer and
the Company have determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the business combination
transaction provided for herein in which the Company
will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, merge (the "Merger") with and into Buyer; and

WHEREAS, as soon as practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, North Fork
Bank, a New York chartered stock commercial bank and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer ("New York Bank", and
sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Bank"),
and Bayside Federal Savings Bank, a federally chartered
stock savings bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company (the "Company Bank"), will enter into a
Subsidiary Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Bank Merger
Agreement") providing for the merger (the "Subsidiary
Merger") of the Company Bank with and into New York Bank,
and it is intended that the Subsidiary Merger be
consummated immediately following the consummation of the
Merger; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain
representations, warranties and agreements in connection
with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions
to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties and agreements
contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1. The Merger. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), the
Company shall merge with and into Buyer. Buyer shall be
the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes called
the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the
State of Delaware. The name of the Surviving Corporation
shall continue to be North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. 
Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall terminate. 

1.2. Effective Time. The Merger shall become 
effective as set forth in the certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") which shall be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Secretary") on the Closing Date (as defined in Section
9.1 hereof). The term "Effective Time" shall be the date
and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth
in the Certificate of Merger.

1.3. Effects of the Merger. At and after the
Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Sections 259 and 261 of the DGCL.

1.4. Conversion of Company Common Stock.

(a) At the Effective Time, subject to
Section 2.2(e) hereof, each share of the common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company
Common Stock held (x) in the Company's treasury or (y)
directly or indirectly by Buyer or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below) (except
for Trust Account Shares and DPC shares, as such terms
are defined in Section 1.4(b) hereof)) shall, by virtue
of this Agreement and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable
for the number of shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the
common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of Buyer ("Buyer
Common Stock") (together with the number of Buyer Rights
(as defined in Section 4.2 hereof) associated therewith),
determined by dividing $25.50 by the Average Closing
Price (as defined below); provided, however, that (I) if
the Average Closing Price is equal to or greater than
$15.50, the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.645 (the "Minimum
Exchange Ratio") and (II) subject to the provisions of
Section 8.1(g) hereof, if the Average Closing Price is
equal to or less than $14.50, the Exchange Ratio shall be
1.759 (the "Maximum Exchange Ratio"). As used herein,
the term "Average Closing Price" means the average
closing sales price per share of Buyer Common Stock on
the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") (as reported by The
Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another
authoritative source), for the 20 consecutive NYSE
trading days (the "Valuation Period") ending on the fifth
business day prior to the date on which the last of all
regulatory approvals required to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger
and the Subsidiary Merger) are obtained, without regard
to any requisite waiting periods in respect thereof. All
of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into
Buyer Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
(each a "Certificate") previously representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter only
represent the right to receive (i) the number of whole
shares of Buyer Common Stock and (ii) the cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted
pursuant to this Section 1.4(a) and Section 2.2(e)
hereof. Certificates previously representing shares of
Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates
representing whole shares of Buyer Common Stock and cash
in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in
accordance with Section 2.2 hereof, without any interest
thereon. If prior to the Effective Time Buyer should
split or combine its common stock, or pay a dividend or
other distribution in such common stock, then the
Exchange Ratio, Minimum Exchange Ratio and Maximum
Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such split, combination, dividend or distribution.

(b) At the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock and all shares of Company Common Stock
that are owned directly or indirectly by Buyer or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other
than shares of Company Common Stock (x) held directly or
indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the
like or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity that are
beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, and
shares of Buyer Common Stock which are similarly held,
whether held directly or indirectly by Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be, being referred to herein as
"Trust Account Shares") and (y) shares of Company Common
Stock held by Buyer or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously
contracted (any such shares of Company Common Stock, and
shares of Buyer Common Stock which are similarly held,
whether held directly or indirectly by Buyer or the
Company being referred to herein as "DPC Shares")) shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of
Buyer or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. All shares of Buyer Common Stock that
are owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall
become treasury stock of Buyer.

1.5. Stock Options. (a) At the Effective
Time, each option granted by the Company (a "Company
Option") to purchase shares of Company Common Stock which
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto
shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 1.5(b)
hereof, be converted automatically into an option to
purchase shares of Buyer Common Stock in an amount and at
an exercise price determined as provided below (and
otherwise subject to the terms (including those terms, if
any, providing for accelerated vesting) of the Company's
1988 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "1988 Incentive
Plan"), the Company's 1988 Stock Option Plan for Outside
Directors (the "1988 Option Plan"), the Company's 1993
Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "Incentive Plan") and
the Company's 1993 Stock Option Plan for Outside
Directors (the "Option Plan" and together with the 1988
Incentive Plan, the 1988 Option Plan and the Incentive
Plan, the "Company Plans"):

(1) The number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock to be subject to the new option
shall be equal to the product of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
original option and the Exchange Ratio,
provided that any fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock resulting from such multiplication
shall be rounded down to the nearest share; and

(2) The exercise price per share of
Buyer Common Stock under the new option shall
be equal to the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock under the original option
divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that
such exercise price shall be rounded up to the
nearest cent.

The adjustment provided herein with respect to any
options which are "incentive stock options" (as defined
in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code")) shall be and is intended to be
effected in a manner which is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code. The duration and other terms of the
new option shall be the same as the original option,
except that all references to the Company shall be deemed
to be references to Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, all Limited Rights (as
such term is defined in the 1988 Incentive Plan or the
Incentive Plan, as the case may be) granted under the
1988 Incentive Plan or the Incentive Plan shall terminate
and be of no further force or effect upon receipt of
consent to such termination from the grantees of such
Limited Rights. The Company will use its best efforts to
obtain such consents from all holders of Limited Rights.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, and
provided that the right contained in this paragraph (b)
is not inconsistent with any of the conditions contained
in Article VII hereof, each holder of a Company Option
shall have the right (which right shall be exercised at
least 5 days prior to the Closing Date by written notice
to Buyer) to elect, in lieu of the provisions of Section
1.5(a), to convert, at the Effective Time, all or a
portion of his or her Company Options which have not
expired prior to the Effective Time into the right to
receive such number of shares (rounded to the nearest
whole share) of Buyer Common Stock as are equal in value
(determined by valuing each share of Buyer Common Stock
at the Average Closing Price (as defined in Section 1.4))
to the excess of (i) the product of the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such option, the
Exchange Ratio and the Average Closing Price of the Buyer
Common Stock over (ii) the aggregate exercise price of
such option.

1.6. Buyer Common Stock. Except for shares of
Buyer Common Stock owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC
Shares), which shall be converted into treasury stock of
Buyer as contemplated by Section 1.4 hereof, the shares
of Buyer Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected by the
Merger and at the Effective Time, such shares shall
remain issued and outstanding.

1.7. Certificate of Incorporation. At the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of
Buyer, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.8. By-Laws. At the Effective Time, the By-
Laws of Buyer, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable law.

1.9. Directors and Officers. Except as
provided in Section 6.14 hereof, the directors and
officers of Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified.

1.10. Tax Consequences. It is intended that
the Merger and the Subsidiary Merger each constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a
"plan of reorganization" for the purposes of Section 368
of the Code. 

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1. Buyer to Make Shares Available. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company
(which may be a Subsidiary of Buyer) (the "Exchange
Agent"), selected by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this
Article II, certificates representing the shares of Buyer
Common Stock and the cash in lieu of fractional shares
(such cash and certificates for shares of Buyer Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and
paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

2.2. Exchange of Shares. (a) As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event
more than three business days thereafter, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates a form letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing the shares of Buyer Common
Stock and the cash in lieu of fractional shares into
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificate or Certificates shall have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement. The Company shall
have the right to review both the letter of transmittal
and the instructions prior to the Effective Time and
provide reasonable comments thereon. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Buyer Common Stock to which such holder of Company Common
Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the
provisions of Article I hereof and (y) a check
representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional
shares, if any, which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. 
No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu
of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, payable to holders of
Certificates. 

(b) No dividends or other distributions
declared after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer
Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After
the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled
to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of Buyer Common
Stock represented by such Certificate. No holder of an
unsurrendered Certificate shall be entitled, until the
surrender of such Certificate, to vote the shares of
Buyer Common Stock into which his Company Common Stock
shall have been converted.

(c) If any certificate representing
shares of Buyer Common Stock is to be issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting
such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate representing shares of Buyer
Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
representing such shares are presented for transfer to
the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for certificates representing shares of Buyer Common
Stock as provided in this Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to
Buyer Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to
any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
other rights of a shareholder of Buyer. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional share, Buyer shall pay to
each former stockholder of the Company who otherwise
would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Buyer
Common Stock an amount in cash determined by multiplying
(i) the average of the closing sale prices of Buyer
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as reported
by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days
immediately preceding the date on which the Effective
Time shall occur by (ii) the fraction of a share of Buyer
Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for
six months after the Effective Time shall be paid to
Buyer. Any stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Buyer for payment of their shares
of Buyer Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares
and unpaid dividends and distributions on the Buyer
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Buyer, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Buyer, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as Buyer may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the shares of Buyer Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company hereby represents and warrants to

Buyer as follows:

3.1. Corporate Organization. (a) The Company
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. 
The Company has the corporate power and authority to own
or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
so licensed or qualified would not have a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below) on the Company. The
Company is duly registered as a unitary savings and loan
holding company under the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933,
as amended. The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws
of the Company, copies of which have previously been
delivered to Buyer, are true, complete and correct copies
of such documents as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material
Adverse Effect" means, with respect to Buyer, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a
material adverse effect on the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, other than any such effect attributable to or
resulting from general political or economic conditions
or a change in law, rule, regulation, GAAP (as defined
below) or regulatory accounting principles, which in each
case affects banking institutions or their holding
companies generally, except to the extent any such
condition or change affects the referenced party to a
materially greater extent than banking institutions or
their holding companies generally. As used in this
Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" when used with respect
to any party means any corporation, partnership or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated,
which is consolidated with such party for financial
reporting purposes. 

(b) The Company Bank is a savings bank
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the United States of America. The
deposit accounts of the Company Bank are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC")
through the Savings Association Insurance Fund to the
fullest extent permitted by law, and all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith
have been paid when due by the Company Bank. Each of the
Company's other Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization. Each of the Company's Subsidiaries has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or the
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by
it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 
The articles of incorporation, by-laws and similar
governing documents of each Subsidiary of the Company,
copies of which have previously been delivered to Buyer,
are true, complete and correct copies of such documents
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

(c) The minute books of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries contain true, complete and
accurate records in all material respects of all meetings
and other corporate actions held or taken since December
31, 1991 of their respective stockholders and Boards of
Directors (including committees of their respective
Boards of Directors).

3.2. Capitalization. (a) The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 8,900,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Company Preferred
Stock"). As of the date of this Agreement, there are (x)
5,076,504 shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding and 236,474 shares of Company Common Stock
held in the Company's treasury, (y) no shares of Company
Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of
outstanding stock options or otherwise except for (i)
511,909 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for

required to be contributed to as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Buyer Plans") by Buyer, any of its
Subsidiaries or by any trade or business, whether or not
incorporated (a "Buyer ERISA Affiliate"), all of which

favorable determination letter, and Buyer is not aware of
any circumstances likely to result in the revocation or
denial of any such favorable determination letter, (iii)

IV of ERISA, the present value of accrued benefits under
such Buyer Plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions
used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial
report prepared by such Buyer Plan's actuary with respect
to such Buyer Plan, did not, as of its latest valuation
date, exceed the then current value of the assets of such
Buyer Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, (iv) no
Plan provides benefits, including without limitation

beneficiary), (v) no liability under Title IV of ERISA
has been incurred by Buyer, its Subsidiaries or any Buyer
ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, (vi)

ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976
of the Code, (ix) there are no pending, or, to the best
knowledge of Buyer, threatened or anticipated claims
(other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of
or against any of the Buyer Plans or any trusts related
thereto and (x) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (y) entitle any
current or former employee or officer of Buyer or any
ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, termination pay or any
other payment, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement or (z) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or increase in the amount of compensation due any
such employee or officer.

4.15. Agreements with Regulatory Agencies. 
Except as set forth in Section 4.15 of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule or as disclosed in Buyer's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993,
neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
any cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or is a
party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any
commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is
subject to any order or directive by, or is a recipient
of any extraordinary supervisory letter from, or has
adopted any board resolutions at the request of (each,
whether or not set forth in Section 4.15 of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, a "Buyer Regulatory Agreement"), any
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
restricts the conduct of its business or that in any
manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit
policies, its management or its business, nor has Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries been advised by any Regulatory
Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is
considering issuing or requesting any Regulatory
Agreement.

reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance
sheet of Buyer included in its Form 10-Q for the period
ended March 31, 1994 and (c) for liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since March 31, 1994 that, either alone or when
combined with all similar liabilities, have not had, and
could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect on Buyer, neither Buyer nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due).

4.17. Administration of Fiduciary Accounts. 
Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries has properly
administered in all material respects all accounts for
which it acts as a fiduciary, including but not limited
to accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent,
custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator
or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of
the governing documents and applicable state and federal
law and regulation and common law. Neither Buyer nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
directors, officers or employees has committed any breach
of trust with respect to any such fiduciary account which
has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Buyer, and the accountings for
each such fiduciary account are true and correct in all
material respects and accurately reflect the assets of
such fiduciary account.

4.18. Approvals. As of the date of this
Agreement, Buyer knows of no reason why all regulatory
approvals required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without
limitation, the Merger and the Subsidiary Merger) should
not be obtained without the imposition of a Burdensome
Condition.

4.19. Reports. Buyer and each of its
Subsidiaries have timely filed all material reports,
registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that
they were required to file since December 31, 1991 with
any Regulatory Agency, and all other material reports and
statements required to be filed by them since December
31, 1991, including, without limitation, any report or
statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws,
rules or regulations of the United States, the Federal
Reserve Board, the FDIC, any State Regulator or any SRO,
and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith. Except for normal examinations
conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the regular course of
the business of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, except as set
forth in Section 4.19 of Buyer Disclosure Schedule, no
Regulatory Agency has initiated any proceeding or, to the
best knowledge of Buyer, investigation into the business
or operations of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries since

with Environmental Laws, except for violations which,
either individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
cannot reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Buyer;

(b) There is no suit, claim, action or
proceeding, pending or threatened, before any
Governmental Entity or other forum in which Buyer, any of
its Subsidiaries, any Participation Facility or any Loan
Property, has been or, with respect to threatened
proceedings, may be, named as a defendant (x) for alleged
noncompliance (including by any predecessor), with any
Environmental Laws, or (y) relating to the release,
threatened release or exposure to any material whether or
not occurring at or on a site owned, leased or operated
by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, any Participation
Facility or any Loan Property, except where such
noncompliance or release has not resulted, and cannot be
reasonably expected to result, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer;

(c) During the period of (x) Buyer's or
any of its Subsidiaries' ownership or operation of any of
their respective current properties, (y) Buyer's or any
of its Subsidiaries' participation in the management of
any Participation Facility, or (z) Buyer's or any of its
Subsidiaries' holding of a security interest in a Loan
Property, there has been no release of materials in, on,
under or affecting any such property, except where such
release has not had and cannot reasonably be expected to
result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Buyer. Prior to the period of
(x) Buyer's or any of its Subsidiaries' ownership or
operation of any of their respective current properties,
(y) Buyer's or any of its Subsidiaries' participation in
the management of any Participation Facility, or (z)

affecting any such property, Participation Facility or
Loan Property, except where such release has not had and
cannot be reasonably expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Buyer; and

(d) The following definitions apply for
purposes of this Section 4.20: (x) "Loan Property" means
any property in which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
holds a security interest, and, where required by the
context, said term means the owner or operator of such
property; and (y) "Participation Facility" means any
facility in which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries

forwards, futures, options on futures, swaps or other
derivative instruments except (i) as agent on the order

purposes of hedging interest rate risk on U.S. dollar-
denominated securities and other financial instruments. 
None of the counterparties to any contract or agreement
with respect to any such instrument is in default with
respect to such contract or agreement and no such

or any of its Subsidiaries, would be classified as "Other
Loans Specially Mentioned", "Special Mention",
"Substandard", "Doubtful", "Loss", "Classified",
"Criticized", "Credit Risk Assets", "Concerned Loans" or
words of similar import. The financial position of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis under or
with respect to each such instrument has been reflected
in the books and records of Buyer and such Subsidiaries
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and no open
exposure of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any such instrument (or with respect to multiple
instruments with respect to any single counterparty)
exceeds $500,000.

4.22. Loan Portfolio. Except as set forth in
Section 4.22 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, neither
Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
written or oral (i) Loan, other than Loans the unpaid
principal balance of which does not exceed $50,000, under

with any director, executive officer or ten percent
stockholder of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or to

in original principal amount in excess of $50,000 of
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries that as of the date of
this Agreement are classified by any bank examiner
(whether regulatory or internal) as "Other Loans
Specially Mentioned", "Special Mention", "Substandard",
"Doubtful", "Loss", "Classified", "Criticized", "Credit
Risk Assets", "Concerned Loans", "Watch List" or words of
similar import, together with the principal amount of and
accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the

other Loans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries that as of the
date of this Agreement are classified as such, together
with the aggregate principal amount of and accrued and

all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including without limitation the Merger and
the Subsidiary Merger) (it being understood that any
amendments to the S-4 or a resolicitation of proxies as
consequence of a subsequent proposed merger, stock
purchase or similar acquisition by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries shall not violate this covenant). The
Company and Buyer shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult
the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to the Company or Buyer, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which
appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly

in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated May 5, 1993, between Buyer and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

(b) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford
to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of the Company, access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to such information regarding Buyer and
its Subsidiaries as shall be reasonably necessary for the
Company to fulfill its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement to prepare the Proxy Statement or which may be
reasonably necessary for the Company to confirm that the
representations and warranties of Buyer contained herein
are true and correct and that the covenants of Buyer
contained herein have been performed in all material
respects. Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate
or prejudice the rights of Buyer's customers, jeopardize
any attorney-client privilege or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

(c) All information furnished by Buyer to
the Company or its representatives pursuant hereto shall
be treated as the sole property of Buyer and, if the
Merger shall not occur, the Company and its
representatives shall return to Buyer all of such written
information and all documents, notes, summaries or other
materials containing, reflecting or referring to, or
derived from, such information. The Company shall, and
shall use its best efforts to cause its representatives
to, keep confidential all such information, and shall not
directly or indirectly use such information for any
competitive or other commercial purpose. The obligation
to keep such information confidential shall continue for
five years from the date the proposed Merger is abandoned
and shall not apply to (i) any information which (x) was
already in the Company's possession prior to the
disclosure thereof by Buyer; (y) was then generally known
to the public; or (z) was disclosed to the Company by a
third party not bound by an obligation of confidentiality
or (ii) disclosures made as required by law. It is
further agreed that, if in the absence of a protective
order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder the Company is
nonetheless, in the opinion of its counsel, compelled to
disclose information concerning Buyer to any tribunal or
governmental body or agency or else stand liable for
contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the Company
may disclose such information to such tribunal or
governmental body or agency without liability hereunder.

(d) No investigation by either of the
parties or their respective representatives shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
of the other set forth herein.

6.3. Stockholder Meetings. The Company and
Buyer each shall take all steps necessary to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
respective stockholders to be held as soon as is
reasonably practicable after the date on which the S-4
becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and Buyer
each will, through its respective Board of Directors,
except to the extent legally required for the discharge
of the fiduciary duties of such board, recommend to its
respective stockholders approval of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and such other
matters as may be submitted to its stockholders in
connection with this Agreement. The Company and Buyer
shall coordinate and cooperate with respect to the
foregoing matters, with a view towards, among other
things, holding the respective meetings of each party's
stockholders on the same day.

6.4. Legal Conditions to Merger. Each of
Buyer and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their best efforts (a) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries
with respect to the Merger or the Subsidiary Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII
hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with
the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party which is
required to be obtained by the Company or Buyer or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger and the Subsidiary Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to
comply with the terms and conditions of such consent,
authorization, order or approval; provided, however, that
neither Buyer nor the Company shall be obligated to take
any action pursuant to the foregoing if the taking of
such action or such compliance or the obtaining of such
consent, authorization, order or approval is likely, in
the good faith reasonable opinion of Buyer or the
Company, to result in the imposition of a Burdensome
Condition.

6.5. Affiliates. Each of Buyer and the
Company shall use its best efforts to cause each
director, executive officer and other person who is an
"affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act and for purposes of qualifying the Merger
for "pooling-of-interests" accounting treatment) of such
party to deliver to the other party hereto, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any
event prior to the earlier of the date of the
stockholders meeting called by the Company to approve
this Agreement and the date of the stockholders meeting
called by Buyer to approve this Agreement, a written
agreement, in the form of Exhibit 6.5(a) hereto (in the
case of affiliates of Buyer) or 6.5(b) hereto (in the
case of affiliates of the Company), providing that such
person will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any shares of Buyer Common Stock or Company
Common Stock held by such "affiliate" and, in the case of
the "affiliates" of the Company, the shares of Buyer
Common Stock to be received by such "affiliate" in the
Merger: (1) in the case of shares of Buyer Common Stock
to be received by "affiliates" of the Company in the
Merger, except in compliance with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder; and (2) during the period
commencing 30 days prior to the Merger and ending at the
time of the publication of financial results covering at
least 30 days of combined operations of Buyer and the
Company.

6.6. Stock Exchange Listing. Buyer shall
cause the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger to be approved for listing on the New York
Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE"), subject to official
notice of issuance, as of the Effective Time.

6.7. Employee Benefit Plans; Existing
Agreements. (a) The employees of the Company (the
"Company Employees") shall be entitled to participate in
Buyer's employee benefit plans in which similarly
situated employees of Buyer participate, to the same
extent as comparable employees of Buyer. As of the
Effective Time, Buyer shall permit the Company Employees
to participate in Buyer's group hospitalization, medical,
life and disability insurance plans on the same terms and
conditions as applicable to comparable employees of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries. As of the next entry date
immediately following the Effective Time, Buyer shall
permit the Company Employees to participate in Buyer's
defined benefit pension plan, thrift plan, severance, and
similar plans on the same terms and conditions as
employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, giving effect
(solely for purposes of Buyer's defined benefit pension
plan and thrift plan) to years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (to the extent the Company
gave effect) as if such service were with Buyer, for
purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not for benefit
accrual purposes.

(b) Following the Effective Time, Buyer shall
honor and shall cause the Surviving Bank to honor in
accordance with their terms all employment, severance and
other compensation agreements and arrangements,
including, but not limited to, severance benefit plans
listed in Section 6.7(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, existing prior to the execution of this
Agreement which are between the Company and any director,
officer or employee thereof and which have been disclosed
in the Company Disclosure Schedule and previously have
been delivered to Buyer and agrees to make the payments
and provide the benefits pursuant thereto described in
Section 6.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(c) As of the Effective Time, Buyer will
assume, or will cause New York Bank to assume, the tax
qualified plans of the Company Bank as listed in Section
3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Neither
Buyer nor New York Bank shall be required to make further
contributions to such plans. As of the Effective Time,
all accrued benefits under the plans shall be fully
vested and nonforfeitable. As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, Buyer shall terminate or shall cause
New York Bank to terminate the tax qualified plans of the
Company Bank assumed by Buyer, or New York Bank, pursuant
to this Section 6.7(c), and distribution of the accounts
of active participants immediately prior to the Effective
Time under the plans shall be made to the participants
and beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of such
plans.

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, in anticipation of such
termination and distribution, the Company and the Company
Bank shall use their best efforts, and after the
Effective Time, Buyer and New York Bank shall use their
best efforts to take all necessary and appropriate action
to cause unallocated Company Common Stock pledged as
collateral for the loan made to the Company Bank Employee
Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") to be applied to repay the
outstanding securities acquisition loan, to allocate the
amount of such stock with a value in excess of the
balance of such loan to the accounts of the ESOP
participants in proportion to their account balances at
the Effective Time and to maintain the status of the ESOP
as a plan qualified under Sections 401(a) and 4975 of the
of the Code. In the event that prior to the Effective
Time, the Company or the Company Bank, or after the
Effective Time, Buyer or New York Bank, determines that
the loan may not be so repaid or that such amounts may
not be so allocated without causing the ESOP to fail to
be a tax qualified plan under Sections 401(a) and 4975 of
the Code, the Company or the Company Bank before the
Effective Time, and Buyer or New York Bank after the
Effective Time, shall take such action as each may
determine with respect to the ESOP, provided that the
assets of the ESOP shall be held or paid for the
exclusive benefit of the ESOP participants and
beneficiaries, and provided further, in no event shall
any portion of the amounts held in trust by the ESOP
revert directly or indirectly to the Company, the Company
Bank, Buyer or New York Bank or any affiliate thereof.

(e) Following the Effective Time, Buyer shall
honor and shall cause any successor corporation and its
affiliates to honor in accordance with its terms, the
Company Bank post retirement medical plan as listed in
Section 6.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule with
respect to benefits being paid thereunder at the
Effective Time, and benefits thereunder to those who
would be eligible for such benefits at retirement as of
the Effective Time.

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in an
employment agreement or other compensation arrangement,
or in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer shall
provide benefits under the terms of the Company Bank post
retirement medical plan to those employees listed in
Section 6.7(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule who
terminate employment with the Company Bank after the
Effective Time, provided that such benefits shall be
continued for the lifetime of such employees' spouse in
the event that any such employee predeceases the spouse.

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall provide each
employee listed in Section 6.7(g) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule with the opportunity to continue
medical/dental coverage under the Buyer's group policy
upon payment by such employee of the cost of the premiums
for such individual under the group policy for the
remainder of the employee's life or the employee first
obtains comparable benefits from another employer,
whichever is earlier.

(h) Following the Effective Time, Buyer shall
provide continued medical/dental and life insurance
benefits for each employee listed in Section 6.7(h) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, for a one year period
following such individual's termination of employment
with the Company Bank as provided in the Special
Termination Agreements listed in Schedule 3.11(a). In
addition, Buyer shall provide each such individual with
the opportunity to continue medical/dental insurance
coverage upon payment by such employee of the cost of the
premium for such individual under the group coverage of
Buyer for a period of four years commencing on the first
anniversary of the date of such individual's termination
of employment, or, if sooner, the time the individual
obtains comparable benefits through another employer.

6.8. Indemnification. (a) In the event of
any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, including, without limitation, any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which
any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to
the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified
Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based
in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company, any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company or any of their respective
predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time,
the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best
efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is
understood and agreed that after the Effective Time,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
extent permitted by Delaware law, each such Indemnified
Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law
upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable
law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the
event of any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time), the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to them after consultation with Buyer;
provided, however, that (1) Buyer shall have the right to
assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption Buyer
shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Buyer
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties reasonably advises that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between Buyer
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after
consultation with Buyer, and Buyer shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties, (2) Buyer shall in all cases be
obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one
firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties, (3) Buyer
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) and (4) Buyer shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if
a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final
and nonappealable, that indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim Indemnification under this Section 6.8,
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall notify promptly Buyer thereof,
provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect
the obligations of Buyer under this Section 6.8 except to
the extent such failure to notify prejudices Buyer. 
Buyer's obligations under this Section 6.8 continue in
full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim (a "Claim")
asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such Claim. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section
6.8(a), in no event shall Buyer's obligations under this
Section 6.8(a) with respect to indemnification or the
advancement of expenses be greater than the obligations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect thereto
set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or similar
governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) Buyer shall cause the persons serving
as officers and directors of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of
four years from the Effective Time by the directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy maintained by the
Company (provided that Buyer may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are not less
advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which
were committed by such officers and directors in their
capacity as such; provided, however, that such policy
shall be increased to an amount of at least $3,000,000.

(c) In the event Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations
set forth in this section.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.8
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives.

6.9. Subsequent Interim and Annual Financial
Statements. As soon as reasonably available, but in no
event later than March 31, 1995 or, in the case of the
Company, December 31, 1994, Buyer will deliver to the
Company and the Company will deliver to Buyer their
respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for, in the case
of Buyer, the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994 and, in
the case of the Company, the fiscal year ended September
30, 1994, as filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act. 
As soon as reasonably available, but in no event more
than 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter ending
after the date of this Agreement, Buyer will deliver to
the Company and the Company will deliver to Buyer their
respective Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as filed with
the SEC under the Exchange Act.

6.10. Additional Agreements. In case at any
time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, or the Bank Merger Agreement, or to vest the
Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the
Merger or the Subsidiary Merger, the proper officers and
directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by Buyer.

6.11. Advice of Changes. Buyer and the
Company shall promptly advise the other party of any
change or event having a Material Adverse Effect on it or
which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to
cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained
herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time
(and on the date prior to the Closing Date), each party
will promptly supplement or amend the Disclosure
Schedules delivered in connection with the execution of
this Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in such
Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary to correct any
information in such Disclosure Schedules which has been
rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment
to such Disclosure Schedules shall have any effect for
the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.3(a) hereof, as the
case may be, or the compliance by the Company or Buyer,
as the case may be, with the respective covenants and
agreements of such parties contained herein.

6.12. Current Information. During the period
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
the Company will cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis
(not less than monthly) with representatives of Buyer and
to report (i) the general status of the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii)
the status of, and the action proposed to be taken with
respect to, those Loans held by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company which, individually or in
combination with one or more other Loans to the same
borrower thereunder, have an original principal amount of
$250,000 or more and are non-performing assets. The
Company will promptly notify Buyer of any material change
in the normal course of business or in the operation of
the properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and of any governmental complaints, investigations or
hearings (or communications indicating that the same may
be contemplated), or the institution or the threat of
significant litigation involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and will keep Buyer fully informed of
such events.

6.13. Execution and Authorization of Bank
Merger Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, (a) Buyer shall (i)
cause the Board of Directors of New York Bank to approve
the Bank Merger Agreement, (ii) cause New York Bank to
execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement, and (iii)
approve the Bank Merger Agreement as the sole stockholder
of New York Bank, and (b) the Company shall (i) cause the
Board of Directors of the Company Bank to approve the
Bank Merger Agreement, (ii) cause the Company Bank to
execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement, and (iii)
approve the Bank Merger Agreement as the sole stockholder
of the Company Bank. The Bank Merger Agreement shall
contain terms that are normal and customary in light of
the transactions contemplated hereby and such additional
terms as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. If Buyer, upon the advice of its counsel,
determines that there is a reasonable possibility that
the Subsidiary Merger is not legally permissible under
the laws of the State of New York or will not be approved
by the Banking Department as a result of Company's status
as a federal savings bank, Buyer shall notify the Company
accordingly and the Company shall, subject to the
requirements of applicable law, use its best efforts to
cause the Company Bank to be converted to a New York
chartered savings bank (the "Conversion") as soon as
practicable after the Company's receipt of such notice
from Buyer (but in no event prior to the day immediately
prior to the Effective Time), and, subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, both Buyer and the Company shall
use their best efforts to cause such New York chartered
savings bank to be merged with and into New York Bank
with New York Bank surviving such merger, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time.

6.14. Directorships. Buyer shall cause its
Board of Directors to be expanded by one member and shall
appoint one of the current directors of the Company 
selected by Buyer as a nominee to fill the vacancy on
Buyer's Board of Directors created by such increase as of
the Effective Time.

contemplated hereby (including the Merger, the Subsidiary
Merger and, if necessary to consummate the Subsidiary
Merger, the Conversion) shall have been obtained and
shall remain in full force and effect and all statutory
waiting periods in respect thereof shall have expired
(all such approvals and the expiration of all such
waiting periods being referred to herein as the

effective under the Securities Act and no stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the S-4 shall have been

of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Bank Merger Agreement shall be in effect. No
statute, rule, regulation, order, injunction or decree
shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced
by any Governmental Entity which prohibits, restricts or
makes illegal consummation of the Merger or the
Subsidiary Merger.

7.2. Conditions to Obligations of Buyer. The
obligation of Buyer to effect the Merger is also subject
to the satisfaction or waiver by Buyer at or prior to the
Effective Time of the following conditions:

(a) Representations and Warranties. (I) 
The representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of this Agreement and
(except to the extent such representations and warranties
speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as
though made on and as of the Closing Date; and (II) the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of this Agreement and
(except to the extent such representations and warranties
speak as of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as
though made on and as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that for purposes of determining the
satisfaction of the condition contained in this clause
(II), no effect shall be given to any exception in such
representations and warranties relating to materiality or
a Material Adverse Effect, and provided, further,
however, that, for purposes of this clause (II), such
representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true
and correct in all material respects unless the failure
or failures of such representations and warranties to be
so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate,
represent a material adverse change from the business,
assets, financial condition or results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole as
represented herein. Buyer shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company to the foregoing effect.

(b) Performance of Obligations of the
Company. The Company shall have performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be
performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the
Closing Date, and Buyer shall have received a certificate
signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to
such effect.

(c) No Burdensome Condition. None of the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals shall impose any term,
condition or restriction upon Buyer, the Company, the
Company Bank, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries that Buyer
or the Company, in good faith, reasonably determines
would so materially adversely affect the economic or
business benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to Buyer or the Company as to render
inadvisable in the reasonable good faith judgment of
Buyer or the Company, the consummation of the Merger (a
"Burdensome Condition").

(d) Consents Under Agreements. The
consent, approval or waiver of each person (other than
the Governmental Entities referred to in Section 7.1(c))
whose consent or approval shall be required in order to
permit the succession by the Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Bank pursuant to the Merger or the Subsidiary
Merger, as the case may be, to any obligation, right or
interest of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
under any loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license or other agreement or
instrument shall have been obtained, except where the
failure to obtain such consent, approval or waiver would
not so materially adversely affect the economic or
business benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to Buyer as to render inadvisable, in the
reasonable good faith judgment of Buyer, the consummation
of the Merger.

(e) No Pending Governmental Actions. No
proceeding initiated by any Governmental Entity seeking
an Injunction shall be pending.

(f) Federal Tax Opinion. Buyer shall
have received an opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
& Flom, counsel to Buyer ("Buyer's Counsel"), in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, substantially
to the effect that, on the basis of facts,
representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion
which are consistent with the state of facts existing at
the Effective Time, the Merger and Subsidiary Merger will
be treated as reorganizations within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and that, accordingly, for
federal income tax purposes no gain or loss will be
recognized by Buyer, the Company, New York Bank or the
Company Bank as a result of the Merger and Subsidiary
Merger except to the extent the Company Bank or New York
Bank may be required to recognize income due to the
recapture of bad debt reserves as a result of the
Subsidiary Merger. In rendering such opinion, Buyer's
Counsel may require and rely upon representations and
covenants contained in certificates of officers of Buyer,
the Company and others.

(g) Legal Opinion. Buyer shall have
received the opinion of Muldoon, Murphy & Faucette,
counsel to the Company (the "Company's Counsel"), dated
the Closing Date, substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit 7.2(g). As to any matter in such
opinion which involves matters of fact or matters
relating to laws other than Federal securities or
Delaware corporate law, such counsel may rely upon the
certificates of officers and directors of the Company and
of public officials and opinions of local counsel,
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, provided a copy of such
reliance opinion shall be attached as an exhibit to the
opinion of such counsel.

(h) Pooling of Interests. Buyer shall
have received a letter from KPMG Peat Marwick addressed
to Buyer, to the effect that the Merger will qualify for
"pooling of interests" accounting treatment, unless such
firm advises Buyer that it is unable to issue a letter to
such effect solely by reason of Buyer having exercised
its right to purchase Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Option Agreement.

(i) Accountant's Letter. The Company
shall have caused to be delivered to Buyer letters from
KPMG Peat Marwick, independent public accountants with
respect to the Company, dated the date on which the
Registration Statement or last amendment thereto shall
become effective, and dated the date of the Closing, and
addressed to Buyer, with respect to the Company's
consolidated financial position and results of
operations, which letters shall be based upon agreed upon
procedures to be specified by Buyer, which procedures
shall be consistent with applicable professional
standards for letters delivered by independent
accountants in connection with comparable transactions.

(j) Subsidiary Merger. Nothing shall
have come to the attention of Buyer which would preclude
consummation of the Subsidiary Merger immediately
following consummation of the Merger.

7.3. Conditions to Obligations of the Company. 
The obligation of the Company to effect the Merger is
also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Company
at or prior to the Effective Time of the following
conditions: 

(a) Representations and Warranties. (I) 
The representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in
this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except to
the extent such representations and warranties speak as
of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made
on and as of the Closing Date; and (II) the
representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except to
the extent such representations and warranties speak as
of an earlier date) as of the Closing Date as though made
on and as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the
condition contained in this clause (II), no effect shall
be given to any exception in such representations and
warranties relating to materiality or a Material Adverse
Effect, and provided, further, however, that, for
purposes of this clause (II), such representations and
warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct in all
material respects unless the failure or failures of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, represent a material
adverse change from the business, assets, financial
condition or results of operations of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole as represented herein. The
Company shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of Buyer by the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer of Buyer to the foregoing effect.

(b) Performance of Obligations of Buyer. 
Buyer shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under this
Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and the
Company shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of Buyer by the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer of Buyer to such effect.

(c) Consents Under Agreements. The
consent, approval or waiver of each person (other than
the Governmental Entities referred to in Section 7.1(c))
whose consent or approval shall be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby under any loan
or credit agreement, note, mortgage, indenture, lease,
license or other agreement or instrument to which Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is otherwise
bound, except those for which failure to obtain such
consents and approvals would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
business, operations or financial condition of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated hereby), shall have been
obtained.

(d) No Pending Governmental Actions. No
proceeding initiated by any Governmental Entity seeking
an Injunction shall be pending.

(e) Federal Tax Opinion. The Company
shall have received an opinion of the Company's Counsel,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, dated as of the Effective Time, substantially to
the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations
and assumptions set forth in such opinion which are
consistent with the state of facts existing at the
Effective Time, the Merger and the Subsidiary Merger will
be treated as reorganizations within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and that accordingly for
federal income tax purposes:

(i) No gain or loss will be
recognized by the Company as a result of the
Merger;

(ii) No gain or loss will be
recognized by the Company Bank as a result of
the Subsidiary Merger except to the extent the
Company Bank or New York Bank may be required
to recognize income due to the recapture of bad
debt reserves as a result of the Subsidiary
Merger.

(iii) No gain or loss will be
recognized by the shareholders of the Company
who exchange all of their Company Common Stock
solely for Buyer Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger (except with respect to cash received in
lieu of a fractional share interest in Buyer
Common Stock);

(iv) The aggregate tax basis of the
Buyer Common Stock received by shareholders who
exchange all of their Company Common Stock
solely for Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of
the Company Common Stock surrendered in
exchange therefor (reduced by any amount
allocable to a fractional share interest for
which cash is received).

In rendering such opinion, the Company's Counsel may
require and rely upon representations and covenants
contained in certificates of officers of Buyer, the
Company and others, including certain shareholders of the
Company.

(f) Legal Opinion. The Company shall
have received the opinion of Buyer's Counsel, dated the
Closing Date, substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit 7.3(f). As to any matter in such opinion
which involves matters of fact or matters relating to
laws other than Federal securities law or Delaware
corporate law, such counsel may rely upon the
certificates of officers and directors of Buyer and of
public officials and opinions of local counsel,
reasonably acceptable to the Company, provided a copy of
such reliance opinions shall be attached as an exhibit to
the opinion of such counsel.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1. Termination. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after approval of the matters presented
in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of both
the Company and Buyer:

(a) by mutual consent of the Company and
Buyer in a written instrument, if the Board of Directors
of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

(b) by either Buyer or the Company upon
written notice to the other party (i) 60 days after the
date on which any request or application for a Requisite
Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn
at the request or recommendation of the Governmental
Entity which must grant such Requisite Regulatory
Approval, unless within the 60-day period following such
denial or withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an
amended application has been filed with the applicable
Governmental Entity, provided, however, that no party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.1(b)(i) if such denial or request or
recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the failure
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such
party set forth herein or (ii) if any Governmental Entity
of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;

(c) by either Buyer or the Company if the
Merger shall not have been consummated on or before June
30, 1995, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by
such date shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein;

(d) by either Buyer or the Company
(provided that the terminating party shall not be in
material breach of any of its obligations under Section
6.3) if any approval of the stockholders of either of the
Company or Buyer required for the consummation of the
Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the
failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held
meeting of such stockholders or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof;

(e) by either Buyer or the Company
(provided that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have
been a material breach of any of the representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach is not cured within thirty days
following written notice to the party committing such
breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured
prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) unless the breach of
representation or warranty, together with all other such
breaches, would entitle the party receiving such
representation not to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby under Section 7.2(a) (in the case of
a breach of representation or warranty by the Company) or
Section 7.3(a) (in the case of a breach of representation
or warranty by Buyer);

(f) by either Buyer or the Company
(provided that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have
been a material breach of any of the covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach shall not have been cured
within thirty days following receipt by the breaching
party of written notice of such breach from the other
party hereto;

(g) by the Company, by action of its
Board of Directors, whether before or after approval of
the Merger by the Company's stockholders, by giving
written notice of such election to Buyer within two NYSE
trading days after the Valuation Period in the event the
Average Closing Price is less than $12.50 per share;
provided, however, that no right of termination shall
arise under this Section 8.1(g) if Buyer elects within 5
business days of receipt of such written notice to notify
the Company in writing that it has waived its right to
utilize the Maximum Exchange Ratio and has increased the
Exchange Ratio such that the value of the consideration
(valued at the Average Closing Price) to be paid in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock to be
converted into Buyer Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares upon consummation of the Merger is
$21.99 per share;

(h) by Buyer, if the Board of Directors
of the Company does not publicly recommend in the Proxy
Statement that the Company's stockholders approve and
adopt this Agreement or if, after recommending in the
Proxy Statement that stockholders approve and adopt this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have withdrawn, modified or amended such recommendation
in any respect materially adverse to Buyer;

(i) By the Company, if on or prior to the
close of business on the 30th day following the execution
of this Agreement, the Company reasonably determines in
good faith that the business or financial condition of
Buyer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole has
materially and adversely changed from that described in
Buyer's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended on December 31,1993; or

(j) by Buyer, after the thirtieth and
prior to the close of business on the sixtieth day
following the date of this Agreement, if within thirty
days after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
not have obtained all of the consents referred to in
Section 1.5 hereof.

8.2. Effect of Termination; Expenses. In
the event of termination of this Agreement by either
Buyer or the Company as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect
except (i) the last sentence of Section 6.2(a), and
Sections 6.2(c), 8.2 and 9.4, shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, (ii) that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities
or damages arising out of its willful breach of any
provision of this Agreement, and (iii) in the event this
Agreement (x) is terminated subsequent to the occurrence
of a Purchase Event (as such term is defined in the
Option Agreement) or (y) is terminated by Buyer pursuant
to Section 8.1(f) hereof, and within 12 months after such
termination by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(f) hereof a
Purchase Event shall occur, then in addition to any other
amounts payable or stock issuable by the Company pursuant
to this Agreement or the Option Agreement, as the case
may be, the Company shall pay to Buyer a termination fee
of $2,000,000. 

8.3. Amendment. Subject to compliance with
applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection
with the Merger by the stockholders of either the Company
or Buyer; provided, however, that after any approval of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
Company's stockholders, there may not be, without further
approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this
Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of
the consideration to be delivered to the Company
stockholders hereunder other than as contemplated by this
Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

8.4. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to
the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken
or authorized by their respective Board of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement
on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

ARTICLE IX

THE TRANSFER OF THIS AGREEMENT IS
SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS CONTAINED
HEREIN AND TO RESALE RESTRICTIONS UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT, dated as of June 27,
1994 (the "Agreement"), by and between Metro Bancshares
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Issuer"), and North Fork
Bancorporation, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Grantee").

WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer have entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"),
of even date herewith, providing for, among other things,
the merger of Issuer with and into Grantee; and 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to
Grantee's execution of the Merger Agreement, Grantee has
requested that Issuer agree, and Issuer has agreed, to
grant Grantee the Option (as defined below);

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing and the respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the
Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Issuer and Grantee agree as follows:

1. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms which
are used but not defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

2. Grant of Option. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, Issuer hereby grants to
Grantee an irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase
up to 557,795 shares (subject to adjustment as set forth
herein) (the "Option Shares") of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Issuer ("Issuer Common Stock") at a
purchase price (subject to adjustment as set forth
herein) of $21.00 per Option Share (the "Purchase
Price").

3. Exercise of Option. (a) Grantee may
exercise the Option, in whole or in part, at any time and
from time to time following the occurrence of a Purchase
Event (as defined below); provided, however, that the
Option, to the extent not previously exercised, shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the
earliest to occur of (i) the Effective Time, (ii) 12
months after the first occurrence of a Purchase Event (as
defined below), (iii) termination of the Merger Agreement
in accordance with the terms thereof prior to the
occurrence of a Purchase Event (other than a termination
of the Merger Agreement by Grantee pursuant to Section
8.1(f) thereof) or (iv) 12 months after the termination
of the Merger Agreement by Grantee pursuant to Section
8.1(f) thereof, provided, however, that if within 12
months after a termination of the Merger Agreement by
Grantee pursuant to Section 8.1(f) thereof a Purchase
Event shall occur, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, this Option shall terminate 12
months after the first occurrence of such Purchase Event;
and provided further, however, that any purchase of
shares upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to
compliance with applicable law, including, without
limitation, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (the "BHC Act"); and provided further, however,
that if the Option cannot be exercised on any day because
of any injunction, order or similar restraint issued by a
court of competent jurisdiction, the period during which
the Option may be exercised shall be extended so that the
Option shall expire no earlier than on the 10th business
day after such injunction, order or restraint shall have
been dissolved or when such injunction, order or
restraint shall have become permanent and no longer
subject to appeal, as the case may be.

(b) As used herein, a "Purchase Event"
means any of the following events:

(i) Issuer shall have
authorized, recommended, publicly proposed or
entered into an agreement with any person
(other than Grantee or any affiliate of Grantee
or any person acting in concert in any respect
with Grantee) to effect an Acquisition
Transaction (as defined below), shall have
failed to publicly oppose any such Acquisition
Transaction or shall have failed to publicly
oppose a Tender Offer or an Exchange Offer (as
defined below). As used herein, the term
Acquisition Transaction shall mean (A) a
merger, consolidation or similar transaction
involving Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than internal mergers, reorganizations,
consolidations or dissolutions involving only
existing Subsidiaries), (B) the disposition, by
sale, lease, exchange or otherwise, of assets
of Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
representing 20% or more of the consolidated
assets of Issuer and its Subsidiaries or (C)
the issuance, sale or other disposition of
(including by way of merger, consolidation,
share exchange or any similar transaction)
securities representing 20% or more of the
voting power of Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries;

(ii) any person (other than
Grantee or any affiliate of Grantee or any
person acting in concert in any respect with
Grantee) shall have acquired Beneficial
Ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-
3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) of,
or the right to acquire Beneficial Ownership
of, or any Group (as such term is defined under
the Exchange Act) shall have been formed which
shall have acquired Beneficial Ownership of, or
the right to acquire Beneficial Ownership of,
20% or more of the then outstanding shares of
Issuer Common Stock;

(iii) any person (other than
Grantee or any affiliate of Grantee or any
person acting in concert in any respect with
Grantee) shall have commenced (as such term is
defined in Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act)
or shall have filed a registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act") with respect to, a
tender offer or exchange offer to purchase any
shares of Issuer Common Stock such that, upon
consummation of such offer, such person would
own or control 20% or more of the then
outstanding shares of Issuer Common Stock (such
an offer being referred to herein as a "Tender
Offer" or an "Exchange Offer," respectively);

(iv) the holders of Issuer
Common Stock shall not have approved the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, at the meeting of such stockholders
held for the purpose of voting on such
agreement, or such meeting shall not have been
held or shall have been cancelled prior to
termination of the Merger Agreement, in each
case after it shall have been publicly
announced that any person (other than Grantee
or any affiliate of Grantee or any person
acting in concert in any respect with Grantee)
shall have made, or disclosed an intention to
make, a proposal to engage in an Acquisition
Transaction; or

(v) Issuer's Board of Directors
shall not have recommended to the stockholders
of Issuer that such stockholders vote in favor
of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby or shall have
withdrawn or modified such recommendation in a
manner adverse to Grantee.

As used in this Agreement, "person" shall have the
meaning specified in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act.

(c) In the event Grantee wishes to
exercise the Option, it shall send to Issuer a written
notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the
"Notice Date") specifying (i) the total number of Option
Shares it intends to purchase pursuant to such exercise
and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three business
days nor later than 30 business days from the Notice Date
for the closing (the "Closing") of such purchase (the
"Closing Date"). If prior notification to or approval of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"Federal Reserve Board") or any other regulatory
authority is required in connection with such purchase,
Issuer shall cooperate in good faith with Grantee in the
filing of the required notice or application for approval
and the obtaining of any such approval and the period of
time that otherwise would run pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall run instead from the date on which, as the
case may be (i) any required notification period has
expired or been terminated or (ii) such approval has been
obtained, and in either event, any requisite waiting
period shall have passed.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Grantee shall not exercise
this Agreement if it is in material breach of the Merger
Agreement.

4. Payment and Delivery of Certificates. (a) 
On each Closing Date, Grantee shall (i) pay to Issuer, in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank
account designated by Issuer, an amount equal to the
Purchase Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares
to be purchased on such Closing Date and (ii) present and
surrender this Agreement to the Issuer at the address of
the Issuer specified in Section 12(f) hereof. In
addition to any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 4(a), upon the first exercise of the Option,
Grantee shall pay an amount, if any, by which (i)
$2,000,000 plus the product of (A) the total number of
Option Shares and (B) the difference between the
Market/Tender Offer Price (as defined below) and the
Purchase Price exceeds (ii) $4,500,000 provided, however,
that in no event shall the amount payable pursuant to
this sentence exceed $2,000,000. As used herein, the
"Market/Tender Offer Price" shall mean the higher of the
highest per share at which a Tender Offer or Exchange
Offer has been made by any person other than Grantee or
any affiliate of Grantee or person acting in concert in
any respect with Grantee for at least 20% of the shares
of Issuer Common Stock then outstanding or the highest
closing sales price per share of Issuer Common Stock
quoted on the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX") (or if
Issuer Common Stock is not quoted on the AMEX, the
highest bid price per share as quoted on the principal
trading market or securities exchange on which such
shares are traded as reported by a recognized source)
within the six-month period immediately preceding this
Agreement.

(b) At each Closing, simultaneously with
the delivery of immediately available funds and surrender
of this Agreement as provided in Section 4(a) hereof,
Issuer shall deliver to Grantee (A) a certificate or
certificates representing the Option Shares to be
purchased at such Closing, which Option Shares shall be
free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and
encumbrances of any kind whatsoever, other than any such
lien or encumbrance created by Grantee and (B) if the
Option is exercised in part only, an executed new
agreement with the same terms as this Agreement
evidencing the right to purchase the balance of the
shares of Issuer Common Stock purchasable hereunder. If
Issuer shall have issued rights or any similar securities
("Rights") pursuant to any shareholder rights, poison
pill or similar plan (a "Shareholder Rights Plan") prior
or subsequent to the date of this Agreement and such
Rights remain outstanding at the time of the issuance of
any Option Shares pursuant to an exercise of all or part
of the Option hereunder, then each Option Share issued
pursuant to such exercise shall also represent the number
of Rights issued per share of Issuer Common Stock with
terms substantially the same as and at least as favorable
to Grantee as are provided under the Shareholder Rights
Plan as then in effect.

(c) Certificates for the Option Shares
delivered at each Closing shall be endorsed with a
restrictive legend which shall read substantially as
follows:

THE TRANSFER OF THE STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE MAY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS
ARISING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED, AND PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF A STOCK
OPTION AGREEMENT DATED AS OF JUNE 27, 1994. A
COPY OF SUCH AGREEMENT WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE
HOLDER HEREOF WITHOUT CHARGE UPON RECEIPT BY
THE ISSUER OF A WRITTEN REQUEST THEREFOR.

It is understood and agreed that the above legend shall
be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s)
without such legend if Grantee shall have delivered to
Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), or an
opinion of outside counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Issuer in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Issuer and its counsel, to the effect that such legend is
not required for purposes of the Securities Act.

5. Representations and Warranties of Issuer. 
Issuer hereby represents and warrants to Grantee as
follows:

(a) Due Authorization. Issuer has full
corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of Issuer. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Issuer.

(b) No Violation. Neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by
Issuer with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will
(i) violate any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") or By-
Laws of Issuer or the certificates of incorporation, by-
laws or similar governing documents of any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) (x) assuming that all of the
consents and approvals required under applicable law for
the purchase of shares upon the exercise of the Option
are duly obtained, violate any statute, code, ordinance,
rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or
injunction applicable to Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties or
assets, or (y) violate, conflict with, result in a breach
of any provisions of or the loss of any benefit under,
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default)
under, result in the termination of or a right of
termination or cancellation under, accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any
lien, pledge, security interest, charge or other
encumbrance upon any of the respective properties or
assets of Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which
they or any of their respective properties or assets may
be bound or affected.

(c) Authorized Stock. Issuer has taken
all necessary corporate and other action to authorize and
reserve and to permit it to issue, and, at all times from
the date of this Agreement until the obligation to
deliver Issuer Common Stock upon the exercise of the
Option terminates, will have reserved for issuance, upon
exercise of the Option, shares of Issuer Common Stock
necessary for Grantee to exercise the Option, and Issuer
will take all necessary corporate action to authorize and
reserve for issuance all additional shares of Issuer
Common Stock (together with any Rights which may have
been issued with respect thereto) or other securities
which may be issued pursuant to Section 7 upon exercise
of the Option. The shares of Issuer Common Stock to be
issued upon due exercise of the Option, including all
additional shares of Issuer Common Stock (together with
any Rights which may have been issued with respect
thereto) or other securities which may be issuable
pursuant to Section 7, upon issuance pursuant hereto,
shall be duly and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and shall be delivered free and clear of
all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances of any kind
or nature whatsoever (except any such lien or
encumbrance created by Grantee), including any preemptive
rights of any stockholder of Issuer.

(d) Board Action. By action of the Board
of Directors of Issuer prior to the execution of this
Agreement, resolutions were duly adopted approving the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement,
any purchase or other transaction respecting Issuer
Common Stock provided for herein, and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the
provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law as they relate to Issuer and Section 8 of
Issuer's Certificate of Incorporation do not and will not
apply to this Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

6. Representations and Warranties of Grantee. 
Grantee hereby represents and warrants to Issuer that:

(a) Due Authorization. Grantee has
corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and, subject to any approvals or consents
referred to herein, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Grantee. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Grantee.

(b) Purchase Not for Distribution. This
Option is not being acquired with a view to the public
distribution thereof and neither this Option nor any
Option Shares will be transferred or otherwise disposed
of except in a transaction registered or exempt from
registration under the Securities Act.

7. Adjustment upon Changes in
Capitalization, etc. (a) In the event (i) of any change
in Issuer Common Stock by reason of a stock dividend,
stock split, split-up, recapitalization, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction or (ii) that
any Rights issued by Issuer shall become exercisable, the
type and number of shares or securities subject to the
Option, and the Purchase Price therefor, shall be
adjusted appropriately, and, in the case of any of the
transactions described in clause (i) above, proper
provision shall be made in the agreements governing such
transaction so that Grantee shall receive, upon exercise
of the Option, the number and class of shares or other
securities or property that Grantee would have received
in respect of Issuer Common Stock if the Option had been
exercised immediately prior to such event, or the record
date therefor, as applicable. If any additional shares
of Issuer Common Stock are issued after the date of this
Agreement (other than pursuant to an event described in
the first sentence of this Section 7(a)), the number of
shares of Issuer Common Stock subject to the Option shall
be adjusted so that, after such issuance, the Option,
together with any shares of Issuer Common Stock
previously issued pursuant hereto, equals 9.9% of the
number of shares of Issuer Common Stock then issued and
outstanding, without giving effect to any shares subject
or previously issued pursuant to the Option.

(b) In the event that Issuer shall enter into
an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any
person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries,
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any
person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to
merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or
surviving corporation, but, in connection with such
merger, the then outstanding shares of Issuer Common
Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or
other securities of Issuer or any other person or cash or
any other property or the outstanding shares of Issuer
Common Stock immediately prior to such merger shall after
such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding
shares and share equivalents of the merged company, or
(iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any person, other than Grantee or
one of its Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the
agreement governing such transaction shall make proper
provisions so that the Option shall, upon the
consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms
and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or
exchanged for, an option (the "Substitute Option"), at
the election of Grantee, of either (I) the Acquiring
Corporation (as defined below), (II) any person that
controls the Acquiring Corporation, or (III) in the case
of a merger described in clause (ii), the Issuer (such
person being referred to as the "Substitute Option
Issuer").

(c) The Substitute Option shall have the
same terms as the Option, provided, that if the terms of
the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons, be the
same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as
possible and in no event less advantageous to Grantee. 
The Substitute Option Issuer shall also enter into an
agreement with the then holder or holders of the
Substitute Option in substantially the same form as this
Agreement, which shall be applicable to the Substitute
Option.

(d) The Substitute Option shall be
exercisable for such number of shares of the Substitute
Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) as is equal to the
Assigned Value (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by the
number of shares of Issuer Common Stock for which the
Option was theretofore exercisable, divided by the
Average Price (as hereinafter defined). The exercise
price of the Substitute Option per share of the
Substitute Common Stock (the "Substitute Purchase Price")
shall then be equal to the Purchase Price multiplied by a
fraction in which the numerator is the number of shares
of the Issuer Common Stock for which the Option was
theretofore exercisable and the denominator is the number
of shares of the Substitute Common Stock for which the
Substitute Option is exercisable.

(e) The following terms have the meanings
indicated:

(I) "Acquiring Corporation" shall mean (i) the
continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or
merger with Issuer (if other than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in
a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or surviving
person, and (iii) the transferee of all or substantially
all of the Issuer's assets (or the assets of its
Subsidiaries).

(II) "Substitute Common Stock" shall mean the
common stock issued by the Substitute Option Issuer upon
exercise of the Substitute Option.

(III) "Assigned Value" shall mean the highest of
(i) the price per share of Issuer Common Stock at which a
tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made by
any person (other than Grantee), (ii) the price per share
of Issuer Common Stock to be paid by any person (other
than the Grantee) pursuant to an agreement with Issuer,
and (iii) the highest closing sales price per share of
Issuer Common Stock quoted on the AMEX (or if Issuer
Common Stock is not quoted on the AMEX, the highest bid
price per share as quoted on the principal trading market
or securities exchange on which such shares are traded as
reported by a recognized source) within the six-month
period immediately preceding the agreement; provided,
however, that in the event of a sale of less than all of
Issuer's assets, the Assigned Value shall be the sum of
the price paid in such sale for such assets and the
current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer as
determined by a nationally recognized investment banking
firm selected by Grantee or by a Grantee Majority,
divided by the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock
outstanding at the time of such sale. In the event that
an exchange offer is made for the Issuer Common Stock or
an agreement is entered into for a merger or
consolidation involving consideration other than cash,
the value of the securities or other property issuable or
deliverable in exchange for the Issuer Common Stock shall
be determined by a nationally recognized investment
banking firm mutually selected by Grantee and Issuer (or
if applicable, Acquiring Corporation), provided that if a
mutual selection cannot be made as to such investment
banking firm, it shall be selected by Grantee (or a
majority of interest of the Grantees if there shall be
more than one Grantee (a "Grantee Majority")).

(IV) "Average Price" shall mean the average closing
price of a share of the Substitute Common Stock for the
one year immediately preceding the consolidation, merger
or sale in question, but in no event higher than the
closing price of the shares of the Substitute Common
Stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or
sale; provided that if Issuer is the issuer of the
Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed
with respect to a share of common stock issued by Issuer,
the person merging into Issuer or by any company which
controls or is controlled by such merging person, as
Grantee may elect.

(f) In no event, pursuant to any of the
foregoing paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be
exercisable for more than 9.9% of the aggregate of the
shares of the Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior
to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the event that
the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than
9.9% of the aggregate of the shares of Substitute Common
Stock but for this clause (f), the Substitute Option
Issuer shall make a cash payment to Grantee equal to the
excess of (i) the value of the Substitute Option without
giving effect to the limitation in this clause (f) over
(ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving
effect to the limitation in this clause (f). This
difference in value shall be determined by a nationally
recognized investment banking firm selected by Grantee
(or a Grantee Majority).

(g) Issuer shall not enter into any
transaction described in subsection (b) of this Section 7
unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that
controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all
the obligations of Issuer hereunder and take all other
actions that may be necessary so that the provisions of
this Section 7 are given full force and effect
(including, without limitation, any action that may be
necessary so that the shares of Substitute Common Stock
are in no way distinguishable from or have lesser
economic value than other shares of common stock issued
by the Substitute Option Issuer).

(h) The provisions of Sections 8 and 9
shall apply to any securities for which the Option
becomes exercisable pursuant to this Section 7 and as
applicable, references in such sections to "Issuer",
"Option", "Purchase Price" and "Issuer Common Stock"
shall be deemed to be references to "Substitute Option
Issuer", "Substitute Option", "Substitute Purchase Price"
and "Substitute Common Stock", respectively.

8. Registration Rights. Issuer shall, if
requested by Grantee (or if applicable, a Grantee
Majority) at any time and from time to time within three
years of the date on which the Option first becomes
exercisable, as expeditiously as possible prepare and
file up to two registration statements under the
Securities Act if such registration is necessary in order
to permit the sale or other disposition of any or all
shares of Issuer Common Stock or other securities that
have been acquired by or are issuable to Grantee upon
exercise of the Option in accordance with the intended
method of sale or other disposition stated by Grantee,
including a "shelf" registration statement under Rule 415
under the Securities Act or any successor provision, and
Issuer shall use its best efforts to qualify such shares
or other securities under any applicable state securities
laws. Issuer shall use its best efforts to cause each
such registration statement to become effective, to
obtain all consents or waivers of other parties which are
required therefor and to keep such registration statement
effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from
the day such registration statement first becomes
effective as may be reasonably necessary to effect such
sale or other disposition. Any registration statement
prepared and filed under this Section 8, and any sale
covered thereby, shall be at Issuer's expense except for
underwriting discounts or commissions, brokers' fees and
the fees and disbursements of Grantee's counsel related
thereto. Grantee shall provide all information
reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in any
registration statement to be filed hereunder. If during
the time periods referred to in the first sentence of
this Section 8 Issuer effects a registration under the
Securities Act of Issuer Common Stock for its own account
or for any other stockholders of Issuer (other than on
Form S-4 or Form S-8, or any successor forms or any form
with respect to a dividend reinvestment or similar plan),
it shall allow Grantee the right to participate in such
registration, and such participation shall not affect the
obligation of Issuer to effect two registration
statements for Grantee under this Section 8; provided,
however, that, if the managing underwriters of such
offering advise Issuer in writing that in their opinion
the number of shares of Issuer Common Stock requested by
Grantee to be included in such registration, together
with the shares of Issuer Common Stock proposed to be
included in such registration, exceeds the number which
can be sold in such offering, Issuer shall include the
shares requested to be included therein by Grantee pro
rata with the shares intended to be included therein by
Issuer. In connection with any registration pursuant to
this Section 8, Issuer and Grantee shall provide each
other and any underwriter of the offering with customary
representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification
and contribution in connection with such registration. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in no event shall Issuer be obligated to effect
more than two registrations pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 8 by reason of the fact that
there shall be more than one Grantee as a result of any
assignment of this Agreement or division of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10 hereof.

9. Listing. If Issuer Common Stock or any
other securities to be acquired upon exercise of the
Option are then authorized for quotation on the AMEX or
any securities exchange, Issuer, upon the request of
Grantee, will promptly file an application to authorize
for quotation the shares of Issuer Common Stock or other
securities to be acquired upon exercise of the Option on
the AMEX or such other securities exchange and will use
its best efforts to obtain approval of such listing as
soon as practicable.

10. Division of Option. This Agreement (and
the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without
expense, at the option of Grantee, upon presentation and
surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of
Issuer for other Agreements providing for Options of
different denominations entitling the holder thereof to
purchase in the aggregate the same number of shares of
Issuer Common Stock purchasable hereunder. The terms
"Agreement" and "Option" as used herein include any other
Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement
(and the Option granted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon
receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to
it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this
Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or
destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification,
and upon surrender and cancellation of this Agreement, if
mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new
Agreement of like tenor and date. Any such new Agreement
executed and delivered shall constitute an additional
contractual obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or
not the Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated
shall at any time be enforceable by anyone.

11. Rights Agreement. Issuer shall not
approve or adopt, or propose the approval and adoption
of, any Shareholder Rights Plan unless such Shareholder
Rights Plan contains terms which provide, to the
reasonable satisfaction of Grantee, that (a) the Rights
issued pursuant thereto will not become exercisable by
virtue of the fact that (i) Grantee is the Beneficial
Owner of shares of Issuer Common Stock (x) acquired or
acquirable pursuant to the grant or exercise of this
Option and (y) held by Grantee or any of its Subsidiaries
as Trust Account Shares or DPC Shares or (ii) while
Grantee is the Beneficial Owner of the shares of Issuer
Common Stock described in clause (a)(i), an Acquisition
Transaction involving Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and Grantee, any of its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, is proposed, agreed to or consummated and
(b) no restrictions or limitations with respect to the
exercise of any Rights acquired or acquirable by Grantee
will result or be imposed by virtue of the fact that
Grantee is the Beneficial Owner of the shares of Issuer
Common Stock described in clause (a)(i) of this Section
11. 

12. Miscellaneous. (a) Expenses. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 8 hereof, each of the
parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses
incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereunder, including fees and
expenses of its own financial consultants, investment
bankers, accountants and counsel.

(b) Waiver and Amendment. Any provision
of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the party
that is entitled to the benefits of such provision. This
Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or
supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto.

(c) Entire Agreement; No Third-Party
Beneficiary; Severability. This Agreement, together with
the Merger Agreement and the other agreements and
instruments referred to herein and therein, (a)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and (b) is not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, this
Agreement shall be deemed to amend the confidentiality
agreement between Issuer and Grantee so as to permit
Grantee to enter into this Agreement and exercise all of
its rights hereunder, including its right to acquire
Issuer Common Stock upon exercise of the Option. If any
term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
a federal or state regulatory agency to be invalid, void
or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated. If for any reason such court or
regulatory agency determines that the Option does not
permit Grantee to acquire the full number of shares of
Issuer Common Stock as provided in Section 3 hereof (as
adjusted pursuant to Section 7 hereof), it is the express
intention of Issuer to allow Grantee to acquire such
lesser number of shares as may be permissible without any
amendment or modification hereof.

(d) Governing Law. This Agreement shall
be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware without regard to any applicable
conflicts of law rules.

(e) Descriptive Headings. The
descriptive headings contained herein are for convenience
of reference only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

(f) Notices. All notices and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
deemed given if delivered personally, telecopied (with
confirmation) or mailed by registered or certified mail

Option, own in excess of 6% of Issuer's then issued and
outstanding common stock. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and assigns. As used in this
Agreement, Grantee shall include any person to whom this
Agreement or the Option shall be assigned by a previous

any such equitable relief and that this provision is
without prejudice to any other rights that the parties
hereto may have for any failure to perform this
Agreement.
