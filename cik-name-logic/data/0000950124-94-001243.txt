ITEM 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

(a) As a result of a bidding process to select an auditor for
fiscal year 1994, on July 19, 1994, the Registrant's Board of
Directors informed Arthur Andersen & Co., the Registrant's
independent accountants for fiscal year 1993, of the Board's 
decision to not retain Arthur Andersen & Co. for fiscal year 1994. 
The decision to change independent accountants was recommended to
the Board of Directors by its Audit and Finance Committee. The
Registrant expects to finalize the engagement of new independent
accountants for fiscal year 1994 within the next several weeks.

(b) Arthur Andersen & Co.'s report on the Registrant's financial 
statements for the past two years contained no adverse opinion 
or disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified
as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.

(c) There were no disagreements with Arthur Andersen & Co. on any 
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement 
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure during the two most 
recent fiscal years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the 
interim period subsequent to January 1, 1994 through July 19, 1994.

(d) The Registrant requested Arthur Andersen & Co. to furnish it
with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
stating whether it agrees with the above statements and, if not, 
stating the respects in which it does not agree. The Registrant 
will file by amendment, as an exhibit to this Form 8-K report, 
a copy of such letter promptly after it is received.
