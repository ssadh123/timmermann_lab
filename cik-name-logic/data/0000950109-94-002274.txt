FORSTMANN EXPECTS SALES INCREASE IN FISCAL 1994,
------------------------------------------------
BUT A DECLINE IN OPERATING INCOME
---------------------------------

NEW YORK, New York -- November 18, 1994 -- Forstmann & Company, Inc., (NASDAQ: 
FSTM) today announced that it expects to report for fiscal 1994 a slight 
increase in sales over the $233 million reported in fiscal 1993 and a decline in
operating income to between $22 million and $24 million, versus $26.6 million 
for the prior year. In addition, due to increased borrowings and higher interest
rates. The Company expects interest expense for the full fiscal year to increase
approximately $1.8 million. As a result, income applicable to common 
shareholders is expected to decline from $1.15 per share in fiscal 1993 to 
between $0.50 to $0.60 per share in fiscal 1994.

Christopher Schaller, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We attribute
these results to a shift in product mix and a sluggish women's outerwear and 
sportswear market, which was compounded by the Company's goal to lower 
inventories by curtailing production levels in response to softness in those 
markets. These factors, as well as the effects of higher interest rates, are 
expected to cause earnings to be below expectations." Mr. Schaller noted that 
the Company expects a decline in inventories during the fourth quarter of 1994 
such that year-end fiscal 1994 balances will be comparable to year-end fiscal 
1993 balances.

The Company anticipates reporting final audited results for fiscal 1994 in early
January.

fashion fabrics for use in the production of brand name and private label
