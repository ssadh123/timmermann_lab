and Exhibits.
-------------

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information:

This Form 8-K/A with Exhibits amends the previously filed Form 
8-K with Exhibits dated October 14, 1994. The response to Item 7 of such
Form 8-K indicated that pro forma financial information showing the effect
of the sale of Giant Cement Holding, Inc. capital stock by KCC Delaware
Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of GIANT GROUP, LTD., would be filed
within the period prescribed by the instructions to Item 7 of Form 8-K. 
The three Exhibits filed herewith represent the pro forma financial
information required by Item 7.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 1994 reflects the historical accounts of the Company as of
that date to give pro forma effect to the sale of the Company's cement
operations as if they had occurred on September 30, 1994. The unaudited
pro forma consolidated statements of operations for the nine month period
ended September 30, 1994 and the year ended December 31, 1993 have been
presented to reflect how results from continuing operations would have 
been reflected if the transaction had taken place at the beginning of the 
fiscal year presented. The pro forma consolidated financial data are 
provided for information purposes only.
