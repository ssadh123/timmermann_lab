PROSPECTUS SUMMARY

The following information is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed
information and the financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere
in this Prospectus. Unless otherwise indicated, (i) all references in this
Prospectus to per share amounts and numbers and percentages of shares
outstanding reflect the Reclassification (as defined below) which will occur
immediately prior to the consummation of the Equity Offerings (as defined below)
and assume that there is no exercise of the over-allotment option by the U.S.
Underwriters, and (ii) references to the 'Company' refer to Jefferson Smurfit
Corporation, and where appropriate, its subsidiaries.

THE COMPANY

The Company believes it is one of the nation's largest producers of
paperboard and packaging products and is the largest producer of recycled
paperboard and recycled packaging products. The Company's system of 16
paperboard mills produces virgin and recycled containerboard, solid bleached
sulfate ('SBS') and recycled boxboard, and recycled cylinderboard, which is sold
to the Company's own converting operations or to third parties. The Company's
converting operations consist of 52 corrugated container plants, 18 folding
carton plants, and 16 industrial packaging plants located across the country,
with three plants located outside the U.S. In 1993, the Company's container
plants converted an amount of containerboard equal to approximately 105.5% of
the amount the Company produced, its folding carton plants converted an amount
of SBS, recycled boxboard and coated natural kraft equal to approximately 65.4%
of the amount the Company produced, and its industrial packaging plants
converted an amount of recycled cylinderboard equal to approximately 59.7% of
the amount the Company produced. The Company's Paperboard/Packaging Products
segment contributed 91.6% of the Company's net sales in 1993. The Company's
paperboard operations are supported by its reclamation division and by its
timber operations which manage approximately one million acres of owned or
leased timberland located in close proximity to its virgin fibre mills.

In addition, the Company believes it is one of the nation's largest
producers of recycled newsprint. The Company's newsprint division includes two
newsprint mills in Oregon and two facilities that produce Cladwood'r', a
construction material produced from newsprint and wood by-products.

The predecessor to the Company was founded in 1974 when Jefferson Smurfit
Group plc ('JS Group'), a worldwide leader in the packaging products industry,
commenced operations in the United States by acquiring 40% of a small paperboard
and packaging products company. The remaining 60% of that company was acquired
in 1977, and in 1978 net sales were $42.9 million. The Company implemented a
strategy to build a fully integrated, broadly based, national packaging
business, primarily through acquisitions, including Alton Box Board Company in
1979, the paperboard and packaging divisions of Diamond International
Corporation in 1982, 80% of Smurfit Newsprint Corporation ('SNC') in 1986, and
50% of Container Corporation of America ('CCA') in 1986. The Company financed
its acquisitions by using leverage, and in several cases, utilized joint venture
financing whereby the Company eventually obtained control of the acquired
company. While no major acquisition has been made since 1986, the Company has
made 18 smaller acquisitions and started up five new facilities which had
combined sales in 1993 of $280.3 million. Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (U.S.)
('JSC') was formed in 1983 to consolidate the operations of the Company, and
today the Company ranks among the industry leaders in its two business segments,
Paperboard/Packaging Products and Newsprint. In 1993, the Company had net sales
of $2.9 billion, achieving a compound annual sales growth rate of 32.6% for the
period since 1978.

The principal components of the Company's business strategy include the
following:

Maintain Focus on Recycled Products. The Company believes that it is
the largest recycler of wastepaper; the largest producer of coated
recycled paperboard and one of the largest producers of recycled
newsprint in the United States, and is well positioned to supply an
increasing demand for environmentally friendly packaging.

Focus on Cost Reduction. The Company is implementing a company-wide
cost reduction program designed to improve the cost competitiveness
of all the Company's operating facilities and staff functions.
Additionally, in 1993 the Company began a restructuring program to
realign and consolidate various manufacturing operations over the
next 2 to 3 years.

4

<PAGE>
Continue to Pursue Vertical Integration. The Company's high level of
integration assures the Company of top quality and economically
priced supplies of fibre for its paperboard mills, and protects the
Company from potential regional supply and demand imbalances for
recycled fibre grades. Integration also reduces the volatility of
pricing for the Company's containerboard products and allows the
Company to run its mills at higher operating rates during industry
downturns.

Continue Growth in Core Businesses. The Company intends to continue
its strategy of building its core packaging businesses primarily by
pursuing acquisitions and through capital improvement programs.

Maintain Leading Market Positions. The Company's prominence in the
United States packaging industry provides the Company certain
advantages in marketing its products, including excellent customer
visibility, which has enabled the Company to enter into strategic
alliances with select large national account customers. The Company's
broad range of packaging products provides a single source option to
supply all of a customer's packaging needs.

Improve Financial Profile. The Recapitalization Plan (as defined
below) will improve operating and financial flexibility by reducing
the level and overall cost of its debt, extending maturities of its
indebtedness, increasing stockholders' equity and increasing its
access to capital markets.

Prior to the consummation of the Equity Offerings, 50% of the stock of the
Company was owned by direct and indirect subsidiaries of Smurfit International,
B.V. ('SIBV') an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of JS Group, a public
corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Ireland, % was
beneficially owned by The Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership investment fund formed to make investments in
industrial and other companies ('MSLEF II'), and certain related entities and
% was beneficially owned by certain other investors. MSLEF II is an affiliate
of both Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ('MS&Co.'), a representative of the
U.S. Underwriters, and Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited, a
representative of the International Underwriters.

After the consummation of the Recapitalization Plan, including the Equity
Offerings and the purchase by SIBV (or a corporate affiliate) of
shares of Common Stock for $100 million (assuming a purchase price per share
equal to the midpoint of the range of the anticipated high and low per share
public offering prices set forth on the cover) (the 'SIBV Investment'), SIBV
will beneficially own approximately %, MSLEF II and certain related entities
will beneficially own in the aggregate approximately %, and all other
stockholders (including public stockholders) will beneficially own approximately
% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. See 'Security Ownership of
Certain Beneficial Owners' and 'Certain Transactions'.

RECAPITALIZATION PLAN

The Company is implementing a recapitalization plan (the 'Recapitalization
Plan') to refinance a substantial portion of its indebtedness in order to
improve operating and financial flexibility by reducing the level and overall
cost of its debt, extending maturities of indebtedness, increasing stockholders'
equity and increasing its access to capital markets. For the year ended December
31, 1993, the Recapitalization Plan would, on a pro forma basis for such year,
have resulted in $68.7 million of aggregate savings in interest expense, of
which $53.8 million represents cash interest expense savings (in each case on a
pre-tax basis).

The Recapitalization Plan includes the following primary components:

(i) (a) The offering by the Company of 14,650,000 shares of
Common Stock pursuant to this Prospectus (the 'Equity Offerings');

(b) The SIBV Investment;

(c) The offering by CCA of $500 million aggregate principal
amount of % Series A Senior Notes due 2004 (the 'Series A
Senior Notes') and $100 million aggregate principal amount of
% Series B Senior Notes due 2002 (the 'Series B Senior
Notes' and, together with the Series A Senior Notes, the 'Senior
Notes') (the 'Debt Offerings'). The Equity Offerings and the Debt
Offerings are collectively referred to herein as the 'Offerings';

(d) The entering into of a new credit agreement by CCA and
JSC (the 'New Credit Agreement') consisting of a $450 million
revolving credit facility (the 'New Revolving Credit Facility'), a
$200 million term loan (the 'Initial Term Loan') and an $850
million delayed term loan (the 'Delayed Term Loan' and, together
with the Initial Term Loan, the 'New Term Loans').

(ii) The application of the net proceeds of the Offerings and the SIBV
Investment, together with borrowings under the New Credit Agreement, to
refinance (the 'Bank Debt Refinancing') all of the Company's indebtedness
outstanding under (a) the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,
dated as of November 9, 1989, among the Company, JSC, CCA, the lenders
which are parties thereto, Bankers Trust Company as agent and Chemical Bank
and Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association as co-agents
(the '1989 Credit Agreement'); (b) the Amended and Restated Note Purchase
Agreement, dated as of December 14, 1989, among the Company, JSC, CCA and
the purchasers of the secured notes (the 'Secured Notes') issued thereunder
(the 'Secured Note Purchase Agreement'), and (c) the Loan and Note Purchase
Agreement, dated as of August 26, 1992, among the Company, JSC, CCA, the
lenders which are

7

<PAGE>
party thereto, Chemical Bank as agent and the managing agents and
collateral trustee which are party thereto (the '1992 Credit Agreement'
and, together with the 1989 Credit Agreement, the 'Old Bank Facilities').

(iii) The application, on approximately December 1, 1994, of the
borrowings under the Delayed Term Loan to redeem (the 'Subordinated Debt
Refinancing') CCA's (a) 13 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 1998 (the
'Senior Subordinated Notes'), (b) 14% Subordinated Debentures due 2001 (the
'Subordinated Debentures') and (c) 15 1/2% Junior Subordinated Accrual
Debentures due 2004 (the 'Junior Accrual Debentures' and, together with the
Senior Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Debentures, the
'Subordinated Debt'). The earliest date the Subordinated Debt may be
redeemed is December 1, 1994. Borrowings under the Delayed Term Loan will
be subject to the satisfaction of certain limited conditions.

- ------------

(a) Assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share of Common Stock
(which is equal to the midpoint of the range of the anticipated high and
low per share public offering prices set forth on the cover) and, in the
case of the Offerings, without deducting estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and expenses.

(b) The maximum amount available under such facility will be $450 million, with
up to $150 million of such amount being available for letters of credit. It
is anticipated that immediately following the Offerings, letters of credit
of approximately $90 million will be outstanding under such facility. See
also (c) below.

(c) Represents the outstanding principal amount and redemption premiums
required to be paid on the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated
Debentures, and the estimated accreted value of the Junior Accrual
Debentures as of December 1, 1994. The Company expects that accrued and
unpaid interest at June 1 and December 1, 1994 on the Senior Subordinated
Notes and the Subordinated Debentures will be paid through internal cash
flow or with additional borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

(d) Expenses include estimated underwriting discounts and commissions relating
to the Equity Offerings and the Debt Offerings, respectively. There are no
underwriting discounts or commissions on the sale of Common Stock pursuant
to the SIBV Investment.

(e) If the U.S. Underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, cash
will be increased by an additional $ million.

The aggregate amount of proceeds, net of estimated expenses, necessary
immediately following the Offerings to consummate the Recapitalization Plan
(excluding the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) is approximately $1,120 million.
The sources of funds for such amount are set forth in the above table. Prior to
consummation of the Offerings, however, the Company may determine to change the
size of the various components of the Recapitalization Plan and, accordingly,
among other things may change the size of the Debt Offerings and/or the Equity
Offerings which could, in turn, affect the size of the Initial Term Loan and/or
the Delayed Term Loan.

In order to consummate the Recapitalization Plan, the Company must obtain
certain consents and waivers, consisting, among others, of the consent of (i) a
majority in principal amount of the holders of CCA's 9 3/4% Senior Notes due
2003 (the '1993 Notes'), (ii) 60% of the holders of the outstanding principal
amount of Secured Notes and (iii) certain parties under JSC's and CCA's trade
receivables

<PAGE>
securitization (the 'Securitization') (collectively, the 'Consents and
Waivers'). The Company expects that, prior to entering into the Underwriting
Agreement (as defined below), it shall have obtained the Consents and Waivers.
For more information concerning the Consents and Waivers, see 'Recapitalization
Plan -- Consents and Waivers'.

All of the transactions contemplated by the Recapitalization Plan (other
than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) are expected to occur substantially
contemporaneously. Consummation of the Equity Offerings is conditioned on the
substantially concurrent consummation of the other components of the
Recapitalization Plan (other than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing), including,
among other things, consummation of (i) the SIBV Investment, (ii) the Debt
Offerings, and (iii) the Bank Debt Refinancing. In addition, consummation of the
Equity Offerings is conditioned on the Company obtaining the Consents and
Waivers.

For more information concerning the Recapitalization Plan, see
'Recapitalization Plan'.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information contained in this Prospectus, the
following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in
the securities offered by this Prospectus.

SUBSTANTIAL LEVERAGE; ABILITY TO SERVICE DEBT; SUBORDINATED DEBT REFINANCING

The Company has, and following the consummation of the Recapitalization
Plan will continue to have, on a consolidated basis a substantial amount of
debt, much of which was originally incurred to finance (or to refinance debt
originally incurred to finance) the 1989 Transaction (as defined below). The
Company's long-term debt at December 31, 1993 was $2,619.1 million and, on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Recapitalization Plan, the Company's
long-term debt as of such date would have been $2,408.8 million. The amount of
long-term indebtedness at such date on a historical basis was greater than the
book value of the Company's total assets, as reflected on its balance sheet
(which is not based on fair saleable or fair value), and is substantial relative
to the Company's stockholders' equity, which has been negative in recent years
due to the accounting treatment of the 1989 Transaction and recent net losses.
See ' -- Recent Losses; Negative Stockholders' Equity'. Although the
consummation of the Recapitalization Plan will reduce the Company's consolidated
interest expense over the next several years, JSC and CCA will remain obligated
to make substantial interest payments on indebtedness under the New Credit
Agreement, the 1993 Notes and the Senior Notes and, until the consummation of
the Subordinated Debt Refinancing, on the Subordinated Debt. For a description
of the terms of the Company's indebtedness, see 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness'. For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company's earnings were
inadequate to cover fixed charges by $264.2 million and, on a pro forma basis,
after giving effect to the Recapitalization Plan and to the Recapitalization
Plan (excluding the Subordinated Debt Refinancing), would have been inadequate
to cover fixed charges by $195.5 million and $254.1 million, respectively. See
'Capitalization' and 'Pro Forma Financial Data'.

The Company generally expects to fund its and its subsidiaries' debt
service obligations, capital expenditures and working capital requirements
through funds generated from operations and additional borrowings under the New
Revolving Credit Facility. As of the closing of the Offerings and the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the Recapitalization Plan
(other than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing), the Company expects JSC and CCA
to have in the aggregate approximately $360 million in unused borrowing capacity
under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See 'Capitalization'. In 1991, JSC and
CCA financed their receivables through the Securitization, thereby reducing
their borrowings under the 1989 Credit Agreement. See 'Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition -- Liquidity and
Capital Resources' and 'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Securitization'.
The Securitization matures in April 1996, at which time the Company expects to
refinance it. Although the Company believes that it will be able to do so, no
assurances can be given in this regard.

The ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to meet their obligations
and to comply with the financial covenants contained in the New Credit
Agreement, the 1993 Notes and the Senior Notes and, until the consummation of
the Subordinated Debt Refinancing, the Subordinated Debt, is largely dependent
upon the future performance of the Company and its subsidiaries, which will be
subject to financial, business and other factors affecting them. Many of these
factors are beyond the Company's control, such as the state of the economy,
demand for and selling prices of its products, costs of its raw materials and
legislative factors and other factors relating to its industry generally or to
specific competitors. There can be no assurance that the Company and its
subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to meet their obligations under
their indebtedness, which includes repayment obligations, assuming consummation
of the Subordinated Debt Refinancing, of $102 million during the second and $152
million during each of the third through fifth years following consummation of
the Offerings (and increasing thereafter). If the Company and its subsidiaries
are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary
to make required payments on their indebtedness, or if the Company or any of its
subsidiaries fails to comply with the various covenants in such indebtedness,
they would be in default under the terms thereof, which would permit the lenders
thereunder to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness and could cause
defaults under other indebtedness of the Company and

11

<PAGE>
its subsidiaries or result in a bankruptcy of the Company and its subsidiaries.
See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition -- Liquidity and Capital Resources' and 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness'. In addition, if a 'Change of Control' as defined in the New
Credit Agreement, the 1993 Notes or the Senior Notes is deemed to have occurred,
then the holders of such indebtedness shall have the right to be repaid 101% of
the principal amount of such indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon. See ' -- Shares Eligible for Future Sale'. Similarly, the exercises of
such rights could also trigger cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions,
and lead to the bankruptcy of the Company and its subsidiaries.

The Subordinated Debt Refinancing is an integral part of the
Recapitalization Plan and a significant portion of the benefits intended to be
achieved as a result of the Recapitalization Plan is derived from it. The
availability of the financing under the Delayed Term Loan necessary to effect
the Subordinated Debt Refinancing is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, although the failure to satisfy such conditions will in almost all
instances indicate that a significant and adverse change in the Company's
financial condition has occurred. The Company expects to be able to satisfy such
conditions, although, in any event, it reserves the right not to consummate the
Subordinated Debt Refinancing for any reason. See 'Recapitalization
Plan -- Subordinated Debt Refinancing'. In addition, the Company believes that,
even if the Subordinated Debt Refinancing is not consummated, it will realize
substantial benefits from the consummation of the other components of the
Recapitalization Plan, including a decrease in leverage and a resulting increase
in stockholders' equity. See 'Pro Forma Financial Data'.

CERTAIN RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

The limitations contained in the agreements relating to the Company's and
its subsidiaries' indebtedness, together with the highly leveraged position of
such companies, as well as various provisions in the Company's agreements
relating to its governance, including the Stockholders Agreement and the
Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below), could limit the ability of the
Company and its subsidiaries to effect future debt or equity financings and may
otherwise restrict corporate activities, including their ability to avoid
defaults and to respond to market conditions, to provide for capital
expenditures beyond those permitted or to take advantage of business
opportunities. If the Company and its subsidiaries cannot generate sufficient
cash flow from operations to meet their obligations, then their indebtedness
might have to be refinanced. There can be no assurance that any such refinancing
could be effected successfully or on terms that are acceptable to the Company
and its subsidiaries. In the absence of such refinancing, the Company and its
subsidiaries could be forced to dispose of assets in order to make up for any
shortfall in the payments due on their indebtedness under circumstances that
might not be favorable to realizing the best price for such assets. Further,
there can be no assurance that any assets could be sold quickly enough, or for
amounts sufficient, to enable the Company and its subsidiaries to make any such
payments.

RECENT LOSSES; NEGATIVE STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Although the Company and its subsidiaries have consistently generated
substantial income from operations, they have experienced, primarily as a result
of interest expense resulting from high leverage (see ' -- Substantial Leverage;
Ability to Service Debt; Subordinated Debt Refinancing'), net losses for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991. See 'Selected Historical
Financial Data' and 'Pro Forma Financial Data'. Improvements in the Company's
consolidated results of operations depend largely upon its ability to increase
prices of its products; accordingly, there can be no assurances as to its
ability to generate net income in future periods. See ' -- Pricing and
Competition' and 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
and Financial Condition'.

The Company has had a deficit in stockholders' equity since 1989 when it
was organized to effect the acquisition of the publicly held shares of JSC and
the shares of CCA not then owned by JSC, and the recapitalization of such
companies (the '1989 Transaction'), since such transaction was treated as a
recapitalization for financial accounting purposes. On a historical basis, at
December 31, 1993, the Company's stockholders' deficit was $1,057.8 million and,
on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Recapitalization Plan, there
would have been a stockholders' deficit of $745.8 million. See 'Capitalization'
and 'Pro Forma Financial Data'.

<PAGE>
PRICING AND COMPETITION

Most markets in which the Company competes are subject to significant price
fluctuations. The Company's sales and profitability have historically been more
sensitive to price changes than changes in volume, and recent reductions in
prices have had an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations. Future
decreases in prices (or the inability to achieve price increases) for the
Company's products would adversely affect its operating results. These factors,
coupled with the highly leveraged financial position of the Company, may
adversely impact the Company's ability to respond to competition and to other
market conditions or to otherwise take advantage of business opportunities.

Operating rates in the industry during 1991 and 1992 were at high levels
relative to demand, which was lower due to the sluggish U.S. economy and a
decline in export markets. This imbalance resulted in excess inventories in the
industry and lower prices for the Company's containerboard and corrugated
shipping container products, which began early in 1991 and has continued
throughout 1992 and most of 1993. During 1993, industry operating rates were
lower as many containerboard producers, including the Company, took downtime at
containerboard mills to reduce the excess inventories. By the end of the third
quarter of 1993, inventory levels had decreased significantly. The lower level
of inventories and the stronger U.S. economy provided what the Company believes
were improved market conditions late in 1993. Although the Company believes that
containerboard pricing will be improved in 1994, there can be no assurance that
price increases will hold or that the Company's containerboard prices will not
decline from current levels.

Newsprint prices have fallen substantially since 1990 due to supply and
demand imbalances. During 1991 and 1992, new capacity of approximately two
million tons annually came on line, representing an approximate 12% increase in
supply. At the same time, U.S. consumption of newsprint fell due to declines in
readership and ad linage. As prices fell, certain high cost, virgin paper
machines, primarily in Canada, representing approximately 1.2 million tons of
annual production capacity, were shut down and remained idle during 1993. While
supply was diminished, a price increase announced for 1993 was unsuccessful.
Although market demand has improved in the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company
does not expect significant improvement in prices before the second quarter of
1994.

The paperboard and packaging products industries are highly competitive,
and no single company is dominant. The Company's competitors include large,
vertically integrated paperboard and packaging products companies and numerous
smaller companies. In recent years, there has been a trend toward consolidation
within the paperboard and packaging products industries, and the Company
believes that this trend is likely to continue. See 'Business -- Industry
Overview'. The primary competitive factors in the paperboard and packaging
products industries are price, design, quality and service, with varying
emphasis on these factors depending on the product line. To the extent that one
or more of the Company's competitors becomes more successful with respect to any
key competitive factor, the Company's business could be materially, adversely
affected. See 'Business -- Competition'.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Federal, state and local environmental requirements, particularly relating
to air and water quality, are a significant factor in the Company's business.
The Company faces potential environmental liability as a result of violations of
permit terms and similar authorizations that have occurred from time to time at
its facilities. In addition, the Company faces potential liability for 'response
costs' at various sites with respect to which the Company has received notice
that it may be a 'potentially responsible party' as well as for contamination of
certain Company-owned properties, under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, analogous state laws and other laws
concerning hazardous substance contamination. While the Company believes it is
currently in compliance with all applicable environmental laws in all material
respects and has budgeted for future expenditures required to maintain such
compliance, unforeseen significant expenditures in connection with such
compliance could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.
See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition -- General' and 'Business -- Environmental Matters'.

<PAGE>
RESTRICTIONS ON PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS

The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of
its capital stock, and does not intend to pay dividends on its Common Stock in
the foreseeable future. Following the consummation of the Offerings, the 1993
Notes and the Senior Notes will allow the Company to pay aggregate annual
dividends of not more than $ on all outstanding shares of its Common
Stock. However, the New Credit Agreement and, unless and until the Subordinated
Debt Refinancing is consummated, the indentures governing the Subordinated Debt,
will effectively prohibit the payment of dividends on the Common Stock for the
foreseeable future. See 'Dividend Policy'.

CONTROL BY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS

Upon completion of the Equity Offerings, SIBV and the MSLEF II Associated
Entities (as defined below) will beneficially own % and %, respectively, and
will in the aggregate beneficially own % of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock. As a result, upon completion of the Equity Offerings, SIBV and the MSLEF
II Associated Entities will, acting together, be able to control the vote on all
matters submitted to a vote of holders of Common Stock. The presence of SIBV
and, until they dispose of their shares (see below), the MSLEF II Associated
Entities, as controlling stockholders, is also likely to deter a potential
acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of
the Company, even if such events might be favorable to the Company's
stockholders. See ' -- Anti-Takeover Provisions'.

SIBV, MSLEF II and the Company will, at or prior to completion of the
Equity Offerings, enter into a Stockholders Agreement (the 'Stockholders
Agreement') which contains, among other things, provisions for various corporate
governance matters, including the election as directors of certain of their
designees. SIBV and MSLEF II collectively will have the power, particularly in
light of the terms of the Stockholders Agreement which effectively consolidates
their voting power, to elect all of the Company's directors, and thereby
influence and control the management and policies of the Company. In addition,
all officers of the Company (other than the Chief Financial Officer) will be
nominated and appointed by directors of the Company designated by SIBV, and the
Chief Financial Officer will be nominated and appointed by directors of the
Company designated by MSLEF II. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement,
operational decisions concerning the Company will be made generally by the
management of the Company; however certain transactions that do not generally
pertain to the day-to-day management of the Company will be subject to approval
by certain of the directors designated by SIBV and MSLEF II. The possibility of
a deadlock exists with respect to such approval and may hinder the ability of
management to take a certain course of action. For a description of the
Stockholders Agreement, see 'Management -- Provisions of Stockholders Agreement
Pertaining to Management' and 'Certain Transactions -- Stockholders Agreement'.

SIBV, which owns its Common Stock through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, is
itself an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of JS Group, an international
paperboard and packaging corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of
Ireland. JS Group is listed on the London and Dublin Stock Exchanges and is the
largest industrial corporation in Ireland. JS Group and its subsidiaries have a
number of operations similar to those of the Company, although for the most part
outside the United States other than their newsprint operations. Accordingly, JS
Group's interests with respect to various business decisions of the Company may
conflict with the Company's interests.

MSLEF II, Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, Inc. ('MSLEF II, Inc.'),
a Delaware corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Group
Inc. ('Morgan Stanley Group') and the general partner of MSLEF II, and SIBV/MS
Equity Investors, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership the general partner of
which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Group ('Equity Investors',
and together with MSLEF II and MSLEF II, Inc., the 'MSLEF II Associated
Entities') will hold approximately %, % and %, respectively, of the
shares of Common Stock immediately following the Equity Offerings. The intention
of the MSLEF II Associated Entities is to dispose of the shares of Common Stock
owned by them. The timing of such sales or other dispositions by them (which
could include distributions to the partners of MSLEF II) will depend on market
and other conditions, but could occur or commence relatively soon after the 180
day hold back period. See 'Underwriters'. MSLEF II is unable to predict the
timing of sales by any of its limited partners in the

14

<PAGE>
event of a distribution to them. Pursuant to the terms of the Stockholders
Agreement, SIBV may, at its option, terminate the Stockholders Agreement once
the MSLEF II Group (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) ceases to own six
percent or more of the outstanding Common Stock. Upon the termination of the
Stockholders Agreement, SIBV will no longer be contractually limited to electing
only four of the eight directors. In addition, if the MSLEF II Group's ownership
is 10% or less of the outstanding Common Stock, SIBV will no longer be required
to obtain the approval of two directors who are designees of MSLEF II for the
Company to engage in certain activities, for which such approval is otherwise
required by the Stockholders Agreement. See 'Management -- Provisions of
Stockholders Agreement Pertaining to Management'. Furthermore, MSLEF II has the
right at any time to waive any of the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement,
to agree to the early termination thereof or to fail to exercise any of its
rights thereunder.

In addition, although SIBV and the MSLEF II Associated Entities have in the
past made additional investments in the Company, they are not obligated to do so
in the future. Investors should not assume or expect that either or both of such
shareholders or their affiliates will invest additional capital, whether in the
form of debt or equity, in the future, particularly in light of the intention of
the MSLEF II Associated Entities to dispose of their shares of Common Stock and
the fact that SIBV's ability to make such investments is subject to limitations
contained in agreements relating to indebtedness of SIBV and its affiliates.

TAX NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS

As of December 31, 1993, the Company had net operating loss ('NOL')
carryforwards of approximately $309 million for federal income tax purposes.
These carryforwards, if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods,
will expire at various times in 2005 through 2008.

If the Company experiences an 'ownership change' within the meaning of
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), the
Company's ability to use its NOL carryforwards existing at such time to offset
its taxable income, if any, generated in taxable periods after the ownership
change would be subject to an annual limitation (the 'Section 382 Limitation')
described below. In general, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of
stock owned by certain '5% shareholders' increases by more than 50 percentage
points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such shareholders during a
prescribed testing period (generally the preceding three years). Under special
rules in the Code and applicable Treasury regulations, certain shareholders
which individually own less than 5% of the Company's stock are aggregated and
treated as a single 5% shareholder. Thus, purchasers of less than 5% of the
Common Stock in the Equity Offerings generally would be treated as a single 5%
shareholder. The amount of NOL carryforwards which may be utilized on an annual
basis following an ownership change generally would be equal to the product of
the value of the outstanding stock of the Company immediately prior to the
ownership change (reduced by certain contributions to the Company's capital made
in the two years prior to the ownership change) multiplied by the 'long-term
tax-exempt rate', which is determined monthly and was 5.15% for February 1994.

Although the Company does not believe that it will experience an ownership
change upon consummation of the Equity Offerings, it is possible that during the
three year period following the Equity Offerings, future events that are beyond
the control of the Company (such as transfers of Common Stock by 5%
shareholders, including MSLEF II, its affiliates, its partners and SIBV and its
affiliates, in registered sales or otherwise), or certain stock issuances or
other actions by the Company, could cause the Company to experience an ownership
change. By way of example and without limitation, a sale by MSLEF II of a
substantial amount of Common Stock in one or more registered secondary offerings
would generally be treated as if MSLEF II sold such stock to a new 5%
shareholder (i.e., the public group that purchased such stock) whose lowest
percentage ownership in the Company during the three years prior to such sale
was zero. Accordingly, the increase in such public group's percentage ownership
in the Company, combined with prior owner shifts in the three years preceding
the sale by MSLEF II, would likely result in an ownership change. As indicated
under ' -- Control by Principal Shareholders' MSLEF II currently intends to
dispose of its Common Stock and sales or other dispositions by it could occur
relatively soon after the 180 day hold back period.

15

<PAGE>
Under special rules contained in temporary Treasury regulations, certain
options are treated as exercised solely for purposes of Section 382 if the
deemed exercise thereof would result in an ownership change. Accordingly, under
these rules, it is possible that the deemed exercise by SIBV and its affiliates
of their option to purchase all of the Common Stock owned by the MSLEF II Group
(see under 'Certain Transactions -- Stockholders Agreement'), combined with
certain transfers of even a relatively small percentage of the Common Stock by
certain shareholders after the consummation of the Equity Offerings, or any
sales of Common Stock by MSLEF II Associated Entities, would cause an ownership
change. Proposed Treasury regulations which would apply to testing dates on or
after November 5, 1992 but which have not yet been adopted in final form,
however, do not contain such a 'deemed exercise' rule applicable to options.
Although it appears likely, based on informal statements from Treasury
officials, that the proposed regulations will be adopted in substantially their
current form with respect to this issue, there can be no assurance as to whether
or in what form such proposed regulations will be finalized or what their
retroactive application, if any, would be.

If the Company experienced an ownership change (as described in either of
the two preceding paragraphs) at a time at which the value of the Common Stock
was equal to the Price to Public set forth on the cover of $ per share, the
Section 382 Limitation would be $[70-80] million using a 'long-term tax exempt
rate' of 5.15%. Depending on the circumstances, such an ownership change could
significantly restrict the Company's ability to utilize NOLs existing at such
time to offset subsequent taxable income. Accordingly, due to uncertainty as to
whether an ownership change will occur following the Equity Offerings,
prospective purchasers of Common Stock should not assume the unrestricted
availability of the Company's currently existing or future NOL carryforwards in
making their investment decisions.

ABSENCE OF PRIOR PUBLIC MARKET

Prior to the Equity Offerings, there has been no public market for the
Common Stock of the Company. The initial public offering price for the Common
Stock will be determined by negotiations among the Company and the
representatives of the Underwriters in accordance with the recommendation of
Salomon Brothers Inc, the 'qualified independent underwriter', as is required by
the by-laws of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the
'NASD'). Although the Company will apply to list the Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange, there can be no assurance that an active trading market
will develop or continue after the completion of the Equity Offerings or that
the market price of the Common Stock will not decline below the initial public
offering price. See 'Underwriters'.

SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE

All of the shares of Common Stock currently outstanding are 'restricted
securities' as defined by Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
'Securities Act'). Of such shares, shares will be eligible for sale
pursuant to Rule 144 following the completion of the Equity Offerings. In
addition, the Company, MSLEF II and SIBV have entered into a registration rights
agreement (the 'Registration Rights Agreement') providing that MSLEF II shall
have certain rights to have the shares of Common Stock owned by the MSLEF II
Group after the Equity Offerings registered by the Company under the Securities
Act in order to permit the public sale of such shares. The Stockholders
Agreement also grants SIBV certain rights, including rights of first refusal, to
purchase shares held by the MSLEF II Group. The intention of the MSLEF II
Associated Entities is to dispose of the shares of Common Stock owned by them.
The timing of such sales or other dispositions by them (which could include
distributions to the partners of MSLEF II) will depend on market and other
conditions, but could occur or commence relatively soon after the 180 day hold
back period. See ' -- Control by Principal Stockholders'. Such dispositions
could be privately negotiated transactions or, subject to SIBV's rights of first
refusal if applicable, public sales. Sales or dispositions of shares of Common
Stock by MSLEF II to persons including its limited partners, other than SIBV or
its affiliates, could increase the likelihood of a 'Change of Control' being
deemed to have occurred under the indentures relating to the Company's
Subordinated Debt, 1993 Notes and Senior Notes; however, so long as MSLEF II,
SIBV and their affiliates own more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding voting
stock of the Company, no such Change of Control will be deemed to have occurred
by reason of any other person's or group's ownership of the Company's voting
stock. See 'Description of Certain Indebtedness'. The Company

16

<PAGE>
and certain stockholders of the Company (including SIBV and the MSLEF II
Associated Entities) who beneficially own an aggregate of shares of
Common Stock have agreed, however, subject to limited exceptions, that they will
not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of Common
Stock for a period of 180 days after the date of this Prospectus without the
prior written consent of MS&Co. (except with respect to shares of Common Stock
held by the MSLEF II Associated Entities, for which the prior written consent of
Kidder, Peabody & Co. Incorporated ('Kidder, Peabody'), a representative of the
U.S. Underwriters, will be required). See 'Underwriters'.

No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of
Common Stock, or the availability of Common Stock for future sale, will have on
the market price of the Common Stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of
substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that
such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the
Common Stock or the ability of the Company to raise capital through a public
offering of its equity securities. See 'Shares Eligible for Future Sale'.

DILUTION

The purchasers of the Common Stock offered hereby will suffer an immediate
and substantial dilution of $ in pro forma net tangible book value per
share of the Common Stock from the initial public offering price. See
'Dilution'.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS

The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain
several provisions which may discourage or make more difficult any attempt by a
person or group to obtain control of the Company, including provisions
authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval,
restricting the persons who may call a special meeting of shareholders,
requiring notice of shareholder nominations for directors and shareholder
proposals at meetings and prohibiting shareholder action by written consent.
Although such provisions do not have substantial practical significance to
investors while SIBV and the MSLEF II Associated Entities control the Company,
such provisions could become significant if each of SIBV and the MSLEF II
Associated Entities reduces its respective ownership interest in the Company
such that they no longer control it. See 'Description of Capital
Stock -- Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.'

RECAPITALIZATION PLAN

The Company is implementing the Recapitalization Plan to refinance a
substantial portion of its indebtedness in order to improve operating and
financial flexibility by reducing the level and overall cost of its debt,
extending maturities of indebtedness, increasing stockholders' equity and
increasing its access to capital markets. As described below, the
Recapitalization Plan includes the following primary components in addition to
others described below: (i) the Equity Offerings, (ii) the SIBV Investment,
(iii) the Debt Offerings, (iv) the Bank Debt Refinancing and (v) the
Subordinated Debt Refinancing, which is anticipated to occur on approximately
December 1, 1994.

For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Recapitalization Plan would, on a
pro forma basis for such year, have resulted in $68.7 million of aggregate
savings in interest expense, of which $53.8 million represents cash interest
expense savings (in each case on a pre-tax basis). See 'Pro Forma Financial
Data'.

SOURCES AND USES

The following table sets forth the sources and uses of funds to be used to
effect the Recapitalization Plan:

(a) Assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share of Common
Stock (which is equal to the midpoint of the range of the anticipated high
and low per share offering prices set forth on the cover) and, in the case
of the Offerings, without deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and expenses.

(b) The maximum amount available under such facility will be $450 million, with
up to $150 million of such amount being available for letters of credit. It
is anticipated that immediately following the Offerings letters of credit
of approximately $90 million will be outstanding under such facility. See
also (c) below.

(c) Represents the outstanding principal amount and redemption premiums
required to be paid on such securities. Aggregate redemption premiums for
the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Debentures are estimated
to be $24 million and $21 million, respectively. The Company expects that
accrued and unpaid interest at June 1 and December 1, 1994 on the Senior
Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Debentures will be paid through
internal cash flow or with additional borrowings under the New Revolving
Credit Facility.

(d) Represents the estimated accreted value of the Junior Accrual Debentures as
of December 1, 1994.

(e) Expenses include underwriting discounts and commissions relating to the
Equity Offerings and the Debt Offerings, respectively. There are no
underwriting discounts or commissions on the sale of Common Stock pursuant
to the SIBV Investment.

(f) If the U.S. Underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, cash
will be increased by an additional $ million.

The aggregate amount of proceeds, net of estimated expenses, necessary
immediately following the Offerings to consummate the Recapitalization Plan
(excluding the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) is

18

<PAGE>
approximately $1,120 million. The sources of funds for such amount are set forth
in the above table. Prior to consummation of the Offerings, however, the Company
may determine to change the size of the various components of the
Recapitalization Plan and, accordingly, among other things may change the size
of the Debt Offerings and/or the Equity Offerings which could, in turn, affect
the size of the Initial Term Loan and/or the Delayed Term Loan. If the Company
and its lenders determine to decrease the amount of the Delayed Term Loan, with
a corresponding increase in the Initial Term Loan, or, if for any other reason,
any of the proceeds to be used to effect the Subordinated Debt Refinancing are
provided by any of the sources of funds set forth above other than the Delayed
Term Loan, the Company intends to invest the proceeds so received and which are
to be so used in short term investments until such proceeds are used to acquire
Subordinated Debt (pursuant to the Subordinated Debt Refinancing or in privately
negotiated or open market purchases) or until the abandonment of the
Subordinated Debt Refinancing.

EQUITY OFFERINGS

Concurrently with the Debt Offerings, the Company is offering hereby
shares of Common Stock initially in the United States and Canada (the 'U.S.
Equity Offering') and shares of Common Stock initially outside the
United States and Canada (the 'International Equity Offering'). The closings of
the Equity Offerings and the Debt Offerings are conditioned on one another as
well as on the substantially concurrent consummation of the other components of
the Recapitalization Plan (other than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) and on
the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions contained in the respective
underwriting agreements related thereto.

SALE OF STOCK TO SIBV

SIBV has agreed to purchase, or to cause a corporate affiliate to purchase,
from the Company pursuant to the SIBV Investment shares of Common
Stock covered by the Registration Statement, of which this Prospectus is a part,
for an aggregate purchase price of $100 million. The shares to be purchased by
SIBV are not part of the shares of Common Stock offered for sale pursuant to
this Prospectus. Such purchase by SIBV is conditioned on the substantially
concurrent consummation of the Offerings and the other components of the
Recapitalization Plan (other than Subordinated Debt Refinancing) and the
satisfaction of certain other closing conditions contained in the purchase
agreement related thereto. Following the consummation of the Equity Offerings
and the SIBV Investment, SIBV, indirectly through its subsidiaries, will
beneficially own % of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. See 'Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners'.

DEBT OFFERINGS

Concurrently with the Equity Offerings, CCA is offering Senior Notes in the
Debt Offerings. The closings of the Equity Offerings and the Debt Offerings are
conditioned on one another as well as on the substantially concurrent
consummation of the other components of the Recapitalization Plan (other than
the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) and on the satisfaction of certain other
closing conditions contained in the respective underwriting agreements related
thereto.

The Senior Notes will be general unsecured obligations of CCA, initially
guaranteed by JSC, and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all other
senior indebtedness of CCA. For a description of certain terms of the Senior
Notes see 'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Senior Notes'.

BANK DEBT REFINANCING

As part of the Recapitalization Plan, CCA and JSC will enter into the New
Credit Agreement. Substantially concurrently with the consummation of the
Offerings, CCA will use borrowings under the Initial Term Loan pursuant to the
New Credit Agreement and net proceeds of the Offerings and the SIBV Investment
contributed to it by the Company, to refinance its indebtedness outstanding
under the Old Bank Facilities and Secured Notes. See 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness -- Terms of New Credit Agreement'.

<PAGE>
RECLASSIFICATION AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

The capital stock of the Company currently consists of four classes of
outstanding common stock (Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D) and a fifth
class of common stock (Class E) reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
outstanding options. Currently, the only outstanding shares of voting stock of
the Company are the shares of Class A common stock (all outstanding shares of
which are indirectly owned by SIBV) and Class B common stock (all outstanding
shares of which are owned by MSLEF II). Immediately prior to the consummation of
the Equity Offerings, the Reclassification will occur, pursuant to which the
Company's five classes of common stock will be converted into one class, on a
basis of ten shares of Common Stock for each share of stock outstanding of each
of the old classes. Following the Reclassification, the Company's only class of
common stock will be the Common Stock, shares of which will be
outstanding immediately prior to the Equity Offerings and the SIBV Investment.
See 'Description of Capital Stock'. The Company intends prior to or
substantially concurrently with the Offerings, to cause CCA Enterprises, Inc. a
wholly-owned subsidiary of CCA, to become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
JSC and then, to merge it and JSC Enterprises, Inc., also a wholly-owned
subsidiary of JSC, into JSC. This will result in the cancellation of the
intercompany notes held by such entities which are their only assets. The
Company also intends to interpose a wholly-owned subsidiary between it and JSC
which would own all of the capital stock of JSC. See 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness -- Substitution Transaction'.

STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT; CHARTER AND BY-LAW AMENDMENTS

Since the 1989 Transaction, the Company, JSC and CCA have been operated
pursuant to the terms of an organization agreement (the 'Organization
Agreement'), which, among other things, provides for the election of directors,
the selection of officers and the day-to-day management of the Company. Pursuant
to the terms of the Organization Agreement and as part of the Recapitalization
Plan, (i) the Organization Agreement will terminate upon the closing of the
Equity Offerings and, at or prior to such closing, the Stockholders Agreement
shall be entered into by SIBV, MSLEF II and the Company and (ii) the
certificates of incorporation and by-laws of each of the Company, JSC and CCA
will, at or prior to the closing of the Offerings, be amended. See ' Description
of Capital Stock'. See 'Management -- Directors', 'Management -- Provisions of
Stockholders Agreement Pertaining to Management' and 'Certain
Transactions -- Stockholders Agreement' for a description of the Stockholders
Agreement. In addition, a prior commitment, subject to certain conditions, of
SIBV to purchase subordinated debt of CCA guaranteed by JSC in order to fund
purchases by CCA of its Subordinated Debt, will be terminated upon consummation
of the Offerings. See 'Certain Transactions -- Other Transactions'.

SUBORDINATED DEBT REFINANCING

On approximately December 1, 1994, the Company intends to cause CCA to use
borrowings under the Delayed Term Loan to effect the Subordinated Debt
Refinancing, which consists of the redemption of the Senior Subordinated Notes,
the Subordinated Debentures and the Junior Accrual Debentures (and, to the
extent necessary, to use borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility to
pay accrued but unpaid interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes and the
Subordinated Debentures). The earliest date such securities may be redeemed is
December 1, 1994. The Company reserves the right, however, to acquire the
Subordinated Debt in open market or privately negotiated transactions prior to
such date. Such acquisitions of Subordinated Debt are expected to be financed
with borrowings under the New Credit Agreement, subject to the limitation that
the indentures governing each of the classes of the Subordinated Debt prohibit
borrowings under the New Credit Agreement to be used to acquire Subordinated
Debt junior to such class. See 'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Terms of
New Credit Agreement' and ' -- Terms of Subordinated Debt'. This is likely to
result in only Senior Subordinated Notes being acquired prior to December 1,
1994. The amount of Subordinated Debt so acquired, if any, will depend on market
conditions and availability of such securities at acceptable prices. The Company
and CCA also reserve the right to determine not to consummate the Subordinated
Debt Refinancing for any reason, even if they are able to do so.

Borrowings under the Delayed Term Loan, which are necessary to effect the
Subordinated Debt Refinancing, will be subject to the following and only the
following conditions: (a) no order, judgment

20

<PAGE>
or decree shall purport to enjoin or restrain (x) borrowings under the Delayed
Term Loan or (y) CCA from redeeming the Subordinated Debt, (b) certain events of
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to the Company, JSC or CCA
shall not have occurred, (c) there shall not have occurred and be continuing a
payment default under the New Credit Agreement, the 1993 Notes, the Senior Notes
or under any subordinated debt (in each case, other than under the New Credit
Agreement, after the expiration of any applicable grace period), (d) the lenders
under the New Credit Agreement shall not have accelerated all or any of the
loans under the New Credit Agreement, (e) there shall not have occurred and be
continuing any event of default under the New Credit Agreement relating to
cross-acceleration of certain other debt and (f) in the event of any borrowing
under the Delayed Term Loan prior to December 15, 1994, the Subordinated Debt
repurchased with the proceeds thereof shall have been repurchased pursuant to
open-market or negotiated transactions for a price not in excess of 113% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated Debt to be so repurchased.

CONSENTS AND WAIVERS

As described below, the Company must obtain the Consents and Waivers under,
among other things, the 1993 Notes, the Secured Notes and the Securitization in
order to consummate the Recapitalization Plan. The Company expects that, prior
to entering into the Underwriting Agreement, it shall have obtained the Consents
and Waivers.

1993 Notes. The terms of the 1993 Notes prohibit the Subordinated Debt
Refinancing because the indebtedness incurred to effect such refinancing would
be unsubordinated secured debt under the New Credit Agreement. The Company,
however, intends to solicit the consent of the holders of the 1993 Notes to
amend the related indenture (the '1993 Note Indenture'), among other things, in
order to allow the Subordinated Debt Refinancing to be consummated without any
violation thereof (the 'Proposed 1993 Note Amendment'). In connection with such
solicitation, the Company will make certain consent payments, in cash, for each
$1,000 principal amount of such securities for which consents have been validly
tendered (and not revoked) on or before the date a supplemental indenture has
been executed. The Company's obligation to make the consent payments with
respect to the 1993 Notes is subject to the terms of the solicitation and is
conditioned on the execution of a supplemental indenture.

Pursuant to the Proposed 1993 Note Amendment (i) the covenant contained in
the 1993 Note Indenture which limits debt incurrence by JSC and CCA would be
modified to allow the Company, JSC or CCA to refinance the existing Subordinated
Debt (or any portion thereof) with indebtedness for borrowed money or with an
exchange for indebtedness of any such company, so long as, at or prior to the
time such indebtedness is incurred but in no event later than April 30, 1995,
the Company, JSC or CCA shall have consummated one or more public or private
sales of its capital stock and applied not less than $ million of the
proceeds therefrom to the repayment of indebtedness of JSC or CCA which is not
by its terms expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 1993 Notes, (ii)
the covenant contained in the 1993 Note Indenture which limits certain payments
by JSC and CCA would be modified to allow, following an initial public offering
of any of the capital stock of the Company, JSC or CCA, the payment of annual
dividends on each share of such capital stock (or on the capital stock of JSC
and CCA as may be necessary to enable the Company or JSC, as the case may be, to
pay such dividends on each share of such capital stock), up to 6% of the per
share initial public offering price in such offering, (iii) certain technical
amendments would be made to the 1993 Note Indenture to clarify the circumstances
under which wholly-owned subsidiaries would be permitted to merge into JSC or
CCA, (iv) the definition of 'change of control' would be amended to delete
therefrom a change in a majority of the outstanding directors and (v) the
Substitution Transaction (as defined under 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness -- Substitution Transaction') would be permitted to occur.

The 1993 Note Indenture requires a majority in principal amount of the
holders of the 1993 Notes to consent to the adoption of the Proposed 1993 Note
Amendment.

Secured Notes. Under the terms of the Secured Notes, the Bank Debt
Refinancing (which involves a prepayment of the Secured Notes) would require
that the holders of the Secured Notes be given a 30 day notice of prepayment.
The Company intends to request that the holders of the Secured Notes waive such
30 day notice of prepayment. Such waiver requires the consent of the holders of
60% of the holders of the outstanding principal amount of Secured Notes.

21

<PAGE>
Securitization. In 1991, JSC and CCA entered into the Securitization. The
Securitization involved the sale of JSC's and CCA's trade receivables (the
'Receivables') to Jefferson Smurfit Finance Corporation ('JSFC'), a special
purpose subsidiary of JSC. Under the Securitization, JSFC currently has
borrowings of $182.3 million outstanding at December 31, 1993 from Emerald
Funding Corporation ('EFC'), a third-party owned corporation not affiliated with
JSC, and has pledged its interest in such Receivables to EFC. EFC issued
commercial paper notes ('CP Notes') and term notes ('Term Notes'). EFC also
entered into a liquidity facility with a group of banks, for whom Dresdner Bank
AG acted as agent (the 'Liquidity Banks'), and a subordinated loan agreement
with Bank Brussels Lambert (the 'Subordinated Lender') to provide additional
sources of funding. EFC pledged its interest in the Receivables assigned to it
by JSFC to secure EFC's obligations to the Liquidity Banks, the Subordinated
Lender, and the holders of the CP Notes and the Term Notes.

Under the terms of the Master Agreement relating to the Securitization, the
completion of the Equity Offerings would result in the occurrence of a
'Liquidation Event' because JS Group and its affiliates would cease to own or
control at least 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company entitled to vote for the election of members of the Company's Board
of Directors. In addition, the consummation of a merger of JSC into CCA (see
'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Substitution Transaction') would
constitute a 'Liquidation Event.' The effect of the occurrence of a Liquidation
Event which is not waived is that collections on receivables are no longer
applied to purchase new receivables, but are used to pay down the amount of
outstanding debt owed to the Liquidity Banks, the Subordinated Lender and the
holders of the CP Notes and the Term Notes.

JSC intends to solicit the consents necessary to amend the Securitization
documents to amend the definition of 'Liquidation Event' so that the
consummation of the Equity Offerings and of a subsequent merger of JSC into CCA
will not result in the occurrence of a Liquidation Event.

Such proposed Securitization amendment requires the unanimous consent of
all of the Liquidity Banks, the Subordinated Lender and all of the holders of
the Term Notes.

Other. The consent of The Times Mirror Company is required under the
shareholders agreement between JSC and The Times Mirror Company in order to
consummate the Recapitalization Plan.

CERTAIN CONDITIONS

All of the transactions contemplated by the Recapitalization Plan (other
than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) are expected to occur contemporaneously.
Consummation of the Equity Offerings is conditioned on the substantially
concurrent consummation of the other components of the Recapitalization Plan
(other than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing), including, among other things,
consummation of (i) the SIBV Investment, (ii) the Debt Offerings and (iii) the
Bank Debt Refinancing. In addition, consummation of the Equity Offerings is
conditioned on obtaining the Consents and Waivers and the execution of (i) a
supplemental indenture providing for the Proposed 1993 Note Amendment, (ii) a
waiver to the Secured Note Purchase Agreement and (iii) an amendment to the
Securitization documents.

USE OF PROCEEDS

The net proceeds to the Company (after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions) from the sale of shares of Common Stock in the Equity
Offerings (at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share of,
the midpoint of the range of the anticipated high and low public offering prices
per share set forth on the cover) are estimated to be $ million ($ million
if the U.S. Underwriters' overallotment option is exercised in full). The
proceeds to the Company from the sale of shares of Common Stock to SIBV (or a
corporate affiliate) pursuant to the SIBV Investment will be $100 million. The
net proceeds to the Company (after deducting estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions) from the sale of Senior Notes in the Debt Offerings are
estimated to be million.

The Company intends to use all of such net proceeds, together with
borrowings under the New Credit Agreement, to pay in full all amounts under the
1989 and 1992 Credit Agreements and the Secured Notes. Specifically, the Company
will repay $196.5 million outstanding at December 31, 1993 under the revolving
credit facility under the 1989 Credit Agreement (the 'Revolving Credit
Facility'),

which bears interest at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (as defined therein) plus
2.25; $412.3 million of term loan indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 1993
under the 1989 Credit Agreement, which bears interest at the Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate (as defined therein) plus 2.25% (the weighted average rate at December 31,
1993 on outstanding 1989 Credit Agreement borrowings was 5.95%); $201.3 million
of term loan indebtedness at December 31, 1993 under the 1992 Credit Agreement,
which bears interest at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (as defined therein) plus
3.00% (6.375% at December 31, 1993); and $270.5 million of Secured Notes at
December 31, 1993 bearing interest at the three-month Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
(as defined therein) plus 2.75% (6.25% at December 31, 1993). The Company has
interest rate swaps and other hedging agreements with commercial banks which
effectively fix (for remaining periods of up to 3 years) the Company's interest
rate on $215 million of such variable rate borrowings at average all-in rates of
approximately 9.10%. The Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to terminate on
December 14, 1995, the term loan indebtedness under the 1989 and 1992 Credit
Agreements is scheduled to mature on December 31, 1997 and the Secured Notes are
scheduled to mature on December 1, 1998.

If the U.S. Underwriters' overallotment option is exercised, proceeds from
the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto will be used by the Company
for general corporate purposes. See 'Underwriters'.

The Company may enter into floating rate interest rate swap agreements with
respect to some or all of its obligations under the Senior Notes and, if it does
so, will be sensitive to prevailing interest rates for the term of such
agreements, which may range from one year to the maturity of the Senior Notes.

DIVIDEND POLICY

The Company has not paid cash dividends on any class of its capital stock
and does not intend to pay dividends on its Common Stock in the foreseeable
future. As a holding company, the Company's ability to pay dividends is
dependent on the receipt of dividends or other payments from JSC and CCA. The
payment of dividends by JSC and CCA is subject to certain restrictions under the
terms of certain outstanding indebtedness and Delaware law. Following the
consummation of the Offerings, the 1993 Notes and the Senior Notes will allow
each of JSC and CCA to pay dividends such that the Company would be able, and
permitted thereunder, to pay aggregate annual dividends of not more than $ on
all outstanding shares of its Common Stock. However, the New Credit Agreement
and, unless and until the Subordinated Debt Refinancing is consummated, the
indentures governing the Subordinated Debt, will prohibit the payment of any
dividends by JSC or CCA and, accordingly, by the Company for the foreseeable
future. Delaware law generally requires that dividends are payable only out of a
company's surplus or current net profits in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of Delaware. Such Delaware law limitations apply to the payment
of dividends by the Company as well as JSC and CCA. Any determination to pay
cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the Company's Board of
Directors and will be dependent upon the Company's results of operations,
financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant
at the time by the Board of Directors.

DILUTION

The deficit in net tangible book value of the Company as of December 31,
1993, after giving effect to the Reclassification, was $ million or $ per
share of Common Stock. Net tangible book value per share represents the amount
of total net tangible assets of the Company (total assets, excluding intangible
assets, less total liabilities) divided by the total number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding. After giving effect to the sale by the Company of (i)
shares of Common Stock offered hereby (at an assumed initial public
offering price of $ per share (the midpoint of the range of the anticipated
high and low public offering prices per share set forth on the cover) and after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses) and (ii) shares of Common Stock to SIBV (or a
corporate affiliate) (assuming an initial public offering price as set forth
above) pursuant to the SIBV Investment the pro forma deficit in net tangible
book value of the Company as of December 31, 1993 would have been $ million or
$ per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible
book value per share of $ to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution
of $ per share to new investors. The following table illustrates this per
share dilution:

(a) Until the Subordinated Debt Refinancing occurs, or if it does not occur,
and assuming no open market or privately negotiated purchases of
Subordinated Debt prior to the Subordinated Debt Refinancing (see
'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Terms of New Credit
Agreement -- The New Bank Facilities'), the Senior Subordinated Notes, the
Subordinated Debentures and the Junior Accrual Debentures will remain
outstanding and no borrowings will be made under the Delayed Term Loan.

(b) For further information about the New Revolving Credit Facility, the
Initial Term Loan and the Delayed Term Loan see 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness -- Terms of New Credit Agreement'.

(c) Represents funds utilized under such revolving credit facilities. The
maximum amount available under each of the New Revolving Credit Facility
(including the amount anticipated to be drawn down upon consummation of the
Recapitalization Plan) and the Revolving Credit Facility is $450 million
(with up to $150 million of such amount being available for letters of
credit) and $400 million (with up to $125 million of such amount being
available for letters of credit), respectively. It is anticipated that
immediately following the Offerings letters of credit of approximately $90
million will be outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility. The
Company expects that accrued and unpaid interest at June 1 and December 1,
1994 on the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Debentures will
be paid through internal cash flow or with additional borrowings under the
New Revolving Credit Facility.

(d) For further information about the 1993 Notes, see 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness -- Terms of 1993 Notes'.

(e) For further information about the Senior Notes, see 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness -- Terms of Senior Notes'.

(f) For further information about the Subordinated Debt, see 'Description of
Certain Indebtedness -- Terms of Subordinated Debt'.

(g) The Junior Accrual Debentures accrete in value at the rate of 15 1/2%
compounded semi-annually. The aggregate accreted value, including accrued
interest, of the Junior Accrual Debentures was approximately $129.7 at
December 31, 1993 and will be approximately $148.7 million at December 1,
1994.

(h) The change in retained earnings (deficit) as a result of the
Recapitalization Plan represents $55.7 million of after-tax cost related to
the extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt. The extraordinary
loss on a pre-tax basis includes a $35.3 million write-off of existing
deferred debt issuance costs, $44.6 million of call premiums, and a $5.9
million adjustment to reflect the result of marking-to-market the interest
rate swaps related to the long-term debt to be repaid with borrowings under
the New Credit Agreement and net proceeds of the Offerings and the SIBV
Investment. See 'Pro Forma Financial Data'.

statement of operations. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance
sheet was prepared as if the Recapitalization Plan (excluding the Subordinated
Debt Refinancing) and the Recapitalization Plan (including the Subordinated Debt
Refinancing) occurred as of December 31, 1993.

The pro forma financial data set forth below in giving effect to the
Recapitalization Plan assumes an initial public offering price of $ per
share, the midpoint of the range of the anticipated high and low public offering
prices per share set forth on the cover, for the Equity Offerings and the SIBV
Investment.

The estimated transaction fees and expenses included in the following pro
forma financial data are provided solely for purposes of presenting the pro
forma financial data set forth below. The actual transaction fees and expenses
may differ from the assumptions set forth below.

The pro forma financial data are provided for informational purposes only
and do not purport to be indicative of the Company's financial position or
results which would actually have been obtained had such transactions been
completed as of the date or for the periods presented, or which may be obtained
in the future.

(1) Represents the actual interest expense incurred, amortization of related
deferred debt issuance costs, and cash payments and the mark-to-market
adjustment of the related interest rate swap agreements during the year
ended December 31, 1993 on indebtedness assumed to be retired in the
refinancing of the term loan indebtedness under the 1989 Credit Agreement in
connection with the 1993 Notes. The pro forma condensed consolidated
statement of operations assumes that the interest rate swap agreements on
debt assumed to be retired were marked-to-market as of the beginning of the
period presented. The loss associated with marking these agreements to
market was treated as an extraordinary charge and therefore does not appear
in the pro forma statements of operations. See Note (c) to the pro forma
condensed consolidated statement of operations.

(2) Interest expense on the Initial Term Loan is at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (as
defined below) plus 3.0%. Assumes the Debt Offerings are swapped to a
floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.77% (average rate of approximately
6.98% for the year ended December 31, 1993). A change in the Adjusted LIBOR
Rate of .25% would change interest expense on the Debt Offerings by
approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1993.

(3) Represents the actual interest expense incurred, amortization of related
deferred debt issuance costs, and cash payments under swap agreements during
the year ended December 31, 1993 on indebtedness assumed to be repaid with
the proceeds from the Equity Offerings, Debt Offerings and the Initial Term
Loan. Assumes that the interest rate swap agreements on debt assumed to be
repaid were marked-to-market as of the beginning of the period presented.
The loss associated with marking these agreements to market was treated as
an extraordinary charge and therefore does not appear in the pro forma

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the selected historical financial data and the historical consolidated financial
statements of the Company. Except as otherwise indicated, the following
discussion relates solely to historical results and does not consider the
potential impact from the Recapitalization Plan.

GENERAL

INDUSTRY CONDITIONS

Sales of containerboard and corrugated shipping containers, two of the
Company's most important products, are generally subject to changes in industry
capacity and cyclical changes in the economy, both of which can significantly
impact selling prices and the Company's profitability. Operating rates in the
industry during 1991 and 1992 were at high levels relative to demand, which was
lower due to the sluggish U.S. economy and a decline in export markets. This
imbalance resulted in excess inventories in the industry and lower prices for
the Company's containerboard and corrugated shipping container products, which
began early in 1991 and has continued throughout 1992 and most of 1993. From the
first quarter of 1991 through the third quarter of 1993 industry linerboard
prices fell from $347 per ton to $295 per ton. During 1993, industry operating
rates were lower as many containerboard producers, including the Company, took
downtime at containerboard mills to reduce the excess inventories. By the end of
the third quarter of 1993, inventory levels had decreased significantly. The
lower level of inventories and the stronger U.S. economy provided improved
market conditions late in 1993, enabling the Company and other producers to
implement a $25 per ton price increase for containerboard. A further linerboard
increase of $30 per ton has been announced by all major integrated
containerboard producers, including the Company, for March 1, 1994.

Newsprint prices have fallen substantially since 1990 due to supply and
demand imbalances. During 1991 and 1992, new capacity of approximately two
million tons annually came on line, representing an approximate 12% increase in
supply. At the same time, U.S. consumption of newsprint fell, due to declines in
readership and ad linage. As prices fell, certain high cost, virgin paper
machines, primarily in Canada, representing approximately 1.2 million tons of
annual production capacity, were shut down and remained idle during 1993. While
supply was diminished, a price increase announced for 1993 was unsuccessful.
Although market demand has improved in the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company
does not expect significant improvement in prices before the second quarter of
1994.

In addition, prices for many of the Company's other products, including
solid bleached sulfate, recycled boxboard, folding cartons and reclaimed fibre
weakened in 1993 and 1992. While the effect of the reclaimed fibre price
decreases is unfavorable to the reclamation products division, it is favorable
to the Company overall because of the reduction in fibre cost to the Company's
paper mills that use reclaimed fibre. The Company has taken various steps to
extend its business into less cyclical product lines, such as industrial
packaging and consumer packaging.

As a result of these industry conditions, the Company's gross margin
declined from 18.1% in 1991 to 16.6% in 1992 and 12.7% in 1993.

The Company's sales and profitability have historically been more sensitive
to price changes than changes in volume. There can be no assurance that
announced price increases for the Company's products can be implemented, or that
prices for the Company's products will not decline from current levels.

COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES

The recent cyclical downturn in the Paperboard/Packaging Products segment
has led management to undertake several major cost reduction initiatives. In
1991, the Company implemented an austerity program to freeze staff levels, defer
certain discretionary spending programs and more aggressively manage capital
expenditures and working capital in order to conserve cash and reduce interest
expense. While these measures successfully reduced expenses and increased cash
flow, the length and extent of

32

<PAGE>
the industry downturn led the Company, in 1993, to initiate a new six year plan
to reduce costs, increase volume and improve product mix (the 'Plan').

The Plan is a systematic Company-wide effort designed to improve the cost
competitiveness of all the Company's operating facilities and staff functions.
In addition to increases in volume and improvements in product mix resulting
from a focus on less commodity oriented business at its converting operations,
the program will focus on opportunities to reduce costs and other measures,
including (i) productivity improvements, (ii) capital projects which provide
high returns and quick paybacks, (iii) reductions in fibre cost, (iv) reductions
in the purchase cost of materials, (v) reductions in personnel costs and (vi)
reductions in waste cost. See 'Business -- Business Strategy'.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

In September 1993, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $150 million to
implement a restructuring program (the 'Restructuring Program') designed to
improve the Company's long-term competitive position and to provide for various
environmental and other matters. The charge consists of approximately $96
million related to the restructuring program and approximately $54 million of
other charges related primarily to environmental matters. The restructuring
component of the charge includes a provision for direct expenses associated with
plant closures, reductions in workforce, and realignment and consolidation of
various manufacturing operations over an approximate two to three year period.
The restructuring program is expected to reduce production cost, employee
expense and depreciation charges. As part of the Restructuring Program, the
Company closed certain high cost operating facilities, including a coated
recycled boxboard mill and five converting plants, in January 1994. While future
benefits of the Restructuring Program are uncertain, the operating losses in
1993 for the plants shut down in January 1994 and those contemplated in the
future were $31 million. While the Company believes that it would have realized
financial benefits in 1993 had these plants been shut down at the beginning of
the year, and that it will realize such benefits in future periods, no
assurances can be given in this regard and, in particular, no assurances can be
given as to what portion of such loss would not have been realized in 1993 had
such plants been shut down for the entire year.

Approximately $39 million in other charges consists of a provision for
environmental and legal matters which primarily represent remediation and other
clean-up costs related to plant closures, existing facilities, and former
operating sites. These estimates mainly include clean-up costs for contamination
at certain Company-owned properties, and to a lesser extent, probable expenses
for response costs at various sites where the Company has received notice that
it is a potentially responsible party ('PRP'). As discussed under 'Risk
Factors -- Environmental Matters' and 'Business -- Environmental Matters', the
Company, as well as other companies in the industry, faces potential
environmental liability related to various sites at which wastes have allegedly
been deposited. The Company has received notice that it is or may be a PRP at a
number of federal and state sites (the 'Sites') where remedial action may be
required. Because the laws that govern the clean up of waste disposal sites have
been construed to authorize joint and several liability, government agencies or
other parties could seek to recover all response costs for any Site from any one
of the PRPs for such Site, including the Company, despite the involvement of
other PRPs. Although the Company is unable to estimate the aggregate response
costs in connection with the remediation of all Sites, if the Company were held
jointly and severally liable for all response costs at some or all of the Sites,
it would have a material adverse effect on financial condition of the Company.
However, joint and several liability generally has not in the past been imposed
on PRPs, and, based on such past practice, the Company's past experience and the
financial conditions of other PRPs with respect to the Sites, the Company does
not expect to be held jointly and severally liable for all response costs at any
Site. Liability at waste disposal sites is typically shared with other PRPs and
costs generally are allocated according to relative volumes of waste deposited.
At most Sites, the waste attributed to the Company is a very small portion of
the total waste deposited at the Site (generally significantly less than 1%).
There are approximately ten Sites where final settlement has not been reached
and where the Company's potential liability is expected to exceed de minimis
levels. Accordingly, the Company believes that its estimated total probable
liability for response costs at the Sites was adequately reserved at December
31, 1993. Further, the estimate takes into consideration the number of other
PRPs at each site, the identity, and financial

33

<PAGE>
position of such parties, in light of the joint and several nature of the
liability, but does not take into account possible insurance coverage or other
similar reimbursement.

The $150 million charge in connection with the Restructuring Program and
various environmental and other matters consists of approximately $43 million
for the write-down of assets at closed facilities and certain other
nonproductive assets and $107 million of probable future cash expenditures. The
Company anticipates that the cash expenditures will be funded through operations
and that a substantial portion related to the Restructuring Program will be paid
in 1994, 1995 and 1996.

1993 COMPARED TO 1992

The Company's net sales for 1993 decreased 1.7% to $2.95 billion compared
to $3.0 billion in 1992. Net sales decreased 1.9% in the Paperboard/Packaging
Products segment and increased 0.3% in the Newsprint segment.

The decrease in Paperboard/Packaging Products segment sales for 1993 was
due primarily to lower prices and changes in product mix for containerboard,
corrugated shipping containers and folding cartons. This decrease was partially
offset by an increase in sales volume primarily of corrugated shipping
containers, which set a record in 1993. A newly constructed corrugated container
facility and several minor acquisitions in 1992 caused net sales to increase
$34.9 million for 1993.

The net sales increase in the Newsprint segment was a result of an increase
in sales volume in 1993 compared to 1992, partially offset by a decline in sales
prices.

34

<PAGE>
Cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for 1993 and 1992 were 85.9%
and 81.9%, respectively, for the Paperboard/Packaging Products segment and
102.8% and 99.0%, respectively, for the Newsprint segment. The increase in cost
of goods sold as a percent of net sales for the Paperboard/Packaging Products
segment was due primarily to the aforementioned changes in pricing and product
mix. The increase in the cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for the
Newsprint segment was due primarily to the higher cost of energy and fibre and
decreases in sales price. The Company changed the estimated depreciable lives of
its paper machines and major converting equipment. These changes were made to
better reflect the estimated periods during which the assets will remain in
service and were based upon the Company's historical experience and comparable
industry practice. These changes were made effective January 1, 1993 and had the
effect of reducing depreciation expense by $17.8 million and decreasing the 1993
net loss by $11.0 million.

Selling and administrative expenses increased to $239.2 million (3.4%) for
1993 compared to $231.4 million for 1992. The increase was due primarily to
higher provisions for retirement costs, acquisitions, new facilities and other
costs.

In order to minimize significant year-to-year fluctuations in pension cost
caused by financial market volatility, the Company changed, effective January 1,
1993, the method of accounting for the recognition of fluctuations in the market
value of pension assets. The effect of this change on 1993 results of
operations, including the cumulative effect of prior years, was not material.
See Note 8 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The Company reduced its weighted average discount rate in measuring its
pension obligations from 8.75% to 7.6% and its rate of increase in compensation
levels from 5.5% to 4.0% at December 31, 1993. The net effect of changing these
assumptions was the primary reason for the increase in the projected benefit
obligations and the changes are expected to increase pension cost by
approximately $3.4 million in 1994.

As a result of the $150 million provision for restructuring and other
charges and the lower margins, primarily for newsprint and containerboard
products, the Company had a loss from operations of $14.7 million for 1993,
compared to $267.7 million income from operations for 1992.

Interest expense for 1993 declined $45.9 million due to lower effective
interest rates and the lower level of subordinated debt outstanding resulting
primarily from the 1992 Transaction (as defined below).

The benefit from income taxes for 1993 was $83.0 million compared to a tax
provision of $10.0 million in 1992. The significant difference in the income tax
provision from 1993 to 1992 results from the use of the liability method of
accounting which restored deferred income taxes and increased the related asset
values for tax effects previously recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount
of the related assets under prior business combinations. The Company's effective
tax rate for 1993 was lower than the Federal statutory tax rate due to the
nondeductibility of goodwill amortization and a $5.7 million provision to adjust
deferred tax assets and liabilities in 1993 due to the enacted Federal income
tax rate change from 34% to 35%.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ('SFAS') No. 109, 'Accounting for Income Taxes' and SFAS
No. 106, 'Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions'. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 was to increase net
income for 1993 by approximately $20.5 million. The cumulative effect of
adopting SFAS No. 106 was to decrease net income for 1993 by approximately $37
million. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 112 'Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits' in 1994, the effect of which is not expected to be
material.

The loss before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of accounting
changes for 1993 was $174.6 million, compared to $34.0 million for the
comparable period in 1992. The Company recorded an extraordinary loss of $37.8
million (net of income tax benefits of $25.8 million) for the early
extinguishment of debt associated with the issuance of the 1993 Notes.

35

<PAGE>
1992 COMPARED TO 1991

Net sales for 1992 increased to $3.0 billion (2.0%) compared to $2.94
billion in 1991. Net sales increased 3.7% in the Paperboard/Packaging Products
segment and decreased 13.6% in the Newsprint segment.

The increase in Paperboard/Packaging Products segment sales was due
primarily to a 5.6% increase in sales volume for corrugated shipping containers.
Segment sales were also positively affected by increases in sales volumes for
papertubes and partitions and to a lesser extent for folding cartons and
reclamation products. Prices of containerboard products improved over 1991 but
did not increase sufficiently to cover cost increases, causing margins to be
somewhat lower in 1992. Prices for most of the Company's other packaging
products have declined compared to 1991. A minor acquisition in 1992 and the
operation of new facilities in the Paperboard/Packaging Products segment
resulted in an increase in net sales of $9.8 million, while plant closings
caused net sales to decrease by $2.2 million.

The net sales decrease in the Newsprint segment was a result of the lower
sales prices as discussed above. Newsprint sales volume for 1992 was virtually
the same as 1991.

The Company continued to benefit from certain austerity measures first
implemented during 1991 to help offset the impact of the recession. These
measures had a positive effect on cost of goods sold and selling and
administrative expenses. Cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for 1992
and 1991 were 81.9% and 81.8% , respectively, for the Paperboard/Packaging
Products segment and 99.0% and 83.1% respectively, for the Newsprint segment.
The increase in the Newsprint segment was due primarily to the aforementioned
decrease in sales price.

Selling and administrative expense as a percent of net sales for 1992 was
7.7%, unchanged from 1991. The Company continues to benefit from certain cost
containment measures implemented in 1991 to reduce expenses to help offset the
impact of the recession and inflation.

Income from operations for 1992 decreased 12.4% to $267.7 million as a
result of the low average selling prices for newsprint and packaging products
discussed above.

Interest expense for 1992 was lower by $35.1 million, due to lower
effective interest rates and the lower level of debt outstanding as a result of
the 1992 Transaction. During 1992, the Company replaced $425.0 million of mature
swaps with $400.0 million of the new two-year fixed interest rate swaps at an
annual savings of approximately 3.8% on such amount (equivalent to an annual
savings of approximately $15.1 million).

The Company recorded a $10.0 million income tax provision in both 1992 and
1991 on income before income taxes, equity in earnings (loss) of affiliates and
extraordinary item of $27.2 and $24.3 million, respectively. The tax provisions
for 1992 and 1991 were higher than the Federal statutory tax rate due to several
factors, the most significant of which was the impact of permanent differences
from applying purchase accounting.

Equity in loss of affiliates for 1991 included a write-down of $36.0
million with respect to the Company's equity investments in Temboard and Company
Limited Partnership and PCL Industries Limited. See Note 3 to the Company's
consolidated financial statements. For 1992 the Company had an extraordinary
loss of $49.8 million (net of income tax benefits of $25.8 million) for the
early extinguishment of debt associated with the 1992 Transaction.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The Company uses the LIFO method of accounting for approximately 81% of its
inventories. Under this method, the cost of products sold reported in the
financial statements approximates current cost and thus reduces the distortion
in reported income due to increasing costs. In recent years, inflation has not
had a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the
Company.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's primary uses of cash for the next several years will be
principal and interest payments on its indebtedness and capital expenditures.

36

<PAGE>
In April 1993, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount
of the 1993 Notes. Proceeds of the 1993 Notes were used to refinance a
substantial portion of indebtedness in order to improve operating and financial
flexibility by extending maturities of indebtedness and improving liquidity. As
a result of the issuance of the 1993 Notes, there are no significant scheduled
payments due on bank term loans until June 1996 (assuming the Bank Debt
Refinancing is not consummated). In connection with the issuance of the 1993
Notes, a subsidiary of JS Group committed to purchase up to $200 million
aggregate principal amount of 11 1/2% Junior Subordinated Notes maturing 2005,
the proceeds of which must be used to repurchase or otherwise retire
Subordinated Debt. The Company does not intend to use the commitment if the
Recapitalization Plan occurs.

The Company is implementing the Recapitalization Plan to refinance a
substantial portion of its indebtedness in order to improve operating and
financial flexibility by (i) reducing the level and overall cost of debt, (ii)
extending maturities of indebtedness, (iii) increasing stockholders' equity and
(iv) increasing its access to capital markets. The Recapitalization Plan
includes (i) the offering by the Company of shares of Common Stock,
(ii) the SIBV Investment, (iii) the offering by CCA of $500 million aggregate
principal amount of % Series A Senior Notes, which will be due 2004 and $100
million aggregate principal amount of % Series B Senior Notes, which will be
due 2002, and (iv) the New Credit Agreement consisting of a $450 million New
Revolving Credit Facility due 2001, a $200 million Initial Term Loan due 2002
and an $850 million Delayed Term Loan due 2001. Proceeds of the Recapitalization
Plan, exclusive of the $850 million Delayed Term Loan, will be used to refinance
all of the Company's indebtedness under the 1989 and 1992 Credit Agreements and
the Secured Notes. The applications of borrowings under the Delayed Term Loan
shall be used to redeem or repurchase the Subordinated Debt. It is anticipated
that letters of credit of approximately $90 million will be outstanding under
the New Revolving Credit Facility immediately following the Offerings. After
giving effect to the Recapitalization Plan on a pro forma basis, at December 31,
1993 the Company would have had approximately $2,408.8 million of total
long-term debt outstanding, all of which would have been senior debt, as
compared to $2,619.1 million of long-term debt outstanding had the
Recapitalization Plan not been effected. After completion of the
Recapitalization Plan there will be no significant scheduled payments due on
bank debt (other than required payments out of 'excess cash', if any) until 18
months following consummation of the Offerings, at which time approximately
$51.0 million will be payable.

The Company's earnings are significantly affected by the amount of interest
on its indebtedness. At December 31, 1993, the Company had $215 million of
variable rate debt which had been swapped to a weighted average fixed rate of
approximately 9.1%. The Company also had interest rate swap agreements related
to the Securitization Program that effectively converted $95 million of fixed
rate borrowings to a variable rate of 5.6% (at December 31, 1993) and converted
$80 million of variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate of 7.2% through January
1996. In addition, the Company is party to interest rate swap agreements related
to the 1993 Notes which convert $500 million of fixed rate borrowings to a
variable rate of 8.6% (at December 31, 1993).

Capital expenditures consist of property and timberland additions and
acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were
$117.4 million, $97.9 million and $118.9 million, respectively. Financing
arrangements entered into in connection with the 1989 Transaction impose an
annual limit on future capital expenditures, as defined in the financing
arrangements, of approximately $125.0 million. The capital spending limit is
subject to increase in any year if the prior year's spending was less than the
maximum amount allowed. For 1993, such carryover from 1992 was $75 million.
Because the Company has invested heavily in its core businesses over the last
several years, management believes the annual limitation on capital expenditures
should not impair its plans for maintenance, expansion and continued
modernization of its facilities. It is expected that the New Credit Agreement
will contain limitations on capital expenditures substantially similar to those
contained in the financing arrangements entered into in connection with the 1989
Transaction. The Company anticipates making capital expenditures of
approximately $142 million in 1994.

Under the terms of the Old Bank Facilities, the Company is required to
comply with certain financial covenants, including maintenance of quarterly and
annual interest coverage ratios and earnings, as defined. In anticipation of
violating these financial covenants at September 30, 1993, the

37

<PAGE>
Company requested and received waivers from its lender group, and in December,
1993 amended the Old Bank Facilities to modify financial covenants. The Company
was in compliance with the amended covenants at December 31, 1993. The Company
expects to have similar covenants in the New Credit Agreement.

Operating activities have historically been the major source of cash for
the Company's working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt payments. For
1993 and 1992, net cash provided by operating activities was $78.2 million and
$145.7 million, respectively.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had $112.1 million in unused borrowing
capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. Following the Offerings, the
Company anticipates having $360.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under the
New Credit Agreement. The Company has borrowing capacity of $230.0 million under
the Securitization subject to the Company's level of eligible accounts
receivable. At December 31, 1993, the Company had borrowed $182.3 million under
the Securitization and the level of eligible receivables did not permit any
additional borrowings under the Securitization at the date. The Securitization
matures in April 1996, at which time the Company expects to refinance it.
Although the Company believes that it will be able to do so, no assurance can be
given in this regard.

The Company's existing indebtedness imposes restrictions on its ability to
incur additional indebtedness. Such restrictions, together with the highly
leveraged position of the Company, could restrict corporate activities,
including the Company's ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for
unanticipated capital expenditures or to take advantage of business
opportunities. However, the Company believes that cash provided by operations
and available financing sources will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash
requirements for the next several years.

BUSINESS

GENERAL

The predecessor to the Company was founded in 1974 when JS Group, a
worldwide leader in the packaging products industry, commenced operations in the
United States by acquiring 40% of a small paperboard and packaging products
company. The remaining 60% of that company was acquired by JS Group in 1977, and
in 1978 net sales were $42.9 million. The Company implemented a strategy to
build a fully integrated, broadly based, national packaging business, primarily
through acquisitions, including Alton Box Board Company in 1979, the paperboard
and packaging divisions of Diamond International Corporation in 1982, 80% of SNC
in 1986 and 50% of CCA in 1986. The Company financed its acquisitions by using
leverage and, in several cases, utilized joint venture financing whereby the
Company eventually obtained control of the acquired company. While no major
acquisition has been made since 1986, the Company has made 18 smaller
acquisitions and started up five new facilities which had combined sales in 1993
of $280.3 million. JSC was formed in 1983 to consolidate the operations of the
Company, and today the Company ranks among the industry leaders in its two
business segments, Paperboard/Packaging Products and Newsprint. In 1993, the
Company had net sales of $2.9 billion, achieving a compound annual sales growth
rate of 32.6% for the period since 1978.

The Company believes it is one of the nation's largest producers of
paperboard and packaging products and is the largest producer of recycled
paperboard and recycled packaging products. In 1993, the Company's system of 16
paperboard mills produced 1,840,000 tons of virgin and recycled containerboard,
829,000 tons of coated and uncoated recycled boxboard and SBS and 206,000 tons
of recycled cylinderboard, which were sold to the Company's own converting
operations or to third parties. The Company's converting operations consist of
52 corrugated container plants, 18 folding carton plants, and 16 industrial
packaging plants located across the country, with three plants located outside
the U.S. In 1993, the Company's container plants converted 1,942,000 tons of
containerboard, an amount equal to approximately 105.5% of the amount it
produced, its folding carton plants converted 542,000 tons of SBS, recycled
boxboard and coated natural kraft, an amount equal to approximately 65.4% of the
amount it produced, and its industrial packaging plants converted 123,000 tons
of recycled cylinderboard, an amount equal to approximately 59.7% of the amount
it produced.

The Company's paperboard operations are supported by its reclamation
division, which processed or brokered 3.9 million tons of wastepaper in 1993,
and by its timber division which manages approximately one million acres of
owned or leased timberland located in close proximity to its virgin fibre mills.
The paperboard/packaging products operations also include 14 consumer packaging
plants.

In addition, the Company believes it is one of the nation's largest
producers of recycled newsprint. The Company's newsprint division includes two
newsprint mills in Oregon, which produced 615,000 tons of recycled newsprint in
1993, and two facilities that produce Cladwood'r', a construction material
produced from newsprint and wood by-products. The Company's newsprint mills are
also supported by the Company's reclamation division.

DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

Since its founding in 1974, the Company has followed a strategy to build a
broadly based packaging business, primarily through acquisitions. The Company's
acquisitions were principally motivated by opportunities to expand productive
capacity, both geographically and into new product lines, further integrate its
operations and broaden its existing product lines and customer base. The Company
has sought to improve the productivity of plants and operations acquired by it.
The most significant acquisitions were:

1979 -- Acquired 51% of Alton Box Board Company; the remaining 49% was
acquired in 1981. Alton's containerboard and industrial packaging
businesses consisted of fully integrated containerboard and paperboard
operations. The Alton acquisition significantly enhanced the Company's
presence in the midwest and expanded its operations to the southeast. In
addition, the Alton acquisition expanded the Company's product lines to
include folding cartons and industrial packaging and provided a network of
reclamation facilities which supplied wastepaper to the Company's recycled
mills. Alton owned a kraft linerboard mill and a recycled medium

39

<PAGE>
mill, two recycled cylinderboard mills, 32 converting facilities and 9
recycled wastepaper plants. Alton's total annual paperboard production at
the date of acquisition was 471,775 tons, as compared to 582,017 tons in
1993.

1982 -- Acquired 50% of the paperboard and packaging divisions of Diamond
International Corporation through a joint venture; the remaining 50% was
acquired in 1983. In addition to expanding the Company's existing product
lines and customer base, the Diamond acquisition added new product lines,
including labels and other consumer packaging, and a related business
which produced rotogravure cylinders for use on printing presses used
extensively by the folding carton industry. Diamond owned two coated
recyled boxboard mills, which provided the Company with an integrated
source of recycled boxboard for use in its folding carton plants, as well
as three folding carton plants, three shipping container plants and three
consumer packaging plants. Diamond's operations were located primarily in
the midwest. Diamond's annual coated recycled boxboard production,
exclusive of a mill recently shut down, at the date of acquisition was
74,494 tons, as compared to 113,006 tons in 1993.

1986 -- Acquired 80% of SNC, formerly Publishers Paper Company. The SNC
acquisition extended the Company's product line to include newsprint and
also expanded the Company's reclamation operations to the west coast. The
SNC acquisition consisted of two newsprint mills and two Cladwood'r'
manufacturing plants, all of which are located in Oregon. SNC's annual
newsprint production at the date of acquisition was 592,804 tons, as
compared to 615,151 tons in 1993.

1986 -- Acquired 50% of CCA through a joint venture with the Morgan
Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund I, L.P.; the remaining 50% was acquired in
1989. The total CCA acquisition cost was $1,130 million, which was
financed with $1,060 million of debt and $70 million of preferred and
common equity. The CCA acquisition substantially enhanced the Company's
production capacity and further integrated the Company's operations. It
also expanded its paperboard and packaging operations to the west coast,
which enabled the Company to compete on a national level and broaden its
customer base. The CCA acquisition consisted primarily of 9 paperboard
mills, 40 converting plants and 5 reclamation facilities as well as
approximately 1,000,000 acres of owned or leased timberlands. CCA's
operations are located throughout the United States. CCA's total annual
paperboard production at the date of acquisition was 1,760,039 tons, as
compared to 2,002,064 tons in 1993.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

PAPERBOARD

General

Paperboard is a general term used to describe certain heavyweight grades of
paper primarily used for packaging products. Paperboard is produced from four
basic types of pulp: (i) unbleached kraft; (ii) bleached kraft; (iii) recycled
and (iv) semi-chemical. Unbleached kraft, bleached kraft and semi-chemical
paperboards, are produced primarily from wood pulp. Recycled paperboard is
produced primarily from wastepaper. Recycled paperboard demand has grown at a
more rapid rate than virgin grades based primarily on its increased quality and
rising environmental awareness by consumers.

Paperboard is classified by three major end-uses: (i) containerboard, (ii)
boxboard and (iii) other paperboard. Containerboard primarily includes
linerboard and corrugating medium, the components of corrugated boxes used in
the transportation of manufactured goods. Boxboard includes folding carton
stock, setup boxboard and food board. Folding cartons, the major segment of
boxboard, are used to package a wide range of consumer products such as health
and beauty products, dry cereals and soap powders. Folding cartons are often
clay-coated for better printability and consumer appeal. Other paperboard
includes paperboard used in a number of industrial applications: fiber drums,
composite cans, spiral tubes, cores, gypsum wallboard liner and box partitions.

Containerboard

Demand. Containerboard production grew from 21.3 million tons in 1983 to
29.2 million tons in 1993 (consisting of 26.2 million tons of domestic
production and 3.0 million tons of exports) for a compound annual growth rate
('Rate') of 3.3%. From 1983-1993, containerboard produced from recycled
paperboard grew at a much faster rate than unbleached kraft, experiencing a 7.6%
Rate. Containerboard demand is highly cyclical and fluctuates with the general
level of economic activity.

[GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION of the relationship between the change in Gross
Domestic Product ('GDP') and the change in containerboard production from 1983
to 1993. For each year during hte period 1983-1993, the annual percentage change
in GDP was 3.9%, 6.2%, 3.2%, 2.9%, 3.1%, 3.9%, 2.5%, 1.2%, (0.7%), 2.6% and
2.9%, respectively. During this same period, the annual percentage change in
containerboard production was 10.2%, 7.1%, (3.7%), 8.4%, 7.1%, 1.8%, 1.1%, 3.7%,
2.2%, 4.2% and 1.0%, respectively. The source of the containboard production
data is the America Forest and Paper Association.]

Overall, containerboard demand is a function of the level of corrugated box
shipments from box converting plants and, to some extent, the level of
containerboard inventories on hand. Over the last six months of 1993, corrugated
box demand was very strong with shipments from August 1993 through December 1993
exceeding corresponding 1992 months by 9.1%, 6.6%, 5.7%, 12.3% and 10.1%,
respectively. Box plant containerboard inventory levels were at 2.16 million
tons on December 31, 1993, up slightly from 1.98 million tons on October 31,
1993, their lowest level on a tonnage basis since 1987. Containerboard demand
has also been assisted in recent months by an increase in exports. The Company
is currently experiencing strong demand and believes that it will continue as
the economy improves. Resource Information Systems, Inc. ('RISI'), a well known
industry consultant, projects domestic containerboard production to grow to 28.9
million tons by 1996, a 3.3% Rate from 1993.

41

<PAGE>
Supply. U.S. containerboard capacity totaled 31.1 million tons in 1993, for
a 2.9% Rate from 1983 to 1993. From 1983 to 1993, capacity utilization reached a
high of 97.8% in 1987 and a low of 90.3% in 1985. Approximately, 4.0 million
tons of new capacity was added between year-end 1988 and year-end 1993,
decreasing operating rates from 1987 levels.

Operating rates in the industry during 1991 and 1992, however, ran at high
levels relative to demand, which was lower due to the sluggish U.S. economy and
a decline in export markets. This imbalance resulted in excess inventories in
the industry and lower prices for the Company's containerboard and corrugated
shipping container products, which continued throughout most of 1993. To reduce
rising inventories, many containerboard producers, including the Company, took
downtime at containerboard mills which resulted in lowering operating rates to
93.7% for 1993. By the end of the third quarter of 1993, inventory levels had
decreased significantly.

According to the AFPA, producers plan to add only a modest 2.1 million tons
of containerboard capacity in 1994-1996. 1.4 million tons, or 70% of the added
capacity, will be recycled linerboard and corrugating medium. The following
graph reflects the historical relationship between containerboard capacity
utilization and linerboard prices, the predominant grade for containerboard
products.

[GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION of the relationship between the level of
containerboard capacity utilizaiton and linerboard prices from 1983 to 1993.
For each year during the period 1983-1993, annual containerboard capacity
utilization was 90.4%, 94.5%, 90.3%, 95.2%, 97.8%, 95.5%, 94.6%, 95.1%, 95.2%,
95.6% and 93.7%, respectively. For each year during this same period, unbleached
kraft lineboard prices per short ton (42 lb., Eastern Market) were $290, $335,
$274, $295, $361, $403, $405, $378, $336, $345 and $316, respectively (1983-1984
prices are as of December 31. 19985-1993 prices reflect the average of the four
quarter-ed prices). The source of the containerboard capacity utilization data
is the American Forest and Paper Association. The source of the linerboard
prices is the Pulp and Paper North American Factbook.]

Pricing. Pricing historically has been correlated with the levels of
industry capacity utilization. Over the past business cycle, containerboard
prices peaked in 1989. Linerboard peaked at approximately $410 per ton and
reached a low of $280-$290 per ton the second quarter of 1993, owing to
decreased demand and increased inventories. Over the past several months,
containerboard pricing has strengthened as demand has increased, inventories
have fallen, and corrugated box producers have been successful in increasing
prices to customers. For example, a $25 per ton increase for linerboard was
implemented in November 1993, raising prices to $315-$325 per ton, and most of
the major linerboard producers, including the Company, have announced a $30 per
ton increase effective March 1, 1994. Although there can be no assurance that
this price increase will be successfully implemented, management believes that
such price increase will hold.

42

<PAGE>
Boxboard

Demand. Total boxboard production (including exports) grew to 8.8 million
tons in 1993 from 6.8 million tons in 1983, representing a 2.5% Rate.
Traditionally, recycled and SBS have been by far the largest segments of
boxboard production, representing 40% and 49%, respectively. During 1983 to
1993, recycled boxboard grew at a 2.0% Rate, SBS boxboard grew at a 1.0% Rate
and unbleached kraft, starting from a much smaller base, grew at a 5.2% Rate.
Like containerboard, boxboard demand tends to fluctuate with the general level
of economic activity. During the late 1980s, the use of clay coated recycled
boxboard as a substitute for SBS boxboard increased based on its improved
quality, heightened environmental awareness by consumers and increased demand by
customers for less expensive packaging alternatives. RISI projects both recycled
boxboard production and SBS production to increase at a 2.2% Rate from 1993 to
1996.

Supply. From 1983 to 1993 total boxboard capacity grew from 7.6 million
tons to 9.3 million tons, a 2.0% Rate. SBS folding boxboard grew at a 1.7% Rate,
reaching 2.5 million tons by 1993, while recycled folding boxboard grew to 3.0
million tons by 1993, a 1.1% Rate.

[GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION of the level of boxboard capacity utilization from
1983 to 1993. For each year during the period 1983-1993 , annual boxboard
capacity utilization was 89.9%, 92.9%, 87.5%, 89.5%, 90.2%, 92.2%, 92.8%, 90.7%,
93.5%, 92.6% and 94.8%, respectively. The source of this data is the American
Forest and Paper Association.]

According to the AFPA, 1.2 million tons of boxboard capacity will be added
between 1993-1996. Recycled boxboard accounts for 16% and SBS for 56% of
announced capacity additions.

Pricing. While general boxboard pricing levels are dependent on the overall
balance of supply and demand, relative pricing of different grades of boxboard
is affected by the substitutability of one grade for another in various customer
applications. For example, although the clay coated recycled demand and supply
situation is positive for the upcoming years, clay coated recycled prices are
influenced by SBS prices. During the late 1980s, SBS prices were substantially
higher than clay coated recycled prices. In recent years, SBS prices have
declined at a greater percentage than clay coated recycled, so that on a yield
basis, there is not currently a significant price differential between the two.
Future price growth in some grades of SBS may be tempered by recent and
projected capacity increases.

NEWSPRINT

General. Newsprint is an uncoated paper used in newspaper production.
Virgin newsprint is manufactured primarily from mechanical or groundwood pulps.
In recent years, the majority of U.S. state legislatures have enacted recycled
content laws requiring newspaper publishers to use newsprint

43

<PAGE>
containing various percentages of recycled fiber. Although the bulk of North
American newsprint capacity is located in Canada, the majority of recycled
newsprint capacity is located in the U.S. because of the close proximity of
wastepaper collection sites.

Demand. According to the AFPA, the total U.S. newsprint production in 1993
remained flat, compared to 1992, with 7.08 million tons being produced. Canadian
production is estimated to have been 10.39 million tons in 1993, compared to
9.84 million tons in 1992. From 1983 to 1993, North American newsprint
production grew at a 1.6% Rate. Newsprint demand is dependent on the general
level of newspaper advertising. RISI estimates North American newsprint
shipments will remain flat through 1995.

According to the AFPA, North American production is also influenced by the
export levels to major newsprint consuming regions such as Western Europe and
Asia. In 1992, U.S. and Canadian producers increased export shipments 17% over
1991. 1993 witnessed a significant decline in North American exports due to
unfavorable currency exchange rates and new capacity in Europe and Asia.

Supply. According to the AFPA, North American newsprint capacity was 18.1
million tons in 1993, reflecting a 1.2% Rate since 1983. During the period from
year end 1989 to year end 1991, 1.26 million tons of U.S. newsprint capacity and
.95 million tons of Canadian newsprint capacity were added, severely depressing
utilization rates in the early 1990s. Capacity expansion in the newsprint
industry has been concentrated on recycling and, over the last three years,
eleven new deinking plants have been brought into operation with the capacity to
recycle 2.9 million tons of recovered paper.

Capacity utilization has been at relatively low levels during the early
1990s as a large growth in capacity has coincided with a decline in newsprint
demand, which has led to lower rates for North American mills overall. Capacity
utilization from 1983 to 1993 is shown in the table below:

[GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION of the level of newsprint capacity utilizsation in
the United States and Canada from 1983 to 1993. For eac year during the period
1983-1993, U.S. newsprint capacity utilization was 89.5%, 94.7%, 93.8%, 97.0%,
97.3% 97.8%, 96.7%, 97.3%, 97.0% and 98.0%, respectively. For each year during
this same period, Canadian newsprintc capacity utilization was 85.1%, 91.8%,
91.4%, 93.9% 97.7%, 98.9%, 96.2%, 89.8%, 87.3%, 88.6% and 95.7%, respectively.
The source of these figures is the American Forest and Paper Association.]

According to the AFPA, North American newsprint capacity will decline from
16.7 million metric tons in 1992 to 16.6 million metric tons in 1996. This
decline in capacity is expected because no new mills or machines are planned
during these years and capacity gains resulting from rebuilds of existing
machines and miscellaneous improvements will be offset by the reallocation of
capacity in several mills to produce groundwood and specialty papers rather than
newsprint. Several new recycled newsprint mills have been announced recently in
Western Europe, and such mills are expected to affect future exports by North
American producers.

44

<PAGE>
Pricing. Newsprint is a commodity paper grade with pricing largely a
function of capacity utilization. West coast prices fell from a peak of
approximately $595 per metric ton (30-lb, delivered) in 1988 to a low of $420
per metric ton in the second quarter of 1992. In December, 1993 newsprint
producers, including the Company, announced price increases which were
unsuccessful. Although market demand has improved in the fourth quarter of 1993,
the Company does not expect significant improvement in prices before the second
quarter of 1994.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

The principal components of the Company's business strategy include the
following:

MAINTAIN FOCUS ON RECYCLED PRODUCTS

The Company believes it is the largest processor of wastepaper, the largest
producer of coated recycled paperboard, the largest producer of recycled medium
and one of the largest producers of recycled newsprint in the U.S. The Company
has historically utilized a significant amount of recycled fibre in its products
and has maintained a strategy to allow it to supply all of the Company's
recycled fibre needs for its paper producing operations. There are several
advantages to this strategy. First, the Company's national operations allow it
to minimize costs of transporting wastepaper to its mills. Second, recycled
fibre has a lower cost base than virgin fibre and wastepaper supplies are
increasing. Third, recycled products are gaining in popularity with customers as
a result of increased environmental awareness and improved quality, making them
more competitive with products made from virgin fibre. The following chart
indicates the significant percentage of recycled paperboard produced and
consumed, by the Company's operations.

Total paperboard consumed by the Company............................. 2,476 2,569 2,607
Percent recycled................................................ 34.5% 35.9% 32.3%
</TABLE>

FOCUS ON COST REDUCTION

The Company continuously strives to reduce operating costs on a system-wide
basis through the implementation of cost reduction programs. In 1991, the
Company implemented an austerity program to offset the impact of declining
prices. This austerity program froze staff levels, deferred certain
discretionary spending programs and more aggressively managed capital
expenditures and working capital to conserve cash and reduce interest expense.
For example, as a result of the austerity program the Company's average working
capital as a percentage of annual sales has averaged 2.8% over the last two
years.

While the austerity program succeeded in reducing expenses and improving
cash flow, the length and extent of the recession led the Company in 1993, to
initiate the Plan and the Restructuring Program.

The Plan is a systematic Company-wide effort designed to improve the cost
competitiveness of all the Company's operating facilities and staff functions.
The Plan focuses on reducing costs and other measures, including:

Productivity improvements to reduce variable unit cost at production
facilities and to increase volume.

Identification of approximately $100 million of high return, quick payback
capital projects for which spending will be accelerated.

Reduction in fibre cost.

Reduction in cost of materials generated through a Company-wide council
which will negotiate large national purchasing activities.

45

<PAGE>
Reductions in personnel cost through a Company-wide freeze on compensation
for salaried employees in 1994 and reductions in workforce.

Reduction in waste cost in the manufacturing process.

Increased focus on specialty niche businesses which are less commodity
oriented and carries pricing premiums.

The Company is implementing the Restructuring Program to improve the
Company's long-term competitive position. The Restructuring Program includes
plant closures, reductions in workforce, and the realignment and consolidation
of various manufacturing operations over an approximately two to three year
period. The Restructuring Program is expected to reduce production cost,
employee expense and depreciation charges. While future benefits of the
Restructuring Program are uncertain, the operating losses in 1993 for the plants
shut down in January 1994 and those contemplated in the future were $31 million.
While the Company believes that it would have realized financial benefits in
1993 had these plants been shut down at the beginning of the year, and that it
will realize such benefits in future periods, no assurances can be given in this
regard and, in particular, no assurances can be given as to what portion of such
loss would not have been realized in 1993 had such plants been shut down for the
entire year. The Company closed certain high cost operating facilities,
including a coated recycled boxboard mill and five converting plants, in January
1994.

CONTINUE TO PURSUE VERTICAL INTEGRATION

The Company's operations are vertically integrated in that the Company uses
significant amounts of timber harvested from its timberlands and wastepaper
provided by its reclamation operations in the manufacture of paperboard and
newsprint, and converts its production of paperboard into shipping containers,
folding cartons, papertubes and other products. The Company also exchanges a
significant amount of containerboard with other major companies in the industry.
These exchanges are generally used when shipment from the Company's mills would
not be freight cost efficient or when container plants require a certain grade
of containerboard not manufactured by the Company.

The Company's integration reduces the volatility of pricing for its
containerboard products, allows it to run its mills at higher operating rates
during industry downturns and protects the Company from potential regional
supply and demand imbalances for recycled fibre grades.

The following table illustrates the balance between the Company's
production and consumption levels for its core businesses for the last three
years.

CONTINUE GROWTH IN CORE BUSINESSES

The Company has built its core businesses through selective acquisitions of
existing businesses and ongoing capital improvements.

Over the years, the Company's acquisition strategy has accomplished several
objectives, including (i) geographic expansion of its operations, (ii) growth of
its recycling capacity and expertise, (iii) expansion of its product lines in
order to satisfy most of the packaging needs of large national and multinational
customers, (iv) expansion of its operations into related products which can be
successfully

46

<PAGE>
marketed to existing customers as well as into related products to which the
Company can apply its papermaking expertise, and (v) integration of its
operations. The Company intends to continue its current strategy by exploring
potential acquisitions and pursuing those which meet its business objectives.

MAINTAIN LEADING MARKET POSITIONS

The Company believes it is one of the most broadly based paperboard
packaging producers in the United States. The Company has achieved this status
through its selective acquisitions and its ongoing capital improvements program.
The Company believes it maintains significant U.S. market positions including
the following:

largest producer of recycled paperboard

largest producer of folding cartons

largest producer of coated recycled boxboard

largest processor of wastepaper

largest producer of mottled white linerboard

one of the largest producers of recycled newsprint

second largest producer of corrugated shipping containers

largest producer of recycled medium

fifth largest producer of containerboard

The Company believes that its size, as evidenced by its leading U.S. market
positions, provides certain advantages in marketing its products. The Company's
prominence in the U.S. packaging industry gives it excellent customer
visibility. The Company is well recognized by its customers as a quality
producer and has recently entered a select number of strategic alliances with
certain large, national account customers to supply packaging. In addition, the
Company's broad range of packaging products provides a single source option,
whereby all of the customers' packaging needs can be satisfied by the Company.

IMPROVE FINANCIAL PROFILE TO GROW CORE BUSINESSES

Since the 1989 recapitalization of JSC, the Company has pursued a strategy
designed to reduce its financial risk profile. During this period, the Company
has accessed various capital markets through several transactions, resulting in
improved financial flexibility.

In 1991, the Company completed a $230 million accounts receivable
securitization. Initial proceeds of $168 million were raised by an A1/D1+
commercial paper issue and a AA-medium term note issue. The proceeds were used
to retire debt, while the transaction increased the liquidity of the Company by
$180 million.

In 1992, the Company received cash equity capital from a subsidiary of JS
Group and MSLEF II (and certain of its limited partners who owned Junior Accrual
Debentures) of $33 million and $200 million, respectively, and in December 1993
a subsidiary of JS Group converted its $167 million of preferred stock into
common stock. The Company also negotiated a $400 million senior secured term
loan. The equity and loan proceeds were used to repurchase $193.5 million of the
Junior Accrual Debentures and to prepay a portion of certain subordinated
indebtedness and $400 million of the 1989 term loan. This transaction reduced
near term debt service requirements and also reduced annual interest expense by
$30 million.

In 1993, in order to improve operating and financial flexibility, CCA
issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1993 Notes, the proceeds of
which were used to repay $100 million of revolving credit indebtedness and an
aggregate of $387.5 million of term loan indebtedness under its existing credit
agreements. As a result of such refinancing, the Company successfully extended
maturities of its indebtedness and improved its liquidity.

47

<PAGE>
The Company anticipates that the Recapitalization Plan will further improve
operating and financial flexibility by reducing the level and overall cost of
its debt, extending maturities of indebtedness, increasing stockholders' equity
and increasing its access to capital markets.

PRODUCTS

PAPERBOARD/PACKAGING PRODUCT SEGMENT

Containerboard and Corrugated Shipping Containers. The Company's
containerboard operations are highly integrated and the Company believes this
integration enhances its ability to respond quickly and efficiently to customers
and to fill orders on short lead times. Tons of containerboard produced and
converted for the last three years were:

</TABLE>

The Company's mills produce a full line of containerboard, including
unbleached kraft linerboard, mottled white linerboard and recycled medium.

The Company believes it is the nation's largest producer of mottled white
linerboard, the largest producer of recycled medium and the fifth largest
producer of containerboard. Unbleached kraft linerboard is produced at the
Company's mills located in Fernandina Beach and Jacksonville, Florida and
mottled white linerboard is produced at its Brewton, Alabama mill. Recycled
medium is produced at the Company's mills located in Alton, Illinois, Carthage,
Indiana, Circleville, Ohio and Los Angeles, California. In 1993, the Company
produced 1,018,000, 315,000 and 507,000 tons of unbleached kraft linerboard,
mottled white linerboard and recycled medium, respectively.

Large capital investment is required to sustain the Company's
containerboard mills, which employ state of the art computer controlled
machinery in their manufacturing processes. During the last five years, the
Company has invested approximately $246 million to enhance product quality,
reduce costs, expand capacity and increase production efficiency, as well as
make required improvements to stay in compliance with environmental regulations.
Major capital projects completed in the last five years include (i) a rebuild of
Jacksonville's linerboard machine to produce high performance, lighter weight
grades now experiencing higher demand, (ii) modifications to Brewton's mottled
white machine to increase run speed by 100 tons per day and (iii) a project to
reduce sulfur emissions from the Fernandina Beach linerboard mill. A key
strategy for the next few years will be to reduce wood cost at its virgin fibre
mills by modifying methods of woodchip production and handling, utilizing random
length roundwood forms and continuing to pursue forest management practices
designed to enhance timberland productivity.

The Company's sales of containerboard in 1993 were $670.6 million
(including $384.1 million of intracompany sales). Sales of containerboard to its
52 container plants are reflected at prices based upon those published by
Official Board Markets which are generally higher than those paid by third
parties except in exchange contracts.

The Company believes it is the second largest producer of corrugated
shipping containers in the U.S. Corrugated shipping containers, manufactured
from containerboard in converting plants, are used to ship such diverse products
as home appliances, electric motors, small machinery, grocery products, produce,
books, tobacco and furniture, and for many other applications, including point
of purchase displays. The Company stresses the value added aspects of its
corrugated containers, such as labeling and multi-color graphics, to
differentiate its products and respond to customer requirements. The Company's
container plants serve local customers and large national accounts and are
located nationwide, generally in or near large metropolitan areas. The Company's
total sales of corrugated shipping containers in 1993 were $1,175.7 million
(including $81.1 million of intracompany sales).

48

<PAGE>
Corrugated shipping container sales volumes for 1991, 1992 and 1993 were 25,178,
26,593 and 27,268 million square feet, respectively.

RECYCLED BOXBOARD, SBS AND FOLDING CARTONS

The Company's recycled boxboard, SBS and folding carton operations are also
well integrated. Tons of recycled boxboard and SBS produced and converted for
the last three years are provided below:

</TABLE>

The Company's mills produce recycled coated and uncoated boxboard and SBS.
The Company believes it is the nation's largest producer of clay-coated
boxboard, made from 100 percent recycled fibre, which offers comparable quality
to virgin boxboard for most applications. The Company also believes that its
premium-priced SBS offers a high quality product for packaging applications.

Coated recycled boxboard is produced at the Company's mills located in
Middletown, Ohio, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Santa Clara, California and
Wabash, Indiana. The Company produces uncoated recycled boxboard at its Los
Angeles, California mill and SBS at its Brewton, Alabama mill. The Company
believes its coated recycled boxboard, known as MASTERCOAT'r', is recognized in
the industry for its high quality and extensive range of grades and calipers.
The Brewton machine produces four basic grades of SBS including MASTERPRINT'r',
which is ideally suited for converting into folding cartons and related end
uses, MASTERSEAL'r' and MASTERVAC'r', which are used for visual carded packaging
that facilitates merchandising at the point of sale, and MASTERWITE'r', which is
designed for intricately printed and die-cut greeting cards and other specialty
uses. In 1993, the Company produced 653,000 and 176,000 tons of recycled
boxboard and SBS, respectively. The Company's total sales of recycled boxboard
and SBS in 1993 were $409.7 million (including $197.2 million of intracompany
sales).

The Company believes it is the nation's largest producer of folding
cartons, offering the broadest range of converting capabilities, including web
and sheet litho, rotogravure and flexo printing and a full line of structural
and design graphics services. The Company's 18 folding carton plants convert
recycled boxboard and SBS, including approximately 49% of the boxboard and SBS
produced by the Company, into folding cartons. Folding cartons are used
primarily to protect customers' products while providing point of purchase
advertising. The Company makes folding cartons for a wide variety of
applications, including food and fast foods, detergents, paper products,
beverages, health and beauty aids and other consumer products. Customers range
from small local accounts to large national and multinational accounts. The
Company's folding carton plants are located nationwide, generally in or near
large metropolitan areas. The Company's sales of folding cartons in 1993 were
$648.2 million (including $2.2 million of intracompany sales). Folding carton
sales volumes for 1991, 1992 and 1993 were 482,000, 487,000 and 475,000 tons,
respectively.

The Company has focused its capital expenditures in these operations and
its marketing activities to support a strategy of enhancing product quality as
it relates to packaging graphics, increasing flexibility while reducing customer
response time and assisting customers in innovating package designs.

The Company provides marketing consultation and research activities, a key
competitive factor within the folding carton industry, through its Design and
Market Research (DMR) Laboratory. It provides customers with graphic and product
design tailored to the specific technical requirements of lithographic,
rotogravure and flexographic printing, as well as photography for packaging,
sales promotion concepts, and point of purchase displays.

RECYCLED CYLINDERBOARD AND INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING

The Company's recycled cylinderboard and industrial packaging operations
are also integrated. Tons of recycled cylinderboard produced and converted for
the last three years are shown in the table below:

</TABLE>

The Company's recycled cylinderboard mills are located in: Tacoma,
Washington, Monroe, Michigan (2 mills), Lafayette, Indiana, and Cedartown,
Georgia. In 1993, total sales of recycled cylinderboard were $61.8 million
(including $17.9 million of intracompany sales).

The Company's 16 industrial packaging plants convert recycled
cylinderboard, including a portion of the recycled cylinderboard produced by the
Company, into papertubes and cores. Papertubes and cores are used primarily for
paper, film and foil, yarn carriers and other textile products and furniture
components. The Company also produces solid fibre partitions for the
pharmaceutical, electronics, cosmetics and plastics industries. In addition, the
Company produces a patented self-locking partition especially suited for
automated packaging and product protection. The Company believes it is the
nation's third largest producer of tubes and cores. The Company's industrial
packaging sales in 1993 were $88.1 million (including $1.6 million in
intracompany sales).

CONSUMER PACKAGING

The Company manufactures a wide variety of consumer packaging products,
which are generally non-cyclical. These products include flexible packaging,
printed paper labels, foil labels, and labels that are heat transferred to
plastic containers for a wide range of industrial and consumer product
applications. The contract packaging plants provide cartoning, bagging, liquid-
or powder-filling, high-speed overwrapping and fragranced advertising products.
The Company produces high-quality rotogravure cylinders and has a full-service
organization highly experienced in the production of color separations and
lithographic film for the commercial printing, advertising and packaging
industries. The Company also designs, manufactures and sells custom machinery
including specialized machines that apply labels to customers' packaging. The
Company currently has 14 facilities including the engineering service center
referred to below and has improved their competitiveness by installing
state-of-the-art production equipment.

In addition, the Company has an engineering services center, specializing
in automated production systems and highly specialized machinery, providing
expert consultation, design and equipment fabrication for consumer and
industrial products manufacturers, primarily from the food, beverage and medical
products industries.

Total sales of consumer packaging products and services were $179.8 million
(including $15.1 million of intracompany sales).

RECLAMATION OPERATIONS; FIBRE RESOURCES AND TIMBER PRODUCTS

The raw materials essential to the Company's business are reclaimed fibre
from wastepaper and wood, in the form of logs or chips. The Brewton,
Circleville, Jacksonville and Fernandina mills use primarily wood fibres, while
the other paperboard mills use reclaimed fibre exclusively. The newsprint mills
use approximately 45% wood fibre and 55% reclaimed fibre.

The Company believes it is the nation's largest recycler of wastepaper. The
use of recycled products in the Company's operations begins with its reclamation
division which operates 26 facilities that collect, sort, grade and bale
wastepaper, as well as collect aluminum and glass. The reclamation division
provides valuable fibre resources to both the paperboard and newsprint segments
of the Company as well as to other producers. Many of the reclamation facilities
are located in close proximity to the Company's recycled paperboard and
newsprint mills, assuring availability of supply, when needed, with

50

<PAGE>
minimal shipping costs. In 1993, the Company processed 3.9 million tons of
wastepaper, which the Company believes is approximately twice the amount of
wastepaper processed by its closest competitor. The amount of wastepaper
collected and the proportions sold internally and externally by the Company's
reclamation division for the last three years were:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
1991 1992 1993
----- ----- -----
(TONS IN THOUSANDS)
<S> <C> <C> <C>
Wastepaper collected by Reclamation Division......................... 3,666 3,846 3,907
Percent sold internally......................................... 49.7% 49.7% 48.8%
Percent sold to third parties................................... 50.3% 50.3% 51.2%
</TABLE>

The reclamation division also operates a nationwide brokerage system
whereby it purchases and resells wastepaper (including wastepaper for use in its
recycled fibre mills) on a regional and national contract basis. Such contracts
provide bulk purchasing, resulting in lower prices and cleaner wastepaper. Total
sales of recycled materials for 1993 were $242.9 million (including $120.8
million of intracompany sales).

During 1993, the wastepaper which was reclaimed by the Company's
reclamation plants and brokerage operations satisfied all of the Company's mill
requirements for reclaimed fibre.

The Company's timber division manages approximately one million acres of
owned and leased timberland. In 1993, approximately 53% of the timber harvested
by the Company was used in its Jacksonville, Fernandina and Brewton Mills. The
Company harvested 808,000 cords of timber which would satisfy approximately 32%
of the Company's requirements for woodfibres. The Company's woodfibre
requirements not satisfied internally are purchased on the open market or under
long-term contracts. In the past, the Company has not experienced difficulty
obtaining an adequate supply of wood through its own operations or open market
purchases. The Company is not aware of any circumstances that would adversely
affect its ability to satisfy its wood requirements in the foreseeable future.
In recent years, a shortage of wood fibre in the spotted owl regions in the
Northwest has resulted in increases in the cost of virgin wood fibre. However,
the Company's use of reclaimed fibre in its newsprint mills has mitigated the
effect of this in significant part.

In 1993, the Company's total sales of timber products were $227.8 million
(including $185.1 million of intracompany sales).

NEWSPRINT SEGMENT

Newsprint Mills. The Company believes it is one of the largest producer of
recycled newsprint and the fourth largest producer overall of newsprint in the
United States. The Company's newsprint mills are located in Newberg and Oregon
City, Oregon. During 1991, 1992 and 1993, the Company produced 614,000, 615,000
and 615,000 tons of newsprint, respectively. In 1993, total sales of newsprint
were $219.5 million (none of which were intracompany sales).

For the past three years, an average of approximately 56% of the Company's
newsprint production has been sold to The Times Mirror Company ('Times Mirror')
pursuant to a long-term newsprint agreement (the 'Newsprint Agreement') entered
into in connection with the Company's acquisition of SNC stock in February 1986.
Under the terms of the Newsprint Agreement, the Company supplies newsprint to
Times Mirror generally at prevailing West Coast market prices. Sales of
newsprint to Times Mirror in 1993 amounted to $115.2 million.

Cladwood'r'. Cladwood'r' is a wood composite panel used by the housing
industry, manufactured from sawmill shavings and other wood residuals and
overlayed with recycled newsprint. The Company has two Cladwood'r' plants
located in Oregon. Total sales for Cladwood'r' in 1993 were $29.1 million ($.5
million of which were intracompany sales).

MARKETING

The marketing strategy for the Company's mills is to maximize sales of
products to manufacturers located within an economical shipping area. The
strategy in the converting plants focuses on both specialty products tailored to
fit customers' needs and high volume sales of commodity products. The

51

<PAGE>
Company also seeks to broaden the customer base for each of its segments rather
than to concentrate on only a few accounts for each plant. These objectives have
led to decentralization of marketing efforts, such that each plant has its own
sales force, and many have product design engineers, who are in close contact
with customers to respond to their specific needs. National sales offices are
also maintained for customers who purchase through a centralized purchasing
office. National account business may be allocated to more than one plant
because of production capacity and equipment requirements.

COMPETITION

The paperboard and packaging products markets are highly competitive and
are comprised of many participants. Although no single company is dominant, the
Company does face significant competitors in each of its businesses. The
Company's competitors include large vertically integrated companies as well as
numerous smaller companies. The industries in which the Company competes are
particularly sensitive to price fluctuations as well as other competitive
factors including design, quality and service, with varying emphasis on these
factors depending on product line. The market for the Newsprint segment is also
highly competitive.

BACKLOG

Demand for the Company's major product lines is relatively constant
throughout the year and seasonal fluctuations in marketing, production,
shipments and inventories are not significant. The Company does not have a
significant backlog of orders, as most orders are placed for delivery within 30
days.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Company's research and development center works with JSC's
manufacturing and sales operations, providing state-of-the-art technology, from
raw materials supply through finished packaging performance. Research programs
have provided improvements in coatings and barriers, stiffeners, inks and
printing. The technical staff conducts basic, applied and diagnostic research,
develops processes and products and provides a wide range of other technical
services.

The Company actively pursues applications for patents on new inventions and
designs and attempts to protect its patents against infringement. Nevertheless,
the Company believes that its success and growth are dependent on the quality of
its products and its relationships with its customers, rather than on the extent
of its patent protection. The Company holds or is licensed to use certain
patents, but does not consider that the successful continuation of any important
phase of its business is dependent upon such patents.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 1993, the Company had approximately 16,600 employees, of
which approximately 11,300 employees (68%), are represented by collective
bargaining units. The expiration date of union contracts for the Company's major
facilities are as follows: the Alton mill, expiring June 1994; the Newberg mill,
expiring March 1995; the Oregon City mill, expiring March 1997; the Brewton
mill, expiring October 1997; the Fernandina mill, expiring June 1998; a group of
12 properties, including 4 paper mills and 8 corrugated container plants,
expiring June 1998; and the Jacksonville mill, expiring June 1999. The Company
believes that its employee relations are generally good and is currently in the
process of bargaining with unions representing production employees at a number
of its other operations.

PROPERTIES

The Company's properties at December 31, 1993 are summarized in the table
below. The table reflects the previously mentioned closure in early 1994 of
three container plants, two folding carton plants and one recycled boxboard mill
but does not reflect the additional closures contemplated by the Restructuring.
Approximately 62% of the Company's investment in property, plant and equipment
is represented by its paperboard and newsprint mills.

In addition to its manufacturing facilities, the Company owns and leases
approximately 758,000 acres and 226,000 acres of timberland, respectively, and
also operates wood harvesting facilities.

LITIGATION

In May 1993, CCA received a notice of default on behalf of Otis B. Ingram,
as executor of the estate of Naomi M. Ingram, and Ingram-LeGrand Lumber Company
with respect to certain timber purchase agreements and timber management
agreements between CCA and such parties dated November 22, 1967 pertaining to
approximately 30,000 acres of property in Georgia (the 'Agreements'). In June
1993, CCA filed suit against such parties in the United States District Court,
Middle District of Georgia, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and
damages in excess of $3 million arising out of the defendants' alleged breach
and anticipatory repudiation of the Agreements. The defendants have filed an
answer and counterclaim seeking damages in excess of $14 million based on
allegations that CCA breached the Agreements and failed to pay for timber
allegedly stolen or otherwise removed from the property by CCA or third parties.
The alleged thefts of timber are being investigated by the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation, which has advised CCA that it is not presently a target of this
investigation. CCA has filed a third-party complaint against Keadle Lumber
Enterprises, Inc. seeking indemnification with respect to such alleged thefts
and has filed a reply to the defendants' counterclaims denying the allegations
and any liability to the defendants. Management does not believe that the
outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition or operations.

The Company is a defendant in a number of other lawsuits that have arisen
in the normal course of business. While any litigation has an element of
uncertainty, the management of the Company believes that the outcome of such
suits will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or
operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Federal, state and local environmental requirements, particularly relating
to air and water quality, are a significant factor in the Company's business.
The Company employs processes in the manufacture

53

<PAGE>
of pulp, paperboard and other products, resulting in various discharges and
emissions that are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental
control statutes, regulations and ordinances. The Company operates and expects
to operate under permits and similar authorizations from various governmental
authorities that regulate such discharges and emissions.

Occasional violations of permit terms have occurred from time to time at
the Company's facilities, resulting in administrative actions, legal proceedings
or consent decrees and similar arrangements. Pending proceedings include the
following:

In March 1992, JSC entered into an administrative consent order with
the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation to carry out any
necessary assessment and remediation of JSC-owned property in Duval County,
Florida that was formerly the site of a sawmill that dipped lumber into a
chemical solution. Assessment is on-going, but initial data indicates soil
and groundwater contamination that may require nonroutine remediation.
Management believes that the probable costs of this site, taken alone or
with potential costs at other Company-owned properties where some
contamination has been found, will not have a material adverse effect on
its financial condition or operations.

In February 1994, JSC executed a consent decree with the State of Ohio
in full satisfaction of all liability for alleged violations of applicable
standards for particulate and opacity emissions with respect to two
coal-fired boilers at its Lockland, Ohio recycled boxboard mill (which has
been permanently closed as part of the Company's restructuring program),
and will be required to pay $122,000 in penalties and enforcement costs
pursuant to such consent decree. The United States Environmental Protection
Agency has also issued a notice of violation with respect to such
emissions, but has informally advised JSC's counsel that no Federal
enforcement is likely to be commenced in light of the settlement with the
State of Ohio.

The Company also faces potential liability as a result of releases, or
threatened releases, of hazardous substances into the environment from various
sites owned and operated by third parties at which Company-generated wastes have
allegedly been deposited. Generators of hazardous substances sent to off-site
disposal locations at which environmental problems exist, as well as the owners
of those sites and certain other classes of persons (generally referred to as
'potentially responsible parties' or 'PRPs'), are, in most instances, subject to
joint and several liability for response costs for the investigation and
remediation of such sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ('CERCLA') and analogous state laws, regardless
of fault or the legality of the original disposal. The Company has received
notice that it is or may be a potentially responsible party at a number of
federal and/or state sites where remedial action may be required, and as a
result may have joint and several liability for cleanup costs at such sites.
However, liability of CERCLA sites is typically shared with the other
potentially responsible parties and costs are commonly allocated according to
relative amounts of waste deposited. Because the Company's relative percentage
of waste deposited at the majority of these sites is quite small, management of
the Company believes that its probable liability under CERCLA, taken on a case
by case basis or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on
its financial condition or operations. Pending CERCLA proceedings include the
following:

In January 1990, CCA filed a motion for leave to intervene and for
modification of the consent decree in United States v. General Refuse
Services, a case pending in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio. CCA contends that it should be allowed to
participate in the proposed consent decree, which provides for remediation
of alleged releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a
site in Miami County, near Troy, Ohio, according to a plan approved by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region V (the 'Agency'). The
Court granted CCA's motion to intervene in this litigation, but denied
CCA's motion for an order denying entry of the consent decree.
Consequently, the consent decree has been entered without CCA's being
included as a party to the decree, meaning that CCA may have some exposure
to potential claims for contribution to remediation costs incurred by other
participants and for non-reimbursed response costs incurred by the Agency,
which costs are reported by the Agency as $3.4 million as of February 1994.
CCA's appeal of the Court's decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
is pending.

54

<PAGE>
In December 1991, the United States filed a civil action against CCA
in United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, to recover its
unreimbursed costs at the Miami County site, and CCA subsequently filed a
third-party complaint against certain entities that had joined the original
consent decree. In October 1993, the United States filed an additional suit
against CCA in the same court seeking injunctive relief and damages up to
$25,000 per day from March 27, 1989 to the present, based on CCA's alleged
failure to properly respond to the Agency's document and information
requests in connection with this site. In July 1993, counsel for CCA was
advised by the Office of the United States Attorney, Northern District of
Illinois that a criminal inquiry is also underway relating to CCA's
responses to the Agency's document and information requests. CCA is
investigating the circumstances regarding its responses, and is pursuing
settlement with respect to all matters relating to the Miami County site.

CCA has paid approximately $768,000 pursuant to two partial consent
decrees entered into in 1990 and 1991 with respect to clean-up obligations
at the Operating Industries site in Monterey Park, California. It is
anticipated that there will be further remedial measures beyond those
covered by these partial settlements.

In addition to other Federal and State laws regarding hazardous substance
contamination at sites owned or operated by the Company, the New Jersey
Industrial Site Recovery Act ('ISRA') requires that a 'Negative Declaration' or
a 'Cleanup Plan' be filed and approved by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection and Energy ('DEPE') as a precondition to the 'transfer'
of an 'industrial establishment'. The ISRA regulations provide that a transferor
may close a transaction prior to the DEPE's approval of a negative declaration
if the transferor enters into an administrative consent order with the DEPE. The
Company is currently a signatory to administrative consent orders with respect
to two formerly leased or owned industrial establishments and has recently
closed a facility and applied for a negative declaration with respect thereto.
Management believes that any requirements that may be imposed by the DEPE with
respect to these sites will not have a materially adverse effect on the
financial condition or operations of the Company.

The Company's paperboard and newsprint mills are large consumers of energy,
using either natural gas or coal. Approximately 67% of the Company's total
paperboard tonnage is produced by mills which have coal-fired boilers. The cost
of energy is dependent, in part, on environmental regulations concerning sulfur
dioxide and particulate emissions.

Because various pollution control standards are subject to change, it is
not possible at this time to predict the amount of capital expenditures that
will ultimately be required to comply with future standards. For the past three
years, the Company has spent an average of approximately $10 million annually on
capital expenditures for environmental purposes. Further sums may be required in
the future, although, in the opinion of management, such expenditures will not
have a material effect on its financial condition or operations. The amount
budgeted for such expenditures for fiscal 1994 is approximately $10 million.
Since the Company's competitors are subject to comparable pollution control
standards, management is of the opinion that compliance with future pollution
standards will not adversely affect the Company's competitive position.

Chief Executive Officer and one of whom shall not be affiliated with SIBV, the
Company, JSC or CCA (an 'SIBV Unaffiliated Director') and (b) four individuals
selected by MSLEF II (each, a 'MSLEF II Nominee'), one of whom shall not be

provided, however, that in the event that the MSLEF II Group owns 10% or more
and less than 30% of the outstanding Common Stock and has received the Initial
Return, then SIBV shall not be required to have one of its nominees be an SIBV
Unaffiliated Director and MSLEF II shall nominate a total of (a) two MSLEF II

duties, to cause the officers of the Company to be the respective officers of
each of JSC and CCA, unless SIBV and MSLEF II otherwise agree.

of death or disability) if and to the extent vested. A participant's award will
vest on the Payment Date if he is still employed by JSC or any of its
subsidiaries at such time; provided that such award shall vest in full if the
participant dies or becomes disabled and shall vest 20% on June 30, 1995, and an
additional 20% on June 30, 1996 if the participant is employed on such date and
is thereafter terminated, prior to June 30, 1997, by the Company without cause.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts shall be paid under the Incentive Plan
unless the Equity Offerings are consummated. The aggregate amount of awards
under the Incentive Plan will not exceed $5 million. The awards expected to be
granted to Messrs. Terrill, Larson and Bradford are $1,000,000, $200,000 and
$75,000, respectively.

1992 STOCK OPTION PLAN

OPTION PLAN

Under the Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan, the Named Executive Officers
and certain other eligible employees have been granted options to purchase
shares of stock of the Company. The options become vested over a ten year period
and vest in their entirety upon the death, disability or retirement of the
optionee. Non-vested options are forfeited upon any other termination of
employment. Options may not be exercised unless they are both exercisable and
vested. Upon the earliest to occur of (i) MSLEF II's transfer of all of its
Common Stock or, if MSLEF II distributes its Common Stock to its partners
pursuant to its dissolution, the transfer by such partners of at least 50% of
the aggregate Common Stock received from MSLEF II pursuant to its dissolution,
(ii) the 11th anniversary of the grant date of the options, and (iii) a public
offering of common stock (including the Equity Offerings), all vested options
shall become exercisable and all options which vest subsequently shall become
exercisable upon vesting; provided, however, that if a public offering occurs
prior to the Threshold Date (defined below) all vested options and all options
which vest subsequent to the public offering but prior to the Threshold Date
shall be exercisable in an amount (as of periodic determination dates) equal to
the product of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock vested pursuant to the
option (whether previously exercised or not) and (b) the Morgan Percentage (as
defined below) as of such date; provided further that in any event a holder's
options shall become exercisable from time to time in an amount equal to the
percentage that the number of shares sold or distributed to its partners by
MSLEF II represents of its aggregate ownership of shares (with vested options
becoming exercisable up to such number before any non-vested options become so
exercisable) less the number of options, if any, which have become exercisable
on January 1, 1995 as set forth below. The Threshold Date is the earlier of (x)
the date the members of the MSLEF II Group (as defined below) shall have
received collectively $200,000,000 in cash and/or other property as a return of
their investment in the Company (as a result of sales of shares of the Company's
common equity) and (y) the date that the members of the MSLEF II Group shall
have transferred an aggregate of at least 30% of the Company's common equity
owned by the MSLEF II Group as of August 26, 1992. The Morgan Percentage as of
any date is the percentage determined from the quotient of (a) the number of
shares of the Company's common equity held as of August 26, 1992, that were
transferred by the MSLEF II Group as of the determination date

61

<PAGE>
and (b) the number of shares of the Company's common equity outstanding as of
such date. The Plan Committee, with the consent of the Board of Directors of the
Company, may accelerate the exercisability of options at such times and
circumstances as it deems appropriate in its discretion. The option exercise
price is not adjustable other than pursuant to an antidilution provision. Ten
percent of stock options granted prior to 1993 vest and become exercisable on
January 1, 1995 so long as the Equity Offerings have been consummated. The
foregoing describes the current terms of the 1992 Stock Option Plan, as intended
to be amended prior to the consummation of the Equity Offerings.

OPTION GRANTS

No option grants were made during 1993 to any Named Executive Officers.
Effective as of February 15, 1994 options with an exercise price of $20 per
share were granted to a number of officers and employees including Messrs.
Terrill and Larson who were granted options for 319,000, and 5,000 shares,
respectively (such dollar amount and numbers have been adjusted to reflect the
ten-for-one stock split). Such options vest over the period ending on December
31, 1999.

OPTION EXERCISES AND YEAR-END VALUE TABLE

The following table summarizes the exercise of options by the Named
Executive Officers during 1993 and the value of options held by such officers as
of the end of 1993. No stock appreciation rights have been granted to any Named
Executive Officers. The table gives effect to the ten-for-one stock split
provided for by the Recapitalization Plan, but does not give effect to options
granted in 1994. In addition, options to purchase 755,000 shares (as adjusted
for the ten-to-one stock split) have been granted to officers and employees of
JS Group and its affiliates (other than Michael W.J. Smurfit).

PENSION PLANS

SALARIED EMPLOYEES' PENSION PLAN AND SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME PENSION PLANS

The Company and its subsidiaries maintain a non-contributory pension plan
for salaried employees (the 'Pension Plan') and non-contributory supplemental
income pension plans (the 'SIP Plans') for certain key executive officers. The
Pension Plan provides monthly benefits at age 65 equal to 1.5% of a
participant's final average earnings minus 1.2% of such participant's primary
social security benefit, multiplied by the number of years of credited service.
Final average earnings equals the average of the highest five consecutive years
of the participant's last 10 years of service, including overtime and certain
bonuses, but excluding bonus payments under the Management Incentive Plan,
deferred or acquisition bonuses, fringe benefits and certain other compensation.
Employees' pension rights vest after five years of service. Benefits are also
available under the Pension Plan upon early or deferred retirement. The pension
benefits for the Named Executive Officers can be calculated pursuant to the
following table, which shows the total estimated single life annuity payments
that would be payable to the Named Executive Officers participating in the
Pension Plan and one of the SIP Plans after various years of service at selected
compensation levels. A limit of 20 and 22.5 years of service can be credited for
SIP I and SIP II, respectively. Payments under the SIP Plans are an unsecured
liability of the Company.

In order to participate in the SIP Plans, an executive must be selected by
the Board of Directors. SIP Plan I provides annual benefits at normal retirement
age (65) equal to 2.5% of a participant's final average earnings multiplied by
the number of years of credited service (with a limit of 20 years or 50% of
final average earnings), less such participant's regular Pension Plan benefit
and a certain portion of the social security benefit, whereas SIP Plan II uses a
2% multiplier (with a limit of 22.5 years or 45% of final average earnings).
Final average earnings equals the participant's average earnings, including
bonus payments made under the Management Incentive Plan, for the five
consecutive highest-paid calendar years out of the last 10 years of service.
Participants may elect to receive benefits in the form of either a life annuity,
a life annuity with ten years certain or a designated survivor annuity.

Dr. Smurfit and Mr. Malloy participate in SIP Plan I and have 21 and 15
years of credited service, respectively. SIP Plan II became effective January 1,
1993, and Mr. Terrill, Mr. Larson and Mr. Bradford participate in such plan and
have 22, 5 and 11 years of credited service, respectively. Estimated final
average earnings for each of the the Named Executive Officers are as follows:
Mr. Malloy ($1,185,000); Dr. Smurfit ($1,040,000); Mr. Terrill ($532,000); Mr.
Larson ($366,000); and Mr. Bradford ($461,000).

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION, SEVERANCE AND CHANGE OF CONTROL
ARRANGEMENTS

The Company and its subsidiaries maintain a severance pay plan for all
salaried employees who have at least one year of credited service (the
'Severance Plan'). Upon a covered termination, the Severance Plan provides for
the payment of one week's salary for each full year of service, payable in
accordance with payroll practices.

Mr. Malloy has a deferred compensation agreement with JSC pursuant to which
JSC intends to pay to him, upon his retirement, lifetime payments of $70,000
annually in addition to his accrued benefits under SIP Plan I.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION CAPITAL ENHANCEMENT PLAN

The Company's Deferred Compensation Capital Enhancement Plan (the 'DCC')
allows for the deferral of compensation of key full-time salaried employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries. Participants may defer a portion of their
compensation and their employer may defer discretionary bonuses (together the
'Deferred Compensation Amount'). Deferrals occur in 18 month cycles. A
participant becomes vested with respect to amounts deferred during a particular
cycle if he continues to be employed by the Company or its subsidiaries for
seven years from the beginning of the cycle, retires

64

<PAGE>
at age 65 or leaves employment for reasons of death or disability. Upon Normal
Retirement (as defined in the DCC) benefits are distributed under the DCC.
Certain participants will receive preretirement distributions from the DCC,
beginning in the eighth year of each cycle. The amounts distributed upon Normal
Retirement for each cycle are determined with reference to the age of the
participant at the beginning of the cycle and the participant's Deferred
Compensation Amount with respect to the cycle. If a participant is younger than
45 years old at the beginning of a cycle, he will receive upon Normal Retirement
a total of fifteen annual payments, each totalling one and one-half times his
Deferred Compensation Amount. If at the beginning of a cycle a participant is
between the ages of 45 and 55 years old, at Normal Retirement he will receive a
total of fifteen annual payments that, in the aggregate, equal his Deferred
Compensation Amount with respect to the cycle plus appreciation credited
annually at 100% of the Moody's Rate (as defined in the DCC). If at the
beginning of a cycle a participant is at least 55 years old, his Normal
Retirement benefit will be a total of fifteen annual payments that, in the
aggregate, equal his Deferred Compensation Amount with respect to the cycle plus
appreciation credited annually at 150% of the Moody's Rate. If at the beginning
of a cycle a participant is age 65 or older, the number of such annual payments
shall be five. If a participant dies prior to retirement, the value of his death
benefit may be more or less than his Normal Retirement benefits, depending on
his age at the beginning of the cycle. Benefits may be reduced by the employer
if a former participant is engaged in a competing business within two years of
termination from the Company or its subsidiaries. Participants may receive early
distributions in the event that they experience unforeseen financial
emergencies. Benefits otherwise payable to the participant are then actuarially
reduced to reflect such early distributions. The benefits payable under the DCC
are funded by the Company through life insurance policies. There have been no
deferrals under the DCC since 1986. Deferrals made by the Named Executive
Officers during 1985 and 1986 and their ages at the time of such deferrals were:
Mr. Malloy ($30,000 at 57, $50,000 at 58), Dr. Smurfit ($30,000 at 48), Mr.
Terrill ($15,000 at 51, $25,000 at 52), Mr. Bradford ($15,000 at 49, $25,000 at
50) and Mr. Larson ($0). In 1993, the Company made the first preretirement
distribution to certain participants totaling $195,000.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

The Company has not heretofore maintained a formal compensation committee.
Dr. Smurfit, Mr. Malloy and Mr. Kilroy, executive officers of the Company,
participated in deliberations of the Board of Directors on executive
compensation matters during 1993. Following consummation of the Offerings, the
Company will maintain a Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. See
' -- Committees'.

Dr. Smurfit and Mr. Kilroy are both directors and executive officers of JS
Group, the Company, JSC and CCA, and Mr. Malloy is a director of JS Group and a
former director and executive officer of the Company, JSC and CCA.

Common Stock for each share of stock of each of the old classes. Following
the Reclassification, the Company's only class of common stock will be the
Common Stock.

(d) Amounts shown exclude shares of Common Stock that have been reserved for
sale to certain directors, officers and other employees of the Company; the
actual amounts of such shares to be purchased by the individuals listed in
the foregoing table and by all directors and executive officers as a group
are undetermined. See 'Underwriters'. Messrs. Malloy, Smurfit, Terrill,
Larson, Bradford and Kilroy and all directors and executive officers as a
group own options to purchase 724,000, 1,026,000, 500,000, 50,000, 121,000
and 423,000 shares of Common Stock, respectively. None of such options are
currently or will become exercisable within 60 days following consummation
of the Offerings. However, a portion of options hereafter vested will
become exercisable, based upon the number of shares transferred by the
MSLEF II Group (as defined in the Option Plan) following the Equity
Offerings. See 'Management -- Executive Compensation -- 1992 Stock Option
Plan'. Prior to the Recapitalization, the holder of an option granted under
the 1992 Stock Option Plan has the right to acquire Class E Stock.
Subsequent to the Recapitalization, the holder of an option has the right
to acquire Common Stock.

(e) Amounts exclude shares of Common Stock owned by SIBV as to which such
persons disclaim beneficial ownership.

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

Set forth below is a summary of certain agreements and arrangements entered
into by the Company and related parties in connection with the 1989 Transaction
and the 1992 Transaction (as defined below), as well as other transactions
between the Company and related parties which have taken place during the
Company's most recently completed three fiscal years.

GENERAL

As a result of certain transactions which occurred in December 1989 (the
'1989 Transaction'), JSC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and CCA
became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of JSC. As part of the 1989
Transaction, the Company issued (i) 1,510,000 shares of the Company's Class A
common stock ('Class A Stock') and 500,000 shares of the Company's Class D
common stock ('Class D Stock') to SIBV for $150 million and $50 million,
respectively, (ii) 1,510,000

66

<PAGE>
shares of the Company's Class B common stock ('Class B Stock') to MSLEF II for
$150 million, (iii) 100,000 shares of the Company's Class C common stock ('Class
C Stock') to MSLEF II, Inc. (the general partner of MSLEF II) and 400,000 shares
of Class C Stock to the Direct Investors (as defined below) for $10 million and
$40 million, respectively (the Direct Investors also purchased Junior Accrual
Debentures and Subordinated Debentures in aggregate principal amounts of $129.2
million and $30.8 million, respectively), and (iv) its preferred stock ('Old
Preferred Stock') to SIBV for $100 million. SIBV subsequently transferred all of
such common and preferred stock to Smurfit Packaging.

In addition to the issuances of capital stock by the Company described
above, the financing for the 1989 Transaction was provided by (i) the issuance
by CCA of the Secured Notes and the Subordinated Debt, and (ii) the incurrence
of term debt and revolving credit indebtedness pursuant to the 1989 Credit
Agreement.

As a result of certain transactions among the Company and CCA and certain
of their securityholders which occurred in August 1992 (the '1992 Transaction'),
(i) MSLEF II acquired an additional 330,000 and 1,212,788 shares of Class B
Stock and Class C Stock, respectively, and certain holders of Class C Stock
acquired 457,212 additional shares of Class C Stock, for an aggregate of $200
million, (ii) Smurfit Holdings, B.V., a subsidiary of SIBV, acquired 330,000
shares of Class A Stock for $33 million, (iii) Smurfit Packaging agreed that its
Old Preferred Stock (including shares issued since the 1989 Transaction as a
dividend) would convert into 1,670,000 shares of Class D Stock on December 31,
1993, (iv) proceeds from the issuances of shares described in clauses (i) and
(ii) above were used to acquire, at a purchase price of $1,100 per $1,000
accreted value, an aggregate of $129.2 million principal amount ($193.5 million
accreted value) of Junior Accrual Debentures from the Direct Investors, (v) CCA
borrowed approximately $400 million under the 1992 Credit Agreement, and used
the proceeds to prepay approximately $400 million of scheduled installments
relating to term loan indebtedness under the 1989 Credit Agreement, (vi) various
provisions of the 1989 Credit Agreement and the Secured Note Purchase Agreement
were amended and restated, and (vii) MSLEF II and SIBV amended a number of the
provisions contained in the Organization Agreement, agreed to the terms of a
Stockholders Agreement (which will replace the Organization Agreement upon the
closing of the Equity Offerings) and entered into the Registration Rights
Agreement.

Currently Smurfit Packaging and Smurfit Holdings, through their ownership
of all of the outstanding Class A Stock, and MSLEF II, through its ownership of
all of the outstanding Class B Stock, each own 50% of the voting common stock of
the Company. MSLEF II, MSLEF II, Inc., Equity Investors, First Plaza Group
Trust, as trustee for certain pension plans ('First Plaza'), and Leeway & Co.,
as nominee for State Street Bank and Trust Co., as trustee for a master pension
trust ('Leeway,' and together with First Plaza, the 'Direct Investors')
(collectively, the 'MSLEF II Group'), and Smurfit Packaging own all of the
non-voting stock of the Company. On December 31, 1993, all of the Old Preferred
Stock owned by Smurfit Packaging was converted into 1,670,000 shares of Class D
Stock. Since such conversion of Old Preferred Stock, each of Smurfit Packaging
and the MSLEF II Group own, through their ownership of Class D Stock and Class C
Stock, respectively, 50% of the non-voting common stock of the Company.

The Company's capital stock currently consists of Class A Stock, Class B
Stock, Class C Stock, Class D Stock and Class E common stock (the 'Class E
Stock' and, together with the Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Stock, the
'Old Common Stock'). The classes of stock comprising the Old Common Stock are
identical in all respects except with respect to certain voting rights, and
certain exchange provisions that do not affect the percentage of the Company
owned by SIBV and MSLEF II. The Company's Class E Stock is non-voting stock
reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan. In the
Reclassification, the Old Common Stock, which consists of five classes of stock,
will be converted into one class, on a basis of ten shares of Common Stock for
each share of the Old Common Stock. Following the Reclassification, the
Company's only class of common stock will be Common Stock. Immediately prior to
the consummation of the Equity Offerings, shares of Common Stock will
be outstanding and such stock will be owned by the Company's stockholders in
proportion to their ownership of the Old Common Stock as described in the two
preceding paragraphs. Substantially concurrently with the consummation of the
Equity Offerings, SIBV (or a corporate affiliate) will purchase
shares of Common Stock from the Company pursuant to the SIBV

67

<PAGE>
Investment. Accordingly, following the consummation of the Equity Offerings and
the SIBV Investment, MSLEF II Associated Entities and SIBV through its
subsidiaries will beneficially own % and %, respectively, of the shares of
Common Stock then outstanding. See 'Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners'.

The relationships among JSC, CCA, the Company and its stockholders are set
forth in a number of agreements described below. The summary descriptions herein
of the terms of such agreements do not purport to be complete and are subject
to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, all of the provisions
of such agreements, which have been filed as exhibits to the Registration
Statement of which this Prospectus forms a part. Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined below or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the meanings given to them in
such agreements. Any reference to either SIBV or MSLEF II in the following
descriptions of the Organization Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement or in
references to the terms of those agreements set forth in this Prospectus shall
be deemed to include their permitted transferees, unless the context indicates
otherwise.

THE ORGANIZATION AGREEMENT

Since the 1989 Transaction, the Company has been operated pursuant to the
terms of the Organization Agreement, which has been amended on various
occasions. The Organization Agreement, among other things, provides generally
for the election of directors, the selection of officers and the day-to-day
management of the Company. The Organization Agreement provides that one-half of
the directors of each of the Company, CCA and JSC be elected by the holders of
the Class A Stock (Smurfit Holdings and Smurfit Packaging) and one-half by the
holders of the Class B Stock (MSLEF II) and that officers of such companies be
designated by the designees of Smurfit Holdings and Smurfit Packaging on the
respective boards, except that the Chief Financial Officer of the Company be
designated by the holders of the Class B Stock (MSLEF II). The Organization
Agreement also contains certain tag along rights, rights of first refusal and
call and put provisions and provisions relating to a sale of the Company as an
entirety, as well as provisions relating to transactions between the Company and
its affiliates, on the one hand, and SIBV or MSLEF II, as the case may be, and
their respective affiliates, on the other. These latter provisions are similar
to those contained in the Stockholders Agreement described below.

Pursuant to the terms of the Organization Agreement and in connection with
the Recapitalization Plan, the Organization Agreement will terminate upon the
closing of the Equity Offerings and, at or prior to such closing, the
Stockholders Agreement shall be entered into by SIBV, MSLEF II and the Company.

The Organization Agreement also contains provisions whereby each of SIBV,
MSLEF II, MSLEF II, Inc., the Company, JSC, CCA and the holders of Class C Stock
indemnify each other and related parties with respect to certain matters arising
under the Organization Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby,
including losses resulting from a breach of the Organization Agreement. In
addition, the Company, JSC and CCA have also agreed to indemnify SIBV, MSLEF II,
MSLEF II, Inc. and the holders of Class C Stock and related parties against
losses arising out of (i) the conduct and operation of the business of the
Company, JSC or CCA, (ii) any action or failure to act by the Company, JSC or
CCA, (iii) the 1989 Transaction and the 1992 Transaction or (iv) the financing
for the 1989 Transaction. Further, SIBV has agreed to indemnify the Company,
JSC, CCA and each of their subsidiaries against all liability for taxes,
charges, fees, levies or other assessments imposed on such entities as a result
of their not having withheld tax upon the issuance or payment of a specified
note to SIBV and the transfer of certain assets to SIBV in connection with the
1989 Transaction. The foregoing indemnification provisions survive a termination
of the Organization Agreement, including a termination in connection with the
closing of the Equity Offerings.

STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT

The Stockholders Agreement will be entered into at or prior to the
consummation of the Offerings by SIBV, MSLEF II and the Company. The Company,
SIBV and MSLEF II are discussing an amendment to the Stockholders Agreement and
the Registration Rights Agreement which would

68

<PAGE>
modify restrictions contained therein on the ability of MSLEF II and its
affiliates to sell or otherwise dispose of any or all of their shares of Common
Stock.

DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT

For a description of certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement which
relate to the management of the Company (including the election of directors of
the Company), see 'Management -- Provision of Stockholders Agreement Pertaining
to Management'.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; OTHER BUSINESSES

The Stockholders Agreement specifically permits SIBV and MSLEF II (and
their affiliates) to engage in transactions with the Company, JSC and CCA in
addition to certain specific transactions contemplated by the Stockholders
Agreement, provided such transactions (except for (i) transactions between any
of the Company, JSC and CCA, (ii) the transactions contemplated by the
Stockholders Agreement, (iii) the transactions contemplated by the Operating
Agreement, dated as of April 30, 1992, between CCA and Smurfit Paperboard, Inc.
('SPI'), or in the Rights Agreement, dated as of April 30, 1992, between CCA,
SPI and Bankers Trust Company, (iv) the transactions contemplated by the
Registration Rights Agreement, (v) the provision of services pursuant to the
Financial Advisory Services Agreement, dated as of September 12, 1989, by and
among MS&Co., SIBV and the Company, and (vi) the provisions of certain other
specified agreements) are fully and fairly disclosed, have fair and equitable
terms, are reasonably necessary and are treated as a commercial arms-length
transaction with an unrelated third party.

Neither SIBV nor MSLEF II (or their affiliates) is prohibited from owning,
operating or investing in any business, regardless of whether such business is
competitive with the Company, JSC or CCA, nor is either SIBV or MSLEF II
required to disclose its intention to make any such investment to the other or
to advise the Company, JSC or CCA of the opportunity presented by any such
prospective investment.

TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP

In general, transfers of Common Stock to entities affiliated with SIBV or
the members of the MSLEF II Group are not restricted. The Stockholders Agreement
provides members of the MSLEF II Group the right to 'tag along' pro rata upon
the transfer by SIBV of any Common Stock, other than transfers to affiliates and
sales pursuant to a public offering registered under the Securities Act or
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

No member of the MSLEF II Group may transfer, within any thirty-six month
period, in the aggregate five percent or more of the outstanding Common Stock to
any non-affiliated person or group without SIBV's prior written consent.
Transfers of two percent or more in the aggregate of the outstanding Common
Stock are subject to the right of first refusal on the part of SIBV; transfers
of less than two percent in the aggregate are not restricted by the Stockholders
Agreement. In the event that there is a public trading market for the Common
Stock, no member of the MSLEF II Group may effect a sale of Common Stock
pursuant to rights granted in the Registration Rights Agreement without first
offering the shares to be sold to SIBV for purchase. SIBV and its affiliates
have the right, exercisable on or after August 26, 2002, to purchase all, but
not less than all, of the Common Stock then owned by the MSLEF II Group at a
price equal to the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement).

In general, if JS Group either does not, directly or indirectly, own a
majority of the voting stock of SIBV, or directly or indirectly, have the right
to appoint a majority of the directors and officers of SIBV, then all of the
obligations of MSLEF II and the members of the MSLEF II Group under the
Stockholders Agreement and all the rights of SIBV under the Stockholders
Agreement shall cease.

TERMINATION

The Stockholders Agreement shall terminate either upon mutual agreement of
SIBV and MSLEF II, or at the option of SIBV or the MSLEF II Group, as the case
may be, upon either the

69

<PAGE>
MSLEF II Group or SIBV, respectively, ceasing to own six percent or more of the
outstanding Common Stock.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of August 26, 1992,
between MSLEF II, SIBV and the Company, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto
dated as of April 15, 1993 (the 'Registration Rights Agreement'), entered into
in connection with the 1992 Transaction, MSLEF II and the other members of the
MSLEF II Group have the right, upon a notice (a 'Registration Notice') from
MSLEF II to both the Company and SIBV, to cause the Company to use its best
efforts to register the shares of Common Stock owned by such holders. MSLEF II
may not deliver a Registration Notice until the earlier of (a) consummation of
the refinancing of certain long-term debt of CCA and (b) December 31, 1997. Upon
the consummation of the Recapitalization Plan clause (a) of the preceding
sentence will be satisfied and MSLEF II will be entitled to exercise its demand
registration rights as described herein. The MSLEF II Group is entitled to four
such demand registrations pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, two of
which MSLEF II will have the right to effect prior to the Company effecting a
common stock registration for its own account. MSLEF II may not, however,
deliver a Registration Notice (i) until the conclusion of any pending Company
Registration Process (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), (ii)
within 30 days of the conclusion of a MSLEF II Registration Process (as defined
in the Registration Rights Agreement), or (iii) in certain other limited
situations. The Company is generally prohibited from 'piggybacking' and selling
stock for its own account on a registration effected pursuant to a Registration
Notice except after the second completed registration for MSLEF II, in which
event MSLEF II may require that any such securities which are 'piggybacked' be
offered and sold on the same terms as the securities offered by MSLEF II. The
Registration Rights Agreement also sets forth certain waiting periods following
sales by MSLEF II pursuant to a registration statement. The MSLEF II Group is
entitled, subject to certain limitations, to register its Common Stock in
connection with a registration statement prepared by the Company to register
Common Stock or any equity securities exercisable for, convertible into, or
exchangeable for Common Stock. The Company, SIBV and MSLEF II are discussing an
amendment to the Registration Rights Agreement which would modify restrictions
contained therein on the ability of MSLEF II to exercise its demand registration
rights.

The Company will pay all registration expenses (other than underwriting
discounts and commissions) in connection with MSLEF II's first two completed
demand registrations and all registrations made in connection with a Company
registration. The Registration Rights Agreement also contains customary terms
and provisions with respect to, among other things, registration procedures and
certain rights to indemnification and contribution granted by parties thereunder
in connection with the registration of Common Stock subject to such agreement.

FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES AGREEMENT

Under a financial advisory services agreement (the 'Financial Advisory
Services Agreement'), MS&Co. agreed to act as the Company's financial advisor
and provided certain services and earned certain fees in connection with its
roles in the 1989 Transaction, with an expectation that for the term of the
Organization Agreement, the Company would retain MS&Co. to render it investment
banking services at market rates to be negotiated.

OTHER TRANSACTIONS

In connection with the 1986 acquisition of CCA, CCA and SIBV entered into
an agreement pursuant to which CCA granted SIBV an option to purchase CCA's
non-U.S. operations (the 'CCA Option'). In 1987, SIBV exercised the CCA Option
with respect to CCA's European, Venezuelan and Puerto Rican subsidiaries for an
aggregate cash price of $64.3 million, which was approximately equal to CCA's
investment as of the date of exercise. In June 1989, SIBV exercised the
remainder of the CCA Option and purchased CCA's beneficial interests in its
Mexican and Colombian subsidiaries for an

70

<PAGE>
aggregate cash price of approximately $150.7 million, which was approximately
equal to CCA's investment as of the date of exercise.

In the 1989 Transaction, (i) the Company acquired the entire equity
interest in JSC, (ii) JSC (through its ownership of JSC Enterprises) acquired
the entire equity interest in CCA, (iii) The Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity
Fund, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ('MSLEF I'), and certain other
private investors, including MS&Co. and certain limited partners of MSLEF I
investing in their individual capacity (collectively, the 'MSLEF I Group')
received $500 million in respect of their shares of CCA common stock and (iv)
SIBV received $41.75 per share, or an aggregate of approximately $1.25 billion,
in respect of its shares of JSC stock, and the public stockholders received $43
per share of JSC stock. Certain assets of JSC and CCA were also transferred to
SIBV or one of its affiliates (the 'Designated Assets'). Pursuant to a tender
offer and consent solicitation for certain debentures of CCA which were
outstanding prior to the consummation of the 1989 Transaction, MS&Co. received
an aggregate of $3.7 million in consideration. MS&Co. also received $29.5
million for serving in its capacity as financial advisor to the Company in
connection with the 1989 Transaction. In addition, MS&Co. as underwriter of the
Subordinated Debt received aggregate net discounts and commissions of $34.6
million. In connection with the sale of the Secured Notes to Morgan Stanley
International, MS&Co. received a placement fee of $7.5 million from CCA; in
addition, CCA agreed to indemnify MS&Co. against certain liabilities in
connection therewith, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

In connection with the issuance of the 1993 Notes, the Company entered into
an agreement with SIBV whereby SIBV committed to purchase up to $200 million
aggregate principal amount of 11 1/2% Junior Subordinated Notes maturing 2005 to
be issued by the Company. From time to time until December 31, 1994, the
Company, at its option, may issue the Junior Subordinated Notes, the proceeds of
which must be used to repurchase or otherwise retire Subordinated Debt. The
Company is obligated to pay SIBV for letter of credit fees incurred by SIBV in
connection with this commitment in addition to an annual commitment fee of
1.375% on the undrawn principal amount. The amount payable for such commitment
for 1993 was $2.9 million. The above commitments will be terminated upon the
consummation of the Offerings.

Net sales by JSC to JS Group, its subsidiaries and affiliates were $18.4
million, $22.8 million and $21.0 million for the years ended December 31, 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively. Net sales by JS Group, its subsidiaries and
affiliates to JSC were $49.3 million, $60.1 million and $11.8 million for the
years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Product sales to and
purchases from JS Group, its subsidiaries and affiliates were consummated on
terms generally similar to those prevailing with unrelated parties.

JSC provides certain subsidiaries and affiliates of JS Group with general
management and elective management services under separate management services
agreements. The services provided include, but are not limited to, management
information services, accounting, tax and internal auditing services, financial
management and treasury services, manufacturing and engineering services,
research and development services, employee benefit plan and management
services, purchasing services, transportation services and marketing services.
In consideration of general management services, JSC is paid a fee up to 2% of
the subsidiaries' or affiliates' gross sales, which fee amounted to $2.3
million, $2.4 million and $2.5 million for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. In
consideration for elective services, JSC received approximately $3.5 million,
$3.2 million and $2.9 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, for its cost
of providing such services. In addition, JSC paid JS Group and its affiliates
$0.4 million in 1993, $0.3 million in 1992 and $0.7 million in 1991 for
management services and certain other services.

In October 1991, an affiliate of JS Group completed a rebuild of the No. 2
paperboard machine owned by it, located in CCA's Fernandina Beach, Florida
paperboard mill (the 'Fernandina Mill'). Pursuant to the Fernandina Operating
Agreement, CCA operates and manages the machine, which is owned by a subsidiary
of SIBV. As compensation to CCA for its services, the affiliate of JS Group
agreed to reimburse CCA for production and manufacturing costs directly
attributable to the No. 2 paperboard machine and to pay CCA a portion of the
indirect manufacturing, selling and administrative costs incurred by CCA for the
entire Fernandina Mill. The compensation is determined by applying various
formulas and agreed upon amounts to the subject costs. The amounts reimbursed to
CCA totaled $62.2 million, $54.7 million and $10.9 million in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.

71

<PAGE>
CCA, JS Group and MSLEF II have had discussions from time to time regarding
the purchase of the No. 2 paperboard machine in the Fernandina Mill by the
Company from JS Group in exchange for cash or Common Stock. No agreement has
been reached as to any such transaction. The Company expects, however, that it
may in the future reach an agreement with regard to such acquisition from JS
Group but cannot predict when and on what terms such acquisition would be
consummated. Such acquisition will occur only if it is approved by the Board of
Directors of the Company and is determined by the Board of Directors to be on
terms no less favorable than a sale made to a third party in an arm's length
transaction.

During 1990, certain assets of CCA comprising the business unit performing
management services for the foreign subsidiaries previously owned by CCA were
sold to a subsidiary of JS Group at a price equal to their net book value of
approximately $5.2 million. Net sales and income from operations related to
these assets were not material. Payment for the assets was received in February
1991.

On February 21, 1986, JSC purchased from Times Mirror 80% of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of SNC for approximately $132 million, including a
promissory note to National Westminster Bank plc in the amount of $42 million
(the 'Subordinated Note'). The Subordinated Note was guaranteed by JS Group. In
the 1992 Transaction, the Company prepaid $19.1 million aggregate principal
amount on the Subordinated Note. The remaining amount of $22.9 million was due
and paid on February 22, 1993.

DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS

The following is a brief discussion of the basic terms of and the
instruments governing certain indebtedness of the Company. The following
discussion does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to, the instruments governing the respective
indebtedness, which instruments are filed as exhibits to the Registration
Statement of which this Prospectus is a part.

TERMS OF NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT

GENERAL

Pursuant to a commitment letter dated February 10, 1994 (the 'Commitment
Letter') among Chemical Bank ('Chemical'), Chemical Securities Inc. ('CSI'),
Bankers Trust Company ('Bankers Trust'), BT Securities Corporation ('BTSC'), JSC
and CCA, Chemical has committed to provide $250 million of the New Bank
Facilities (as defined below), Bankers Trust has committed to provide $250
million of the New Bank Facilities and CSI and BTSC have agreed to use their
best efforts to assemble a syndicate of financial institutions (the 'Lenders')
to provide the balance of the remaining commitments for the New Bank Facilities
in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, all upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, including the
execution of definitive financing agreements.

Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, the New Bank Facilities are expected to
consist of (i) the New Term Loans, consisting of two senior secured term loan
facilities to be provided to CCA in an aggregate principal amount of $1.05
billion, to be allocated between the Delayed Term Loan in an aggregate principal
amount of $850 million and the Initial Term Loan in an aggregate principal
amount of $200 million and (ii) the New Revolving Credit Facility consisting of
a seven year senior secured revolving credit facility available to JSC and CCA
in an aggregate principal amount of $450 million, of which up to $150 million
will be available as a letter of credit facility (the 'Letter of Credit
Facility').

The Commitment Letter provides that the commitments of Chemical and Bankers
Trust will terminate unless definitive financing agreements with respect thereto
shall have been executed and delivered on or prior to June 30, 1994.

In connection with the New Bank Facilities, Chemical will act as the
administrative agent (in such capacity, the 'Agent'), Chemical and Bankers Trust
will act as senior managing agents and CSI and BTSC will act as the arrangers
for the New Bank Facilities. The Commitment Letter also contemplates that
certain managing agents will be appointed for the New Bank Facilities.

72

<PAGE>
JSC and CCA have agreed, jointly and severally, to pay certain fees to the
Agent for its own account and for the account of the other Lenders in connection
with the New Bank Facilities, payable as follows: (i) a commitment fee of 1/2 of
1% per annum on the undrawn amount of the Initial Term Loan and the New
Revolving Credit Facility, accruing, with respect to each Lender, on the date of
acceptance of such Lender's commitment and (ii) with respect to each Lender
which has a commitment under the Delayed Term Loan, (A) 1/2 of 1% per annum on
the amount of such commitment accruing for the period from and including the
date of acceptance of such Lender's commitment to but excluding the date of the
initial funding of the New Bank facilities (the 'Closing Date') or the earlier
termination of such Lender's commitment and (B) 3/4 of 1% per annum on the
undrawn amount of such Lender's commitment, accruing from and including the
Closing Date to the date of the funding of the Delayed Term Loan. All such
commitment fees will be payable on the Closing Date and, thereafter, in arrears
at the end of each quarter and upon termination of any commitment. The fees
payable in respect of letters of credit provided under the New Revolving Credit
Facility are in an amount equal to the greater of (a) the margin in excess of
the Adjusted LIBOR Rate applicable to the New Revolving Credit Facility at such
time minus 1/2 of 1% and (b) 1%. In addition, a separate fronting fee shall be
payable by JSC and CCA to the bank issuing the letters of credit for its own
account in an amount to be agreed. All letter of credit fees shall be payable on
the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit under the New
Revolving Credit Facility, and shall be payable in arrears at the end of each
quarter and upon the termination of the New Revolving Credit Facility. CSI, BTSC
and the Lenders shall receive such other fees as have been separately agreed
upon with CSI, BTSC, Chemical and Bankers Trust.

Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, JSC and CCA agreed, regardless of
whether the financing agreements relating to the New Bank Facilities are
executed or the commitments to provide the New Bank Facilities are terminated,
to reimburse Chemical, Bankers Trust, CSI and BTSC for, among other things, all
of their respective out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred or sustained by
such entities in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Commitment
Letter and to indemnify Chemical, Bankers Trust, CSI and BTSC, and each
director, officer, employee and affiliate thereof against certain claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses incurred or asserted in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter.

THE NEW BANK FACILITIES

The New Bank Facilities will be provided pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the New Credit Agreement.

Borrowings under the Initial Term Loan will be used, together with the
proceeds of the Equity Offerings, the Debt Offerings and the SIBV Investment, to
consummate the Bank Debt Refinancing. Borrowings under the Delayed Term Loan
must be made on or before December 15, 1994 and will be used solely to redeem or
repurchase the Subordinated Debt and pay accrued interest and the applicable
redemption premiums thereon, to repay amounts drawn under the New Revolving
Credit Facility prior to December 15, 1994 for the purpose of repurchasing
Subordinated Debt, and to pay the related fees and expenses in connection with
such repurchase or redemption. Borrowings under the New Revolving Credit
Facility are to be used for the sole purpose of providing working capital for
JSC, CCA and their subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes
including to fund open market or privately negotiated purchases of Subordinated
Debt prior to December 15, 1994. Amounts borrowed and outstanding under the New
Revolving Credit Facility to finance purchases of Subordinated Debt which
aggregate at least $20 million will be repaid with the proceeds of borrowings
from time to time under the Delayed Term Loan.

The obligations under the New Credit Agreement will be unconditionally
guaranteed by the Company, JSC, CCA, SNC (but only to the extent permitted under
the Shareholders Agreement, dated as of February 21, 1986, between JSC and Times
Mirror) and certain other existing and subsequently acquired or organized
material subsidiaries of the Company, JSC and CCA (each such entity providing
such a guaranty, a 'Guarantor'). The obligations of JSC and CCA under the New
Credit Agreement (including all guarantee obligations of JSC and CCA in respect
thereof) will be secured by a security interest in substantially all of the
assets of JSC, CCA and their material subsidiaries, with the exception

73

<PAGE>
of trade receivables of JSC, CCA and their material subsidiaries sold to JSFC,
and by a pledge of all the capital stock of JSC, CCA and each material
subsidiary of the Company, JSC and CCA.

The Delayed Term Loan and the New Revolving Credit Facility will each
mature on the date which is seven years after the Closing Date. The Initial Term
Loan will mature on the date which is eight years after the Closing Date. The
outstanding principal amount of the New Term Loans is repayable as follows, such
repayments to be made at the end of each six month period after the Closing Date
as follows:

</TABLE>

The New Term Loans and the New Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid at
any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the borrowers. Voluntary
reductions of the unutilized portion of the New Revolving Credit Facility are
permitted at any time. Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, required prepayments
on the New Bank Facilities are to be made in an amount equal to (i) 75% of
Excess Cash Flow (to be defined as the parties shall mutually agree), reducing
to 50% of Excess Cash Flow upon the satisfaction of certain performance tests to
be agreed, (ii) 100% of the net proceeds of the issuance or incurrence of
certain indebtedness (not including the Debt Offerings), (iii) 100% of the net
proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales, (iv) 100% of the net
proceeds of certain condemnation or insurance proceeds, (v) in the event the
gross proceeds from the Equity Offerings and any other equity infusion in the
Company is less than $500 million (the amount by which $500 million exceeds such
gross proceeds, the 'Differential'), the lesser of (A) 100% of the net proceeds
to the Company of the sale of Common Stock in connection with the exercise of
the underwriters' overallotment option, if any, in connection with the Equity
Offerings and (B) the amount of the Differential, and (vi) 25% of the net
proceeds of the issuance of any other equity securities (other than the Equity
Offerings and the exercise of management stock options). Required prepayments
will be allocated pro rata between the Delayed Term Loan and the Initial Term
Loan, and will be applied pro rata against the remaining scheduled amortization
payments under each of the New Term Loans (and, if the Delayed Term Loan has not
then been drawn, the amount allocable thereto will permanently reduce the
commitments thereunder) or, if the New Term Loans have been fully repaid, to
permanently reduce the then existing commitments under the New Revolving Credit
Facility.

Interest on indebtedness outstanding under the Delayed Term Loan and the
New Revolving Credit Facility, from and including the Closing Date to but
excluding the first anniversary of the Closing Date, will be payable at a rate
per annum, selected at the option of the borrower, equal to the ABR Rate (as
defined below) plus 1.5% per annum or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus 2.5% per
annum. From and including the first anniversary of the Closing Date and
thereafter, the margin in excess of the ABR Rate or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate
applicable to such New Bank Facilities will be determined by reference to

74

<PAGE>
certain financial tests. Interest on indebtedness outstanding under the Initial
Term Loan will be payable at a rate per annum, selected at the option of CCA,
equal to the ABR Rate plus 2% per annum or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus 3% per
annum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the first 90 days following the
Closing Date, all such borrowings may only be made with reference to the ABR
Rate or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for one month borrowings. All overdue
installments of principal and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on
borrowings accruing interest based on the ABR Rate or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate
shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2% in excess of the interest
rate then borne by such borrowings. The borrowers shall have the option of
selecting the type of borrowing and the length of the interest period applicable
thereto.

'ABR Rate' shall mean the higher of (a) the rate at which Chemical
announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (b) 1/2 of 1% in excess
of the Federal Funds Rate and (c) 1% in excess of the base certificate of
deposit rate.

'Adjusted LIBOR Rate' shall mean the London Interbank Offered Rate,
adjusted for statutory reserves at all times.

Interest based on the ABR Rate and the Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall be
determined based on the number of days elapsed over a 360 day year. Interest
based on the (i) ABR Rate shall be payable quarterly and (ii) Adjusted LIBOR
Rate shall be payable at the end of the applicable interest period but in any
event not less often than quarterly.

The New Credit Agreement will contain certain representations and
warranties, certain negative, affirmative and financial covenants, certain
conditions and certain events of default which are customarily required for
similar financings, in addition to other representations, warranties, covenants,
conditions and events of default appropriate to the specific transactions
contemplated thereby. Such covenants will include restrictions and limitations
of dividends, redemptions and repurchases of capital stock, the incurrence of
debt, liens, leases, sale-leaseback transactions, capital expenditures, the
issuance of stock, transactions with affiliates, the making of loans,
investments and certain payments, and on mergers, acquisitions and asset sales,

as minimum levels of consolidated earnings before depreciation, interest, taxes
and amortization, and minimum interest coverage ratios.

Events of default under the New Credit Agreement will include, among other
things, (i) failure to pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts when due;
(ii) violation of covenants; (iii) failure of any representation or warranty

indebtedness under the New Credit Agreement or of the security interests granted
to the Lenders, in certain cases with appropriate grace periods to be agreed
upon.

The conditions to the borrowing of the Delayed Term Loan are set forth

The foregoing summary of the Commitment Letter is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the text of such letter, a copy of which has been filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement
of which this Prospectus forms a part.

SECURITIZATION

In 1991, JSC and CCA entered into the Securitization in order to reduce its
borrowings under the 1989 Credit Agreement. The Securitization involved the sale
of Receivables to JSFC, a special purpose subsidiary of JSC. Under the
Securitization, JSFC currently has borrowings of $182.3 million outstanding from
EFC, a third-party owned corporation not affiliated with JSC, and has pledged
its interest in such Receivables to EFC. EFC issued CP Notes and Term Notes. EFC
also entered into a liquidity facility with the Liquidity Banks and a
subordinated loan agreement with the Subordinated Lender to provide additional
sources of funding. EFC pledged its interest in the Receivables assigned to it
by JSFC to secure EFC's obligations to the Liquidity Banks, the Subordinated
Lender, and the

75

<PAGE>
holders of the CP Notes and the Term Notes. Neither the Company nor JSFC is a
guarantor of CP Notes, the Term Notes or borrowings under the liquidity
facility. See Note 5 to the Company's consolidated financial statements and
'Recapitalization Plan -- Consents and Waivers -- Securitization'.

TERMS OF 1993 NOTES

In April 1993, CCA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1993
Notes. The 1993 Notes are unsecured senior obligations of CCA and will mature
April 1, 2003. The 1993 Notes bear interest at 9.75% per annum. Interest is
payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1, of each year. The 1993 Notes are
not redeemable prior to maturity.

The 1993 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of CCA, which rank pari
passu with the other senior indebtedness of CCA, including, without limitation,
CCA's obligations under the New Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes, and are
senior in right to payment to the Subordinated Debt. CCA's obligations under the
New Credit Agreement, but not the 1993 Notes, will be secured by liens on
substantially all the assets of CCA and its subsidiaries with the exception of
cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The secured indebtedness will
have priority over the 1993 Notes with respect to the assets securing such
indebtedness.

The 1993 Note Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other
things, limit the ability of JSC and its subsidiaries (including CCA) to incur
indebtedness, pay dividends, engage in transactions with stockholders and
affiliates, issue capital stock, create liens, sell assets, enter into
sale-leaseback transactions, engage in mergers and consolidations and make
investments in unrestricted subsidiaries. The limitations imposed by the
covenants on JSC and its subsidiaries (including CCA) are subject to certain
exceptions.

Upon a Change of Control (as defined below), CCA is required to make an
offer to purchase the 1993 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest. Certain transactions with
affiliates of the Company may not constitute a Change of Control. 'Change of
Control' is defined to mean such time as (i)(a) a person or group, other than
MSLEF II, Morgan Stanley Group, SIBV, JS Group and any affiliate thereof,
(collectively, the 'Original Stockholders'), becomes the beneficial owner of
more than 35% of the total voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of
the Company or a parent of the Company and (b) the Original Stockholders
beneficially own, directly or indirectly, less than the then outstanding voting
stock of the Company or a parent of the Company beneficially owned by such
person or group; (ii)(a) a person or group, other than the Original
Stockholders, becomes the beneficial owner of more than 35% of the total voting
power of the then outstanding voting stock of JSC, (b) the Original Stockholders
beneficially own, directly or indirectly, less than the then outstanding voting
stock of JSC beneficially owned by such person or group and (c) CCA is a
subsidiary of JSC at the time that the later of (a) and (b) above occurs; or
(iii) individuals who at the beginning of any period of two consecutive calendar
years constituted the Board of Directors of JSC (together with any new directors
whose election by the Board of Directors or whose nomination for election by
JSC's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members
of the Board of Directors of JSC then still in office who either were members of
the Board of Directors of JSC at the beginning of such period or whose election
or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to
constitute a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of JSC then in
office. Pursuant to the Proposed 1993 Note Amendment, the Company and JSC are
seeking to eliminate clause (iii) above.

The payment of principal and interest on the 1993 Notes is unconditionally
guaranteed on a senior basis by JSC. Such guarantee ranks pari passu with the
other senior indebtedness of JSC, including, without limitation, JSC's
obligations under the New Credit Agreement (including its guarantees of CCA's
obligations thereunder) and JSC's guarantee of CCA's obligations under the
Senior Notes, and is senior in right of payment to JSC's guarantees of the
Subordinated Debt. JSC's obligations under the New Credit Agreement, but not its
guarantees of the 1993 Notes, will be secured by liens on substantially all the
assets of JSC and its subsidiaries with the exception of cash and cash
equivalents and trade receivables, and guaranteed by CCA and certain
subsidiaries of JSC and CCA. The secured indebtedness will have priority over
JSC's guarantees of the 1993 Notes with respect to the assets securing such
indebtedness. In the event that (i) a purchaser of capital stock of CCA acquires
a majority

76

<PAGE>
of the voting rights thereunder or (ii) there occurs a merger or consolidation
of CCA that results in CCA having a parent other than JSC and, at the time of
and after giving effect to such transaction, such purchaser or parent satisfies
certain minimum net worth and cash flow requirements, JSC will be released from
its guarantee of the 1993 Notes. Such sale, merger or consolidation will be
prohibited unless certain other requirements are met, including that the
purchaser or the entity surviving such a merger or consolidation expressly
assumes JSC's or CCA's obligations, as the case may be, and that no Event of
Default (as defined in the 1993 Note Indenture) occur or be continuing.

The net proceeds from the offering of the 1993 Notes were used to repay
certain revolving credit indebtedness and term loan indebtedness outstanding
under the Old Bank Facilities. The Company has also entered into reverse
interest rate swap agreements which hedge a portion of the 1993 Note issue.

MS&Co. acted as underwriter in connection with the original offering of the
1993 Notes and received an underwriting discount of $12.5 million in connection
therewith.

In connection with implementing the Recapitalization Plan, the Company
intends to amend the terms of the 1993 Note Indenture. Among other things, the
Proposed 1993 Note Amendment will modify the provisions of the 1993 Note
Indenture which limit the ability of the Company, JSC and CCA to incur
indebtedness and to make certain restricted payments. See 'Recapitalization
Plan -- Consents and Waivers'.

TERMS OF SENIOR NOTES

Concurrently with the Equity Offerings, CCA is offering $500 million
aggregate principal amount of % Series A Senior Notes due 2004 and $100
million aggregate principal amount of % Series B Senior Notes due 2002 in the
Debt Offerings. The Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations of CCA with
interest payable semiannually on and , of each year.

The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of CCA, which rank pari
passu with the other senior indebtedness of CCA, including, without limitation,
CCA's obligations under the New Credit Agreement and the 1993 Notes, and are
senior in right to payment to the Subordinated Debt. CCA's obligations under the
New Credit Agreement, but not the Senior Notes, will be secured by liens on
substantially all the assets of CCA and its subsidiaries with the exception of
cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The secured indebtedness will
have priority over the Senior Notes with respect to the assets securing such
indebtedness.

The Senior Notes are redeemable in whole or in part at the option of CCA,
at any time on or after , 1999, at the following redemption
prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) together with accrued and
unpaid interest to the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period
commencing:

</TABLE>

The indentures relating to the Senior Notes (the 'Senior Note Indentures')
contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of JSC and
its subsidiaries (including CCA) to incur indebtedness, pay dividends, engage in
transactions with stockholders and affiliates, issue capital stock, create
liens, sell assets, engage in mergers and consolidations and make investments in
unrestricted subsidiaries. The limitations imposed by the covenants on JSC and
its subsidiaries (including CCA) are subject to certain exceptions.

Upon a Change of Control, CCA is required to make an offer to purchase the
Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to % of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued interest. Certain transactions with affiliates of the Company may
not constitute a change of Control. 'Change of

77

<PAGE>
Control' is defined to mean such time as (i)(a) a person or group, other than
the Original Stockholders, becomes the beneficial owner of more than 35% of the
total voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the Company or a
parent of the Company and (b) the Original Stockholders beneficially own,
directly or indirectly, less than the then outstanding voting stock of the
Company or a parent of the Company beneficially owned by such person or group;
or (ii)(a) a person or group, other than the Original Stockholders, becomes the
beneficial owner of more than 35% of the total voting power of the then
outstanding voting stock of JSC, (b) the Original Stockholders beneficially own,
directly or indirectly, less than the then outstanding voting stock of JSC
beneficially owned by such person or group and (c) CCA is a subsidiary of JSC at
the time that the later of (a) and (b) above occurs.

The payment of principal and interest on the Senior Notes is
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by JSC. Such guarantee ranks pari
passu with the other senior indebtedness of JSC, including, without limitation,
JSC's obligations under the New Credit Agreement (including its guarantees of
CCA's obligations thereunder) and JSC's guarantee of CCA's obligations under the
1993 Notes, and is senior in right of payment to JSC's guarantees of the
Subordinated Debt. JSC's obligations under the New Credit Agreement, but not its
guarantees of the Senior Notes, will be secured by liens on substantially all
the assets of JSC and its subsidiaries with the exception of cash and cash
equivalents and trade receivables, and guaranteed by CCA and certain
subsidiaries of JSC and CCA. The secured indebtedness will have priority over
JSC's guarantees of the Senior Notes with respect to the assets securing such
indebtedness. In the event that (i) a purchaser of capital stock of CCA acquires
a majority of the voting rights thereunder or (ii) there occurs a merger or
consolidation of CCA that results in CCA having a parent other than JSC and, at
the time of and after giving effect to such transaction, such purchaser or
parent satisfies certain minimum net worth and cash flow requirements, JSC will
be released from its guarantee of the Senior Notes. Such sale, merger or
consolidation will be prohibited unless certain other requirements are met,
including that the purchaser or the entity surviving such a merger or
consolidation expressly assumes JSC's or CCA's obligations, as the case may be,
and that no Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Note Indenture) occur or
be continuing.

The net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes will be used to
effect the Bank Debt Refinancing, as contemplated by the Recapitalization Plan.
See 'Recapitalization Plan'.

MS&Co. is acting as underwriter in connection with the original offering of
the Senior Notes and will receive an underwriting discount of $ million in
connection therewith.

SUBSTITUTION TRANSACTION

JSC is currently the guarantor on all of CCA's outstanding public
indebtedness (consisting of the 1993 Notes and the three classes of Subordinated
Debt) and will similarly guarantee the Senior Notes. The Company will organize a
new subsidiary ('Smurfit Interco'), all the outstanding capital stock of which
will be owned by the Company and which will own all of the outstanding capital
stock of JSC, but which will have no other significant assets (other than
intercompany note receivables) and, except for guarantees of indebtedness of
CCA, no indebtedness for borrowed money. Subject to obtaining the consent of the
holders of the 1993 Notes to the Proposed 1993 Note Amendment and the consents
necessary to amend the Securitization documents, the Company intends (i) to
cause Smurfit Interco to replace JSC as guarantor under the indentures relating
to CCA's public indebtedness (and under the New Credit Agreement), (ii) to amend
such indentures so that references to JSC therein and in the 1993 Notes and the
Senior Notes shall be changed to be Smurfit Interco and (iii) to cause JSC to
merge into CCA, which shall succeed to all of JSC's assets and liabilities
(except that any guaranty of obligations of CCA by JSC shall be extinguished)
(collectively, the 'Substitution Transaction'). The purpose of the Substitution
Transaction is to maximize operating efficiencies by combining the Company's two
key operating subsidiaries into one entity and achieve cost savings.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

GENERAL

The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of shares of
Common Stock and shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share
(the 'Preferred Stock'). JSC's authorized capital stock consists of 1,000 shares
of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of which 1,000 shares of common stock
are issued and outstanding and are owned by the Company. CCA's authorized
capital stock consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of which 1,000 shares are issued and outstanding and are indirectly owned
by the Company. The following summary does not purport to be complete and is
subject to the detailed provisions of, and qualified in its entirety by
reference to, the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws,
copies of which have been filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement of
which this Prospectus is a part, and to the applicable provisions of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.

COMMON STOCK

As of the date of this Prospectus, shares of Common Stock were
issued and outstanding.

Voting Rights. Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to
one vote in elections of directors and all other matters submitted to a vote of
stockholders. The Common Stock does not have cumulative voting rights, which
means that holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock voting for the
election of directors can elect all directors then being elected. Upon the
consummation of the Equity Offerings, SIBV and MSLEF II will enter into the
Stockholders Agreement, which provides, among other things, for the election of
the Company's Board of Directors. See 'Certain Transactions -- Stockholders
Agreement' and 'Management -- Provisions of Stockholders Agreement Pertaining to
Management'. Following the consummation of the Equity Offerings and the SIBV
Investment, SIBV and MSLEF II Associated Entities collectively will beneficially
own % of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, and consequently they
collectively will have the power, and in accordance with the Stockholders
Agreement intend, to elect all of the Company's directors. See 'Risk
Factors -- Control by Principal Stockholders'.

Dividends. Each share of Common Stock has an equal and ratable right to
receive dividends to be paid from the Company's assets legally available
therefor when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors. The declaration and
payment of dividends on the Common Stock are currently effectively prohibited by
the terms of the Company's outstanding indebtedness. In addition, Delaware law
generally requires that dividends are payable only out of the Company's surplus
or current net profits in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law.
See 'Dividend Policy'.

Liquidation. In the event of the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
the Company, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share equally and
ratably in the assets available for distribution after

80

<PAGE>
payments are made to the Company's creditors and to the holder of any Preferred
Stock of the Company that may be outstanding at the time.

Other. The holders of shares of Common Stock have no preemptive,
subscription, redemption or conversion rights and are not liable for further
call or assessment. All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are, and the
Common Stock offered hereby will be, fully paid and nonassessable.

Prior to the date of this Prospectus, there has been no established public
trading market for the Common Stock. Application will be made to list the Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ' '. See 'Risk
Factors -- Absence of Prior Public Market'.

PREFERRED STOCK

The Board of Directors of the Company is authorized, without further
stockholder action, to divide any or all shares of authorized Preferred Stock
into series and to fix and determine the designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations
or restrictions thereon, of any series so established, including voting powers,
dividend rights, liquidation preferences, redemption rights and conversion or
exchange privileges. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Board of Directors
of the Company has not authorized any series of Preferred Stock and there are no
plans, agreements or understandings for the issuance of any shares of Preferred
Stock.

STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT

The Stockholders Agreement, among other things, provides for the election
of directors of the Company and the selection of officers. See 'Certain
Transactions -- Stockholders Agreement' and 'Management -- Provisions of
Stockholders Agreement Pertaining to Management'.

RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS

Stockholders' rights and related matters are governed by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
its By-laws. Certain provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws of the Company, which are summarized below, may discourage or make more
difficult any attempt by a person or group to obtain control of the Company.

No Stockholder Action by Written Consent; Special Meeting. The Company's
Restated Certificate of Incorporation prohibits stockholders from taking action
by written consent in lieu of an annual or special meeting, and thus
stockholders may only take action at an annual or special meeting called in
accordance with the Company's By-laws. The Company's By-laws provide that
special meetings of stockholders may only be called by (i) the Chairman of the
Board, (ii) the President, (iii) any Vice President, (iv) the Secretary or (v)
any Assistant Secretary. Special meetings may not be called by the stockholders.

Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director
Nominations. The Company's By-laws establish advance notice procedures with
regard to stockholder proposals and the nomination, other than by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, of candidates for
election as directors. These procedures provide that the notice of stockholder
proposals and stockholder nominations for the election of directors at an annual
meeting must be in writing and received by the Secretary of the Company not less
than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the
immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in
the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 30
days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order
to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the 10th
day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was
mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made,
whichever first occurs. The notice of stockholder nominations must set forth
certain information with respect to the stockholder giving the notice and with
respect to each nominee.

Indemnification. The Company's By-laws will provide that the Company shall
advance expenses to and indemnify each director and officer of the Company to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

81

<PAGE>
LIMITATIONS ON DIRECTORS' LIABILITY

The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that no
director of the Company shall be personally liable to the Company or its
stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of
loyalty to the Company or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of
law, (iii) in respect of certain unlawful dividend payments or stock redemptions
or purchases or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit. The effect of these provisions will be to eliminate
the rights of the Company and its stockholders (through stockholders' derivative
suits on behalf of the Company) to recover monetary damages against a director
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director (including breaches resulting from
grossly negligent behavior), except in the situations described above. These
provisions will not limit the liability of directors under federal securities
laws and will not affect the availability of equitable remedies such as an
injunction or rescission based upon a director's breach of his duty of care.

SECTION 203 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ('DGCL') prohibits
certain transactions between a Delaware corporation and an 'interested
stockholder,' which is defined as a person who, together with any affiliates
and/or associates of such person, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 15
percent or more of the outstanding voting shares of a Delaware corporation. This
provision prohibits certain business combinations (defined broadly to include
mergers, consolidations, sales or other dispositions of assets having an
aggregate value of 10 percent or more of the consolidated assets of the
corporation, and certain transactions that would increase the interested
stockholder's proportionate share ownership in the corporation) between an
interested stockholder and a corporation for a period of three years after the
date the interested stockholder acquired its stock, unless (i) the business
combination is approved by the corporation's board of directors prior to the
date the interested stockholder acquired shares; (ii) the interested stockholder
acquired at least 85 percent of the voting stock of the corporation in the
transaction in which it became an interested stockholder; or (iii) the business
combination is approved by a majority of the board of directors and by the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock owned by
disinterested stockholders at an annual or special meeting. A Delaware
corporation, pursuant to a provision in its certificate of incorporation or
by-laws, may choose not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL in which case
such election becomes effective one year after its adoption. The Company
anticipates that it will choose, pursuant to a provision of its Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL.
Such election is expected to become effective on or about the first anniversary
of the completion of the Offerings.

REGISTRAR AND TRANSFER AGENT

[ ] will act as Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Common Stock.

SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE

Upon the completion of the Equity Offerings, the Company will have
shares of Common Stock outstanding, assuming no exercise of the overallotment
option granted to the U.S. Underwriters and assuming the exercise of all other
options granted by the Company. Of these shares, the shares of Common
Stock issued in the Equity Offerings will be freely tradeable without
restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any of
such shares held by 'affiliates' (as defined under the Securities Act) of the
Company. The shares of Common Stock sold by the Company to SIBV (or a corporate
affiliate) pursuant to the SIBV Investment will be shares held by an
'affiliate'. The remaining shares of Common Stock will be deemed
'restricted' securities under the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act
('Rule 144'). Neither shares held by an affiliate nor restricted securities may
be sold in the absence of registration under the Securities Act unless an
exemption from registration is available, including the exemptions contained in
Rule 144.

82

<PAGE>
Generally, Rule 144 provides that a person who has owned restricted
securities for at least two years, or who may be deemed an 'affiliate' of the
Company, is entitled to sell, within any three-month period, up to the number of
restricted securities that does not exceed the greater of (i) one percent of the
then outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (ii) the average weekly trading
volume during the four calendar weeks preceding the date on which notice of sale
is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'Commission'). Sales
under Rule 144 are subject to certain restrictions relating to manner of sale,
volume of sales and the availability of current public information about the
Company. In addition, restricted securities that have been held by a person who
is not an 'affiliate' of the Company for at least three years may be sold under
Rule 144(k) without regard to the volume limitations or current public
information or manner of sale requirements of Rule 144. As defined in Rule 144,
an 'affiliate' of an issuer is a person that directly, or indirectly through the
use of one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under
the common control with, such issuer.

The Company, SIBV and the MSLEF II Associated Entities have agreed, subject
to certain exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose
of shares of Common Stock for a period of 180 days after the date of this
Prospectus, without the prior written consent of MS&Co. (except with respect to
shares of Common Stock held by the MSLEF II Associated Entities, for which the
prior written consent of Kidder, Peabody will be required). See 'Underwriters'.

Prior to the Equity Offerings, there has been no public market for the
Common Stock. Trading of the Common Stock is expected to commence following the
completion of the Equity Offerings. There can be no assurance that an active
trading market will develop or continue after the completion of the Equity
Offerings or that the market price of the Common Stock will not decline below
the initial public offering price. No prediction can be made as to the effect,
if any, that future sales of shares, or the availability of shares for future
sale, will have on the market price prevailing from time to time. Sales of
substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that
such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of
the Common Stock or the ability of the Company to raise capital through a public
offering of its equity securities. See 'Risk Factors -- Absence of Prior Public
Market'.

In addition, the Company, MSLEF II and SIBV have entered into the
Registration Rights Agreement providing that MSLEF II shall have certain rights
to have the shares of Common Stock owned by it and certain other parties after
the Equity Offerings registered by the Company under the Securities Act in order
to permit the public sale of such shares. The Stockholders Agreement also grants
SIBV certain rights, including rights of first refusal, to purchase shares held
by MSLEF II and certain related parties. As described under 'Risk
Factors -- Control by Principal Stockholders', MSLEF II's (and its affiliates')
intention is to dispose of the shares of Common Stock owned by them. The timing
of such sales or other dispositions by them (which could include distributions
to the partners of MSLEF II) will depend on market and other conditions, but
could occur or commence relatively soon after the 180 day hold back period. See
'Risk Factors -- Control by Principal Stockholders'. Such dispositions could be
privately negotiated transactions or, subject to SIBV's rights of first refusal,
if applicable, public sales. Sales or dispositions of shares of Common Stock by
MSLEF II to persons, including its limited partners, other than SIBV or its
affiliates could increase the likelihood of a 'Change of Control' being deemed
to have occurred under the indentures relating to the Company's Subordinated
Debt, 1993 Notes and Senior Notes; however, so long as MSLEF II, SIBV and their
affiliates own more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding voting stock of the
Company, no such Change of Control will be deemed to have occurred by reason of
any other person's or group's ownership of the Company's voting stock. See
'Description of Certain Indebtedness'.

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS
FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK

The following is a general discussion of certain United States federal
income and estate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of Common
Stock by 'Non-U.S. Holders'. In general, a 'Non-U.S. Holder' is an individual or
entity other than (i) a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a
corporation or partnership created or organized in the United States or under
the laws of the United States or of any state or (iii) an estate or trust, the
income of which is includable in gross income for

83

<PAGE>
United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its source. The term
'Non-U.S. Holder' does not include individuals who were United States citizens
within the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of this Prospectus and
whose loss of United States citizenship had as one of its principal purposes the
avoidance of United States taxes. This discussion is based on current law and is
for general information only. This discussion does not address aspects of United
States federal taxation other than income and estate taxation and does not
address all aspects of income and estate taxation, nor does it consider any
specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular Non-U.S. Holder.
ACCORDINGLY, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS
REGARDING THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-UNITED STATES INCOME
AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.

DIVIDENDS

In general, dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to United
States withholding tax at a 30% rate (or a lower rate prescribed by an
applicable tax treaty) unless the dividends are either (i) effectively connected
with a trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. Holder within the United
States, or (ii) if certain income tax treaties apply, attributable to a
permanent establishment in the United States maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder.
Dividends effectively connected with such a United States trade or business or
attributable to such a United States permanent establishment generally will not
be subject to withholding tax (if the Non-U.S. Holder files certain forms,
including IRS Form 4224, with the payor of the dividend) and generally will be
subject to United States federal income tax on a net income basis, in the same
manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a resident of the United States. A
Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may be subject to an additional branch
profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an
applicable treaty) on the repatriation from the United States of its
'effectively connected earnings and profits,' subject to certain adjustments. To
determine the applicability of a tax treaty providing for a lower rate of
withholding, dividends paid to an address in a foreign country are presumed
under current Treasury Regulations to be paid to a resident of that country
absent knowledge to the contrary. Treasury regulations proposed in 1984 that
have not been finally adopted, however, would require Non-U.S. Holders to file
certain forms to obtain the benefit of any applicable tax treaty providing for a
lower rate of withholding tax on dividends. Such forms would contain the
Non-U.S. Holder's name and address and an official statement by the competent
authority (as designated in the applicable treaty) in the foreign country
attesting to the Non-U.S. Holder's status as a resident thereof.

SALE OF COMMON STOCK

In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to United States federal
income tax on any gain recognized upon the disposition of Common Stock unless
(i) the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by the
Non-U.S. Holder within the United States or, alternatively, if certain tax
treaties apply, attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States
maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder (and in either such case, the branch profits
tax may also apply if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation); (ii) in the case of
a Non-U.S. Holder who is a nonresident alien individual and holds shares of
stock as a capital asset, such individual is present in the United States for
183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition, and either (a) such
individual has a 'tax home' (as defined for United States federal income tax
purposes) in the United States, or (b) the gain is attributable to an office or
other fixed place of business maintained by such individual in the United
States; (iii) the Non-U.S. Holder is subject to tax pursuant to the provisions
of United States tax law applicable to certain United States expatriates; or
(iv) the Company is or has been a United States real property holding
corporation (a 'USRPHC') for United States federal income tax purposes (which
the Company does not believe that it is or is likely to become) at any time
within the shorter of the five year period preceding such disposition or such
Non-U.S. Holder's holding period. If the Company were or were to become a
USRPHC, gains realized upon a disposition of Common Stock by a Non-U.S. Holder
which did not directly or indirectly own more than 5% of the Common Stock during
the shorter of the periods described above generally would not be subject to
United States federal income tax, provided that the

84

<PAGE>
Common Stock is 'regularly traded' on an established securities market. Since
the Common Stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange, the Company believes
that the Common Stock will be 'regularly traded' on an established securities
market.

ESTATE TAX

Common Stock owned or treated as owned by an individual who is not a
citizen or resident (as defined for United States federal estate tax purposes)
of the United States at the time of death will be includable in the individual's
gross estate for United States federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable
estate tax treaty provides otherwise, and therefore may be subject to United
States federal estate tax.

BACKUP WITHHOLDING, INFORMATION REPORTING AND OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

The Company must report annually to the Internal Revenue Service and to
each Non-U.S. Holder the amount of dividends paid to, and the tax withheld with
respect to, each Non-U.S. Holder. These reporting requirements apply regardless
of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty.
Copies of this information also may be made available under the provisions of a
specific treaty or agreement with the tax authorities in the country in which
the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established.

United States backup withholding (which generally is imposed at the rate of
31% on certain payments to persons that fail to furnish the information required
under the United States information reporting requirements) and information
reporting generally will not apply to dividends paid on Common Stock to a
Non-U.S. Holder at an address outside the United States.

The payment of proceeds from the disposition of Common Stock to or through
a United States office of a broker will be subject to information reporting and
backup withholding unless the owner, under penalties of perjury, certifies,
among other things, its status as a Non-U.S. Holder, or otherwise establishes an
exemption. The payment of proceeds from the disposition of Common Stock to or
through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be subject to
backup withholding and information reporting, except as noted below. In the case
of proceeds from a disposition of Common Stock paid to or through a non-United
States office of a broker that is (i) a United States person, (ii) a 'controlled
foreign corporation' for United States federal income tax purposes or (iii) a
foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income from certain periods is
effectively connected with a United States trade or business, (a) backup
withholding will not apply unless such broker has actual knowledge that the
owner is not a Non-U.S. Holder, and (b) information reporting will apply unless
the broker has documentary evidence in its files that the owner is a Non-U.S.
Holder (and the broker has no actual knowledge to the contrary).

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules from a payment to a Non-U.S. Holder will be refunded or
credited against the Non-U.S. Holder's United States federal income tax
liability, if any, provided that the required information is furnished to the
Internal Revenue Service.

The U.S. Underwriters and the International Underwriters are collectively
referred to as the 'Underwriters'. The Underwriting Agreement provides that the
obligations of the several Underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the
shares of Common Stock offered hereby are subject to the approval of certain
legal matters by their counsel and to certain other conditions. The Underwriters
are obligated to take and pay for all of the shares of Common Stock offered
hereby (other than those covered by the U.S. Underwriters' over-allotment option
described below) if any such shares are taken.

Pursuant to the Agreement Between U.S. and International Underwriters, each
U.S. Underwriter has represented and agreed that, with certain exceptions, (i)
it is not purchasing any U.S. Shares (as defined below) for the account of
anyone other than a United States or Canadian Person (as defined below) and (ii)
it has not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, directly or indirectly,
any U.S. Shares or distribute any prospectus relating to the U.S. Shares outside
the United States or Canada or to anyone other than a United States or Canadian
Person. Pursuant to the Agreement Between U.S. and International Underwriters,
each International Underwriter has represented and agreed that, with certain
exceptions, (i) it is not purchasing any International Shares (as defined below)
for the account of any United States or Canadian Person and (ii) it has not

International Shares or distribute any prospectus relating to the International
Shares within the United States or Canada or to any United States or Canadian
Person. The foregoing limitations do not apply to stabilization transactions or
to certain other transactions specified in the Agreement Between U.S. and
International Underwriters. As used herein, 'United States or Canadian Person'
means any national or resident of the United States or Canada, or any
corporation, pension, profit-sharing or other trust or other entity organized
under the laws of the United States or Canada or of any political subdivision
thereof (other than a branch located outside the United States and Canada of any
United States or Canadian Person) and includes any United States or Canadian
branch of a person who is otherwise not a United States or Canadian Person. All
shares of Common Stock to be purchased by the U.S. Underwriters and the
International Underwriters are referred to herein as the U.S. Shares and the
International Shares, respectively.

Pursuant to the Agreement Between U.S. and International Underwriters,
sales may be made between the U.S. Underwriters and International Underwriters
of any number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to the
Underwriting Agreement as may be mutually agreed. The per share price of any
shares sold shall be the Price to Public set forth on the cover page hereof, in
United

86

<PAGE>
States dollars, less an amount not greater than the per share amount of the
concession to dealers set forth below.

Pursuant to the Agreement Between U.S. and International Underwriters, each
U.S. Underwriter has represented that it has not offered or sold, and has agreed
not to offer or sell, any shares of Common Stock, directly or indirectly, in
Canada in contravention of the securities laws of Canada or any province or
territory thereof and has represented that any offer of Common Stock in Canada
will be made only pursuant to an exemption from the requirement to file a
prospectus in the province or territory of Canada in which such offer is made.
Each U.S. Underwriter has further agreed to send to any dealer who purchases
from it any shares of Common Stock a notice stating in substance that, by
purchasing such Common Stock, such dealer represents and agrees that it has not
offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, directly or indirectly, any of such
Common Stock in Canada or to, or for the benefit of, any resident of Canada in
contravention of the securities laws of Canada or any province or territory
thereof and that any offer of Common Stock in Canada will be made only pursuant
to an exemption from the requirement to file a prospectus in the province of
Canada in which such offer is made, and that such dealer will deliver to any
other dealer to whom it sells any of such Common Stock a notice to the foregoing
effect.

Pursuant to the Agreement Between U.S. and International Underwriters, each
International Underwriter has represented and agreed that (i) it has not offered
or sold and will not offer or sell any shares of Common Stock in the United
Kingdom by means of any document (other than in circumstances which do not
constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies Act 1985);
(ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the
Financial Services Act 1986 with respect to anything done by it in relation to
the shares of Common Stock offered hereby in, from or otherwise involving the
United Kingdom; and (iii) it has only issued or passed on and will only issue or
pass on to any person in the United Kingdom any document received by it in
connection with the issue of the shares of Common Stock, other than any document
which consists of, or is a part of, listing particulars, supplementary listing
particulars or any other document required or permitted to be published by
listing rules under Part IV of the Financial Services Act 1986, if that person
is of a kind described in Article 9(3) of the Financial Services Act 1986
(Investment Advertisements) (Exemptions) Order 1988.

The Underwriters propose to offer part of the Common Stock directly to the
public at the Price to Public set forth on the cover page hereof and part to
certain dealers at a price which represents a concession not in excess of
$ per share under the Price to Public. The Underwriters may allow, and
such dealers may reallow, a concession not in excess of $ per share to
other Underwriters or to certain dealers.

Application will be made to list the Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange, under the symbol ' '. The Underwriters intend to sell the shares of
Common Stock so as to meet the distribution requirements of such listing.

Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company has granted the U.S.
Underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this
Prospectus, to purchase up to 2,195,122 additional shares of Common Stock at the
Price to Public set forth on the cover page hereof, less underwriting discounts
and commissions. The U.S. Underwriters may exercise such option to purchase
solely for the purpose of covering overallotments, if any, made in connection
with the offering of the shares of Common Stock offered hereby. To the extent
such option is exercised, each U.S. Underwriter will become obligated, subject
to certain conditions, to purchase approximately the same percentage of such
additional shares as the number set forth next to such U.S. Underwriter's name
in the preceding table bears to the total number of U.S. Shares offered hereby.

The Company has agreed that, without the prior written consent of MS&Co.,
it will not register for sale or offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise
dispose of any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, for a period of 180 days after the
date of this Prospectus, other than (i) the shares of Common Stock offered
hereby and the shares of Common Stock to be sold to Smurfit Holdings as
described in this Prospectus, (ii) any shares of Common Stock sold upon the
exercise of an option or warrant or the conversion of a security outstanding on
the date of this Prospectus and (iii) any shares of Common Stock sold pursuant
to

87

<PAGE>
existing employee benefit plans of the Company. In addition, SIBV and the MSLEF
II Associated Entities have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of shares of Common Stock for a period of 180 days after the
date of this Prospectus without the prior written consent of MS&Co. (except with
respect to shares of Common Stock held by the MSLEF II Associated Entities, for
which the prior written consent of Kidder, Peabody will be required). See
'Shares Eligible For Future Sale'.

The Company and the Underwriters have agreed to indemnify each other
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

Upon consummation of the Equity Offerings and the SIBV Investment,
affiliates of MS&Co. will own approximately % of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock ( % if the U.S. Underwriters' overallotment option is exercised
in full). See 'Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners'. In addition,
MS&Co. owns approximately $ million aggregate principal amount of the 1993
Notes, approximately $ million aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Subordinated Notes, approximately $ million aggregate principal amount of the
Subordinated Debentures and approximately $ million aggregate principal amount
of the Junior Accrual Debentures.

The provisions of Schedule E ('Schedule E') to the By-laws of the NASD
apply to the U.S. Offering. Accordingly, the public offering price can be no
higher than that recommended by a 'qualified independent underwriter'. The NASD
requires that the 'qualified independent underwriter' (i) be an NASD member
experienced in the securities or investment banking business, (ii) not be an
affiliate of the issuer of the securities and (iii) agree to undertake the
responsibilities and liabilities of an underwriter under the Securities Act. In
accordance with this requirement, Salomon Brothers Inc ('Salomon') is serving in
such role, and the initial public offering price of the Common Stock offered
hereby will not be higher than Salomon's recommended initial public offering
price. Salomon also participated in the preparation of the Registration
Statement of which this Prospectus is a part and has performed due diligence
with respect thereto. The Company has agreed to pay Salomon a fee of $ in
connection with the Equity Offerings and to reimburse Salomon for certain
expenses. The Company has also agreed to indemnify Salomon against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

Pursuant to the provisions of Schedule E, NASD members may not execute
transactions in Common Stock offered hereby to any accounts over which they
exercise discretionary authority without prior written approval of the customer.

Rule 312(g) of the New York Stock Exchange effectively prohibits MS&Co. and
its affiliates, following the Equity Offerings, from effecting any transaction
(except on an unsolicited basis) for the account of any customer in, or making
any recommendation with respect to, the Common Stock.

The Company has reserved up to shares of Common Stock, representing
% of the shares of Common Stock to be sold in the Equity Offerings ( % if
the U.S. Underwriters' overallotment option is exercised in full), for sale to
certain of its directors, officers and other employees at the Price to Public
set forth on the cover page hereof. If such shares are not so sold to directors,
officers and other employees of the Company, they will be sold to the public.

From time to time MS&Co. has provided, and continues to provide, investment
banking services to the Company and its affiliates. See 'Certain Transactions'.

PRICING OF THE OFFERINGS

Prior to the Equity Offerings, there has been no public market for the
Common Stock. The initial public offering price for the Common Stock will be
determined by negotiations between the Company and the Underwriters in
accordance with the recommendation of Salomon, the 'qualified independent
underwriter,' as is required by the by-laws of the NASD. Among the factors to be
considered in determining the initial public offering price will be the sales,
earnings and certain other financial and operating information of the Company in
recent periods, the future prospects of the Company and its industry in general,
and certain ratios, market prices of securities and certain financial and
operating information of companies engaged in activities similar to those of the
Company.

to the Equity Offerings have been passed upon for the Company by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom, New York, New York. Certain legal matters have been
passed upon for the Underwriters by Shearman & Sterling, New York, New York.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
JEFFERSON SMURFIT CORPORATION
(formerly SIBV/MS Holdings, Inc.)

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jefferson
Smurfit Corporation (formerly SIBV/MS Holdings, Inc.) as of December 31, 1993
and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1993. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in
the Index at Item 16(b) of the Registration Statement. These financial
statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Jefferson
Smurfit Corporation at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As described in Note 6 and Note 8 to the financial statements, in 1993, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and postretirement
benefits.

JEFFERSON SMURFIT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993
(TABULAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS)

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (formerly SIBV/MS Holdings, Inc.),
hereinafter referred to as the 'Company', owns 100% of the equity interest in
Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (U.S.) (formerly Jefferson Smurfit Corporation),
hereinafter referred to as 'JSC'. The Company has no operations other than its
investment in JSC. Fifty percent of the voting stock of the Company is owned by
Smurfit Packaging Corporation ('SPC') and Smurfit Holdings B.V. ('SHBV'),
indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Jefferson Smurfit Group plc ('JS Group'),
a public corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The
remaining 50% is owned by The Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, L.P.
('MSLEF II').

In December 1989, pursuant to a series of transactions referred to
hereafter as the '1989 Recapitalization', the Company acquired the entire equity
interest in JSC and Container Corporation of America ('CCA') acquired its equity
interest not owned by JSC. Prior to the 1989 Recapitalization, Smurfit
International B.V. ('SIBV'), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of JS Group,
owned 78% of JSC's outstanding common equity, the public owned the remaining
common equity of JSC and JSC indirectly owned 50% of the common stock and 100%
of the preferred stock of CCA. The other 50% of the common stock of CCA was
owned by The Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund L.P. and other investors
('MSLEF I Group'). Both MSLEF II and MSLEF I Group are affiliates of Morgan
Stanley & Co. Incorporated ('MS&Co.'). Unless otherwise indicated, references to
the Company include JSC and CCA.

For financial accounting purposes, the Company's purchase of the JSC common
equity owned by SIBV and the acquisition by CCA of its common equity owned by
MSLEF I Group were accounted for as purchases of treasury stock, resulting in a
deficit balance in stockholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. The Company's acquisition of JSC's minority interest,
representing approximately 22% of JSC's common equity, was accounted for as a
purchase.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Significant
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At
December 31, 1993 cash and cash equivalents of $42.9 million are maintained as
collateral for obligations under the accounts receivable securitization program
(see Note 5).

Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized at the time products are
shipped.

Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market,
principally under the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method except for $50.6
million in 1993 and $51.9 million in 1992 which are valued at the lower of
average cost or market. First-in, first-out costs (which approximate replacement
costs) exceed the LIFO value by $44.7 million and $46.3 million at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are carried at
cost. Provisions for depreciation and amortization are made using straight-line
rates over the estimated useful lives of the related assets and the terms of the
applicable leases for leasehold improvements.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its estimate of the useful
lives of certain machinery and equipment. Based upon historical experience and
comparable industry practice, the depreciable lives of the papermill machines
that previously ranged from 16 to 20 years were increased to an average of 23
years, while major converting equipment and folding carton presses that
previously averaged 12 years were increased to an average of 20 years. These
changes were made to better reflect

F-7

<PAGE>
JEFFERSON SMURFIT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
DECEMBER 31, 1993
(TABULAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS)

the estimated periods during which such assets will remain in service. The
change had the effect of reducing depreciation expense by $17.8 million and
decreasing net loss by $11.0 million in 1993.

Timberland: The portion of the costs of timberland attributed to standing
timber is charged against income as timber is cut, at rates determined annually,
based on the relationship of unamortized timber costs to the estimated volume of
recoverable timber. The costs of seedlings and reforestation of timberland are
capitalized.

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs: Deferred debt issuance costs are amortized
over the terms of the respective debt obligations using the interest method.

Goodwill: The excess of cost over the fair value assigned to the net assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill and is being amortized using the straight-line
method over 40 years.

Income Taxes: Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of
accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ('SFAS') No. 109,
'Accounting for Income Taxes' (see Note 6).

Interest Rate Swap Agreements: The Company enters into interest rate swap
agreements which involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest
payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount. The
differential to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change and is
recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense.

Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share: The computations of earnings (loss) per
common share are based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding of 6,355,000, 4,831,000 and 4,020,000 during 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, after recognition of preferred dividend requirements in 1992 and
1991 of $21.8 million and $24.2 million, respectively. The computations do not
assume the inclusion of common stock equivalents associated with stock options
or the conversion of the cumulative exchangeable preferred stock as the results
would have been antidilutive.

Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications of prior year presentations
have been made to conform to the 1993 presentation.

3. INVESTMENTS

Equity in loss of affiliates of $39.9 million in 1991, which is net of
deferred income tax benefits of $18.5 million, includes the Company's (i)
write-off of its equity investment in Temboard, Inc., formerly Temboard and
Company Limited Partnership ('Temboard'), totalling $29.3 million, (ii)
write-off of its remaining equity investment in PCL Industries Limited ('PCL')
totaling $6.7 million, and (iii) proportionate share of the net loss of equity
affiliates, including PCL prior to the write-off of that investment, totaling
$3.9 million.

TRANSACTIONS WITH JS GROUP

Transactions with JS Group, its subsidiaries and affiliates were as
follows:

</TABLE>

Product sales to and purchases from JS Group, its subsidiaries, and
affiliates are consummated on terms generally similar to those prevailing with
unrelated parties.

JSC provides certain subsidiaries and affiliates of JS Group with general
management and elective management services under separate Management Services
Agreements. In consideration for general management services, JSC is paid a fee
up to 2% of the subsidiaries' or affiliate's gross sales. In consideration for
elective services, JSC is reimbursed for its direct cost of providing such
services.

In October 1991 an affiliate of JS Group completed a rebuild of the No. 2
paperboard machine owned by the affiliate that is located in CCA's Fernandina
Beach, Florida paperboard mill (the 'Fernandina Mill'). Pursuant to an operating
agreement between CCA and the affiliate, the affiliate engaged CCA to operate
and manage the No. 2 paperboard machine. As compensation to CCA for its services
the affiliate reimburses CCA for production and manufacturing costs directly
attributable to the No. 2 paperboard machine and pays CCA a portion of the
indirect manufacturing, selling and administrative costs incurred by CCA for the
entire Fernandina Mill. The compensation is determined by applying various
formulas and agreed upon amounts to the subject costs. The amounts reimbursed to
CCA are reflected as reductions of cost of goods sold and selling and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

TRANSACTIONS WITH TIMES MIRROR

Under the terms of a long-term agreement, Smurfit Newsprint Corporation
('SNC'), a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, supplies newsprint to Times
Mirror, a minority shareholder of SNC, at amounts which approximate prevailing
market prices. The obligations of the Company and Times Mirror to supply and
purchase newsprint, respectively, are wholly or partially terminable upon the
occurrence of certain defined events. Sales to Times Mirror for 1993, 1992 and
1991 were $115.2 million, $114.0 million and $150.6 million, respectively.

</TABLE>

Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 1993, for the
next five years are $10.3 million in 1994, $220.6 million in 1995, $379.8
million in 1996, $431.5 million in 1997, and $273.0 million in 1998. In
addition, approximately $77.7 million in accrued interest related to the Junior
Subordinated Accrual Debentures (the 'Junior Accrual Debentures') becomes due in
1994. Accrued interest of approximately $58.9 million is classified as long-term
debt in the accompanying financial statements because it is the Company's
intention to refinance the Junior Accrual Debentures in December 1994 with the
proceeds from its $200 million commitment from SIBV described below.

1992 TERM LOAN

In August 1992, the Company repurchased $193.5 million of Junior Accrual
Debentures, and repaid $19.1 million of the Subordinated Note and $400 million
of the 1989 term loan facility ('1989 Term Loan'). Proceeds of $231.8 million
from the issuance of additional common stock (see Note 7) and a $400 million
senior secured term loan ('1992 Term Loan') were used to repurchase the Junior
Accrual Debentures and repay the loans. Premiums paid in connection with this
transaction, the write-off of related deferred debt issuance costs, and losses
on interest rate swap agreements, totaling $49.8 million (net of income tax
benefits of $25.8 million), are reflected in the accompanying 1992 consolidated
statement of operations as an extraordinary loss.

Outstanding loans under the 1992 Term Loan bear interest primarily at rates
for which Eurodollar deposits are offered plus 3% (6.375% at December 31, 1993).
The 1992 Term Loan, which matures on December 31, 1997, may require principal
prepayments before then as defined in the 1992 Term Loan.

1989 TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

The 1989 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ('1989 Credit Agreement')
consists of the 1989 Term Loan and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility
(which expires in 1995) of which up to $125.0 million may consist of letters of
credit. The 1989 Term Loan, which expires in 1997, requires

F-10

<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

(TABULAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS)

minimum annual principal reductions, subject to additional reductions if the
Company has excess cash flows or excess cash balances, as defined, or receives
proceeds from certain sales of assets, issuance of equity securities, permitted
indebtedness or any pension fund termination.

Outstanding loans under the 1989 Credit Agreement bear interest primarily
at rates for which Eurodollar deposits are offered plus 2.25%. The weighted
average interest rate at December 31, 1993 on outstanding Credit Agreement
borrowings was 5.95%. A commitment fee of 1/2 of 1% per annum is assessed on the
unused portion of the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 1993, the
unused portion of the revolving credit facility, after giving consideration to
outstanding letters of credit, was $112.1 million.

SENIOR SECURED NOTES

The Senior Secured Notes due in 1998 may be prepaid at any time. Mandatory
prepayment is required from a pro rata portion of net cash proceeds of certain
sales of assets or additional borrowings. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest
at rates for which three month Eurodollar deposits are offered plus 2.75% (6.25%
at December 31, 1993).

Obligations under the 1992 Term Loan, the 1989 Credit Agreement, and the
Senior Secured Notes Agreement share pro rata in certain mandatory prepayments
and the collateral and guarantees that secure these obligations. These
obligations are secured by the common stock of JSC and CCA and substantially all
of their assets, with the exception of cash and cash equivalents and trade
receivables, and are guaranteed by the Company. These agreements contain various
business and financial covenants including, among other things, (i) limitations
on the incurrence of indebtedness; (ii) limitations on capital expenditures;
(iii) restrictions on paying dividends, except for dividends paid by SNC; (iv)
maintenance of minimum interest coverage ratios; and (v) maintenance of
quarterly and annual cash flows, as defined.

In anticipation of violation of certain financial covenants at September
30, 1993, in connection with its 1992 Term Loan, 1989 Credit Agreement and the
Senior Secured Notes, the Company requested and received waivers from its lender
group. In addition, the Company's credit facilities were amended in December
1993, to modify financial covenants that had become too restrictive due to
continued pricing weakness in the paper industry. The Company complied with the
amended covenants at December 31, 1993.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION PROGRAM LOANS

The $230.0 million accounts receivable securitization program
('Securitization Program') provides for the sale of certain of the Company's
trade receivables to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote, limited purpose
subsidiary, Jefferson Smurfit Finance Corporation ('JS Finance'), which finances
its purchases of the receivables, through borrowings from a limited purpose
finance company (the 'Issuer') unaffiliated with the Company. The Issuer, which
is restricted to making loans to JS Finance, issued $95.0 million in fixed rate
term notes, issued $13.8 million under a subordinated loan, and may issue up to
$121.2 million in trade receivables backed commercial paper or obtain up to
$121.2 million under a revolving liquidity facility to fund loans to JS Finance.
At December 31, 1993, $47.1 million was available for additional borrowing.
Borrowings under the Securitization Program, which expires April 1996, have been
classified as long-term debt because of the company's intent to refinance this
debt on a long-term basis and the availability of such financing under the terms
of the program.

At December 31, 1993, all assets of JS Finance, principally cash and cash
equivalents of $42.9 million and trade receivables of $173.8 million, are
pledged as collateral for obligations of JS Finance to the Issuer. Interest
rates on borrowings under this program are at a fixed rate of 9.56% for $95.0

SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES

In April 1993, CCA issued $500.0 million of 9.75% Senior Unsecured Notes
due 2003 which are unconditionally guaranteed by JSC. Net proceeds from the
offering were used to repay: $100.0 million outstanding under the revolving
credit facility, $196.5 million outstanding under the 1989 Term Loan, and $191.0
million outstanding under the 1992 Term Loan. The write-off of related deferred
debt issuance costs and losses on interest rate swap agreements, totalling $37.8
million (net of income tax benefits of $21.7 million), are reflected in the
accompanying 1993 consolidated statement of operations as an extraordinary item.

In connection with the issuance of the Senior Unsecured Notes, the Company
entered into an agreement with SIBV whereby SIBV committed to purchase up to
$200 million of 11.5% Junior Subordinated Notes to be issued by the Company
maturing December 1, 2005. From time to time until December 31, 1994, the
Company, at their option, may issue the Junior Subordinated Notes, the proceeds
of which must be used to repurchase or otherwise retire subordinated debt. The
Company is obligated to pay SIBV for letter of credit fees incurred by SIBV in
connection with this commitment in addition to an annual commitment fee of
1.375% on the undrawn principal amount (See Note 4).

The Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2003, which are not redeemable
prior to maturity, rank pari passu with the 1992 Term Loan, the 1989 Credit
Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Unsecured Note Agreement
contains business and financial covenants which are substantially less
restrictive than those contained in the 1992 Term Loan, the 1989 Credit
Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Agreement.

OTHER NON-SUBORDINATED DEBT

Other non-subordinated long-term debt at December 31, 1993, is payable in
varying installments through the year 2004. Interest rates on these obligations
averaged approximately 9.76 % at December 31, 1993.

SUBORDINATED DEBT

The Senior Subordinated Notes, Subordinated Debentures and Junior Accrual
Debentures are unsecured obligations of CCA and are unconditionally guaranteed
on a senior subordinated, subordinated and junior subordinated basis,
respectively, by JSC. Semi-annual interest payments are required on the Senior
Subordinated Notes, and Subordinated Debentures. Interest on the Junior Accrual
Debentures accrues and compounds on a semi-annual basis until December 1, 1994
at which time accrued interest is payable. Thereafter, interest on the Junior
Accrual Debentures will be payable semi-annually.

The Senior Subordinated Notes are redeemable at CCA's option beginning
December 1, 1994 with premiums of 6.75% and 3.375% of the principal amount if
redeemed during the 12-month periods commencing December 1, 1994 and 1995,
respectively. The payment of principal and interest is subordinated to the prior
payment, when due, of all senior indebtedness, as defined.

The Subordinated Debentures are redeemable at CCA's option beginning
December 1, 1994 with premiums of 7% and 3.5% of the principal amount if
redeemed during the 12-month periods commencing December 1, 1994 and 1995,
respectively. The payment of principal and interest is subordinated to the prior
payment, when due, of all senior indebtedness, as defined, and the Senior
Subordinated Notes. Sinking fund payments to retire 33 1/3% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated Debentures are required on each
of December 15, 1999 and 2000.

The Junior Accrual Debentures are redeemable at CCA's option beginning
December 1, 1994 at 100% of the principal amount. The payment of principal and
interest is subordinated to the prior

payment, when due, of all senior indebtedness, as defined, the Senior
Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Debentures. Sinking fund payments to
retire 33 1/3% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Junior Accrual
Debentures are required on each of December 1, 2002 and 2003.

Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes, Subordinated Debentures, and
Junior Accrual Debentures have the right, subject to certain limitations, to
require the Company to repurchase their securities at 101% of the principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a change of
control or in certain events from proceeds of major asset sales, as defined. The
Senior Subordinated Notes, Subordinated Debentures and Junior Accrual Debentures
contain various business and financial covenants which are less restrictive than
those contained in the 1992 Term Loan, the 1989 Credit Agreement and the Senior
Secured Notes Agreement.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS

At December 31, 1993, the Company has interest rate swap and other hedging
agreements with commercial banks which effectively fix (for remaining periods up
to 3 years) the Company's interest rate on $215 million of variable rate
borrowings at average all-in rates of approximately 9.1%. At December 31, 1993,
the Company had $435 million of swap commitments outstanding which were marked
to market in April 1993. The Company also has outstanding interest rate swap
agreements related to the Securitization Program that effectively convert $95.0
million of fixed rate borrowings to a variable rate (5.6% at December 31, 1993)
through December 1995, and convert $80.0 million of variable rate borrowings to
a fixed rate of 7.2% through January 1996. In addition, the Company is party to
interest rate swap agreements related to the Senior Unsecured Notes which
effectively converts $500.0 million of fixed rate borrowings to a variable rate
(8.6% at December 31, 1993) maturing at various dates through May 1995. The
Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other
parties to the interest rate swap agreements. However, the Company does not
anticipate non-performance by the counter parties.

Interest costs capitalized on construction projects in 1993, 1992 and 1991
totalled $3.4 million, $4.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Interest
payments on all debt instruments for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were $226.2 million,
$257.6 million and $273.1 million, respectively.

6. INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by SFAS
No. 109, 'Accounting for Income Taxes'. As permitted under the new rules, prior
years' financial statements have not been restated.

The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 as of January 1, 1993 was to
increase net income by $20.5 million. For 1993, application of SFAS No. 109
increased the pretax loss by $14.5 million because of increased depreciation
expense as a result of the requirement to report assets acquired in prior
business combinations at pretax amounts.

In adopting this new accounting principle, the Company (i) adjusted assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in prior business combinations from their
net-of-tax amounts to their pre-tax amounts and recognized the related deferred
tax assets and liabilities for those temporary differences, (ii) adjusted
deferred income tax assets and liabilities to statutory income tax rates and for
previously unrecognized tax benefits related to certain state net operating loss
carryforwards and, (iii) adjusted asset and liability accounts arising from the
1986 acquisition and the 1989 Recapitalization to recognize potential tax
liabilities related to those transactions. The net effect of these adjustments
on assets and liabilities was to increase inventory $23.0 million, increase
property, plant and equipment and timberlands $196.5 million, increase goodwill
$42.0 million, increase liabilities by $12.6 million, and increase deferred
income taxes by $228.4 million.

federal income tax purposes of approximately $308.6 million (expiring in the
years 2005 through 2008), none of which are available for utilization against
alternative minimum taxes.

statutory tax rate from 34% to 35% effective January 1, 1993.

The Internal Revenue Service completed the examination of the Company's
consolidated federal income tax returns for 1987 and 1988. The provision for
current taxes includes settlement of the additional tax liabilities.

The Company made income tax payments of $33.0 million, $6.6 million, and

7. CAPITAL STOCK

On August 26, 1992, the Company's shareholders approved an increase in the
authorized number of shares of Class C and Class D common stock of the Company
from 500,000 shares to 2,170,000 shares, and authorized the issuance of up to
603,656 shares of Class E non-voting shares. The Company then issued an
additional 330,000 shares of Class A common stock to SHBV, and an additional
330,000 shares of Class B common stock and 1,670,000 shares of Class C common
stock to MSLEF II Group. Net proceeds from the shares issued totalled $231.8
million and were used to repay a portion of the Company's long-term debt (see
Note 5). At December 31, 1993, SPC converted its shares of Cumulative
Exchangeable Preferred Stock ('Preferred Stock'), bearing dividends at a
quarterly rate of 4.664% payable in additional preferred shares, to 1,670,000
shares of Class D common stock at a value of $167 million.

Because the Preferred Stock shares were converted at December 31, 1993 into
1,670,000 shares of Class D common stock with a fixed value at August 26, 1992
of $167 million, no Preferred Stock dividends were recognized by the Company
subsequent to August 26, 1992.

The Company's Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D and Class E common stock
are identical in all respects, except for voting rights and except that the
Company's Board of Directors can cause the exchange of shares of the Class C
stock into Class B stock at any time, thereby causing the automatic conversion
of an equal number of shares of Class D stock into Class A stock.

8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION PLANS

The Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all employees not covered by multi-employer plans. Plans that
cover salaried and management employees provide pension benefits that are based
on the employee's five highest consecutive calendar years' compensation during
the last ten years of service. Plans covering non-salaried employees generally
provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. These plans provide
reduced benefits for

(TABULAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS)

early retirement. The Company's funding policy is to make minimum annual
contributions required by applicable regulations. The Company also participates
in several multi-employer pension plans, which provide defined benefits to
certain union employees.

In order to minimize significant year-to-year fluctuations in pension cost
caused by financial market volatility, the Company changed, effective as of
January 1, 1993 the method of accounting used for determining the market-related
value of plan assets. The method changed from a fair market value to a
calculated value that recognizes all changes in a systematic manner over a
period not to exceed four years and eliminates the use of a corridor approach
for amoritizing gains and losses. The effect of this change on 1993 results of
operations, including the cumulative effect of prior years, was not material.

Assumptions used in the accounting for the defined benefit plans were:

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS

The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for
all salaried and certain hourly employees. The Company has various plans under
which the cost may be borne either by the Company, the employee or partially by
each party. The Company does not currently fund these plans. These benefits are
discretionary and are not a commitment to long-term benefit payments. The plans
were amended effective January 1, 1993 to allow employees who retire on or after
January 1, 1994 to become eligible for these benefits only if they retire after
age 60 while working for the Company.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, 'Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions', which requires
companies to accrue the expected cost of retiree benefit payments, other than
pensions, during employees' active service period. The Company elected to
immediately recognize the accumulated liability, measured as of January 1, 1993.
The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle resulted in a
charge of $37.0 million (net of income tax benefits of $21.9 million). The
Company had previously recorded an obligation of $36.0 million in connection
with prior business combinations. The net periodic postretirement benefit cost
for 1993 was $9.8 million. In 1992 and 1991, the cost of the postretirement
benefits was recognized as claims were paid and was $6.4 million and $5.3
million, respectively.

The following table sets forth the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation ('APBO') with respect to these benefits as of December 31, 1993:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Retirees................................................................... $ 58.3
Active employees........................................................... 51.8
------
Total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation........................ 110.1
Unrecognized net loss...................................................... (11.9)
------
Accrued postretirement benefit cost........................................ $ 98.2
------
------
</TABLE>

Net periodic postirement benefit cost for 1993 included the following
components:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Service cost of benefits earned............................................ $ 1.5
Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation............. 8.3
------
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost................................... $ 9.8
------
------
</TABLE>

A weighted-average discount rate of 7.6% was used in determining the APBO
at December 31, 1993. The weighted-average annual assumed rate of increase in
the per capita cost of covered benefits ('healthcare cost trend rate') was 11%,
with an annual decline of 1% until the rate reaches 5%. The effect of a 1%
increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would increase both APBO as
of December 31, 1993 by $5.7 million and the annual net periodic postretirement
benefit cost for 1993 by $.8 million.

1992 STOCK OPTION PLAN

Effective August 26, 1992, the Company adopted the 1992 Stock Option Plan
(the 'Plan') which replaced the 1990 Long-Term Management Incentive Plan. Under
the Plan, selected employees of the Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries
are granted non-qualified stock options, up to a maximum of 603,656 shares, to
acquire shares of common stock of the Company. The stock options are exercisable
at a price equal to the fair market value, as defined, of the Company's common
stock on the date of grant. The options vest pursuant to the schedule set forth
for each option and expire upon the earlier of twelve years from the date of
grant or termination of employment. The stock options become exercisable upon
the earlier of the occurrence of certain trigger dates, as defined, or eleven
years from the date of grant. Options for 494,215 and 502,645 shares, were
outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively at an exercise price of
$100.00, none of which were exercisable.

9. LEASES

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment for production, selling
and administrative purposes under operating leases. Future minimum lease
payments at December 31, 1993, required under operating leases that have initial
or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are $30.3 million
in 1994, $22.5 million in 1995, $15.5 million in 1996, $11.3 million in 1997,
$8.3 million in 1998 and $19.1 million thereafter.

Net rental expense was $45.0 million, $42.2 million, and $38.7 million for
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

10. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as
follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
DECEMBER 31,
--------------------------------------------
1993 1992
-------------------- --------------------
CARRYING FAIR CARRYING FAIR
AMOUNT VALUE AMOUNT VALUE
-------- -------- -------- --------
<S> <C> <C> <C> <C>
Cash and cash equivalents.......................................... $ 44.2 $ 44.2 $ 45.0 $ 45.0
Long-term debt, including current maturities....................... 2,629.4 2,686.4 2,535.4 2,540.4
Gain (loss) on interest rate swap agreements....................... (3.9) (35.5)
</TABLE>

The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximate fair value because of
the short maturity of those instruments. The fair value of the Company's
long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the
same remaining maturities. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements
is the estimated amount the Company would pay, net of accrued interest expense,
to terminate the agreements at December 31, 1993, taking into account current
interest rates and the current credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.

11. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

In September 1993, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $150 million to
recognize the effects of a restructuring program designed to improve the
Company's long-term competitive position and future profitability and to provide
for environmental and other matters. Charges related to the restructuring
program consist of approximately $96 million of expenses associated with plant
closures, reductions in workforce, realignment and consolidation of various
manufacturing operations and write-downs of nonproductive assets. The charge
also includes a provision of $54 million related primarily to environmental
remediation costs associated with plant closures, and existing and former
operating sites. See Restructuring and Other Charges section of Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Operation.

12. CONTINGENCIES

The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and claims arising out
of the conduct of its business. While the ultimate results of such suits or
other proceedings against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, the
management of the Company believes that resolution of these matters will not
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or
results of operation.

13. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company's business segments are paperboard/packaging products and
newsprint. Substantially all the Company's operations are in the United States.
The Company's customers represent a diverse

ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 ('Securities Act') may be permitted to directors, officers and
controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event
that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the
payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action,
suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person
in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless
in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

The Registrant hereby undertakes:

(1) That for purposes of determining any liability under the
Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed
as part of this registration statement in reliance upon

II-3

<PAGE>
Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant
pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall
be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was
declared effective.

(2) That for the purpose of determining any liability under the
Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of
prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to
the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that
time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

(3) To provide the underwriters at the closing specified in the
underwriting agreements, certificates in such denominations and registered
in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to
each purchaser.

THE COMPANY

The Company believes it is one of the nation's largest producers of
paperboard and packaging products and is the largest producer of recycled
paperboard and recycled packaging products. The Company's system of 16
paperboard mills produces virgin and recycled containerboard, solid bleached
sulfate ('SBS') and recycled boxboard, and recycled cylinderboard, which is sold
to the Company's own converting operations or to third parties. The Company's
converting operations consist of 52 corrugated container plants, 18 folding
carton plants, and 16 industrial packaging plants located across the country,
with three plants located outside the U.S. In 1993, the Company's container
plants converted an amount of containerboard equal to approximately 105.5% of
the amount the Company produced, its folding carton plants converted an amount
of SBS, recycled boxboard and coated natural kraft equal to approximately 65.4%
of the amount the Company produced, and its industrial packaging plants
converted an amount of recycled cylinderboard equal to approximately 59.7% of
the amount the Company produced. The Company's Paperboard/Packaging Products
segment contributed 91.6% of the Company's net sales in 1993. The Company's
paperboard operations are supported by its reclamation division and by its
timber operations which manage approximately one million acres of owned or
leased timberland located in close proximity to its virgin fibre mills.

In addition, the Company believes it is one of the nation's largest
producers of recycled newsprint. The Company's newsprint division includes two
newsprint mills in Oregon and two facilities that produce Cladwood'r', a
construction material produced from newsprint and wood by-products.

The predecessor to the Company was founded in 1974 when Jefferson Smurfit
Group plc ('JS Group'), a worldwide leader in the packaging products industry,
commenced operations in the United States by acquiring 40% of a small paperboard
and packaging products company. The remaining 60% of that company was acquired
in 1977, and in 1978 net sales were $42.9 million. The Company implemented a
strategy to build a fully integrated, broadly based, national packaging
business, primarily through acquisitions, including Alton Box Board Company in
1979, the paperboard and packaging divisions of Diamond International
Corporation in 1982, 80% of Smurfit Newsprint Corporation ('SNC') in 1986, and
50% of CCA in 1986. The Company financed its acquisitions by using leverage, and
in several cases, utilized joint venture financing whereby the Company
eventually obtained control of the acquired company. While no major acquisition
has been made since 1986, the Company has made 18 smaller acquisitions and
started up five new facilities which had combined sales in 1993 of $280.3
million. JSC was formed in 1983 to consolidate the operations of the Company,
and today the Company ranks among the industry leaders in its two business
segments, Paperboard/Packaging Products and Newsprint. In 1993, the Company had
net sales of $2.9 billion, achieving a compound annual sales growth rate of
32.6% for the period since 1978.

The principal components of the Company's business strategy include the
following:

Maintain Focus on Recycled Products. The Company believes that it is
the largest recycler of wastepaper; the largest producer of coated
recycled paperboard and one of the largest producers of recycled
newsprint in the United States, and is well positioned to supply an
increasing demand for environmentally friendly packaging.

<PAGE>
Focus on Cost Reduction. The Company is implementing a company-wide
cost reduction program designed to improve the cost competitiveness
of all the Company's operating facilities and staff functions.
Additionally, in 1993 the Company began a restructuring program to
realign and consolidate various manufacturing operations over the
next 2 to 3 years.

Continue to Pursue Vertical Integration. The Company's high level of
integration assures the Company of top quality and economically
priced supplies of fibre for its paperboard mills, and protects the
Company from potential regional supply and demand imbalances for
recycled fibre grades. Integration also reduces the volatility of
pricing for the Company's containerboard products and allows the
Company to run its mills at higher operating rates during industry
downturns.

Continue Growth in Core Businesses. The Company intends to continue
its strategy of building its core packaging businesses primarily by
pursuing acquisitions and through capital improvement programs.

Maintain Leading Market Positions. The Company's prominence in the
United States packaging industry provides the Company certain
advantages in marketing its products, including excellent customer
visibility, which has enabled the Company to enter into strategic
alliances with select large national account customers. The Company's
broad range of packaging products provides a single source option to
supply all of a customer's packaging needs.

Improve Financial Profile. The Recapitalization Plan (as defined
below) will improve operating and financial flexibility by reducing
the level and overall cost of its debt, extending maturities of its
indebtedness, increasing stockholders' equity and increasing its
access to capital markets.

All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of JSC are owned by
Holdings. Prior to the consummation of the Debt Offerings and the substantially
concurrent Equity Offerings, 50% of the common stock of Holdings was owned by
direct and indirect subsidiaries of Smurfit International, B.V. ('SIBV') an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of JS Group, a public corporation organized
under the laws of the Republic of Ireland, % was beneficially owned by The
Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
investment fund formed to make investments in industrial and other companies
('MSLEF II'), and certain related entities and % was beneficially owned by
certain other investors. MSLEF II is an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated ('MS&Co.'), the Underwriter.

After the consummation of the Recapitalization Plan, SIBV will beneficially
own approximately %, MSLEF II and certain related entities will beneficially
own in the aggregate approximately %, and all other stockholders (including
public stockholders) will beneficially own approximately % of the outstanding
shares of common stock of Holdings (after giving effect to the Reclassification,
the 'Holdings Common Stock'). See 'Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners' and 'Certain Transactions'.

RECAPITALIZATION PLAN

Holdings and the Company are implementing a recapitalization plan (the
'Recapitalization Plan') to refinance a substantial portion of their
indebtedness in order to improve operating and financial flexibility by reducing
the level and overall cost of their debt, extending maturities of indebtedness,
increasing stockholders' equity and increasing their access to capital markets.
For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Recapitalization Plan would, on a pro
forma basis for such year, have resulted in $68.7 million of aggregate savings
in interest expense, of which $53.8 million represents cash interest expense
savings (in each case on a pre-tax basis).

The Recapitalization Plan includes the following primary components:

(i) (a) The offering by CCA pursuant to this Prospectus of $500
million aggregate principal amount of % Series A Senior Notes
due 2004 and $100 million aggregate principal amount of %
Series B Senior Notes due 2002 (the 'Debt Offerings');

(b) The offering by Holdings of 14,650,000 shares of Holdings
Common Stock through a U.S. offering and an international offering
(the 'Equity Offerings'). The Equity Offerings and the Debt
Offerings are collectively referred to herein as the 'Offerings';

(c) The purchase by SIBV (or a corporate affiliate) of shares
of Holdings Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $100
million (the 'SIBV Investment');

(d) The entering into of a new credit agreement by CCA and
JSC (the 'New Credit Agreement') consisting of a $450 million
revolving credit facility (the 'New Revolving Credit Facility'), a
$200 million term loan (the 'Initial Term Loan') and an $850
million delayed term loan (the 'Delayed Term Loan' and, together
with the Initial Term Loan, the 'New Term Loans').

(ii) The application of the net proceeds of the Offerings and the SIBV
Investment, together with borrowings under the New Credit Agreement, to
refinance (the 'Bank Debt Refinancing') all of the Company's indebtedness
outstanding under (a) the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,
dated as of November 9, 1989, among Holdings, JSC, CCA, the lenders which
are parties thereto, Bankers Trust Company as agent and Chemical Bank and
Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association as co-agents (the
'1989 Credit Agreement'); (b) the Amended and Restated Note Purchase
Agreement, dated as of December 14, 1989, among Holdings, JSC, CCA and the
purchasers of the secured notes (the 'Secured Notes') issued thereunder
(the 'Secured Note Purchase Agreement'), and (c) the Loan and Note Purchase
Agreement, dated as of August 26, 1992, among Holdings, JSC, CCA, the
lenders which are party thereto, Chemical Bank as agent and the managing
agents and collateral trustee which are party thereto (the '1992 Credit
Agreement' and, together with the 1989 Credit Agreement, the 'Old Bank
Facilities').

(iii) The application, on approximately December 1, 1994, of the
borrowings under the Delayed Term Loan to redeem (the 'Subordinated Debt
Refinancing') CCA's (a) 13 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 1998 (the
'Senior Subordinated Notes'), (b) 14% Subordinated Debentures due 2001 (the
'Subordinated Debentures') and (c) 15 1/2% Junior Subordinated Accrual
Debentures due 2004 (the 'Junior Accrual Debentures' and, together with the
Senior Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Debentures, the
'Subordinated Debt'). The earliest date the Subordinated Debt may be
redeemed is December 1, 1994. Borrowings under the Delayed Term Loan will
be subject to the satisfaction of certain limited conditions.

- ------------

(a) Assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share of Holdings
Common Stock (which is equal to the midpoint of the range of the
anticipated high and low per share public offering prices set forth on the
cover of the Prospectus relating to the Equity Offerings) and, in the case
of the Offerings, without deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and expenses.

(b) The maximum amount available under such facility will be $450 million, with
up to $150 million of such amount being available for letters of credit. It
is anticipated that immediately following the Offerings, letters of credit
of approximately $90 million will be outstanding under such facility. See
also (c) below.

(c) Represents the outstanding principal amount and redemption premiums
required to be paid on the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated
Debentures, and the estimated accreted value of the Junior Accrual
Debentures as of December 1, 1994. The Company expects that accrued and
unpaid interest at June 1 and December 1, 1994 on the Senior Subordinated
Notes and the Subordinated Debentures will be paid through internal cash
flow or with additional borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

(d) Expenses include estimated commissions and underwriting discounts relating
to the Debt Offerings and the Equity Offerings, respectively. There are no
underwriting discounts or commissions on the sale of Holdings Common Stock
pursuant to the SIBV Investment.

(e) If the underwriters in the Equity Offerings exercise their overallotment
option in full, cash will be increased by an additional $ million.

The aggregate amount of proceeds, net of estimated expenses, necessary
immediately following the Offerings to consummate the Recapitalization Plan
(excluding the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) is approximately $1,120 million.
The sources of funds for such amount are set forth in the above table. Prior to
consummation of the Offerings, however, the Company may determine to change the
size of the various components of the Recapitalization Plan and, accordingly,
among other things may change the size of the Debt Offerings and/or the Equity
Offerings which could, in turn, affect the size of the Initial Term Loan and/or
the Delayed Term Loan.

In order to consummate the Recapitalization Plan, the Company must obtain
certain consents and waivers, consisting, among others, of the consent of (i) a
majority in principal amount of the holders of CCA's 9 3/4% Senior Notes due
2003 (the '1993 Notes'), (ii) 60% of the holders of the outstanding principal
amount of Secured Notes and (iii) certain parties under JSC's and CCA's trade
receivables securitization (the 'Securitization') (collectively, the 'Consents
and Waivers'). The Company expects that, prior to entering into the Underwriting
Agreement (as defined below), it shall have obtained the Consents and Waivers.
For more information concerning the Consents and Waivers, see 'Recapitalization
Plan -- Consents and Waivers'.

All of the transactions contemplated by the Recapitalization Plan (other
than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) are expected to occur substantially
contemporaneously. Consummation of the Debt Offerings is conditioned on the
substantially concurrent consummation of the other components of the
Recapitalization Plan (other than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing), including,
among other things, consummation of (i) the Equity Offerings, (ii) the SIBV
Investment and (iii) the Bank Debt Refinancing. In addition, consummation of the
Debt Offerings is conditioned on the Company obtaining the Consents and Waivers.

For more information concerning the Recapitalization Plan, see
'Recapitalization Plan'.

Issuer.................................... Container Corporation of America.
<S> <C>
Securities Offered........................ $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Series A Senior Notes
due 2004 (the 'Series A Senior Notes') and $100,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of % Series B Senior Notes due 2002 (the 'Series B
Senior Notes', and collectively with the Series A Senior Notes, the
'Senior Notes').
Interest Payment Dates.................... and , commencing , 1994.
Maturity.................................. , 2004 for the Series A Senior Notes and , 2002 for
the Series B Senior Notes.
Redemption................................ The Series A Senior Notes may be redeemed at the option of CCA, in
whole or in part, at any time on or after , 1999,
initially at % of their principal amount at maturity and declining
to 100% of such principal amount at maturity on or after
, in each case plus accrued interest. In addition, at
the option of CCA at any time prior to , 1997, CCA may
redeem up to $175 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of
the Series A Senior Notes with the Net Cash Proceeds from the
issuance of Capital Stock (other than Redeemable Stock) of CCA or JSC
or any parent of CCA to the extent that the proceeds are contributed
to CCA or used to acquire Capital Stock of CCA (other than Redeemable
Stock) in a single transaction or a series of related transactions
(other than the Equity Offerings or an issuance to a Subsidiary), at
a redemption price of % of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued interest.
The Series B Senior Notes will not be redeemable prior to maturity.
Ranking................................... The Senior Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of CCA, will
rank pari passu with the other senior indebtedness of CCA, including,
without limitation, CCA's obligations under the New Credit Agreement
and the 1993 Notes, and will be senior in right of payment to the
Subordinated Debt. CCA's obligations under the New Credit Agreement,
but not the Senior Notes, are secured by liens on substantially all
of the assets of CCA and its subsidiaries with the exception of cash
and cash equivalents and trade receivables. After giving pro forma
effect to the Recapitalization Plan and the Recapitalization Plan
(excluding the Subordinated Debt Refinancing), as of December 31,
1993, CCA would have had outstanding approximately $2,169.9 million
and approximately $1,319.9 million, respectively, of senior
indebtedness (excluding intercompany indebtedness), of which
approximately $1,066.5 million and approximately $216.5 million,
respectively, would have been senior secured indebtedness. The
secured indebtedness will have priority over the Senior Notes with
respect to the assets securing such indebtedness. See 'Risk
Factors -- Effect of Secured Indebtedness on the Senior Notes'.
Covenants................................. The indentures pursuant to which the Senior Notes will be issued (the
'Indentures') will contain certain covenants that, among other
things, will limit the ability of JSC and its subsidiaries (including
CCA) to incur indebtedness, pay dividends and make other restricted
payments, engage in transactions with shareholders and affiliates,
issue capital stock, create liens, sell assets, engage in
sale-leaseback transactions, allow the imposition of restrictions on
the ability of Restricted Subsidiaries to pay dividends to CCA,
engage in mergers and consolidations and make investments in Un-
restricted Subsidiaries. The limitations imposed by the covenants on
JSC and its subsidiaries (including CCA) are subject
</TABLE>

<PAGE>

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
to certain exceptions. See 'Description of the Senior Notes --
Covenants'.
Put Option................................ Upon a Change of Control, CCA will make an offer to purchase the
Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued interest. Certain transactions with
affiliates of the Company may not constitute a Change of Control. See
'Description of the Senior Notes -- Covenants -- Repurchase of Senior
Notes upon Change of Control'.
Guarantees................................ The payment of principal and interest on the Senior Notes is
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by JSC. Such
guarantee will rank pari passu with the other senior indebtedness of
JSC, including, without limitation, JSC's obligations under the New
Credit Agreement (including its guarantees of CCA's obligations
thereunder) and JSC's guarantee of CCA's obligations under the 1993
Notes, and will be senior in right of payment to JSC's guarantees of
the Subordinated Debt. JSC's obligations under the New Credit
Agreement are secured by liens on substantially all the assets of JSC
and its subsidiaries with the exception of cash and cash equivalents
and trade receivables, and are guaranteed by CCA and certain
subsidiaries of JSC and CCA. After giving pro forma effect to the
Recapitalization Plan and the Recapitalization Plan (excluding the
Subordinated Debt Refinancing), as of December 31, 1993, JSC would
have had outstanding approximately $2,419.1 million and approximately
$1,569.1 million, respectively, of senior indebtedness (including
indebtedness of CCA and JSC's other consolidated subsidiaries but
excluding intercompany indebtedness), of which approximately $1,311.7
million and approximately $461.7 million, respectively, would have
been senior secured indebtedness. The secured indebtedness will have
priority over JSC's guarantees of the Senior Notes with respect to
the assets securing such indebtedness. See 'Risk Factors -- Effect of
Secured Indebtedness on the Senior Notes'. In the event that (i) a
purchaser of capital stock of CCA acquires a majority of the voting
rights thereunder or (ii) there occurs a merger or consolidation of
CCA that results in CCA having a parent other than JSC and, at the
time of and after giving effect to such transactions, such purchaser
or parent satisfies certain minimum net worth and cash flow
requirements, JSC will be released from its guarantee of the Senior
Notes. Such sale, merger or consolidation will be prohibited unless
certain other requirements are met, including that the purchaser or
the entity surviving such a merger or consolidation expressly assumes
JSC's or CCA's obligations, as the case may be, and that no Event of
Default (as defined below) occur or be continuing. See 'Description
of the Senior Notes -- Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets'.
Use of Proceeds........................... The net proceeds to the Company from the Debt Offerings, together
with the net proceeds from the Equity Offerings and the SIBV
Investment will be used to effect certain of the transactions
contemplated by the Recapitalization Plan. See 'Recapitalization
Plan.'

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information contained in this Prospectus, the
following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in
the securities offered by this Prospectus.

SUBSTANTIAL LEVERAGE; ABILITY TO SERVICE DEBT; SUBORDINATED DEBT REFINANCING

The Company has, and following the consummation of the Recapitalization
Plan will continue to have, on a consolidated basis a substantial amount of
debt, much of which was originally incurred to finance (or to refinance debt
originally incurred to finance) the 1989 Transaction (as defined below). The
Company's long-term debt at December 31, 1993 was $2,619.1 million and, on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Recapitalization Plan, the Company's
long-term debt as of such date would have been $2,408.8 million. The amount of
long-term indebtedness at such date on a historical basis was greater than the
book value of the Company's total assets, as reflected on its balance sheet
(which is not based on fair saleable or fair value), and is substantial relative
to the Company's stockholders' equity, which has been negative in recent years
due to the accounting treatment of the 1989 Transaction and recent net losses.
See ' -- Recent Losses; Negative Stockholders' Equity'. Although the
consummation of the Recapitalization Plan will reduce the Company's consolidated
interest expense over the next several years, JSC and CCA will remain obligated
to make substantial interest payments on indebtedness under the New Credit
Agreement, the 1993 Notes and the Senior Notes and, until the consummation of
the Subordinated Debt Refinancing, on the Subordinated Debt. For a description
of the terms of the Company's indebtedness, see 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness'. For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company's earnings were
inadequate to cover fixed charges by $264.2 million and, on a pro forma basis,
after giving effect to the Recapitalization Plan and to the Recapitalization
Plan (excluding the Subordinated Debt Refinancing), would have been inadequate
to cover fixed charges by $195.5 million and $254.1 million, respectively. See
'Capitalization' and 'Pro Forma Financial Data'.

The Company generally expects to fund its and its subsidiaries' debt
service obligations, capital expenditures and working capital requirements
through funds generated from operations and additional borrowings under the New
Revolving Credit Facility. As of the closing of the Offerings and the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the Recapitalization Plan
(other than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing), the Company expects to have in
the aggregate approximately $360 million in unused borrowing capacity under the
New Revolving Credit Facility. See 'Capitalization'. In 1991, the Company
financed its receivables through the Securitization, thereby reducing borrowings
under the 1989 Credit Agreement. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial Condition -- Liquidity and Capital
Resources' and 'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Securitization'. The
Securitization matures in April 1996, at which time the Company expects to
refinance it. Although the Company believes that it will be able to do so, no
assurances can be given in this regard.

The ability of the Company to meet its obligations and to comply with the
financial covenants contained in the New Credit Agreement, the 1993 Notes and
the Senior Notes and, until the consummation of the Subordinated Debt
Refinancing, the Subordinated Debt, is largely dependent upon the future
performance of the Company, which will be subject to financial, business and
other factors affecting it. Many of these factors are beyond the Company's
control, such as the state of the economy, demand for and selling prices of its
products, costs of its raw materials and legislative factors and other factors
relating to its industry generally or to specific competitors. There can be no
assurance that the Company will generate sufficient cash flow to meet its
obligations under its indebtedness, which includes repayment obligations,
assuming consummation of the Subordinated Debt Refinancing, of $102 million
during the second and $152 million during each of the third through fifth years
following consummation of the Offerings (and increasing thereafter). If the
Company were unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds
necessary to make required payments on its indebtedness, or if the Company fails
to comply with the various covenants in such indebtedness, it would be in
default under the terms thereof, which would permit the lenders thereunder to
accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness and could cause defaults under
other indebtedness of the Company or result in a bankruptcy of the Company. See
'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and

12

<PAGE>
Financial Condition -- Liquidity and Capital Resources' and 'Description of
Certain Indebtedness'. In addition, if a 'Change of Control' as defined in the
New Credit Agreement, the 1993 Notes or the Senior Notes is deemed to have
occurred, then the holders of such indebtedness shall have the right to be
repaid 101% of the principal amount of such indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon. See 'Description of Certain Indebtedness'. Similarly, the
exercises of such rights could also trigger cross-default or cross-acceleration
provisions, and lead to the bankruptcy of the Company.

The Subordinated Debt Refinancing is an integral part of the
Recapitalization Plan and a significant portion of the benefits intended to be
achieved as a result of the Recapitalization Plan is derived from it. The
availability of the financing under the Delayed Term Loan necessary to effect
the Subordinated Debt Refinancing is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, although the failure to satisfy such conditions will in almost all
instances indicate that a significant and adverse change in the Company's
financial condition has occurred. The Company expects to be able to satisfy such
conditions, although, in any event, it reserves the right not to consummate the
Subordinated Debt Refinancing for any reason. See 'Recapitalization
Plan -- Subordinated Debt Refinancing'. In addition, the Company believes that,
even if the Subordinated Debt Refinancing is not consummated, it will realize
substantial benefits from the consummation of the other components of the
Recapitalization Plan, including a decrease in leverage and a resulting increase
in stockholders' equity. See 'Pro Forma Financial Data'.

CERTAIN RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

The limitations contained in the agreements relating to the Company's
indebtedness, together with its highly leveraged position, as well as various
provisions in the agreements relating to the governance of Holdings and the
Company, including the Stockholders Agreement and the Registration Rights
Agreement (as defined below), could limit the ability of the Company to effect
future debt or equity financings and may otherwise restrict corporate
activities, including its ability to avoid defaults and to respond to market
conditions, to provide for capital expenditures beyond those permitted or to
take advantage of business opportunities. If the Company cannot generate
sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its obligations, then its
indebtedness might have to be refinanced. There can be no assurance that any
such refinancing could be effected successfully or on terms that are acceptable
to the Company. In the absence of such refinancing, the Company could be forced
to dispose of assets in order to make up for any shortfall in the payments due
on its indebtedness under circumstances that might not be favorable to realizing
the best price for such assets. Further, there can be no assurance that any
assets could be sold quickly enough, or for amounts sufficient, to enable the
Company to make any such payments.

RECENT LOSSES; NEGATIVE STOCKHOLDER'S EQUITY

Although the Company has consistently generated substantial income from
operations, it has experienced, primarily as a result of interest expense
resulting from high leverage (see ' -- Substantial Leverage; Ability to Service
Debt; Subordinated Debt Refinancing'), net losses for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991. See 'Selected Historical Financial Data' and
'Pro Forma Financial Data'. Improvements in the Company's consolidated results
of operations depend largely upon its ability to increase prices of its
products; accordingly, there can be no assurances as to its ability to generate
net income in future periods. See ' -- Pricing and Competition' and
'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition'.

The Company has had a deficit in stockholder's equity since 1989 when
Holdings was organized to effect the acquisition of the publicly held shares of
JSC and the shares of CCA not then owned by JSC, and the recapitalization of
such companies (the '1989 Transaction'), since such transaction was treated as a
recapitalization for financial accounting purposes. On a historical basis, at
December 31, 1993, the Company's stockholder's deficit was $1,057.8 million and,
on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Recapitalization Plan, there
would have been a stockholder's deficit of $745.8 million. See 'Capitalization'
and 'Pro Forma Financial Data'.

<PAGE>
EFFECT OF SECURED INDEBTEDNESS ON THE SENIOR NOTES

Although the Senior Notes (and JSC's guarantees thereof) rank pari passu
with indebtedness outstanding under the New Credit Agreement (and the 1993
Notes), such bank debt (including all guarantee obligations of JSC and CCA in
respect thereof) is secured by (i) a security interest in substantially all of
the assets, with the exception of cash and cash equivalents and trade
receivables, of JSC, CCA and their material subsidiaries, (ii) a pledge of all
of the capital stock of material subsidiaries of JSC and CCA and (iii) a pledge
of all intercompany notes. The Senior Notes and JSC's guarantees thereof are
unsecured and therefore do not have the benefit of such collateral; that is, if
an event of default occurs under the New Credit Agreement, the banks party
thereto will have a prior right to the Company's assets and may foreclose upon
such collateral to the exclusion of the holders of the Senior Notes,
notwithstanding the existence of an event of default with respect thereto.
Accordingly, in such an event the Company's assets would first be used to repay
in full amounts outstanding under the New Credit Agreement, resulting in a
portion of the Company's assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of
holders of Senior Notes and other pari passu, unsecured indebtedness (including
the 1993 Notes). After giving pro forma effect to the Recapitalization Plan and
the Recapitalization Plan (excluding the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) as of
December 31, 1993, the Company would have had outstanding approximately $1,311.7
million and approximately $461.7 million, respectively, of secured indebtedness,
including indebtedness under the New Credit Agreement.

In addition, SNC, an 80% owned subsidiary of JSC, will guarantee amounts
owing under the New Credit Agreement but not the Senior Notes. Additional
subsidiaries of JSC or CCA may also in the future own assets, incur indebtedness
and liabilities or guarantee senior indebtedness other than the Senior Notes
provided that, if the aggregate amount of indebtedness guaranteed by any
Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in the indenture relating to the Senior Notes)
of JSC (other than CCA and SNC) exceeds $50 million, then the indentures
relating to the Senior Notes and the 1993 Notes require such subsidiaries to
also guarantee the Senior Notes and the 1993 Notes. Such guarantees will,
however, be unsecured, whereas the guarantees of the indebtedness under the New
Credit Agreement will be secured. Consequently, the Senior Notes to the extent
not so guaranteed will be effectively subordinated to claims of creditors of
such subsidiaries, including, in the case of SNC and, subject to the foregoing
proviso, other subsidiary guarantors and the banks that are parties to the New
Credit Agreement. As a result of the foregoing, in an event of default, holders
of Senior Notes may recover less, ratably, than the banks that are parties to
the New Credit Agreement and other secured creditors of CCA or JSC or their
respective subsidiaries.

PAYMENTS DUE ON COMPANY INDEBTEDNESS PRIOR TO MATURITY OF SENIOR NOTES;
REFINANCING RISKS

The Securitization matures in April 1996, at which time the Company expects
to refinance it. After giving effect to the Subordinated Debt Refinancing, an
aggregate of approximately $1,915.5 million and $1,299.0 million of senior
indebtedness (excluding intercompany indebtedness) matures prior to the Series A
Senior Notes and the Series B Senior Notes, respectively. Without giving effect
to the Subordinated Debt Refinancing, an aggregate of approximately $1,065.5
million and $449.0 million of senior indebtedness (excluding intercompany
indebtedness) matures prior to the Series A Senior Notes and Series B Senior
Notes, respectively, and an aggregate of $713.1 million and $698.9 million of
Subordinated Debt matures prior to the Series A Senior Notes and Series B Senior
Notes, respectively. Accordingly, the Company will have to refinance or
otherwise generate sufficient cash to repay a substantial amount of indebtedness
prior to the time the Senior Notes mature. The Company's ability to do this will
depend, in part, on the Company's financial condition at the time and the
covenants and other provisions in its debt agreements. In this regard, it should
be noted that the Company's ability to incur new indebtedness will be quite
limited by the terms of its outstanding indebtedness and, in particular, unless
and until the Subordinated Debt Refinancing is consummated, the indentures
governing the Subordinated Debt.

PRICING AND COMPETITION

Most markets in which the Company competes are subject to significant price
fluctuations. The Company's sales and profitability have historically been more
sensitive to price changes than changes in

14

<PAGE>
volume, and recent reductions in prices have had an adverse impact on the
Company's results of operations. Future decreases in prices (or the inability to
achieve price increases) for the Company's products would adversely affect its
operating results. These factors, coupled with the highly leveraged financial
position of the Company, may adversely impact the Company's ability to respond
to competition and to other market conditions or to otherwise take advantage of
business opportunities.

Operating rates in the industry during 1991 and 1992 were at high levels
relative to demand, which was lower due to the sluggish U.S. economy and a
decline in export markets. This imbalance resulted in excess inventories in the
industry and lower prices for the Company's containerboard and corrugated
shipping container products, which began early in 1991 and has continued
throughout 1992 and most of 1993. During 1993, industry operating rates were
lower as many containerboard producers, including the Company, took downtime at
containerboard mills to reduce the excess inventories. By the end of the third
quarter of 1993, inventory levels had decreased significantly. The lower level
of inventories and the stronger U.S. economy provided what the Company believes
were improved market conditions late in 1993. Although the Company believes that
containerboard pricing will be improved in 1994, there can be no assurance that
price increases will hold or that the Company's containerboard prices will not
decline from current levels.

Newsprint prices have fallen substantially since 1990 due to supply and
demand imbalances. During 1991 and 1992, new capacity of approximately two
million tons annually came on line, representing an approximate 12% increase in
supply. At the same time, U.S. consumption of newsprint fell due to declines in
readership and ad linage. As prices fell, certain high cost, virgin paper
machines, primarily in Canada, representing approximately 1.2 million tons of
annual production capacity, were shut down and remained idle during 1993. While
supply was diminished, a price increase announced for 1993 was unsuccessful.
Although market demand has improved in the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company
does not expect significant improvement in prices before the second quarter of
1994.

The paperboard and packaging products industries are highly competitive,
and no single company is dominant. The Company's competitors include large,
vertically integrated paperboard and packaging products companies and numerous
smaller companies. In recent years, there has been a trend toward consolidation
within the paperboard and packaging products industries, and the Company
believes that this trend is likely to continue. See 'Business -- Industry
Overview'. The primary competitive factors in the paperboard and packaging
products industries are price, design, quality and service, with varying
emphasis on these factors depending on the product line. To the extent that one
or more of the Company's competitors becomes more successful with respect to any
key competitive factor, the Company's business could be materially, adversely
affected. See 'Business -- Competition'.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Federal, state and local environmental requirements, particularly relating
to air and water quality, are a significant factor in the Company's business.
The Company faces potential environmental liability as a result of violations of
permit terms and similar authorizations that have occurred from time to time at
its facilities. In addition, the Company faces potential liability for 'response
costs' at various sites with respect to which the Company has received notice
that it may be a 'potentially responsible party' as well as for contamination of
certain Company-owned properties, under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, analogous state laws and other laws
concerning hazardous substance contamination. While the Company believes it is
currently in compliance with all applicable environmental laws in all material
respects and has budgeted for future expenditures required to maintain such
compliance, unforeseen significant expenditures in connection with such
compliance could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.
See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition -- General' and 'Business -- Environmental Matters'.

POTENTIAL FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE LIABILITY

Various laws enacted for the protection of creditors may have applied to
the Company's incurrence of indebtedness and the making of certain payments in
connection with the 1989 Transaction, including the issuance of the Subordinated
Debt, debt under the 1989 Credit Agreement and the Secured Notes,

15

<PAGE>
and JSC's guarantees thereof. Such state and federal fraudulent transfer laws
may also apply to refinancings of such debt, including the issuance by CCA of
the 1993 Notes and the Senior Notes, the entering into and incurrence of debt
under the New Credit Agreement, guarantees by JSC and its subsidiaries thereof
and the application of the proceeds thereof. If a court in a lawsuit by an
unpaid creditor or representative of creditors of Holdings, JSC or CCA, such as
a trustee in bankruptcy or Holdings, JSC or CCA as debtor in possession, were to
find that, at the time of the 1989 Transaction, Holdings, JSC or CCA (a) was
insolvent or was rendered insolvent by reason of the 1989 Transaction or the
indebtedness incurred and payments made in connection therewith, (b) was engaged
in a business or transaction for which the assets remaining with Holdings, JSC
or CCA constituted unreasonably small capital, (c) intended to, or believed that
it would, incur debts beyond its ability to pay as such debts matured or (d)
intended to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors, such court could, under
state or federal fraudulent transfer law, avoid the Senior Notes or such other
indebtedness (including under the 1993 Notes and the New Credit Agreement) and
order that all payments made by Holdings, JSC or CCA with respect thereto be
returned to it or to a fund for the benefit of its creditors. Such court could
also subordinate the Senior Notes or such other indebtedness (including under
the 1993 Notes and the New Credit Agreement) or the guarantees thereof to all
existing and future indebtedness of JSC or CCA. Such avoidance or subordination
would result in an event of default under the New Credit Agreement.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing would vary
depending upon the law of the jurisdiction being applied. Generally, however, a
company would be considered insolvent if the sum of such company's debts were
greater than all of such company's property at a fair valuation or if the
present fair saleable value of such company's assets were less than the amount
that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts
(including contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and matured.
Accordingly, the Company does not believe that the fact that the liabilities of
it or Holdings exceed the book value of such corporation's assets, as reflected
on its balance sheet (which is not based on fair saleable value or fair value),
would be a significant factor in any fraudulent conveyance analysis.

The Company believed at the time of the 1989 Transaction and continues to
believe today, that at the time of the 1989 Transaction, and after giving effect
thereto, none of Holdings, JSC or CCA came within any of the clauses (a) through
(d) above and that therefore the incurrence of indebtedness under the Senior
Notes or such other indebtedness (including under the 1993 Notes and the New
Credit Agreement) will not constitute fraudulent transfers. These beliefs were
(and are) based on management's analysis of, among other things, (i) internal
cash flow projections, (ii) the Company's historical financial information and
(iii) valuations of assets and liabilities of the Company. There can be no
assurance, however, that a court passing on such questions would agree with the
Company's analysis.

CONTROL BY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS

Upon completion of the Equity Offerings, SIBV and the MSLEF II Associated
Entities (as defined below) will beneficially own % and %, respectively, and
will in the aggregate beneficially own % of the outstanding shares of Holdings
Common Stock. As a result, upon completion of the Equity Offerings, SIBV and the
MSLEF II Associated Entities will, acting together, be able to control the vote
on all matters submitted to a vote of holders of Holdings Common Stock. The
presence of SIBV and, until they dispose of their shares (see below), the MSLEF
II Associated Entities, as controlling stockholders, is also likely to deter a
potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain
control of Holdings, even if such events might be favorable to Holdings'
stockholders.

SIBV, MSLEF II and Holdings will, at or prior to completion of the Equity
Offerings, enter into a Stockholders Agreement (the 'Stockholders Agreement')
which contains, among other things, provisions for various corporate governance
matters, including the election as directors of certain of their designees. SIBV
and MSLEF II collectively will have the power, particularly in light of the
terms of the Stockholders Agreement which effectively consolidates their voting
power, to elect all of the directors of Holdings, JSC and CCA, and thereby
influence and control the management and policies of Holdings and the Company.
In addition, all officers of Holdings, JSC and CCA (other than the Chief

16

<PAGE>

Financial Officer) will be nominated and appointed by the respective directors
of Holdings, JSC and CCA designated by SIBV, and the Chief Financial Officer
will be nominated and appointed by the respective directors of Holdings, JSC and
CCA designated by MSLEF II. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, operational
decisions concerning Holdings and the Company will be made generally by
management; however certain transactions that do not generally pertain to the
day-to-day management of Holdings and the Company will be subject to approval by
certain of the directors designated by SIBV and MSLEF II. The possibility of a
deadlock exists with respect to such approval and may hinder the ability of
management to take a certain course of action. For a description of the
Stockholders Agreement, see 'Management -- Provisions of Stockholders Agreement
Pertaining to Management' and 'Certain Transactions -- Stockholders Agreement'.

SIBV, which owns its Holdings Common Stock through two wholly-owned
subsidiaries, is itself an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of JS Group, an
international paperboard and packaging corporation organized under the laws of
the Republic of Ireland. JS Group is listed on the London and Dublin Stock
Exchanges and is the largest industrial corporation in Ireland. JS Group and its
subsidiaries have a number of operations similar to those of the Company,
although for the most part outside the United States other than their newsprint
operations. Accordingly, JS Group's interests with respect to various business
decisions of Holdings and the Company may conflict with the interests of
Holdings and the Company.

MSLEF II, Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, Inc. ('MSLEF II, Inc.'),
a Delaware corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Group
Inc. ('Morgan Stanley Group') and the general partner of MSLEF II, and SIBV/MS
Equity Investors, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership the general partner of
which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Group ('Equity Investors',
and together with MSLEF II and MSLEF II, Inc., the 'MSLEF II Associated
Entities') will hold approximately %, % and %, respectively, of the
shares of Holdings Common Stock immediately following the Equity Offerings. The
intention of the MSLEF II Associated Entities is to dispose of the shares of
Holdings Common Stock owned by them. The timing of such sales or other
dispositions by them (which could include distributions to the partners of MSLEF
II) will depend on market and other conditions, but could occur or commence
relatively soon after the 180 day hold back period imposed by the underwriters
in the Equity Offerings. MSLEF II is unable to predict the timing of sales by
any of its limited partners in the event of a distribution to them. Pursuant to
the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, SIBV may, at its option, terminate the
Stockholders Agreement once the MSLEF II Group (as defined in the Stockholders
Agreement) ceases to own six percent or more of the outstanding Holdings Common
Stock. Upon the termination of the Stockholders Agreement, SIBV will no longer
be contractually limited to electing only four of the eight directors. In
addition, if the MSLEF II Group's ownership is 10% or less of the outstanding
Holdings Common Stock, SIBV will no longer be required to obtain the approval of
two directors who are designees of MSLEF II for Holdings and the Company to
engage in certain activities, for which such approval is otherwise required by
the Stockholders Agreement. See 'Management -- Provisions of Stockholders
Agreement Pertaining to Management'. Furthermore, MSLEF II has the right at any
time to waive any of the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, to agree to
the early termination thereof or to fail to exercise any of its rights
thereunder.

In addition, although SIBV and the MSLEF II Associated Entities have in the
past made additional investments in Holdings and the Company, they are not
obligated to do so in the future. Investors should not assume or expect that
either or both of such shareholders or their affiliates will invest additional
capital, whether in the form of debt or equity, in the future, particularly in
light of the intention of the MSLEF II Associated Entities to dispose of their
shares of Holdings Common Stock and the fact that SIBV's ability to make such
investments is subject to limitations contained in agreements relating to
indebtedness of SIBV and its affiliates.

TAX NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS

As of December 31, 1993, the Company and the other members of its
consolidated group had aggregate net operating loss ('NOL') carryforwards of
approximately $309 million for federal income

17

<PAGE>
tax purposes. These carryforwards, if not utilized to offset taxable income in
future periods, will expire at various times in 2005 through 2008.

If Holdings experiences an 'ownership change' within the meaning of Section
382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), the Company's
ability to use NOL carryforwards existing at such time to offset its taxable
income, if any, generated in taxable periods after the ownership change would be
subject to an annual limitation (the 'Section 382 Limitation') described below.
In general, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of stock owned by
certain '5% shareholders' increases by more than 50 percentage points over the
lowest percentage of stock owned by such shareholders during a prescribed
testing period (generally the preceding three years). Under special rules in the
Code and applicable Treasury regulations, certain shareholders which
individually own less than 5% of Holdings' stock are aggregated and treated as a
single 5% shareholder. Thus, purchasers of less than 5% of Holdings Common Stock
in the Equity Offerings generally would be treated as a single 5% shareholder.
The amount of NOL carryforwards which may be utilized on an annual basis
following an ownership change generally would be equal to the product of the
value of the outstanding stock of Holdings immediately prior to the ownership
change (reduced by certain contributions to Holdings' capital made in the two
years prior to the ownership change) multiplied by the 'long-term tax-exempt
rate', which is determined monthly and was 5.15% for February 1994.

Although the Company does not believe that Holdings will experience an
ownership change upon consummation of the Equity Offerings, it is possible that
during the three year period following the Equity Offerings, future events that
are beyond the control of the Company and Holdings (such as transfers of
Holdings Common Stock by 5% shareholders, including MSLEF II, its affiliates,
its partners and SIBV and its affiliates, in registered sales or otherwise), or
certain stock issuances or other actions by Holdings or the Company, could cause
Holdings to experience an ownership change. By way of example and without
limitation, a sale by MSLEF II of a substantial amount of Holdings Common Stock
in one or more registered secondary offerings would generally be treated as if
MSLEF II sold such stock to a new 5% shareholder (i.e., the public group that
purchased such stock) whose lowest percentage ownership in Holdings during the
three years prior to such sale was zero. Accordingly, the increase in such
public group's percentage ownership in Holdings, combined with prior owner
shifts in the three years preceding the sale by MSLEF II, would likely result in
an ownership change. As indicated under ' -- Control by Principal Shareholders'
MSLEF II currently intends to dispose of its Holdings Common Stock and sales or
other dispositions by it could occur relatively soon after the 180 day hold back
period for the Equity Offerings.

Under special rules contained in temporary Treasury regulations, certain
options are treated as exercised solely for purposes of Section 382 if the
deemed exercise thereof would result in an ownership change. Accordingly, under
these rules, it is possible that the deemed exercise by SIBV and its affiliates
of their option to purchase all of the Holdings Common Stock owned by the MSLEF
II Group (see under 'Certain Transactions -- Stockholders Agreement'), combined
with certain transfers of even a relatively small percentage of Holdings Common
Stock by certain shareholders after the consummation of the Equity Offerings, or
any sales of Holdings Common Stock by MSLEF II Associated Entities, would cause
an ownership change. Proposed Treasury regulations which would apply to testing
dates on or after November 5, 1992 but which have not yet been adopted in final
form, however, do not contain such a 'deemed exercise' rule applicable to
options. Although it appears likely, based on informal statements from Treasury
officials, that the proposed regulations will be adopted in substantially their
current form with respect to this issue, there can be no assurance as to whether
or in what form such proposed regulations will be finalized or what their
retroactive application, if any, would be.

If Holdings experienced an ownership change (as described in either of the
two preceding paragraphs) at a time at which the value of the Holdings Common
Stock was equal to the Price to Public set forth on the cover of the Prospectus
relating to the Equity Offerings of $ per share, the Section 382 Limitation
would be $[70-80] million using a 'long-term tax exempt rate' of 5.15%.
Depending on the circumstances, such an ownership change could significantly
restrict the Company's ability to utilize NOLs existing at such time to offset
subsequent taxable income. Accordingly, due to uncertainty as to whether an
ownership change will occur following the Equity Offerings, prospective

18

<PAGE>
purchasers of Senior Notes should not assume the unrestricted availability of
currently existing or future NOL carryforwards in making their investment
decisions.

ABSENCE OF PUBLIC MARKET

There is currently no established trading market for the Senior Notes and
the Company does not intend to have the Senior Notes listed for trading on any
securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system. Although the
Underwriter has advised the Company that it will make a market in the Senior
Notes, there can be no assurance that an active public market for the Senior
Notes will develop. The Underwriter is not obligated to make a market for the
Senior Notes and may discontinue or suspend such market-making at any time
without notice. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of,
or trading market for, the Senior Notes. Further, the liquidity of, and trading
market for, the Senior Notes may be adversely affected by declines and
volatility on the market for high yield securities generally as well as by any
changes in the Company's financial performance or prospects.

RECAPITALIZATION PLAN

Holdings and the Company are implementing the Recapitalization Plan to
refinance a substantial portion of their indebtedness in order to improve
operating and financial flexibility by reducing the level and overall cost of
their debt, extending maturities of indebtedness, increasing stockholders'
equity and increasing their access to capital markets. As described below, the
Recapitalization Plan includes the following primary components in addition to
others described below: (i) the Debt Offerings, (ii) the Equity Offerings, (iii)
the SIBV Investment, (iv) the Bank Debt Refinancing and (v) the Subordinated
Debt Refinancing, which is anticipated to occur on approximately December 1,
1994.

For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Recapitalization Plan would, on a
pro forma basis for such year, have resulted in $68.7 million of aggregate
savings in interest expense, of which $53.8 million represents cash interest
expense savings (in each case on a pre-tax basis). See 'Pro Forma Financial
Data'.

SOURCES AND USES

The following table sets forth the sources and uses of funds to be used to
effect the Recapitalization Plan:

(a) Assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share of Holdings
Common Stock (which is equal to the midpoint of the range of the
anticipated high and low per share offering prices set forth on the cover
of the Prospectus relating to the Equity Offerings) and, in the case of the
Offerings, without deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and expenses.

(b) The maximum amount available under such facility will be $450 million, with
up to $150 million of such amount being available for letters of credit. It
is anticipated that immediately following the Offerings letters of credit
of approximately $90 million will be outstanding under such facility. See
also (c) below.

(c) Represents the outstanding principal amount and redemption premiums
required to be paid on such securities. Aggregate redemption premiums for
the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Debentures are estimated
to be $24 million and $21 million, respectively. The Company expects that
accrued and unpaid interest at June 1 and December 1, 1994 on the Senior
Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Debentures will be paid through
internal cash flow or with additional borrowings under the New Revolving
Credit Facility.

(d) Represents the estimated accreted value of the Junior Accrual Debentures as
of December 1, 1994.

(e) Expenses include commissions and underwriting discounts relating to the
Debt Offerings and the Equity Offerings, respectively. There are no
underwriting discounts or commissions on the sale of Holdings Common Stock
pursuant to the SIBV Investment.

(f) If the underwriters in the Equity Offerings exercise their overallotment
option in full, cash will be increased by an additional $ million.

20

<PAGE>
The aggregate amount of proceeds, net of estimated expenses, necessary
immediately following the Offerings to consummate the Recapitalization Plan
(excluding the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) is approximately $1,120 million.
The sources of funds for such amount are set forth in the above table. Prior to
consummation of the Offerings, however, the Company may determine to change the
size of the various components of the Recapitalization Plan and, accordingly,
among other things may change the size of the Debt Offerings and/or the Equity
Offerings which could, in turn, affect the size of the Initial Term Loan and/or
the Delayed Term Loan. If the Company and its lenders determine to decrease the
amount of the Delayed Term Loan, with a corresponding increase in the Initial
Term Loan, or, if for any other reason, any of the proceeds to be used to effect
the Subordinated Debt Refinancing are provided by any of the sources of funds
set forth above other than the Delayed Term Loan, the Company intends to invest
the proceeds so received and which are to be so used in short term investments
until such proceeds are used to acquire Subordinated Debt (pursuant to the
Subordinated Debt Refinancing or in privately negotiated or open market
purchases) or until the abandonment of the Subordinated Debt Refinancing.

DEBT OFFERINGS

Concurrently with the Equity Offerings, CCA is offering Senior Notes in the
Debt Offerings. The closings of the Debt Offerings and the Equity Offerings are
conditioned on one another as well as on the substantially concurrent
consummation of the other components of the Recapitalization Plan (other than
the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) and on the satisfaction of certain other
closing conditions contained in the respective underwriting agreements related
thereto.

The Senior Notes will be general unsecured obligations of CCA, guaranteed
by JSC, and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all other senior
indebtedness of CCA. For a description of certain terms of the Senior Notes see
'Description of the Senior Notes'.

EQUITY OFFERINGS

Concurrently with the Debt Offerings, Holdings is offering shares of
Holdings Common Stock initially in the United States and Canada (the 'U.S.
Equity Offering') and shares of Holdings Common Stock initially outside
the United States and Canada (the 'International Equity Offering'). The closings
of the Equity Offerings and the Debt Offerings are conditioned on one another as
well as on the substantially concurrent consummation of the other components of
the Recapitalization Plan (other than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) and on
the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions contained in the respective
underwriting agreements related thereto.

SALE OF STOCK TO SIBV

SIBV has agreed to purchase, or to cause a corporate affiliate to purchase,
from Holdings pursuant to the SIBV Investment shares of Holdings
Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $100 million. Such purchase by
SIBV is conditioned on the substantially concurrent consummation of the
Offerings and the other components of the Recapitalization Plan (other than
Subordinated Debt Refinancing) and the satisfaction of certain other closing
conditions contained in the purchase agreement related thereto. Following the
consummation of the Equity Offerings and the SIBV Investment, SIBV, indirectly
through its subsidiaries, will beneficially own % of the outstanding shares
of Holdings Common Stock. See 'Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners'.

BANK DEBT REFINANCING

As part of the Recapitalization Plan, CCA and JSC will enter into the New
Credit Agreement. Substantially concurrently with the consummation of the
Offerings, CCA will use borrowings under the Initial Term Loan pursuant to the
New Credit Agreement and net proceeds of the Offerings and the SIBV Investment
contributed to it by Holdings, to refinance its indebtedness outstanding under
the Old Bank Facilities and Secured Notes. See 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness -- Terms of New Credit Agreement'.

RECLASSIFICATION AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

The capital stock of Holdings currently consists of four classes of
outstanding common stock (Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D) and a fifth
class of common stock (Class E) reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
outstanding options. Currently, the only outstanding shares of voting stock of
Holdings are the shares of Class A common stock (all outstanding shares of which
are indirectly owned by SIBV) and Class B common stock (all outstanding shares
of which are owned by MSLEF II). Immediately prior to the consummation of the
Equity Offerings, the Reclassification will occur, pursuant to which Holdings'
five classes of common stock will be converted into one class, on a basis of ten
shares of Holdings Common Stock for each share of stock outstanding of each of
the old classes. Following the Reclassification, Holdings' only class of common
stock will be the Holdings Common Stock, shares of which will be
outstanding immediately prior to the Equity Offerings and the SIBV Investment.
The Company intends prior to or substantially concurrently with the Offerings,
to cause CCA Enterprises, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of CCA, to become a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of JSC and then, to merge it and JSC Enterprises,
Inc., also a wholly-owned subsidiary of JSC, into JSC. This will result in the
cancellation of the intercompany notes held by such entities which are their
only assets. Holdings intends to interpose a wholly-owned subsidiary between it
and JSC which would own all of the capital stock of JSC. See 'Description of
Certain Indebtedness -- Substitution Transaction'.

STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT; CHARTER AND BY-LAW AMENDMENTS

Since the 1989 Transaction, Holdings, JSC and CCA have been operated
pursuant to the terms of an organization agreement (the 'Organization
Agreement'), which, among other things, provides for the election of directors,
the selection of officers and the day-to-day management of Holdings and the
Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Organization Agreement and as part of the
Recapitalization Plan, (i) the Organization Agreement will terminate upon the
closing of the Equity Offerings and, at or prior to such closing, the
Stockholders Agreement shall be entered into by SIBV, MSLEF II and Holdings and
(ii) the certificates of incorporation and by-laws of each of Holdings, JSC and
CCA will, at or prior to the closing of the Offerings, be amended. See
'Management -- Directors', 'Management -- Provisions of Stockholders Agreement
Pertaining to Management' and 'Certain Transactions -- Stockholders Agreement'
for a description of the Stockholders Agreement. In addition, a prior
commitment, subject to certain conditions, of SIBV to purchase subordinated debt
of CCA guaranteed by JSC in order to fund purchases by CCA of its Subordinated
Debt, will be terminated upon consummation of the Offerings. See 'Certain
Transactions -- Other Transactions'.

SUBORDINATED DEBT REFINANCING

On approximately December 1, 1994, CCA intends to use borrowings under the
Delayed Term Loan to effect the Subordinated Debt Refinancing, which consists of
the redemption of the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Subordinated Debentures and
the Junior Accrual Debentures (and, to the extent necessary, to use borrowings
under the New Revolving Credit Facility to pay accrued but unpaid interest on
the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Debentures). The earliest
date such securities may be redeemed is December 1, 1994. CCA reserves the
right, however, to acquire the Subordinated Debt in open market or privately
negotiated transactions prior to such date. Such acquisitions of Subordinated
Debt are expected to be financed with borrowings under the New Credit Agreement,
subject to the limitation that the indentures governing each of the classes of
the Subordinated Debt prohibit borrowings under the New Credit Agreement to be
used to acquire Subordinated Debt junior to such class. See 'Description of
Certain Indebtedness -- Terms of New Credit Agreement' and ' -- Terms of
Subordinated Debt'. This is likely to result in only Senior Subordinated Notes
being acquired prior to December 1, 1994. The amount of Subordinated Debt so
acquired, if any, will depend on market conditions and availability of such
securities at acceptable prices. JSC and CCA also reserve the right to determine
not to consummate the Subordinated Debt Refinancing for any reason, even if they
are able to do so.

Borrowings under the Delayed Term Loan, which are necessary to effect the
Subordinated Debt Refinancing, will be subject to the following and only the
following conditions: (a) no order, judgment

22

<PAGE>
or decree shall purport to enjoin or restrain (x) borrowings under the Delayed
Term Loan or (y) CCA from redeeming the Subordinated Debt, (b) certain events of
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to Holdings, JSC or CCA
shall not have occurred, (c) there shall not have occurred and be continuing a
payment default under the New Credit Agreement, the 1993 Notes, the Senior Notes
or under any subordinated debt (in each case, other than under the New Credit
Agreement, after the expiration of any applicable grace period), (d) the lenders
under the New Credit Agreement shall not have accelerated all or any of the
loans under the New Credit Agreement, (e) there shall not have occurred and be
continuing any event of default under the New Credit Agreement relating to
cross-acceleration of certain other debt and (f) in the event of any borrowing
under the Delayed Term Loan prior to December 15, 1994, the Subordinated Debt
repurchased with the proceeds thereof shall have been repurchased pursuant to
open-market or negotiated transactions for a price not in excess of 113% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated Debt to be so repurchased.

CONSENTS AND WAIVERS

As described below, the Company must obtain the Consents and Waivers under,
among other things, the 1993 Notes, the Secured Notes and the Securitization in
order to consummate the Recapitalization Plan. The Company expects that, prior
to entering into the Underwriting Agreement, it shall have obtained the Consents
and Waivers.

1993 Notes. The terms of the 1993 Notes prohibit the Subordinated Debt
Refinancing because the indebtedness incurred to effect such refinancing would
be unsubordinated secured debt under the New Credit Agreement. The Company,
however, intends to solicit the consent of the holders of the 1993 Notes to
amend the related indenture (the '1993 Note Indenture'), among other things, in
order to allow the Subordinated Debt Refinancing to be consummated without any
violation thereof (the 'Proposed 1993 Note Amendment'). In connection with such
solicitation, CCA will make certain consent payments, in cash, for each $1,000
principal amount of such securities for which consents have been validly
tendered (and not revoked) on or before the date a supplemental indenture has
been executed. CCA's obligation to make the consent payments with respect to the
1993 Notes is subject to the terms of the solicitation and is conditioned on the
execution of a supplemental indenture.

Pursuant to the Proposed 1993 Note Amendment (i) the covenant contained in
the 1993 Note Indenture which limits debt incurrence by JSC and CCA would be
modified to allow Holdings, JSC or CCA to refinance the existing Subordinated
Debt (or any portion thereof) with indebtedness for borrowed money or with an
exchange for indebtedness of any such company, so long as, at or prior to the
time such indebtedness is incurred but in no event later than April 30, 1995,
Holdings, JSC or CCA shall have consummated one or more public or private sales
of its capital stock and applied not less than $ million of the proceeds
therefrom to the repayment of indebtedness of JSC or CCA which is not by its
terms expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 1993 Notes, (ii) the
covenant contained in the 1993 Note Indenture which limits certain payments by
JSC and CCA would be modified to allow the payment of dividends on the capital
stock of JSC or CCA, following the initial public offering of capital stock of
Holdings provided for in the Recapitalization Plan, of up to 6% per annum of the
net proceeds received by JSC or CCA, as the case may be, from Holdings out of
the proceeds of (a) such public offering and (b) the SIBV Investment (net of
underwriting discounts and commissions, but without deducting other fees and
expenses therefrom), (iii) certain technical amendments would be made to the
1993 Note Indenture to clarify the circumstances under which wholly-owned
subsidiaries would be permitted to merge into JSC or CCA, (iv) the definition of
'change of control' would be amended to delete therefrom a change in a majority
of the outstanding directors, (v) the Substitution Transaction (as defined under
'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Substitution Transaction') would be
permitted to occur and (vi) certain other technical amendments.

The 1993 Note Indenture requires a majority in principal amount of the
holders of the 1993 Notes to consent to the adoption of the Proposed 1993 Note
Amendment.

Secured Notes. Under the terms of the Secured Notes, the Bank Debt
Refinancing (which involves a prepayment of the Secured Notes) would require
that the holders of the Secured Notes be given a 30 day notice of prepayment.
The Company intends to request that the holders of the Secured Notes waive

23

<PAGE>
such 30 day notice of prepayment. Such waiver requires the consent of the
holders of 60% of the holders of the outstanding principal amount of Secured
Notes.

Securitization. In 1991, JSC and CCA entered into the Securitization. The
Securitization involved the sale of JSC's and CCA's trade receivables (the
'Receivables') to Jefferson Smurfit Finance Corporation ('JSFC'), a special
purpose subsidiary of JSC. Under the Securitization, JSFC currently has
borrowings of $182.3 million outstanding at December 31, 1993 from Emerald
Funding Corporation ('EFC'), a third-party owned corporation not affiliated with
JSC, and has pledged its interest in such Receivables to EFC. EFC issued
commercial paper notes ('CP Notes') and term notes ('Term Notes'). EFC also
entered into a liquidity facility with a group of banks, for whom Dresdner Bank
AG acted as agent (the 'Liquidity Banks'), and a subordinated loan agreement
with Bank Brussels Lambert (the 'Subordinated Lender') to provide additional
sources of funding. EFC pledged its interest in the Receivables assigned to it
by JSFC to secure EFC's obligations to the Liquidity Banks, the Subordinated
Lender, and the holders of the CP Notes and the Term Notes.

Under the terms of the Master Agreement relating to the Securitization, the
completion of the Equity Offerings would result in the occurrence of a
'Liquidation Event' because JS Group and its affiliates would cease to own or
control at least 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
Holdings entitled to vote for the election of members of the Holdings' Board of
Directors. In addition, the consummation of a merger of JSC into CCA (see
'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Substitution Transaction') would
constitute a 'Liquidation Event.' The effect of the occurrence of a Liquidation
Event which is not waived is that collections on receivables are no longer
applied to purchase new receivables, but are used to pay down the amount of
outstanding debt owed to the Liquidity Banks, the Subordinated Lender and the
holders of the CP Notes and the Term Notes.

JSC intends to solicit the consents necessary to amend the Securitization
documents to amend the definition of 'Liquidation Event' so that the
consummation of the Equity Offerings and of a subsequent merger of JSC into CCA
will not result in the occurrence of a Liquidation Event.

Such proposed Securitization amendment requires the unanimous consent of
all of the Liquidity Banks, the Subordinated Lender and all of the holders of
the Term Notes.

Other. The consent of The Times Mirror Company is required under the
shareholders agreement between JSC and The Times Mirror Company in order to
consummate the Recapitalization Plan.

CERTAIN CONDITIONS

All of the transactions contemplated by the Recapitalization Plan (other
than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing) are expected to occur contemporaneously.
Consummation of the Debt Offerings is conditioned on the substantially
concurrent consummation of the other components of the Recapitalization Plan
(other than the Subordinated Debt Refinancing), including, among other things,
consummation of (i) the Equity Offerings (ii) the SIBV Investment, and (iii) the
Bank Debt Refinancing. In addition, consummation of the Debt Offerings is
conditioned on obtaining the Consents and Waivers and the execution of (i) a
supplemental indenture providing for the Proposed 1993 Note Amendment, (ii) a
waiver to the Secured Note Purchase Agreement and (iii) an amendment to the
Securitization documents.

USE OF PROCEEDS

The net proceeds to the Company (after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions) from the sale of Senior Notes in the Debt Offerings
are estimated to be million. The net proceeds to Holdings (after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions) from the sale of
shares of Holdings Common Stock in the Equity Offerings (at an assumed initial
public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the range of the
anticipated high and low public offering prices per share set forth on the cover
of the Prospectus relating to the Equity Offerings) are estimated to be $
million ($ million if the overallotment option is exercised in full). The
proceeds to Holdings from the sale of shares of Holdings Common Stock to SIBV
(or a corporate affiliate) pursuant to the SIBV Investment will be $100 million.

The Company intends to use all of such net proceeds, together with
borrowings under the New Credit Agreement, to pay in full all amounts under the
1989 and 1992 Credit Agreements and the

24

<PAGE>
Secured Notes. Specifically, the Company will repay $196.5 million outstanding
at December 31, 1993 under the revolving credit facility under the 1989 Credit
Agreement (the 'Revolving Credit Facility'), which bears interest at the
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (as defined therein) plus 2.25%; $412.3 million of term
loan indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 1993 under the 1989 Credit
Agreement, which bears interest at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (as defined
therein) plus 2.25% (the weighted average rate at December 31, 1993 on
outstanding 1989 Credit Agreement borrowings was 5.95%); $201.3 million of term
loan indebtedness at December 31, 1993 under the 1992 Credit Agreement, which
bears interest at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (as defined therein) plus 3.00%
(6.375% at December 31, 1993); and $270.5 million of Secured Notes at December
31, 1993 bearing interest at the three-month Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (as
defined therein) plus 2.75% (6.25% at December 31, 1993). The Company has
interest rate swaps and other hedging agreements with commercial banks which
effectively fix (for remaining periods of up to 3 years) the Company's interest
rate on $215 million of such variable rate borrowings at average all-in rates of
approximately 9.10%. The Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to terminate on
December 14, 1995, the term loan indebtedness under the 1989 and 1992 Credit
Agreements is scheduled to mature on December 31, 1997 and the Secured Notes are
scheduled to mature on December 1, 1998.

If the overallotment option granted as part of the Equity Offerings is
exercised, proceeds from the sale of shares of Holdings Common Stock pursuant
thereto will be used by the Company for general corporate purposes.

The Company may enter into floating rate interest rate swap agreements with
respect to some or all of its obligations under the Senior Notes and, if it does
so, will be sensitive to prevailing interest rates for the term of such
agreements, which may range from one year to the maturity of the Senior Notes.

share set forth on the cover of the Prospectus relating to the Equity Offerings,
for the Equity Offerings and the SIBV Investment). This table should be read in

(a) Until the Subordinated Debt Refinancing occurs, or if it does not occur,
and assuming no open market or privately negotiated purchases of
Subordinated Debt prior to the Subordinated Debt Refinancing (see
'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Terms of New Credit
Agreement -- The New Bank Facilities'), the Senior Subordinated Notes, the
Subordinated Debentures and the Junior Accrual Debentures will remain
outstanding and no borrowings will be made under the Delayed Term Loan.

(b) For further information about the New Revolving Credit Facility, the
Initial Term Loan and the Delayed Term Loan see 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness -- Terms of New Credit Agreement'.

(c) Represents funds utilized under such revolving credit facilities. The
maximum amount available under each of the New Revolving Credit Facility
(including the amount anticipated to be drawn down upon consummation of the
Recapitalization Plan) and the Revolving Credit Facility is $450 million
(with up to $150 million of such amount being available for letters of
credit) and $400 million (with up to $125 million of such amount being
available for letters of credit), respectively. It is anticipated that
immediately following the Offerings letters of credit of approximately $90
million will be outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility. The
Company expects that accrued and unpaid interest at June 1 and December 1,
1994 on the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Debentures will
be paid through internal cash flow or with additional borrowings under the
New Revolving Credit Facility.

(d) For further information about the 1993 Notes, see 'Description of Certain
Indebtedness -- Terms of 1993 Notes'.

(e) For further information about the Senior Notes, see 'Description of the
Senior Notes'.

(f) For further information about the Subordinated Debt, see 'Description of
Certain Indebtedness -- Terms of Subordinated Debt'.

(g) The Junior Accrual Debentures accrete in value at the rate of 15 1/2%
compounded semi-annually. The aggregate accreted value, including accrued
interest, of the Junior Accrual Debentures was approximately $129.7 million
at December 31, 1993 and will be approximately $148.7 million at December
1, 1994.

(h) The change in retained earnings (deficit) as a result of the
Recapitalization Plan represents $55.7 million of after-tax cost related to
the extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt. The extraordinary
loss on a pre-tax basis includes a $35.3 million write-off of existing
deferred debt issuance costs, $44.6 million of call premiums, and a $5.9
million adjustment to reflect the result of marking-to-market the interest
rate swaps related to the long-term debt to be repaid with borrowings under
the New Credit Agreement and net proceeds of the Offerings and the SIBV
Investment. See 'Pro Forma Financial Data'.

(a) Equity in earnings (loss) of affiliates in 1991 includes after-tax charges
of $29.3 million and $6.7 million for the write-off of the Company's equity
investments in Temboard and PCL, respectively.

(b) For purposes of these calculations, earnings consist of income (loss) before
income taxes, equity in earnings (loss) of affiliates, minority interests
and extraordinary item and cumulative effect of accounting changes, plus
fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest on indebtedness,
amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and that portion of lease
rental expense considered to be representative of the interest factor
therein (deemed to be one-fourth of lease rental expense).

(c) For the years ended December 31, 1991, 1992 and 1993, earnings were
inadequate to cover fixed charges by 26.7 million, $31.4 million and $264.2
million, respectively.

(d) Gross profit margin represents the excess of net sales over cost of goods
sold divided by net sales.

(e) EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, income taxes,
depreciation, depletion and amortization, equity in earnings (loss) of
affiliates, minority interests, recapitalization expense and extraordinary
items and cumulative effect of accounting changes and in 1993, nonrecurring
restructuring and other charges. The restructuring and other charges include
$43 million of asset writedowns and $107 million of future cash
expenditures. EBITDA is presented here, not as a measure of operating
results, but rather as a measure of the Company's debt service ability.

Refinancing) occurred as of December 31, 1993.

The pro forma financial data set forth below in giving effect to the
Recapitalization Plan assumes an initial public offering price of $ per
share, the midpoint of the range of the anticipated high and low public offering
prices per share set forth on the cover of the Prospectus relating to the Equity
Offerings, for the Equity Offerings and the SIBV Investment.

The estimated transaction fees and expenses included in the following pro
forma financial data are provided solely for purposes of presenting the pro
forma financial data set forth below. The actual transaction fees and expenses

(1) Represents the actual interest expense incurred, amortization of related
deferred debt issuance costs, and cash payments and the mark-to-market
adjustment of the related interest rate swap agreements during the year
ended December 31, 1993 on indebtedness assumed to be retired in the
refinancing of the term loan indebtedness under the 1989 Credit Agreement in
connection with the 1993 Notes. The pro forma condensed consolidated
statement of operations assumes that the interest rate swap agreements on
debt assumed to be retired were marked-to-market as of the beginning of the
period presented. The loss associated with marking these agreements to
market was treated as an extraordinary charge and therefore does not appear
in the pro forma statements of operations. See Note (c) to the pro forma
condensed consolidated statement of operations.

(2) Interest expense on the Initial Term Loan is at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (as
defined below) plus 3.0%. Assumes the Debt Offerings are swapped to a
floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.77% (average rate of approximately
6.98% for the year ended December 31, 1993). A change in the Adjusted LIBOR
Rate of .25% would change interest expense on the Debt Offerings by
approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1993.

(3) Represents the actual interest expense incurred, amortization of related
deferred debt issuance costs, and cash payments under swap agreements during
the year ended December 31, 1993 on indebtedness assumed to be repaid with
the proceeds from the Equity Offerings, Debt Offerings and the Initial Term
Loan. Assumes that the interest rate swap agreements on debt assumed to be
repaid were marked-to-market as of the beginning of the period presented.
The loss associated with marking these agreements to market was treated as
an extraordinary charge and therefore does not appear in the pro forma

consolidated statement of operations.

(4) Deferred debt costs will be amortized over the term of the related debt.

(5) Interest expense on the Delayed Term Loan is at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus
2.5%. A change in the Adjusted LIBOR Rate of .25% would change interest
expense by approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1993.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the selected historical financial data and the historical consolidated financial
statements of the Company. Except as otherwise indicated, the following
discussion relates solely to historical results and does not consider the
potential impact from the Recapitalization Plan.

GENERAL

INDUSTRY CONDITIONS

Sales of containerboard and corrugated shipping containers, two of the
Company's most important products, are generally subject to changes in industry
capacity and cyclical changes in the economy, both of which can significantly
impact selling prices and the Company's profitability. Operating rates in the
industry during 1991 and 1992 were at high levels relative to demand, which was
lower due to the sluggish U.S. economy and a decline in export markets. This
imbalance resulted in excess inventories in the industry and lower prices for
the Company's containerboard and corrugated shipping container products, which
began early in 1991 and has continued throughout 1992 and most of 1993. From the
first quarter of 1991 through the third quarter of 1993 industry linerboard
prices fell from $347 per ton to $295 per ton. During 1993, industry operating
rates were lower as many containerboard producers, including the Company, took
downtime at containerboard mills to reduce the excess inventories. By the end of
the third quarter of 1993, inventory levels had decreased significantly. The
lower level of inventories and the stronger U.S. economy provided improved
market conditions late in 1993, enabling the Company and other producers to
implement a $25 per ton price increase for containerboard. A further linerboard
increase of $30 per ton has been announced by all major integrated
containerboard producers, including the Company, for March 1, 1994.

Newsprint prices have fallen substantially since 1990 due to supply and
demand imbalances. During 1991 and 1992, new capacity of approximately two
million tons annually came on line, representing an approximate 12% increase in
supply. At the same time, U.S. consumption of newsprint fell, due to declines in
readership and ad linage. As prices fell, certain high cost, virgin paper
machines, primarily in Canada, representing approximately 1.2 million tons of
annual production capacity, were shut down and remained idle during 1993. While
supply was diminished, a price increase announced for 1993 was unsuccessful.
Although market demand has improved in the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company
does not expect significant improvement in prices before the second quarter of
1994.

In addition, prices for many of the Company's other products, including
solid bleached sulfate, recycled boxboard, folding cartons and reclaimed fibre
weakened in 1993 and 1992. While the effect of the reclaimed fibre price
decreases is unfavorable to the reclamation products division, it is favorable
to the Company overall because of the reduction in fibre cost to the Company's
paper mills that use reclaimed fibre. The Company has taken various steps to
extend its business into less cyclical product lines, such as industrial
packaging and consumer packaging.

As a result of these industry conditions, the Company's gross margin
declined from 18.1% in 1991 to 16.6% in 1992 and 12.7% in 1993.

The Company's sales and profitability have historically been more sensitive
to price changes than changes in volume. There can be no assurance that
announced price increases for the Company's products can be implemented, or that
prices for the Company's products will not decline from current levels.

COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES

The recent cyclical downturn in the Paperboard/Packaging Products segment
has led management to undertake several major cost reduction initiatives. In
1991, the Company implemented an austerity program to freeze staff levels, defer
certain discretionary spending programs and more aggressively manage capital
expenditures and working capital in order to conserve cash and reduce interest
expense. While these measures successfully reduced expenses and increased cash
flow, the length and extent of

33

<PAGE>
the industry downturn led the Company, in 1993, to initiate a new six year plan
to reduce costs, increase volume and improve product mix (the 'Plan').

The Plan is a systematic Company-wide effort designed to improve the cost
competitiveness of all the Company's operating facilities and staff functions.
In addition to increases in volume and improvements in product mix resulting
from a focus on less commodity oriented business at its converting operations,
the program will focus on opportunities to reduce costs and other measures,
including (i) productivity improvements, (ii) capital projects which provide
high returns and quick paybacks, (iii) reductions in fibre cost, (iv) reductions
in the purchase cost of materials, (v) reductions in personnel costs and (vi)
reductions in waste cost. See 'Business -- Business Strategy'.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

In September 1993, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $150 million to
implement a restructuring program (the 'Restructuring Program') designed to
improve the Company's long-term competitive position and to provide for various
environmental and other matters. The charge consists of approximately $96
million related to the restructuring program and approximately $54 million of
other charges related primarily to environmental matters. The restructuring
component of the charge includes a provision for direct expenses associated with
plant closures, reductions in workforce, and realignment and consolidation of
various manufacturing operations over an approximate two to three year period.
The restructuring program is expected to reduce production cost, employee
expense and depreciation charges. As part of the Restructuring Program, the
Company closed certain high cost operating facilities, including a coated
recycled boxboard mill and five converting plants, in January 1994. While future
benefits of the Restructuring Program are uncertain, the operating losses in
1993 for the plants shut down in January 1994 and those contemplated in the
future were $31 million. While the Company believes that it would have realized
financial benefits in 1993 had these plants been shut down at the beginning of
the year, and that it will realize such benefits in future periods, no
assurances can be given in this regard and, in particular, no assurances can be
given as to what portion of such loss would not have been realized in 1993 had
such plants been shut down for the entire year.

Approximately $39 million in other charges consists of a provision for
environmental and legal matters which primarily represent remediation and other
clean-up costs related to plant closures, existing facilities, and former
operating sites. These estimates mainly include clean-up costs for contamination
at certain Company-owned properties, and to a lesser extent, probable expenses
for response costs at various sites where the Company has received notice that
it is a potentially responsible party ('PRP'). As discussed under 'Risk
Factors -- Environmental Matters' and 'Business -- Environmental Matters', the
Company, as well as other companies in the industry, faces potential
environmental liability related to various sites at which wastes have allegedly
been deposited. The Company has received notice that it is or may be a PRP at a
number of federal and state sites (the 'Sites') where remedial action may be
required. Because the laws that govern the clean up of waste disposal sites have
been construed to authorize joint and several liability, government agencies or
other parties could seek to recover all response costs for any Site from any one
of the PRPs for such Site, including the Company, despite the involvement of
other PRPs. Although the Company is unable to estimate the aggregate response
costs in connection with the remediation of all Sites, if the Company were held
jointly and severally liable for all response costs at some or all of the Sites,
it would have a material adverse effect on financial condition of the Company.
However, joint and several liability generally has not in the past been imposed
on PRPs, and, based on such past practice, the Company's past experience and the
financial conditions of other PRPs with respect to the Sites, the Company does
not expect to be held jointly and severally liable for all response costs at any
Site. Liability at waste disposal sites is typically shared with other PRPs and
costs generally are allocated according to relative volumes of waste deposited.
At most Sites, the waste attributed to the Company is a very small portion of
the total waste deposited at the Site (generally significantly less than 1%).
There are approximately ten Sites where final settlement has not been reached
and where the Company's potential liability is expected to exceed de minimis
levels. Accordingly, the Company believes that its estimated total probable
liability for response costs at the Sites was adequately reserved at December
31, 1993. Further, the estimate takes into consideration the number of other
PRPs at each site, the identity, and financial

34

<PAGE>
position of such parties, in light of the joint and several nature of the
liability, but does not take into account possible insurance coverage or other
similar reimbursement.

The $150 million charge in connection with the Restructuring Program and
various environmental and other matters consists of approximately $43 million
for the write-down of assets at closed facilities and certain other
nonproductive assets and $107 million of probable future cash expenditures. The
Company anticipates that the cash expenditures will be funded through operations
and that a substantial portion related to the Restructuring Program will be paid
in 1994, 1995 and 1996.

1993 COMPARED TO 1992

The Company's net sales for 1993 decreased 1.7% to $2.95 billion compared
to $3.0 billion in 1992. Net sales decreased 1.9% in the Paperboard/Packaging
Products segment and increased 0.3% in the Newsprint segment.

The decrease in Paperboard/Packaging Products segment sales for 1993 was
due primarily to lower prices and changes in product mix for containerboard,
corrugated shipping containers and folding cartons. This decrease was partially
offset by an increase in sales volume primarily of corrugated shipping
containers, which set a record in 1993. A newly constructed corrugated container
facility and several minor acquisitions in 1992 caused net sales to increase
$34.9 million for 1993.

The net sales increase in the Newsprint segment was a result of an increase
in sales volume in 1993 compared to 1992, partially offset by a decline in sales
prices.

35

<PAGE>
Cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for 1993 and 1992 were 85.9%
and 81.9%, respectively, for the Paperboard/Packaging Products segment and
102.8% and 99.0%, respectively, for the Newsprint segment. The increase in cost
of goods sold as a percent of net sales for the Paperboard/Packaging Products
segment was due primarily to the aforementioned changes in pricing and product
mix. The increase in the cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for the
Newsprint segment was due primarily to the higher cost of energy and fibre and
decreases in sales price. The Company changed the estimated depreciable lives of
its paper machines and major converting equipment. These changes were made to
better reflect the estimated periods during which the assets will remain in
service and were based upon the Company's historical experience and comparable
industry practice. These changes were made effective January 1, 1993 and had the
effect of reducing depreciation expense by $17.8 million and decreasing the 1993
net loss by $11.0 million.

Selling and administrative expenses increased to $239.2 million (3.4%) for
1993 compared to $231.4 million for 1992. The increase was due primarily to
higher provisions for retirement costs, acquisitions, new facilities and other
costs.

In order to minimize significant year-to-year fluctuations in pension cost
caused by financial market volatility, the Company changed, effective January 1,
1993, the method of accounting for the recognition of fluctuations in the market
value of pension assets. The effect of this change on 1993 results of
operations, including the cumulative effect of prior years, was not material.
See Note 8 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The Company reduced its weighted average discount rate in measuring its
pension obligations from 8.75% to 7.6% and its rate of increase in compensation
levels from 5.5% to 4.0% at December 31, 1993. The net effect of changing these
assumptions was the primary reason for the increase in the projected benefit
obligations and the changes are expected to increase pension cost by
approximately $3.4 million in 1994.

As a result of the $150 million provision for restructuring and other
charges and the lower margins, primarily for newsprint and containerboard
products, the Company had a loss from operations of $14.7 million for 1993,
compared to $267.7 million income from operations for 1992.

Interest expense for 1993 declined $45.9 million due to lower effective
interest rates and the lower level of subordinated debt outstanding resulting
primarily from the 1992 Transaction (as defined below).

The benefit from income taxes for 1993 was $83.0 million compared to a tax
provision of $10.0 million in 1992. The significant difference in the income tax
provision from 1993 to 1992 results from the use of the liability method of
accounting which restored deferred income taxes and increased the related asset
values for tax effects previously recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount
of the related assets under prior business combinations. The Company's effective
tax rate for 1993 was lower than the Federal statutory tax rate due to the
nondeductibility of goodwill amortization and a $5.7 million provision to adjust
deferred tax assets and liabilities in 1993 due to the enacted Federal income
tax rate change from 34% to 35%.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ('SFAS') No. 109, 'Accounting for Income Taxes' and SFAS
No. 106, 'Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions'. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 was to increase net
income for 1993 by approximately $20.5 million. The cumulative effect of
adopting SFAS No. 106 was to decrease net income for 1993 by approximately $37
million. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 112 'Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits' in 1994, the effect of which is not expected to be
material.

The loss before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of accounting
changes for 1993 was $174.6 million, compared to $34.0 million for the
comparable period in 1992. The Company recorded an extraordinary loss of $37.8
million (net of income tax benefits of $25.8 million) for the early
extinguishment of debt associated with the issuance of the 1993 Notes.

36

<PAGE>
1992 COMPARED TO 1991

Net sales for 1992 increased to $3.0 billion (2.0%) compared to $2.94
billion in 1991. Net sales increased 3.7% in the Paperboard/Packaging Products
segment and decreased 13.6% in the Newsprint segment.

The increase in Paperboard/Packaging Products segment sales was due
primarily to a 5.6% increase in sales volume for corrugated shipping containers.
Segment sales were also positively affected by increases in sales volumes for
papertubes and partitions and to a lesser extent for folding cartons and
reclamation products. Prices of containerboard products improved over 1991 but
did not increase sufficiently to cover cost increases, causing margins to be
somewhat lower in 1992. Prices for most of the Company's other packaging
products have declined compared to 1991. A minor acquisition in 1992 and the
operation of new facilities in the Paperboard/Packaging Products segment
resulted in an increase in net sales of $9.8 million, while plant closings
caused net sales to decrease by $2.2 million.

The net sales decrease in the Newsprint segment was a result of the lower
sales prices as discussed above. Newsprint sales volume for 1992 was virtually
the same as 1991.

The Company continued to benefit from certain austerity measures first
implemented during 1991 to help offset the impact of the recession. These
measures had a positive effect on cost of goods sold and selling and
administrative expenses. Cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for 1992
and 1991 were 81.9% and 81.8% , respectively, for the Paperboard/Packaging
Products segment and 99.0% and 83.1% respectively, for the Newsprint segment.
The increase in the Newsprint segment was due primarily to the aforementioned
decrease in sales price.

Selling and administrative expense as a percent of net sales for 1992 was
7.7%, unchanged from 1991. The Company continues to benefit from certain cost
containment measures implemented in 1991 to reduce expenses to help offset the
impact of the recession and inflation.

Income from operations for 1992 decreased 12.4% to $267.7 million as a
result of the low average selling prices for newsprint and packaging products
discussed above.

Interest expense for 1992 was lower by $35.1 million, due to lower
effective interest rates and the lower level of debt outstanding as a result of
the 1992 Transaction. During 1992, the Company replaced $425.0 million of mature
swaps with $400.0 million of the new two-year fixed interest rate swaps at an
annual savings of approximately 3.8% on such amount (equivalent to an annual
savings of approximately $15.1 million).

The Company recorded a $10.0 million income tax provision in both 1992 and
1991 on income before income taxes, equity in earnings (loss) of affiliates and
extraordinary item of $27.2 and $24.3 million, respectively. The tax provisions
for 1992 and 1991 were higher than the Federal statutory tax rate due to several
factors, the most significant of which was the impact of permanent differences
from applying purchase accounting.

Equity in loss of affiliates for 1991 included a write-down of $36.0
million with respect to the Company's equity investments in Temboard and Company
Limited Partnership and PCL Industries Limited. See Note 3 to the Company's
consolidated financial statements. For 1992 the Company had an extraordinary
loss of $49.8 million (net of income tax benefits of $25.8 million) for the
early extinguishment of debt associated with the 1992 Transaction.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

The Company uses the LIFO method of accounting for approximately 81% of its
inventories. Under this method, the cost of products sold reported in the
financial statements approximates current cost and thus reduces the distortion
in reported income due to increasing costs. In recent years, inflation has not
had a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the
Company.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's primary uses of cash for the next several years will be
principal and interest payments on its indebtedness and capital expenditures.

37

<PAGE>
In April 1993, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount
of the 1993 Notes. Proceeds of the 1993 Notes were used to refinance a
substantial portion of indebtedness in order to improve operating and financial
flexibility by extending maturities of indebtedness and improving liquidity. As
a result of the issuance of the 1993 Notes, there are no significant scheduled
payments due on bank term loans until June 1996 (assuming the Bank Debt
Refinancing is not consummated). In connection with the issuance of the 1993
Notes, a subsidiary of JS Group committed to purchase up to $200 million
aggregate principal amount of 11 1/2% Junior Subordinated Notes maturing 2005,
the proceeds of which must be used to repurchase or otherwise retire
Subordinated Debt. The Company does not intend to use the commitment if the
Recapitalization Plan occurs.

Holdings and the Company are implementing the Recapitalization Plan to
refinance a substantial portion of their indebtedness in order to improve
operating and financial flexibility by (i) reducing the level and overall cost
of their debt, (ii) extending maturities of indebtedness, (iii) increasing
stockholders' equity and (iv) increasing their access to capital markets. The
Recapitalization Plan includes (i) the offering by CCA of $500 million aggregate
principal amount of % Series A Senior Notes, which will be due 2004 and $100
million aggregate principal amount of % Series B Senior Notes, which will be
due 2002, (ii) the offering by Holdings of shares of Holdings Common
Stock, (iii) the SIBV Investment, and (iv) the New Credit Agreement consisting
of a $450 million New Revolving Credit Facility due 2001, a $200 million Initial
Term Loan due 2002 and an $850 million Delayed Term Loan due 2001. Proceeds of
the Recapitalization Plan, exclusive of the $850 million Delayed Term Loan, will
be used to refinance all of the Company's indebtedness under the 1989 and 1992
Credit Agreements and the Secured Notes. The applications of borrowings under
the Delayed Term Loan shall be used to redeem or repurchase the Subordinated
Debt. It is anticipated that letters of credit of approximately $90 million will
be outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility immediately following the
Offerings. After giving effect to the Recapitalization Plan on a pro forma
basis, at December 31, 1993 the Company would have had approximately $2,408.8
million of total long-term debt outstanding, all of which would have been senior
debt, as compared to $2,619.1 million of long-term debt outstanding had the
Recapitalization Plan not been effected. After completion of the
Recapitalization Plan there will be no significant scheduled payments due on
bank debt (other than required payments out of 'excess cash', if any) until 18
months following consummation of the Offerings, at which time approximately
$51.0 million will be payable.

The Company's earnings are significantly affected by the amount of interest
on its indebtedness. At December 31, 1993, the Company had $215 million of
variable rate debt which had been swapped to a weighted average fixed rate of
approximately 9.1%. The Company also had interest rate swap agreements related
to the Securitization Program that effectively converted $95 million of fixed
rate borrowings to a variable rate of 5.6% (at December 31, 1993) and converted
$80 million of variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate of 7.2% through January
1996. In addition, the Company is party to interest rate swap agreements related
to the 1993 Notes which convert $500 million of fixed rate borrowings to a
variable rate of 8.6% (at December 31, 1993).

Capital expenditures consist of property and timberland additions and
acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were
$117.4 million, $97.9 million and $118.9 million, respectively. Financing
arrangements entered into in connection with the 1989 Transaction impose an
annual limit on future capital expenditures, as defined in the financing
arrangements, of approximately $125.0 million. The capital spending limit is
subject to increase in any year if the prior year's spending was less than the
maximum amount allowed. For 1993, such carryover from 1992 was $75 million.
Because the Company has invested heavily in its core businesses over the last
several years, management believes the annual limitation on capital expenditures
should not impair its plans for maintenance, expansion and continued
modernization of its facilities. It is expected that the New Credit Agreement
will contain limitations on capital expenditures substantially similar to those
contained in the financing arrangements entered into in connection with the 1989
Transaction. The Company anticipates making capital expenditures of
approximately $142 million in 1994.

Under the terms of the Old Bank Facilities, the Company is required to
comply with certain financial covenants, including maintenance of quarterly and
annual interest coverage ratios and earnings, as defined. In anticipation of
violating these financial covenants at September 30, 1993, the

38

<PAGE>
Company requested and received waivers from its lender group, and in December,
1993 amended the Old Bank Facilities to modify financial covenants. The Company
was in compliance with the amended covenants at December 31, 1993. The Company
expects to have similar covenants in the New Credit Agreement.

Operating activities have historically been the major source of cash for
the Company's working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt payments. For
1993 and 1992, net cash provided by operating activities was $78.2 million and
$145.7 million, respectively.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had $112.1 million in unused borrowing
capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. Following the Offerings, the
Company anticipates having $360.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under the
New Credit Agreement. The Company has borrowing capacity of $230.0 million under
the Securitization subject to the Company's level of eligible accounts
receivable. At December 31, 1993, the Company had borrowed $182.3 million under
the Securitization and the level of eligible receivables did not permit any
additional borrowings under the Securitization at the date. The Securitization
matures in April 1996, at which time the Company expects to refinance it.
Although the Company believes that it will be able to do so, no assurance can be
given in this regard.

The Company's existing indebtedness imposes restrictions on its ability to
incur additional indebtedness. Such restrictions, together with the highly
leveraged position of the Company, could restrict corporate activities,
including the Company's ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for
unanticipated capital expenditures or to take advantage of business
opportunities. However, the Company believes that cash provided by operations
and available financing sources will be sufficient to meet the Company's cash
requirements for the next several years.

BUSINESS

GENERAL

The predecessor to the Company was founded in 1974 when JS Group, a
worldwide leader in the packaging products industry, commenced operations in the
United States by acquiring 40% of a small paperboard and packaging products
company. The remaining 60% of that company was acquired by JS Group in 1977, and
in 1978 net sales were $42.9 million. The Company implemented a strategy to
build a fully integrated, broadly based, national packaging business, primarily
through acquisitions, including Alton Box Board Company in 1979, the paperboard
and packaging divisions of Diamond International Corporation in 1982, 80% of SNC
in 1986 and 50% of CCA in 1986. The Company financed its acquisitions by using
leverage and, in several cases, utilized joint venture financing whereby the
Company eventually obtained control of the acquired company. While no major
acquisition has been made since 1986, the Company has made 18 smaller
acquisitions and started up five new facilities which had combined sales in 1993
of $280.3 million. JSC was formed in 1983 to consolidate the operations of the
Company, and today the Company ranks among the industry leaders in its two
business segments, Paperboard/Packaging Products and Newsprint. In 1993, the
Company had net sales of $2.9 billion, achieving a compound annual sales growth
rate of 32.6% for the period since 1978.

The Company believes it is one of the nation's largest producers of
paperboard and packaging products and is the largest producer of recycled
paperboard and recycled packaging products. In 1993, the Company's system of 16
paperboard mills produced 1,840,000 tons of virgin and recycled containerboard,
829,000 tons of coated and uncoated recycled boxboard and SBS and 206,000 tons
of recycled cylinderboard, which were sold to the Company's own converting
operations or to third parties. The Company's converting operations consist of
52 corrugated container plants, 18 folding carton plants, and 16 industrial
packaging plants located across the country, with three plants located outside
the U.S. In 1993, the Company's container plants converted 1,942,000 tons of
containerboard, an amount equal to approximately 105.5% of the amount it
produced, its folding carton plants converted 542,000 tons of SBS, recycled
boxboard and coated natural kraft, an amount equal to approximately 65.4% of the
amount it produced, and its industrial packaging plants converted 123,000 tons
of recycled cylinderboard, an amount equal to approximately 59.7% of the amount
it produced.

The Company's paperboard operations are supported by its reclamation
division, which processed or brokered 3.9 million tons of wastepaper in 1993,
and by its timber division which manages approximately one million acres of
owned or leased timberland located in close proximity to its virgin fibre mills.
The paperboard/packaging products operations also include 14 consumer packaging
plants.

In addition, the Company believes it is one of the nation's largest
producers of recycled newsprint. The Company's newsprint division includes two
newsprint mills in Oregon, which produced 615,000 tons of recycled newsprint in
1993, and two facilities that produce Cladwood'r', a construction material
produced from newsprint and wood by-products. The Company's newsprint mills are
also supported by the Company's reclamation division.

DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

Since its founding in 1974, the Company has followed a strategy to build a
broadly based packaging business, primarily through acquisitions. The Company's
acquisitions were principally motivated by opportunities to expand productive
capacity, both geographically and into new product lines, further integrate its
operations and broaden its existing product lines and customer base. The Company
has sought to improve the productivity of plants and operations acquired by it.
The most significant acquisitions were:

1979 -- Acquired 51% of Alton Box Board Company; the remaining 49% was
acquired in 1981. Alton's containerboard and industrial packaging
businesses consisted of fully integrated containerboard and paperboard
operations. The Alton acquisition significantly enhanced the Company's
presence in the midwest and expanded its operations to the southeast. In
addition, the Alton acquisition expanded the Company's product lines to
include folding cartons and industrial packaging and provided a network of
reclamation facilities which supplied wastepaper to the Company's recycled
mills. Alton owned a kraft linerboard mill and a recycled medium

40

<PAGE>
mill, two recycled cylinderboard mills, 32 converting facilities and 9
recycled wastepaper plants. Alton's total annual paperboard production at
the date of acquisition was 471,775 tons, as compared to 582,017 tons in
1993.

1982 -- Acquired 50% of the paperboard and packaging divisions of Diamond
International Corporation through a joint venture; the remaining 50% was
acquired in 1983. In addition to expanding the Company's existing product
lines and customer base, the Diamond acquisition added new product lines,
including labels and other consumer packaging, and a related business
which produced rotogravure cylinders for use on printing presses used
extensively by the folding carton industry. Diamond owned two coated
recyled boxboard mills, which provided the Company with an integrated
source of recycled boxboard for use in its folding carton plants, as well
as three folding carton plants, three shipping container plants and three
consumer packaging plants. Diamond's operations were located primarily in
the midwest. Diamond's annual coated recycled boxboard production,
exclusive of a mill recently shut down, at the date of acquisition was
74,494 tons, as compared to 113,006 tons in 1993.

1986 -- Acquired 80% of SNC, formerly Publishers Paper Company. The SNC
acquisition extended the Company's product line to include newsprint and
also expanded the Company's reclamation operations to the west coast. The
SNC acquisition consisted of two newsprint mills and two Cladwood'r'
manufacturing plants, all of which are located in Oregon. SNC's annual
newsprint production at the date of acquisition was 592,804 tons, as
compared to 615,151 tons in 1993.

1986 -- Acquired 50% of CCA through a joint venture with the Morgan
Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund I, L.P.; the remaining 50% was acquired in
1989. The total CCA acquisition cost was $1,130 million, which was
financed with $1,060 million of debt and $70 million of preferred and
common equity. The CCA acquisition substantially enhanced the Company's
production capacity and further integrated the Company's operations. It
also expanded its paperboard and packaging operations to the west coast,
which enabled the Company to compete on a national level and broaden its
customer base. The CCA acquisition consisted primarily of 9 paperboard
mills, 40 converting plants and 5 reclamation facilities as well as
approximately 1,000,000 acres of owned or leased timberlands. CCA's
operations are located throughout the United States. CCA's total annual
paperboard production at the date of acquisition was 1,760,039 tons, as
compared to 2,002,064 tons in 1993.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

PAPERBOARD

General

Paperboard is a general term used to describe certain heavyweight grades of
paper primarily used for packaging products. Paperboard is produced from four
basic types of pulp: (i) unbleached kraft; (ii) bleached kraft; (iii) recycled
and (iv) semi-chemical. Unbleached kraft, bleached kraft and semi-chemical
paperboards, are produced primarily from wood pulp. Recycled paperboard is
produced primarily from wastepaper. Recycled paperboard demand has grown at a
more rapid rate than virgin grades based primarily on its increased quality and
rising environmental awareness by consumers.

Paperboard is classified by three major end-uses: (i) containerboard, (ii)
boxboard and (iii) other paperboard. Containerboard primarily includes
linerboard and corrugating medium, the components of corrugated boxes used in
the transportation of manufactured goods. Boxboard includes folding carton
stock, setup boxboard and food board. Folding cartons, the major segment of
boxboard, are used to package a wide range of consumer products such as health
and beauty products, dry cereals and soap powders. Folding cartons are often
clay-coated for better printability and consumer appeal. Other paperboard
includes paperboard used in a number of industrial applications: fiber drums,
composite cans, spiral tubes, cores, gypsum wallboard liner and box partitions.

Containerboard

Demand. Containerboard production grew from 21.3 million tons in 1983 to
29.2 million tons in 1993 (consisting of 26.2 million tons of domestic
production and 3.0 million tons of exports) for a compound annual growth rate
('Rate') of 3.3%. From 1983-1993, containerboard produced from recycled
paperboard grew at a much faster rate than unbleached kraft, experiencing a 7.6%
Rate. Containerboard demand is highly cyclical and fluctuates with the general
level of economic activity.

[GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION of the relationship between the change in Gross Domestic
Product ('GDP') and the change in containerboard production from 1983 to 1993.
For each year during the period 1983-1993, the annual percentage change in GDP
was 3.9%, 6.2%, 3.2%, 2.9%, 3.1%, 3.9%, 2.5%, 1.2%, (0.7)%, 2.6% and 2.9%,
respectively. During this same period, the annual percentage change in
containerboard production was 10.2%, 7.1%, (3.7)%, 8.4%, 7.1%, 1.8%, 1.1%, 3.7%,
2.2%, 4.2% and 1.0%, respectively. The source of the containerboard production
data is the American Forest and Paper Association.]

Overall, containerboard demand is a function of the level of corrugated box
shipments from box converting plants and, to some extent, the level of
containerboard inventories on hand. Over the last six months of 1993, corrugated
box demand was very strong with shipments from August 1993 through December 1993
exceeding corresponding 1992 months by 9.1%, 6.6%, 5.7%, 12.3% and 10.1%,
respectively. Box plant containerboard inventory levels were at 2.16 million
tons on December 31, 1993, up slightly from 1.98 million tons on October 31,
1993, their lowest level on a tonnage basis since 1987. Containerboard demand
has also been assisted in recent months by an increase in exports. The Company
is currently experiencing strong demand and believes that it will continue as
the economy improves. Resource Information Systems, Inc. ('RISI'), a well known
industry consultant, projects domestic containerboard production to grow to 28.9
million tons by 1996, a 3.3% Rate from 1993.

42

<PAGE>
Supply. U.S. containerboard capacity totaled 31.1 million tons in 1993, for
a 2.9% Rate from 1983 to 1993. From 1983 to 1993, capacity utilization reached a
high of 97.8% in 1987 and a low of 90.3% in 1985. Approximately, 4.0 million
tons of new capacity was added between year-end 1988 and year-end 1993,
decreasing operating rates from 1987 levels.

Operating rates in the industry during 1991 and 1992, however, ran at high
levels relative to demand, which was lower due to the sluggish U.S. economy and
a decline in export markets. This imbalance resulted in excess inventories in
the industry and lower prices for the Company's containerboard and corrugated
shipping container products, which continued throughout most of 1993. To reduce
rising inventories, many containerboard producers, including the Company, took
downtime at containerboard mills which resulted in lowering operating rates to
93.7% for 1993. By the end of the third quarter of 1993, inventory levels had
decreased significantly.

According to the AFPA, producers plan to add only a modest 2.1 million tons
of containerboard capacity in 1994-1996. 1.4 million tons, or 70% of the added
capacity, will be recycled linerboard and corrugating medium. The following
graph reflects the historical relationship between containerboard capacity
utilization and linerboard prices, the predominant grade for containerboard
products.

[GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION of the relationship between the level of containerboard
capacity utilization and linerboard prices from 1983 to 1993. For each year
during the period 1983-1993, annual containerboard capacity utilization was
90.4%, 94.5%, 90.3%, 95.2%, 97.8%, 95.4%, 94.6%, 95.1%, 95.2%, 95.6% and 93.7%,
respectively. For each year during this same period, unbleached kraft linerboard
prices per short ton (42 lb., Eastern Market) were $290, $335, $274, $295, $361,
$403, $405, $378, $336, $345 and $316, respectively (1983-1984 prices are as of
December 31. 1985-1993 prices reflect the average of the four quarter-end
prices). The source of the containerboard capacity utilization data is the
American Forest and Paper Association. The source of the linerboard prices is
the Pulp and Paper North American Factbook.]

Pricing. Pricing historically has been correlated with the levels of
industry capacity utilization. Over the past business cycle, containerboard
prices peaked in 1989. Linerboard peaked at approximately $410 per ton and
reached a low of $280-$290 per ton the second quarter of 1993, owing to
decreased demand and increased inventories. Over the past several months,
containerboard pricing has strengthened as demand has increased, inventories
have fallen, and corrugated box producers have been successful in increasing
prices to customers. For example, a $25 per ton increase for linerboard was
implemented in November 1993, raising prices to $315-$325 per ton, and most of
the major linerboard producers, including the Company, have announced a $30 per
ton increase effective March 1, 1994. Although there can be no assurance that
this price increase will be successfully implemented, management believes that
such price increase will hold.

Boxboard

Demand. Total boxboard production (including exports) grew to 8.8 million
tons in 1993 from 6.8 million tons in 1983, representing a 2.5% Rate.
Traditionally, recycled and SBS have been by far the largest segments of
boxboard production, representing 40% and 49%, respectively. During 1983 to
1993, recycled boxboard grew at a 2.0% Rate, SBS boxboard grew at a 1.0% Rate
and unbleached kraft, starting from a much smaller base, grew at a 5.2% Rate.
Like containerboard, boxboard demand tends to fluctuate with the general level
of economic activity. During the late 1980s, the use of clay coated recycled
boxboard as a substitute for SBS boxboard increased based on its improved
quality, heightened environmental awareness by consumers and increased demand by
customers for less expensive packaging alternatives. RISI projects both recycled
boxboard production and SBS production to increase at a 2.2% Rate from 1993 to
1996.

Supply. From 1983 to 1993 total boxboard capacity grew from 7.6 million
tons to 9.3 million tons, a 2.0% Rate. SBS folding boxboard grew at a 1.7% Rate,
reaching 2.5 million tons by 1993, while recycled folding boxboard grew to 3.0
million tons by 1993, a 1.1% Rate.

[GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION of the level of boxboard capacity utilization from 1983
to 1993. For each year during the period 1983-1993, annual boxboard capacity
utilization was 89.9%, 92.9%, 87.5%, 89.5%, 90.2%, 92.2%, 92.8%, 90.7%, 93.5%,
92.6% and 94.8%, respectively. The source of this data is the American Forest
and Paper Association.]

According to the AFPA, 1.2 million tons of boxboard capacity will be added
between 1993-1996. Recycled boxboard accounts for 16% and SBS for 56% of
announced capacity additions.

Pricing. While general boxboard pricing levels are dependent on the overall
balance of supply and demand, relative pricing of different grades of boxboard
is affected by the substitutability of one grade for another in various customer
applications. For example, although the clay coated recycled demand and supply
situation is positive for the upcoming years, clay coated recycled prices are
influenced by SBS prices. During the late 1980s, SBS prices were substantially
higher than clay coated recycled prices. In recent years, SBS prices have
declined at a greater percentage than clay coated recycled, so that on a yield
basis, there is not currently a significant price differential between the two.
Future price growth in some grades of SBS may be tempered by recent and
projected capacity increases.

NEWSPRINT

General. Newsprint is an uncoated paper used in newspaper production.
Virgin newsprint is manufactured primarily from mechanical or groundwood pulps.
In recent years, the majority of U.S. state legislatures have enacted recycled
content laws requiring newspaper publishers to use newsprint

44

<PAGE>
containing various percentages of recycled fiber. Although the bulk of North
American newsprint capacity is located in Canada, the majority of recycled
newsprint capacity is located in the U.S. because of the close proximity of
wastepaper collection sites.

Demand. According to the AFPA, the total U.S. newsprint production in 1993
remained flat, compared to 1992, with 7.08 million tons being produced. Canadian
production is estimated to have been 10.39 million tons in 1993, compared to
9.84 million tons in 1992. From 1983 to 1993, North American newsprint
production grew at a 1.6% Rate. Newsprint demand is dependent on the general
level of newspaper advertising. RISI estimates North American newsprint
shipments will remain flat through 1995.

According to the AFPA, North American production is also influenced by the
export levels to major newsprint consuming regions such as Western Europe and
Asia. In 1992, U.S. and Canadian producers increased export shipments 17% over
1991. 1993 witnessed a significant decline in North American exports due to
unfavorable currency exchange rates and new capacity in Europe and Asia.

Supply. According to the AFPA, North American newsprint capacity was 18.1
million tons in 1993, reflecting a 1.2% Rate since 1983. During the period from
year end 1989 to year end 1991, 1.26 million tons of U.S. newsprint capacity and
.95 million tons of Canadian newsprint capacity were added, severely depressing
utilization rates in the early 1990s. Capacity expansion in the newsprint
industry has been concentrated on recycling and, over the last three years,
eleven new deinking plants have been brought into operation with the capacity to
recycle 2.9 million tons of recovered paper.

Capacity utilization has been at relatively low levels during the early
1990s as a large growth in capacity has coincided with a decline in newsprint
demand, which has led to lower rates for North American mills overall. Capacity
utilization from 1983 to 1993 is shown in the table below:

[GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION of the level of newsprint capacity utilization in the
United States and Canada from 1983 to 1993. For each year during the period
1983-1993, U.S. newsprint capacity utilization was 89.5%, 94.7%, 93.8%, 97.0%,
97.3%, 97.8%, 96.7%, 97.3%, 97.0%, 97.0% and 98.0%, respectively. For each year
during this same period, Canadian newsprint capacity utilization was 85.1%,
91.8%, 91.4%, 93.9%, 97.7%, 98.9%, 96.2%, 89.8%, 87.3%, 88.6% and 95.7%,
respectively. The source of these figures is the American Forest and Paper
Association.]

According to the AFPA, North American newsprint capacity will decline from
16.7 million metric tons in 1992 to 16.6 million metric tons in 1996. This
decline in capacity is expected because no new mills or machines are planned
during these years and capacity gains resulting from rebuilds of existing
machines and miscellaneous improvements will be offset by the reallocation of
capacity in several mills to produce groundwood and specialty papers rather than
newsprint. Several new recycled newsprint mills have been announced recently in
Western Europe, and such mills are expected to affect future exports by North
American producers.

45

<PAGE>
Pricing. Newsprint is a commodity paper grade with pricing largely a
function of capacity utilization. West coast prices fell from a peak of
approximately $595 per metric ton (30-lb, delivered) in 1988 to a low of $420
per metric ton in the second quarter of 1992. In December, 1993 newsprint
producers, including the Company, announced price increases which were
unsuccessful. Although market demand has improved in the fourth quarter of 1993,
the Company does not expect significant improvement in prices before the second
quarter of 1994.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

The principal components of the Company's business strategy include the
following:

MAINTAIN FOCUS ON RECYCLED PRODUCTS

The Company believes it is the largest processor of wastepaper, the largest
producer of coated recycled paperboard, the largest producer of recycled medium
and one of the largest producers of recycled newsprint in the U.S. The Company
has historically utilized a significant amount of recycled fibre in its products
and has maintained a strategy to allow it to supply all of the Company's
recycled fibre needs for its paper producing operations. There are several
advantages to this strategy. First, the Company's national operations allow it
to minimize costs of transporting wastepaper to its mills. Second, recycled
fibre has a lower cost base than virgin fibre and wastepaper supplies are
increasing. Third, recycled products are gaining in popularity with customers as
a result of increased environmental awareness and improved quality, making them
more competitive with products made from virgin fibre. The following chart
indicates the significant percentage of recycled paperboard produced and
consumed, by the Company's operations.

Total paperboard consumed by the Company............................. 2,476 2,569 2,607
Percent recycled................................................ 34.5% 35.9% 32.3%
</TABLE>

FOCUS ON COST REDUCTION

The Company continuously strives to reduce operating costs on a system-wide
basis through the implementation of cost reduction programs. In 1991, the
Company implemented an austerity program to offset the impact of declining
prices. This austerity program froze staff levels, deferred certain
discretionary spending programs and more aggressively managed capital
expenditures and working capital to conserve cash and reduce interest expense.
For example, as a result of the austerity program the Company's average working
capital as a percentage of annual sales has averaged 2.8% over the last two
years.

While the austerity program succeeded in reducing expenses and improving
cash flow, the length and extent of the recession led the Company in 1993, to
initiate the Plan and the Restructuring Program.

The Plan is a systematic Company-wide effort designed to improve the cost
competitiveness of all the Company's operating facilities and staff functions.
The Plan focuses on reducing costs and other measures, including:

Productivity improvements to reduce variable unit cost at production
facilities and to increase volume.

Identification of approximately $100 million of high return, quick payback
capital projects for which spending will be accelerated.

Reduction in fibre cost.

Reduction in cost of materials generated through a Company-wide council
which will negotiate large national purchasing activities.

46

<PAGE>
Reductions in personnel cost through a Company-wide freeze on compensation
for salaried employees in 1994 and reductions in workforce.

Reduction in waste cost in the manufacturing process.

Increased focus on specialty niche businesses which are less commodity
oriented and carries pricing premiums.

The Company is implementing the Restructuring Program to improve the
Company's long-term competitive position. The Restructuring Program includes
plant closures, reductions in workforce, and the realignment and consolidation
of various manufacturing operations over an approximately two to three year
period. The Restructuring Program is expected to reduce production cost,
employee expense and depreciation charges. While future benefits of the
Restructuring Program are uncertain, the operating losses in 1993 for the plants
shut down in January 1994 and those contemplated in the future were $31 million.
While the Company believes that it would have realized financial benefits in
1993 had these plants been shut down at the beginning of the year, and that it
will realize such benefits in future periods, no assurances can be given in this
regard and, in particular, no assurances can be given as to what portion of such
loss would not have been realized in 1993 had such plants been shut down for the
entire year. The Company closed certain high cost operating facilities,
including a coated recycled boxboard mill and five converting plants, in January
1994.

CONTINUE TO PURSUE VERTICAL INTEGRATION

The Company's operations are vertically integrated in that the Company uses
significant amounts of timber harvested from its timberlands and wastepaper
provided by its reclamation operations in the manufacture of paperboard and
newsprint, and converts its production of paperboard into shipping containers,
folding cartons, papertubes and other products. The Company also exchanges a
significant amount of containerboard with other major companies in the industry.
These exchanges are generally used when shipment from the Company's mills would
not be freight cost efficient or when container plants require a certain grade
of containerboard not manufactured by the Company.

The Company's integration reduces the volatility of pricing for its
containerboard products, allows it to run its mills at higher operating rates
during industry downturns and protects the Company from potential regional
supply and demand imbalances for recycled fibre grades.

The following table illustrates the balance between the Company's
production and consumption levels for its core businesses for the last three
years.

CONTINUE GROWTH IN CORE BUSINESSES

The Company has built its core businesses through selective acquisitions of
existing businesses and ongoing capital improvements.

Over the years, the Company's acquisition strategy has accomplished several
objectives, including (i) geographic expansion of its operations, (ii) growth of
its recycling capacity and expertise, (iii) expansion of its product lines in
order to satisfy most of the packaging needs of large national and multinational
customers, (iv) expansion of its operations into related products which can be
successfully

47

<PAGE>
marketed to existing customers as well as into related products to which the
Company can apply its papermaking expertise, and (v) integration of its
operations. The Company intends to continue its current strategy by exploring
potential acquisitions and pursuing those which meet its business objectives.

MAINTAIN LEADING MARKET POSITIONS

The Company believes it is one of the most broadly based paperboard
packaging producers in the United States. The Company has achieved this status
through its selective acquisitions and its ongoing capital improvements program.
The Company believes it maintains significant U.S. market positions including
the following:

largest producer of recycled paperboard

largest producer of folding cartons

largest producer of coated recycled boxboard

largest processor of wastepaper

largest producer of mottled white linerboard

one of the largest producers of recycled newsprint

second largest producer of corrugated shipping containers

largest producer of recycled medium

fifth largest producer of containerboard

The Company believes that its size, as evidenced by its leading U.S. market
positions, provides certain advantages in marketing its products. The Company's
prominence in the U.S. packaging industry gives it excellent customer
visibility. The Company is well recognized by its customers as a quality
producer and has recently entered a select number of strategic alliances with
certain large, national account customers to supply packaging. In addition, the
Company's broad range of packaging products provides a single source option,
whereby all of the customers' packaging needs can be satisfied by the Company.

IMPROVE FINANCIAL PROFILE TO GROW CORE BUSINESSES

Since the 1989 recapitalization of JSC, the Company has pursued a strategy
designed to reduce its financial risk profile. During this period, the Company
has accessed various capital markets through several transactions, resulting in
improved financial flexibility.

In 1991, the Company completed a $230 million accounts receivable
securitization. Initial proceeds of $168 million were raised by an A1/D1+
commercial paper issue and a AA-medium term note issue. The proceeds were used
to retire debt, while the transaction increased the liquidity of the Company by
$180 million.

In 1992, Holdings received cash equity capital from a subsidiary of JS
Group and MSLEF II (and certain of its limited partners who owned Junior Accrual
Debentures) of $33 million and $200 million, respectively, and in December 1993
a subsidiary of JS Group converted $167 million of preferred stock of Holdings
into common stock of Holdings. The Company also negotiated a $400 million senior
secured term loan. The equity and loan proceeds were used to repurchase $193.5
million of the Junior Accrual Debentures and to prepay a portion of certain
subordinated indebtedness and $400 million of the 1989 term loan. This
transaction reduced near term debt service requirements and also reduced annual
interest expense by $30 million.

In 1993, in order to improve operating and financial flexibility, CCA
issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1993 Notes, the proceeds of
which were used to repay $100 million of revolving credit indebtedness and an
aggregate of $387.5 million of term loan indebtedness under its existing credit
agreements. As a result of such refinancing, the Company successfully extended
maturities of its indebtedness and improved its liquidity.

48

<PAGE>
The Company anticipates that the Recapitalization Plan will further improve
operating and financial flexibility by reducing the level and overall cost of
its debt, extending maturities of indebtedness, increasing stockholders' equity
and increasing its access to capital markets.

PRODUCTS

PAPERBOARD/PACKAGING PRODUCT SEGMENT

Containerboard and Corrugated Shipping Containers. The Company's
containerboard operations are highly integrated and the Company believes this
integration enhances its ability to respond quickly and efficiently to customers
and to fill orders on short lead times. Tons of containerboard produced and
converted for the last three years were:

</TABLE>

The Company's mills produce a full line of containerboard, including
unbleached kraft linerboard, mottled white linerboard and recycled medium.

The Company believes it is the nation's largest producer of mottled white
linerboard, the largest producer of recycled medium and the fifth largest
producer of containerboard. Unbleached kraft linerboard is produced at the
Company's mills located in Fernandina Beach and Jacksonville, Florida and
mottled white linerboard is produced at its Brewton, Alabama mill. Recycled
medium is produced at the Company's mills located in Alton, Illinois, Carthage,
Indiana, Circleville, Ohio and Los Angeles, California. In 1993, the Company
produced 1,018,000, 315,000 and 507,000 tons of unbleached kraft linerboard,
mottled white linerboard and recycled medium, respectively.

Large capital investment is required to sustain the Company's
containerboard mills, which employ state of the art computer controlled
machinery in their manufacturing processes. During the last five years, the
Company has invested approximately $246 million to enhance product quality,
reduce costs, expand capacity and increase production efficiency, as well as
make required improvements to stay in compliance with environmental regulations.
Major capital projects completed in the last five years include (i) a rebuild of
Jacksonville's linerboard machine to produce high performance, lighter weight
grades now experiencing higher demand, (ii) modifications to Brewton's mottled
white machine to increase run speed by 100 tons per day and (iii) a project to
reduce sulfur emissions from the Fernandina Beach linerboard mill. A key
strategy for the next few years will be to reduce wood cost at its virgin fibre
mills by modifying methods of woodchip production and handling, utilizing random
length roundwood forms and continuing to pursue forest management practices
designed to enhance timberland productivity.

The Company's sales of containerboard in 1993 were $670.6 million
(including $384.1 million of intracompany sales). Sales of containerboard to its
52 container plants are reflected at prices based upon those published by
Official Board Markets which are generally higher than those paid by third
parties except in exchange contracts.

The Company believes it is the second largest producer of corrugated
shipping containers in the U.S. Corrugated shipping containers, manufactured
from containerboard in converting plants, are used to ship such diverse products
as home appliances, electric motors, small machinery, grocery products, produce,
books, tobacco and furniture, and for many other applications, including point
of purchase displays. The Company stresses the value added aspects of its
corrugated containers, such as labeling and multi-color graphics, to
differentiate its products and respond to customer requirements. The Company's
container plants serve local customers and large national accounts and are
located nationwide, generally in or near large metropolitan areas. The Company's
total sales of corrugated shipping containers in 1993 were $1,175.7 million
(including $81.1 million of intracompany sales).

49

<PAGE>
Corrugated shipping container sales volumes for 1991, 1992 and 1993 were 25,178,
26,593 and 27,268 million square feet, respectively.

RECYCLED BOXBOARD, SBS AND FOLDING CARTONS

The Company's recycled boxboard, SBS and folding carton operations are also
well integrated. Tons of recycled boxboard and SBS produced and converted for
the last three years are provided below:

</TABLE>

The Company's mills produce recycled coated and uncoated boxboard and SBS.
The Company believes it is the nation's largest producer of clay-coated
boxboard, made from 100 percent recycled fibre, which offers comparable quality
to virgin boxboard for most applications. The Company also believes that its
premium-priced SBS offers a high quality product for packaging applications.

Coated recycled boxboard is produced at the Company's mills located in
Middletown, Ohio, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Santa Clara, California and
Wabash, Indiana. The Company produces uncoated recycled boxboard at its Los
Angeles, California mill and SBS at its Brewton, Alabama mill. The Company
believes its coated recycled boxboard, known as MASTERCOAT'r', is recognized in
the industry for its high quality and extensive range of grades and calipers.
The Brewton machine produces four basic grades of SBS including MASTERPRINT'r',
which is ideally suited for converting into folding cartons and related end
uses, MASTERSEAL'r' and MASTERVAC'r', which are used for visual carded packaging
that facilitates merchandising at the point of sale, and MASTERWITE'r', which is
designed for intricately printed and die-cut greeting cards and other specialty
uses. In 1993, the Company produced 653,000 and 176,000 tons of recycled
boxboard and SBS, respectively. The Company's total sales of recycled boxboard
and SBS in 1993 were $409.7 million (including $197.2 million of intracompany
sales).

The Company believes it is the nation's largest producer of folding
cartons, offering the broadest range of converting capabilities, including web
and sheet litho, rotogravure and flexo printing and a full line of structural
and design graphics services. The Company's 18 folding carton plants convert
recycled boxboard and SBS, including approximately 49% of the boxboard and SBS
produced by the Company, into folding cartons. Folding cartons are used
primarily to protect customers' products while providing point of purchase
advertising. The Company makes folding cartons for a wide variety of
applications, including food and fast foods, detergents, paper products,
beverages, health and beauty aids and other consumer products. Customers range
from small local accounts to large national and multinational accounts. The
Company's folding carton plants are located nationwide, generally in or near
large metropolitan areas. The Company's sales of folding cartons in 1993 were
$648.2 million (including $2.2 million of intracompany sales). Folding carton
sales volumes for 1991, 1992 and 1993 were 482,000, 487,000 and 475,000 tons,
respectively.

The Company has focused its capital expenditures in these operations and
its marketing activities to support a strategy of enhancing product quality as
it relates to packaging graphics, increasing flexibility while reducing customer
response time and assisting customers in innovating package designs.

The Company provides marketing consultation and research activities, a key
competitive factor within the folding carton industry, through its Design and
Market Research (DMR) Laboratory. It provides customers with graphic and product
design tailored to the specific technical requirements of lithographic,
rotogravure and flexographic printing, as well as photography for packaging,
sales promotion concepts, and point of purchase displays.

RECYCLED CYLINDERBOARD AND INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING

The Company's recycled cylinderboard and industrial packaging operations
are also integrated. Tons of recycled cylinderboard produced and converted for
the last three years are shown in the table below:

The Company's recycled cylinderboard mills are located in: Tacoma,
Washington, Monroe, Michigan (2 mills), Lafayette, Indiana, and Cedartown,
Georgia. In 1993, total sales of recycled cylinderboard were $61.8 million
(including $17.9 million of intracompany sales).

The Company's 16 industrial packaging plants convert recycled
cylinderboard, including a portion of the recycled cylinderboard produced by the
Company, into papertubes and cores. Papertubes and cores are used primarily for
paper, film and foil, yarn carriers and other textile products and furniture
components. The Company also produces solid fibre partitions for the
pharmaceutical, electronics, cosmetics and plastics industries. In addition, the
Company produces a patented self-locking partition especially suited for
automated packaging and product protection. The Company believes it is the
nation's third largest producer of tubes and cores. The Company's industrial
packaging sales in 1993 were $88.1 million (including $1.6 million in
intracompany sales).

CONSUMER PACKAGING

The Company manufactures a wide variety of consumer packaging products,
which are generally non-cyclical. These products include flexible packaging,
printed paper labels, foil labels, and labels that are heat transferred to
plastic containers for a wide range of industrial and consumer product
applications. The contract packaging plants provide cartoning, bagging, liquid-
or powder-filling, high-speed overwrapping and fragranced advertising products.
The Company produces high-quality rotogravure cylinders and has a full-service
organization highly experienced in the production of color separations and
lithographic film for the commercial printing, advertising and packaging
industries. The Company also designs, manufactures and sells custom machinery
including specialized machines that apply labels to customers' packaging. The
Company currently has 14 facilities including the engineering service center
referred to below and has improved their competitiveness by installing
state-of-the-art production equipment.

In addition, the Company has an engineering services center, specializing
in automated production systems and highly specialized machinery, providing
expert consultation, design and equipment fabrication for consumer and
industrial products manufacturers, primarily from the food, beverage and medical
products industries.

Total sales of consumer packaging products and services were $179.8 million
(including $15.1 million of intracompany sales).

RECLAMATION OPERATIONS; FIBRE RESOURCES AND TIMBER PRODUCTS

The raw materials essential to the Company's business are reclaimed fibre
from wastepaper and wood, in the form of logs or chips. The Brewton,
Circleville, Jacksonville and Fernandina mills use primarily wood fibres, while
the other paperboard mills use reclaimed fibre exclusively. The newsprint mills
use approximately 45% wood fibre and 55% reclaimed fibre.

The Company believes it is the nation's largest recycler of wastepaper. The
use of recycled products in the Company's operations begins with its reclamation
division which operates 26 facilities that collect, sort, grade and bale
wastepaper, as well as collect aluminum and glass. The reclamation division
provides valuable fibre resources to both the paperboard and newsprint segments
of the Company as well as to other producers. Many of the reclamation facilities
are located in close proximity to the Company's recycled paperboard and
newsprint mills, assuring availability of supply, when needed, with

51

<PAGE>
minimal shipping costs. In 1993, the Company processed 3.9 million tons of
wastepaper, which the Company believes is approximately twice the amount of
wastepaper processed by its closest competitor. The amount of wastepaper
collected and the proportions sold internally and externally by the Company's
reclamation division for the last three years were:

</TABLE>

The reclamation division also operates a nationwide brokerage system
whereby it purchases and resells wastepaper (including wastepaper for use in its
recycled fibre mills) on a regional and national contract basis. Such contracts
provide bulk purchasing, resulting in lower prices and cleaner wastepaper. Total
sales of recycled materials for 1993 were $242.9 million (including $120.8
million of intracompany sales).

During 1993, the wastepaper which was reclaimed by the Company's
reclamation plants and brokerage operations satisfied all of the Company's mill
requirements for reclaimed fibre.

The Company's timber division manages approximately one million acres of
owned and leased timberland. In 1993, approximately 53% of the timber harvested
by the Company was used in its Jacksonville, Fernandina and Brewton Mills. The
Company harvested 808,000 cords of timber which would satisfy approximately 32%
of the Company's requirements for woodfibres. The Company's woodfibre
requirements not satisfied internally are purchased on the open market or under
long-term contracts. In the past, the Company has not experienced difficulty
obtaining an adequate supply of wood through its own operations or open market
purchases. The Company is not aware of any circumstances that would adversely
affect its ability to satisfy its wood requirements in the foreseeable future.
In recent years, a shortage of wood fibre in the spotted owl regions in the
Northwest has resulted in increases in the cost of virgin wood fibre. However,
the Company's use of reclaimed fibre in its newsprint mills has mitigated the
effect of this in significant part.

In 1993, the Company's total sales of timber products were $227.8 million
(including $185.1 million of intracompany sales).

NEWSPRINT SEGMENT

Newsprint Mills. The Company believes it is one of the largest producer of
recycled newsprint and the fourth largest producer overall of newsprint in the
United States. The Company's newsprint mills are located in Newberg and Oregon
City, Oregon. During 1991, 1992 and 1993, the Company produced 614,000, 615,000
and 615,000 tons of newsprint, respectively. In 1993, total sales of newsprint
were $219.5 million (none of which were intracompany sales).

For the past three years, an average of approximately 56% of the Company's
newsprint production has been sold to The Times Mirror Company ('Times Mirror')
pursuant to a long-term newsprint agreement (the 'Newsprint Agreement') entered
into in connection with the Company's acquisition of SNC stock in February 1986.
Under the terms of the Newsprint Agreement, the Company supplies newsprint to
Times Mirror generally at prevailing West Coast market prices. Sales of
newsprint to Times Mirror in 1993 amounted to $115.2 million.

Cladwood'r'. Cladwood'r' is a wood composite panel used by the housing
industry, manufactured from sawmill shavings and other wood residuals and
overlayed with recycled newsprint. The Company has two Cladwood'r' plants
located in Oregon. Total sales for Cladwood'r' in 1993 were $29.1 million ($.5
million of which were intracompany sales).

MARKETING

The marketing strategy for the Company's mills is to maximize sales of
products to manufacturers located within an economical shipping area. The
strategy in the converting plants focuses on both specialty products tailored to
fit customers' needs and high volume sales of commodity products. The

52

<PAGE>
Company also seeks to broaden the customer base for each of its segments rather
than to concentrate on only a few accounts for each plant. These objectives have
led to decentralization of marketing efforts, such that each plant has its own
sales force, and many have product design engineers, who are in close contact
with customers to respond to their specific needs. National sales offices are
also maintained for customers who purchase through a centralized purchasing
office. National account business may be allocated to more than one plant
because of production capacity and equipment requirements.

COMPETITION

The paperboard and packaging products markets are highly competitive and
are comprised of many participants. Although no single company is dominant, the
Company does face significant competitors in each of its businesses. The
Company's competitors include large vertically integrated companies as well as
numerous smaller companies. The industries in which the Company competes are
particularly sensitive to price fluctuations as well as other competitive
factors including design, quality and service, with varying emphasis on these
factors depending on product line. The market for the Newsprint segment is also
highly competitive.

BACKLOG

Demand for the Company's major product lines is relatively constant
throughout the year and seasonal fluctuations in marketing, production,
shipments and inventories are not significant. The Company does not have a
significant backlog of orders, as most orders are placed for delivery within 30
days.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Company's research and development center works with its manufacturing
and sales operations, providing state-of-the-art technology, from raw materials
supply through finished packaging performance. Research programs have provided
improvements in coatings and barriers, stiffeners, inks and printing. The
technical staff conducts basic, applied and diagnostic research, develops
processes and products and provides a wide range of other technical services.

The Company actively pursues applications for patents on new inventions and
designs and attempts to protect its patents against infringement. Nevertheless,
the Company believes that its success and growth are dependent on the quality of
its products and its relationships with its customers, rather than on the extent
of its patent protection. The Company holds or is licensed to use certain
patents, but does not consider that the successful continuation of any important
phase of its business is dependent upon such patents.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 1993, the Company had approximately 16,600 employees, of
which approximately 11,300 employees (68%), are represented by collective
bargaining units. The expiration date of union contracts for the Company's major
facilities are as follows: the Alton mill, expiring June 1994; the Newberg mill,
expiring March 1995; the Oregon City mill, expiring March 1997; the Brewton
mill, expiring October 1997; the Fernandina mill, expiring June 1998; a group of
12 properties, including 4 paper mills and 8 corrugated container plants,
expiring June 1998; and the Jacksonville mill, expiring June 1999. The Company
believes that its employee relations are generally good and is currently in the
process of bargaining with unions representing production employees at a number
of its other operations.

PROPERTIES

The Company's properties at December 31, 1993 are summarized in the table
below. The table reflects the previously mentioned closure in early 1994 of
three container plants, two folding carton plants and one recycled boxboard mill
but does not reflect the additional closures contemplated by the Restructuring.
Approximately 62% of the Company's investment in property, plant and equipment
is represented by its paperboard and newsprint mills.

In addition to its manufacturing facilities, the Company owns and leases
approximately 758,000 acres and 226,000 acres of timberland, respectively, and
also operates wood harvesting facilities.

LITIGATION

In May 1993, CCA received a notice of default on behalf of Otis B. Ingram,
as executor of the estate of Naomi M. Ingram, and Ingram-LeGrand Lumber Company
with respect to certain timber purchase agreements and timber management
agreements between CCA and such parties dated November 22, 1967 pertaining to
approximately 30,000 acres of property in Georgia (the 'Agreements'). In June
1993, CCA filed suit against such parties in the United States District Court,
Middle District of Georgia, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and
damages in excess of $3 million arising out of the defendants' alleged breach
and anticipatory repudiation of the Agreements. The defendants have filed an
answer and counterclaim seeking damages in excess of $14 million based on
allegations that CCA breached the Agreements and failed to pay for timber
allegedly stolen or otherwise removed from the property by CCA or third parties.
The alleged thefts of timber are being investigated by the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation, which has advised CCA that it is not presently a target of this
investigation. CCA has filed a third-party complaint against Keadle Lumber
Enterprises, Inc. seeking indemnification with respect to such alleged thefts
and has filed a reply to the defendants' counterclaims denying the allegations
and any liability to the defendants. Management does not believe that the
outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition or operations.

The Company is a defendant in a number of other lawsuits that have arisen
in the normal course of business. While any litigation has an element of
uncertainty, the management of the Company believes that the outcome of such
suits will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or
operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Federal, state and local environmental requirements, particularly relating
to air and water quality, are a significant factor in the Company's business.
The Company employs processes in the manufacture

54

<PAGE>
of pulp, paperboard and other products, resulting in various discharges and
emissions that are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental
control statutes, regulations and ordinances. The Company operates and expects
to operate under permits and similar authorizations from various governmental
authorities that regulate such discharges and emissions.

Occasional violations of permit terms have occurred from time to time at
the Company's facilities, resulting in administrative actions, legal proceedings
or consent decrees and similar arrangements. Pending proceedings include the
following:

In March 1992, JSC entered into an administrative consent order with
the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation to carry out any
necessary assessment and remediation of JSC-owned property in Duval County,
Florida that was formerly the site of a sawmill that dipped lumber into a
chemical solution. Assessment is on-going, but initial data indicates soil
and groundwater contamination that may require nonroutine remediation.
Management believes that the probable costs of this site, taken alone or
with potential costs at other Company-owned properties where some
contamination has been found, will not have a material adverse effect on
its financial condition or operations.

In February 1994, JSC executed a consent decree with the State of Ohio
in full satisfaction of all liability for alleged violations of applicable
standards for particulate and opacity emissions with respect to two
coal-fired boilers at its Lockland, Ohio recycled boxboard mill (which has
been permanently closed as part of the Company's restructuring program),
and will be required to pay $122,000 in penalties and enforcement costs
pursuant to such consent decree. The United States Environmental Protection
Agency has also issued a notice of violation with respect to such
emissions, but has informally advised JSC's counsel that no Federal
enforcement is likely to be commenced in light of the settlement with the
State of Ohio.

The Company also faces potential liability as a result of releases, or
threatened releases, of hazardous substances into the environment from various
sites owned and operated by third parties at which Company-generated wastes have
allegedly been deposited. Generators of hazardous substances sent to off-site
disposal locations at which environmental problems exist, as well as the owners
of those sites and certain other classes of persons (generally referred to as
'potentially responsible parties' or 'PRPs'), are, in most instances, subject to
joint and several liability for response costs for the investigation and
remediation of such sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ('CERCLA') and analogous state laws, regardless
of fault or the legality of the original disposal. The Company has received
notice that it is or may be a potentially responsible party at a number of
federal and/or state sites where remedial action may be required, and as a
result may have joint and several liability for cleanup costs at such sites.
However, liability of CERCLA sites is typically shared with the other
potentially responsible parties and costs are commonly allocated according to
relative amounts of waste deposited. Because the Company's relative percentage
of waste deposited at the majority of these sites is quite small, management of
the Company believes that its probable liability under CERCLA, taken on a case
by case basis or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on
its financial condition or operations. Pending CERCLA proceedings include the
following:

In January 1990, CCA filed a motion for leave to intervene and for
modification of the consent decree in United States v. General Refuse
Services, a case pending in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio. CCA contends that it should be allowed to
participate in the proposed consent decree, which provides for remediation
of alleged releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a
site in Miami County, near Troy, Ohio, according to a plan approved by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region V (the 'Agency'). The
Court granted CCA's motion to intervene in this litigation, but denied
CCA's motion for an order denying entry of the consent decree.
Consequently, the consent decree has been entered without CCA's being
included as a party to the decree, meaning that CCA may have some exposure
to potential claims for contribution to remediation costs incurred by other
participants and for non-reimbursed response costs incurred by the Agency,
which costs are reported by the Agency as $3.4 million as of February 1994.
CCA's appeal of the Court's decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
is pending.

55

<PAGE>
In December 1991, the United States filed a civil action against CCA
in United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, to recover its
unreimbursed costs at the Miami County site, and CCA subsequently filed a
third-party complaint against certain entities that had joined the original
consent decree. In October 1993, the United States filed an additional suit
against CCA in the same court seeking injunctive relief and damages up to
$25,000 per day from March 27, 1989 to the present, based on CCA's alleged
failure to properly respond to the Agency's document and information
requests in connection with this site. In July 1993, counsel for CCA was
advised by the Office of the United States Attorney, Northern District of
Illinois that a criminal inquiry is also underway relating to CCA's
responses to the Agency's document and information requests. CCA is
investigating the circumstances regarding its responses, and is pursuing
settlement with respect to all matters relating to the Miami County site.

CCA has paid approximately $768,000 pursuant to two partial consent
decrees entered into in 1990 and 1991 with respect to clean-up obligations
at the Operating Industries site in Monterey Park, California. It is
anticipated that there will be further remedial measures beyond those
covered by these partial settlements.

In addition to other Federal and State laws regarding hazardous substance
contamination at sites owned or operated by the Company, the New Jersey
Industrial Site Recovery Act ('ISRA') requires that a 'Negative Declaration' or
a 'Cleanup Plan' be filed and approved by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection and Energy ('DEPE') as a precondition to the 'transfer'
of an 'industrial establishment'. The ISRA regulations provide that a transferor
may close a transaction prior to the DEPE's approval of a negative declaration
if the transferor enters into an administrative consent order with the DEPE. The
Company is currently a signatory to administrative consent orders with respect
to two formerly leased or owned industrial establishments and has recently
closed a facility and applied for a negative declaration with respect thereto.
Management believes that any requirements that may be imposed by the DEPE with
respect to these sites will not have a materially adverse effect on the
financial condition or operations of the Company.

The Company's paperboard and newsprint mills are large consumers of energy,
using either natural gas or coal. Approximately 67% of the Company's total
paperboard tonnage is produced by mills which have coal-fired boilers. The cost
of energy is dependent, in part, on environmental regulations concerning sulfur
dioxide and particulate emissions.

Because various pollution control standards are subject to change, it is
not possible at this time to predict the amount of capital expenditures that
will ultimately be required to comply with future standards. For the past three
years, the Company has spent an average of approximately $10 million annually on
capital expenditures for environmental purposes. Further sums may be required in
the future, although, in the opinion of management, such expenditures will not
have a material effect on its financial condition or operations. The amount
budgeted for such expenditures for fiscal 1994 is approximately $10 million.
Since the Company's competitors are subject to comparable pollution control
standards, management is of the opinion that compliance with future pollution
standards will not adversely affect the Company's competitive position.

PROVISIONS OF STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT PERTAINING TO MANAGEMENT

The Stockholders Agreement provides that SIBV and the MSLEF II Group shall
vote their shares of Holdings Common Stock to elect as directors of Holdings (a)
four individuals selected by SIBV (each, an 'SIBV Nominee') one of whom shall be
the Chief Executive Officer and one of whom shall not be affiliated with SIBV,
Holdings, JSC or CCA (an 'SIBV Unaffiliated Director') and (b) four individuals
selected by MSLEF II (each, a 'MSLEF II Nominee'), one of whom shall not be
affiliated with MSLEF II, Holdings, JSC or CCA (a 'MSLEF II Unaffiliated
Director'), if (i) the MSLEF II Group owns collectively more than 10% of the
outstanding Holdings Common Stock or SIBV owns less than 25% of the outstanding
Holdings Common Stock and the MSLEF II Group shall not have received the Initial
Return (as defined below) or (ii) the MSLEF II Group owns 30% or more of the
outstanding Holdings Common Stock or the MSLEF II Group owns a greater number of
voting shares than SIBV and the MSLEF II Group shall have collectively received
the Initial Return; provided, however, that in the event that the MSLEF II Group
owns 10% or more and less than 30% of the outstanding Holdings Common Stock and
has received the Initial Return, then SIBV shall not be required to have one of
its nominees be an SIBV Unaffiliated Director and MSLEF II shall nominate a
total of (a) two MSLEF II Unaffiliated Directors if the MSLEF II Group owns 20%
or more but less than 30% of the outstanding Holdings Common Stock and (b) three
MSLEF II Unaffiliated Directors if the MSLEF II Group owns 10% or more but less
than 20% of the Holdings Common Stock; provided, further, that in the event that
the MSLEF II Group owns 6% or more but less than 10% of the outstanding Holdings

SIBV Nominees, MSLEF II shall nominate one MSLEF II Nominee and Holdings' Board
of Directors shall nominate three persons to

59

<PAGE>
the Board of Directors, two of whom shall be SIBV Unaffiliated Directors and one
of whom shall be the Chief Executive Officer. The Stockholders Agreement defines
'Initial Return' to mean the receipt, as dividends or as a result of sales of
shares of Holdings Common Stock, of $400 million in cash or certain other
property (or a combination thereof) collectively by members of the MSLEF II
Group. Calculations made for purposes of the foregoing shall not give effect to
shares of Holdings Common Stock purchased after the date of the closing of the
Offerings.

Pursuant to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, SIBV and MSLEF II will
each be entitled to designate four nominees to Holdings' Board of Directors upon
the consummation of the Recapitalization Plan (excluding the Subordinated Debt
Refinancing). Such designees include, in the case of SIBV, Michael W. J.
Smurfit, Howard E. Kilroy and James E. Terrill and, in the case of MSLEF II,
Donald P. Brennan, Alan E. Goldberg and David R. Ramsay. The MSLEF II
Unaffiliated Director and the SIBV Unaffiliated Director will be named following
completion of the Offerings. See ' -- Directors'.

Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the Board of Directors of Holdings
shall have all powers and duties and the full discretion to manage and conduct
the business and affairs of Holdings as may be conferred or imposed upon a board
of directors pursuant to Section 141 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Provided that the MSLEF II Group's ownership of Holdings Common Stock shall be
more than 30%, or more than 10% if members of the MSLEF II Group have not
received the Initial Return, approval of certain specified actions shall require
approval of (a) the sum of one and a majority of the entire Board of Directors

Without limiting the foregoing, if the MSLEF II Group owns 6% or more but less
than 10% of the Holdings Common Stock during any period when Holdings' Board of
Directors does not consist of eight members (or such greater number of members
as may be agreed to by SIBV, MSLEF II and Holdings) then all actions of the
Board of Directors shall require approval of at least one director who is a SIBV
Nominee and one director who is a MSLEF II Nominee. The specified corporate
actions that must be approved by a Required Majority include the amendment of
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Holdings or any of its
subsidiaries; the issuance, sale, purchase or redemption of securities of
Holdings or any of its subsidiaries; the establishment of and appointments to
the Audit Committee of Holdings' Board of Directors; certain sales of assets or
investments in, or certain transactions with, JS Group or its affiliates in
excess of a specified amount or any other person in excess of other specified
amounts; certain mergers, consolidations, dissolutions or liquidations of

to be the respective officers of each of JSC and CCA, unless SIBV and MSLEF II
otherwise agree.

CCA received any fees for their services as directors; however, the directors
were reimbursed for their travel expenses in connection with their attendance at
board meetings. Following the completion of the Offerings, each of Holdings, JSC
and CCA intends to reimburse all its directors for their travel expenses in

1994 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

Prior to consummation of the Equity Offerings, JSC intends to adopt the
Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (U.S.) 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
'Incentive Plan'). Pursuant to the Plan, participants will be granted awards,
payable in cash on June 30, 1997 (the 'Payment Date') (or earlier in the event
of death or disability) if and to the extent vested. A participant's award will
vest on the Payment Date if he is still employed by JSC or any of its
subsidiaries at such time; provided that such award shall vest in full if the
participant dies or becomes disabled and shall vest 20% on June 30, 1995, and an
additional 20% on June 30, 1996 if the participant is employed on such date and
is thereafter terminated, prior to June 30, 1997, by the Company without cause.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts shall be paid under the Incentive Plan
unless the Equity Offerings are consummated. The aggregate amount of awards
under the Incentive Plan will not exceed $5 million. The awards expected to be
granted to Messrs. Terrill, Larson and Bradford are $1,000,000, $200,000 and
$75,000, respectively.

1992 STOCK OPTION PLAN

OPTION PLAN

Under Holdings' 1992 Stock Option Plan, the Named Executive Officers and
certain other eligible employees have been granted options to purchase shares of
stock of Holdings. The options become vested over a ten year period and vest in
their entirety upon the death, disability or retirement of the optionee.
Non-vested options are forfeited upon any other termination of employment.
Options may not be exercised unless they are both exercisable and vested. Upon
the earliest to occur of (i) MSLEF II's transfer of all of its Holdings Common
Stock or, if MSLEF II distributes its Holdings Common Stock to its partners
pursuant to its dissolution, the transfer by such partners of at least 50% of
the aggregate Holdings Common Stock received from MSLEF II pursuant to its
dissolution, (ii) the 11th anniversary of the grant date of the options, and
(iii) a public offering of Holdings Common Stock (including the Equity
Offerings), all vested options shall become exercisable and all options which
vest subsequently shall become exercisable upon vesting; provided, however, that
if a public offering occurs prior to the Threshold Date (defined below) all
vested options and all options which vest subsequent to the public offering but
prior to the Threshold Date shall be exercisable in an amount (as of periodic
determination dates) equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of
Holdings Common Stock vested pursuant to the option (whether previously
exercised or not) and (b) the Morgan Percentage (as defined below) as of such
date; provided further that in any event a holder's options shall become
exercisable from time to time in an amount equal to the percentage that the
number of shares sold or distributed to its partners by MSLEF II represents of
its aggregate ownership of shares (with vested options becoming exercisable up
to such number before any non-vested options become so exercisable) less the
number of options, if any, which have become exercisable on January 1, 1995 as
set forth below. The Threshold Date is the earlier of (x) the date the members
of the MSLEF II Group (as defined below) shall have received collectively
$200,000,000 in cash and/or other property as a return of their

62

<PAGE>
investment in Holdings (as a result of sales of shares of Holdings' common
equity) and (y) the date that the members of the MSLEF II Group shall have
transferred an aggregate of at least 30% of Holdings' common equity owned by the
MSLEF II Group as of August 26, 1992. The Morgan Percentage as of any date is
the percentage determined from the quotient of (a) the number of shares of
Holdings' common equity held as of August 26, 1992, that were transferred by the
MSLEF II Group as of the determination date and (b) the number of shares of
Holdings' common equity outstanding as of such date. The Plan Committee, with
the consent of the Board of Directors of Holdings, may accelerate the
exercisability of options at such times and circumstances as it deems
appropriate in its discretion. The option exercise price is not adjustable other
than pursuant to an antidilution provision. Ten percent of stock options granted
prior to 1993 vest and become exercisable on January 1, 1995 so long as the
Equity Offerings have been consummated. The foregoing describes the current
terms of the 1992 Stock Option Plan, as intended to be amended prior to the
consummation of the Equity Offerings.

OPTION GRANTS

No option grants were made during 1993 to any Named Executive Officers.
Effective as of February 15, 1994 options with an exercise price of $20 per
share of Holdings Common Stock were granted to a number of officers and
employees including Messrs. Terrill and Larson who were granted options for
319,000, and 5,000 shares of Holdings Common Stock, respectively (such dollar
amount and numbers have been adjusted to reflect the ten-for-one stock split).
Such options vest over the period ending on December 31, 1999.

OPTION EXERCISES AND YEAR-END VALUE TABLE

The following table summarizes the exercise of options relating to shares
of Holdings Common Stock by the Named Executive Officers during 1993 and the
value of options held by such officers as of the end of 1993. No stock
appreciation rights have been granted to any Named Executive Officers. The table
gives effect to the ten-for-one stock split provided for by the Recapitalization
Plan, but does not give effect to options granted in 1994. In addition, options
to purchase 755,000 shares (as adjusted for the ten-to-one stock split) have
been granted to officers and employees of JS Group and its affiliates (other
than Michael W.J. Smurfit).

PENSION PLANS

SALARIED EMPLOYEES' PENSION PLAN AND SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME PENSION PLANS

The Company and its subsidiaries maintain a non-contributory pension plan
for salaried employees (the 'Pension Plan') and non-contributory supplemental
income pension plans (the 'SIP Plans') for certain key executive officers. The
Pension Plan provides monthly benefits at age 65 equal to 1.5% of a
participant's final average earnings minus 1.2% of such participant's primary
social security benefit, multiplied by the number of years of credited service.
Final average earnings equals the average of the highest five consecutive years
of the participant's last 10 years of service, including overtime and certain
bonuses, but excluding bonus payments under the Management Incentive Plan,
deferred or acquisition bonuses, fringe benefits and certain other compensation.
Employees' pension rights vest after five years of service. Benefits are also
available under the Pension Plan upon early or deferred retirement. The pension
benefits for the Named Executive Officers can be calculated pursuant to the
following table, which shows the total estimated single life annuity payments
that would be payable to the Named Executive Officers participating in the
Pension Plan and one of the SIP Plans after various years of service at selected
compensation levels. A limit of 20 and 22.5 years of service can be credited for
SIP I and SIP II, respectively. Payments under the SIP Plans are an unsecured
liability of the Company.

In order to participate in the SIP Plans, an executive must be selected by
the Board of Directors. SIP Plan I provides annual benefits at normal retirement
age (65) equal to 2.5% of a participant's final average earnings multiplied by
the number of years of credited service (with a limit of 20 years or 50% of
final average earnings), less such participant's regular Pension Plan benefit
and a certain portion of the social security benefit, whereas SIP Plan II uses a
2% multiplier (with a limit of 22.5 years or 45% of final average earnings).
Final average earnings equals the participant's average earnings, including
bonus payments made under the Management Incentive Plan, for the five
consecutive highest-paid calendar years out of the last 10 years of service.
Participants may elect to receive benefits in the form of either a life annuity,
a life annuity with ten years certain or a designated survivor annuity.

Dr. Smurfit and Mr. Malloy participate in SIP Plan I and have 21 and 15
years of credited service, respectively. SIP Plan II became effective January 1,
1993, and Mr. Terrill, Mr. Larson and Mr. Bradford participate in such plan and
have 22, 5 and 11 years of credited service, respectively. Estimated final
average earnings for each of the the Named Executive Officers are as follows:
Mr. Malloy ($1,185,000); Dr. Smurfit ($1,040,000); Mr. Terrill ($532,000); Mr.
Larson ($366,000); and Mr. Bradford ($461,000).

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION, SEVERANCE AND CHANGE OF CONTROL
ARRANGEMENTS

The Company and its subsidiaries maintain a severance pay plan for all
salaried employees who have at least one year of credited service (the
'Severance Plan'). Upon a covered termination, the Severance Plan provides for
the payment of one week's salary for each full year of service, payable in
accordance with payroll practices.

Mr. Malloy has a deferred compensation agreement with JSC pursuant to which
JSC intends to pay to him, upon his retirement, lifetime payments of $70,000
annually in addition to his accrued benefits under SIP Plan I.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION CAPITAL ENHANCEMENT PLAN

The Company's Deferred Compensation Capital Enhancement Plan (the 'DCC')
allows for the deferral of compensation of key full-time salaried employees of
the Company and its subsidiaries. Participants may defer a portion of their
compensation and their employer may defer discretionary bonuses (together the
'Deferred Compensation Amount'). Deferrals occur in 18 month cycles. A
participant becomes vested with respect to amounts deferred during a particular
cycle if he continues to be employed by the Company or its subsidiaries for
seven years from the beginning of the cycle, retires

65

<PAGE>
at age 65 or leaves employment for reasons of death or disability. Upon Normal
Retirement (as defined in the DCC) benefits are distributed under the DCC.
Certain participants will receive preretirement distributions from the DCC,
beginning in the eighth year of each cycle. The amounts distributed upon Normal
Retirement for each cycle are determined with reference to the age of the
participant at the beginning of the cycle and the participant's Deferred
Compensation Amount with respect to the cycle. If a participant is younger than
45 years old at the beginning of a cycle, he will receive upon Normal Retirement
a total of fifteen annual payments, each totalling one and one-half times his
Deferred Compensation Amount. If at the beginning of a cycle a participant is
between the ages of 45 and 55 years old, at Normal Retirement he will receive a
total of fifteen annual payments that, in the aggregate, equal his Deferred
Compensation Amount with respect to the cycle plus appreciation credited
annually at 100% of the Moody's Rate (as defined in the DCC). If at the
beginning of a cycle a participant is at least 55 years old, his Normal
Retirement benefit will be a total of fifteen annual payments that, in the
aggregate, equal his Deferred Compensation Amount with respect to the cycle plus
appreciation credited annually at 150% of the Moody's Rate. If at the beginning
of a cycle a participant is age 65 or older, the number of such annual payments
shall be five. If a participant dies prior to retirement, the value of his death
benefit may be more or less than his Normal Retirement benefits, depending on
his age at the beginning of the cycle. Benefits may be reduced by the employer
if a former participant is engaged in a competing business within two years of
termination from the Company or its subsidiaries. Participants may receive early
distributions in the event that they experience unforeseen financial
emergencies. Benefits otherwise payable to the participant are then actuarially
reduced to reflect such early distributions. The benefits payable under the DCC
are funded by the Company through life insurance policies. There have been no
deferrals under the DCC since 1986. Deferrals made by the Named Executive
Officers during 1985 and 1986 and their ages at the time of such deferrals were:
Mr. Malloy ($30,000 at 57, $50,000 at 58), Dr. Smurfit ($30,000 at 48), Mr.
Terrill ($15,000 at 51, $25,000 at 52), Mr. Bradford ($15,000 at 49, $25,000 at
50) and Mr. Larson ($0). In 1993, the Company made the first preretirement
distribution to certain participants totaling $195,000.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

The Company has not heretofore maintained a formal compensation committee.
Dr. Smurfit, Mr. Malloy and Mr. Kilroy, executive officers of the Company,
participated in deliberations of the Board of Directors on executive
compensation matters during 1993. Following consummation of the Offerings, JSC
and CCA will maintain a Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. See
' -- Committees'.

Dr. Smurfit and Mr. Kilroy are both directors and executive officers of JS
Group, Holdings, JSC and CCA, and Mr. Malloy is a director of JS Group and a
former director and executive officer of Holdings, JSC and CCA.

(a) Gives effect to the Reclassification pursuant to which, immediately prior
to the consummation of the Equity Offerings, Holdings' five classes of
common stock will be converted into one class, on a basis of ten shares of
Holdings Common Stock for each share of stock of each of the old classes.
Following the Reclassification, Holdings' only class of common stock will
be the Holdings Common Stock.

(b) Includes shares of Holdings Common Stock to be purchased by SIBV (or
a corporate affiliate) from Holdings pursuant to the SIBV Investment.

(c) Amounts shown exclude shares of Holdings Common Stock owned by MSLEF II, of
which each of First Plaza Group Trust and State Street Bank & Trust Co. is
a limited partner. If MSLEF II were to distribute its shares of Holdings
Common Stock to its partners each of First Plaza Group Trust and State
Street Bank & Trust Co. would receive a number of shares based on its pro
rata ownership of MSLEF II. State Street Bank & Trust Co. currently owns
3,000,000 shares of Class C Stock of Holdings (after giving effect to the
Reclassification), which following the consummation of the Offerings will
be % of the outstanding Holdings Common Stock.

(d) Amounts shown exclude shares of Holdings Common Stock that have been
reserved for sale to certain directors, officers and other employees of the
Company and its affiliates; the actual amounts of such shares to be
purchased by the individuals listed in the foregoing table and by all
directors and executive officers as a group are undetermined. Messrs.
Malloy, Smurfit, Terrill, Larson, Bradford and Kilroy and all directors and
executive officers as a group own options to purchase 724,000, 1,026,000,
500,000, 50,000, 121,000, 423,000 and 3,726,000 shares of Holdings Common
Stock, respectively. None of such options are currently or will become
exercisable within 60 days following consummation of the Offerings.
However, a portion of options hereafter vested will become exercisable,
based upon the number of shares of Holdings Common Stock transferred by the
MSLEF II Group (as defined in the Option Plan) following the Equity
Offerings. See 'Management -- Executive Compensation -- 1992 Stock Option
Plan'. Prior to the Recapitalization, the holder of an option granted under
the 1992 Stock Option Plan has the right to acquire Holdings' Class E
Stock. Subsequent to the Recapitalization, the holder of an option has the
right to acquire Holdings Common Stock.

(e) Amounts exclude shares of Holdings Common Stock owned by SIBV as to which
such persons disclaim beneficial ownership.

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

Set forth below is a summary of certain agreements and arrangements entered
into by the Company and related parties in connection with the 1989 Transaction
and the 1992 Transaction (as defined below), as well as other transactions
between the Company and related parties which have taken place during the
Company's most recently completed three fiscal years.

GENERAL

As a result of certain transactions which occurred in December 1989 (the
'1989 Transaction'), JSC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings and CCA
became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of JSC. As part of the 1989
Transaction, Holdings issued (i) 1,510,000 shares of Holdings' Class A

67

<PAGE>
common stock ('Class A Stock') and 500,000 shares of Holdings' Class D common
stock ('Class D Stock') to SIBV for $150 million and $50 million, respectively,
(ii) 1,510,000 shares of Holdings' Class B common stock ('Class B Stock') to
MSLEF II for $150 million, (iii) 100,000 shares of Holdings' Class C common
stock ('Class C Stock') to MSLEF II, Inc. (the general partner of MSLEF II) and
400,000 shares of Class C Stock to the Direct Investors (as defined below) for
$10 million and $40 million, respectively (the Direct Investors also purchased
Junior Accrual Debentures and Subordinated Debentures in aggregate principal
amounts of $129.2 million and $30.8 million, respectively), and (iv) its
preferred stock ('Old Preferred Stock') to SIBV for $100 million. SIBV
subsequently transferred all of such common and preferred stock to Smurfit
Packaging.

In addition to the issuances of capital stock by Holdings described above,
the financing for the 1989 Transaction was provided by (i) the issuance by CCA
of the Secured Notes and the Subordinated Debt, and (ii) the incurrence of term
debt and revolving credit indebtedness pursuant to the 1989 Credit Agreement.

As a result of certain transactions among Holdings and CCA and certain of
their securityholders which occurred in August 1992 (the '1992 Transaction'),
(i) MSLEF II acquired an additional 330,000 and 1,212,788 shares of Class B
Stock and Class C Stock, respectively, and certain holders of Class C Stock
acquired 457,212 additional shares of Class C Stock, for an aggregate of $200
million, (ii) Smurfit Holdings, B.V., a subsidiary of SIBV, acquired 330,000
shares of Class A Stock for $33 million, (iii) Smurfit Packaging agreed that its
Old Preferred Stock (including shares issued since the 1989 Transaction as a
dividend) would convert into 1,670,000 shares of Class D Stock on December 31,
1993, (iv) proceeds from the issuances of shares described in clauses (i) and
(ii) above were used to acquire, at a purchase price of $1,100 per $1,000
accreted value, an aggregate of $129.2 million principal amount ($193.5 million
accreted value) of Junior Accrual Debentures from the Direct Investors, (v) CCA
borrowed approximately $400 million under the 1992 Credit Agreement, and used
the proceeds to prepay approximately $400 million of scheduled installments
relating to term loan indebtedness under the 1989 Credit Agreement, (vi) various
provisions of the 1989 Credit Agreement and the Secured Note Purchase Agreement
were amended and restated, and (vii) MSLEF II and SIBV amended a number of the
provisions contained in the Organization Agreement, agreed to the terms of a
Stockholders Agreement (which will replace the Organization Agreement upon the
closing of the Equity Offerings) and entered into the Registration Rights
Agreement.

Currently Smurfit Packaging and Smurfit Holdings, through their ownership
of all of the outstanding Class A Stock, and MSLEF II, through its ownership of
all of the outstanding Class B Stock, each own 50% of the voting common stock of
Holdings. MSLEF II, MSLEF II, Inc., Equity Investors, First Plaza Group Trust,
as trustee for certain pension plans ('First Plaza'), and Leeway & Co., as
nominee for State Street Bank and Trust Co., as trustee for a master pension
trust ('Leeway,' and together with First Plaza, the 'Direct Investors')
(collectively, the 'MSLEF II Group'), certain other investors and Smurfit
Packaging own all of the non-voting stock of Holdings. On December 31, 1993, all
of the Old Preferred Stock owned by Smurfit Packaging was converted into
1,670,000 shares of Class D Stock. Since such conversion of Old Preferred Stock,
Smurfit Packaging owns and the MSLEF II Group and certain other investors own,
through their ownership of Class D Stock and Class C Stock, respectively, 50% of
the non-voting common stock of Holdings.

The Holdings' capital stock currently consists of Class A Stock, Class B
Stock, Class C Stock, Class D Stock and Class E common stock (the 'Class E
Stock' and, together with the Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Stock, the
'Old Common Stock'). The classes of stock comprising the Old Common Stock are
identical in all respects except with respect to certain voting rights, and
certain exchange provisions that do not affect the percentage of Holdings owned
by SIBV and MSLEF II. The Holdings' Class E Stock is non-voting stock reserved
for issuance pursuant to the 1992 Stock Option Plan. In the Reclassification,
the Old Common Stock, which consists of five classes of stock, will be converted
into one class, on a basis of ten shares of Common Stock for each share of the
Old Common Stock. Following the Reclassification, Holdings' only class of common
stock will be Holdings Common Stock. Immediately prior to the consummation of
the Equity Offerings, shares of Holdings Common Stock will be
outstanding and such stock will be owned by Holdings' stockholders in proportion
to their ownership of the Old Common Stock as described in the two preceding
paragraphs.

68

<PAGE>
Substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Equity Offerings, SIBV
(or a corporate affiliate) will purchase shares of Holdings Common
Stock from Holdings pursuant to the SIBV Investment. Accordingly, following the
consummation of the Equity Offerings and the SIBV Investment, MSLEF II
Associated Entities and SIBV through its subsidiaries will beneficially own %
and %, respectively, of the shares of Holdings Common Stock then outstanding.
See 'Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners'.

The relationships among JSC, CCA, Holdings and its stockholders are set
forth in a number of agreements described below. The summary descriptions herein
of the terms of such agreements do not purport to be complete and are subject
to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, all of the provisions
of such agreements, which have been filed as exhibits to the Registration
Statement of which this Prospectus forms a part. Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined below or elsewhere in this Prospectus have the meanings given to them in
such agreements. Any reference to either SIBV or MSLEF II in the following
descriptions of the Organization Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement or in
references to the terms of those agreements set forth in this Prospectus shall
be deemed to include their permitted transferees, unless the context indicates
otherwise.

THE ORGANIZATION AGREEMENT

Since the 1989 Transaction, the Company has been operated pursuant to the
terms of the Organization Agreement, which has been amended on various
occasions. The Organization Agreement, among other things, provides generally
for the election of directors, the selection of officers and the day-to-day
management of the Company. The Organization Agreement provides that one-half of
the directors of each of Holdings, CCA and JSC be elected by the holders of the
Class A Stock (Smurfit Holdings and Smurfit Packaging) and one-half by the
holders of the Class B Stock (MSLEF II) and that officers of such companies be
designated by the designees of Smurfit Holdings and Smurfit Packaging on the
respective boards, except that the Chief Financial Officer of the Company be
designated by the holders of the Class B Stock (MSLEF II). The Organization
Agreement also contains certain tag along rights, rights of first refusal and
call and put provisions and provisions relating to a sale of Holdings as an
entirety, as well as provisions relating to transactions between Holdings, the
Company and its affiliates, on the one hand, and SIBV or MSLEF II, as the case
may be, and their respective affiliates, on the other. These latter provisions
are similar to those contained in the Stockholders Agreement described below.

Pursuant to the terms of the Organization Agreement and in connection with
the Recapitalization Plan, the Organization Agreement will terminate upon the
closing of the Equity Offerings and, at or prior to such closing, the
Stockholders Agreement shall be entered into by SIBV, MSLEF II and Holdings.

The Organization Agreement also contains provisions whereby each of SIBV,
MSLEF II, MSLEF II, Inc., Holdings, JSC, CCA and the holders of Class C Stock
indemnify each other and related parties with respect to certain matters arising
under the Organization Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby,
including losses resulting from a breach of the Organization Agreement. In
addition, Holdings, JSC and CCA have also agreed to indemnify SIBV, MSLEF II,
MSLEF II, Inc. and the holders of Class C Stock and related parties against
losses arising out of (i) the conduct and operation of the business of Holdings,
JSC or CCA, (ii) any action or failure to act by Holdings, JSC or CCA, (iii) the
1989 Transaction and the 1992 Transaction or (iv) the financing for the 1989
Transaction. Further, SIBV has agreed to indemnify Holdings, JSC, CCA and each
of their subsidiaries against all liability for taxes, charges, fees, levies or
other assessments imposed on such entities as a result of their not having
withheld tax upon the issuance or payment of a specified note to SIBV and the
transfer of certain assets to SIBV in connection with the 1989 Transaction. The
foregoing indemnification provisions survive a termination of the Organization
Agreement, including a termination in connection with the closing of the Equity
Offerings.

69

<PAGE>
STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT

The Stockholders Agreement will be entered into at or prior to the
consummation of the Offerings by SIBV, MSLEF II and Holdings. Holdings, SIBV and
MSLEF II are discussing an amendment to the Stockholders Agreement and the
Registration Rights Agreement which would modify restrictions contained therein
on the ability of MSLEF II and its affiliates to sell or otherwise dispose of
any or all of their shares of Holdings Common Stock.

DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT

For a description of certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement which
relate to the management of the Company (including the election of directors of
the Company), see 'Management -- Provision of Stockholders Agreement Pertaining
to Management'.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; OTHER BUSINESSES

The Stockholders Agreement specifically permits SIBV and MSLEF II (and
their affiliates) to engage in transactions with Holdings, JSC and CCA in
addition to certain specific transactions contemplated by the Stockholders
Agreement, provided such transactions (except for (i) transactions between any
of Holdings, JSC and CCA, (ii) the transactions contemplated by the Stockholders
Agreement, (iii) the transactions contemplated by the Operating Agreement, dated
as of April 30, 1992, between CCA and Smurfit Paperboard, Inc. ('SPI'), or in
the Rights Agreement, dated as of April 30, 1992, between CCA, SPI and Bankers
Trust Company, (iv) the transactions contemplated by the Registration Rights
Agreement, (v) the provision of services pursuant to the Financial Advisory
Services Agreement, dated as of September 12, 1989, by and among MS&Co., SIBV
and Holdings, and (vi) the provisions of certain other specified agreements) are
fully and fairly disclosed, have fair and equitable terms, are reasonably
necessary and are treated as a commercial arms-length transaction with an
unrelated third party.

Neither SIBV nor MSLEF II (or their affiliates) is prohibited from owning,
operating or investing in any business, regardless of whether such business is
competitive with Holdings, JSC or CCA, nor is either SIBV or MSLEF II required
to disclose its intention to make any such investment to the other or to advise
Holdings, JSC or CCA of the opportunity presented by any such prospective
investment.

TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP

In general, transfers of Holdings Common Stock to entities affiliated with
SIBV or the members of the MSLEF II Group are not restricted. The Stockholders
Agreement provides members of the MSLEF II Group the right to 'tag along' pro
rata upon the transfer by SIBV of any Holdings Common Stock, other than
transfers to affiliates and sales pursuant to a public offering registered under
the Securities Act or pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

No member of the MSLEF II Group may transfer, within any thirty-six month
period, in the aggregate five percent or more of the outstanding Holdings Common
Stock to any non-affiliated person or group without SIBV's prior written
consent. Transfers of two percent or more in the aggregate of the outstanding
Holdings Common Stock are subject to the right of first refusal on the part of
SIBV; transfers of less than two percent in the aggregate are not restricted by
the Stockholders Agreement. In the event that there is a public trading market
for the Holdings Common Stock, no member of the MSLEF II Group may effect a sale
of Holdings Common Stock pursuant to rights granted in the Registration Rights
Agreement without first offering the shares to be sold to SIBV for purchase.
SIBV and its affiliates have the right, exercisable on or after August 26, 2002,
to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Holdings Common Stock then owned
by the MSLEF II Group at a price equal to the Fair Market Value (as defined in
the Stockholders Agreement).

In general, if JS Group either does not, directly or indirectly, own a
majority of the voting stock of SIBV, or directly or indirectly, have the right
to appoint a majority of the directors and officers of SIBV, then all of the
obligations of MSLEF II and the members of the MSLEF II Group under the
Stockholders Agreement and all the rights of SIBV under the Stockholders
Agreement shall cease.

70

<PAGE>
TERMINATION

The Stockholders Agreement shall terminate either upon mutual agreement of
SIBV and MSLEF II, or at the option of SIBV or the MSLEF II Group, as the case
may be, upon either the MSLEF II Group or SIBV, respectively, ceasing to own six
percent or more of the outstanding Holdings Common Stock.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of August 26, 1992,
between MSLEF II, SIBV and Holdings, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto dated
as of April 15, 1993 (the 'Registration Rights Agreement'), entered into in
connection with the 1992 Transaction, MSLEF II and the other members of the
MSLEF II Group have the right, upon a notice (a 'Registration Notice') from
MSLEF II to both Holdings and SIBV, to cause Holdings to use its best efforts to
register the shares of Holdings Common Stock owned by such holders. MSLEF II may
not deliver a Registration Notice until the earlier of (a) consummation of the
refinancing of certain long-term debt of CCA and (b) December 31, 1997. Upon the
consummation of the Recapitalization Plan clause (a) of the preceding sentence
will be satisfied and MSLEF II will be entitled to exercise its demand
registration rights as described herein. The MSLEF II Group is entitled to four
such demand registrations pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, two of
which MSLEF II will have the right to effect prior to Holdings effecting a
common stock registration for its own account. MSLEF II may not, however,
deliver a Registration Notice (i) until the conclusion of any pending Holdings
Registration Process (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), (ii)
within 30 days of the conclusion of a MSLEF II Registration Process (as defined
in the Registration Rights Agreement), or (iii) in certain other limited
situations. Holdings is generally prohibited from 'piggybacking' and selling
stock for its own account on a registration effected pursuant to a Registration
Notice except after the second completed registration for MSLEF II, in which
event MSLEF II may require that any such securities which are 'piggybacked' be
offered and sold on the same terms as the securities offered by MSLEF II. The
Registration Rights Agreement also sets forth certain waiting periods following
sales by MSLEF II pursuant to a registration statement. The MSLEF II Group is
entitled, subject to certain limitations, to register its Holdings Common Stock
in connection with a registration statement prepared by Holdings to register
Holdings Common Stock or any equity securities exercisable for, convertible
into, or exchangeable for Holdings Common Stock. Holdings, SIBV and MSLEF II are
discussing an amendment to the Registration Rights Agreement which would modify
restrictions contained therein on the ability of MSLEF II to exercise its demand
registration rights.

Holdings will pay all registration expenses (other than underwriting
discounts and commissions) in connection with MSLEF II's first two completed
demand registrations and all registrations made in connection with a Holdings
registration. The Registration Rights Agreement also contains customary terms
and provisions with respect to, among other things, registration procedures and
certain rights to indemnification and contribution granted by parties thereunder
in connection with the registration of Holdings Common Stock subject to such
agreement.

FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES AGREEMENT

Under a financial advisory services agreement (the 'Financial Advisory
Services Agreement'), MS&Co. agreed to act as Holdings' and the Company's
financial advisor and provided certain services and earned certain fees in
connection with its roles in the 1989 Transaction, with an expectation that for
the term of the Organization Agreement, the Company would retain MS&Co. to
render it investment banking services at market rates to be negotiated.

OTHER TRANSACTIONS

In connection with the 1986 acquisition of CCA, CCA and SIBV entered into
an agreement pursuant to which CCA granted SIBV an option to purchase CCA's
non-U.S. operations (the 'CCA Option'). In 1987, SIBV exercised the CCA Option
with respect to CCA's European, Venezuelan and Puerto Rican subsidiaries for an
aggregate cash price of $64.3 million, which was approximately equal to

71

<PAGE>
CCA's investment as of the date of exercise. In June 1989, SIBV exercised the
remainder of the CCA Option and purchased CCA's beneficial interests in its
Mexican and Colombian subsidiaries for an aggregate cash price of approximately
$150.7 million, which was approximately equal to CCA's investment as of the date
of exercise.

In the 1989 Transaction, (i) Holdings acquired the entire equity interest
in JSC, (ii) JSC (through its ownership of JSC Enterprises) acquired the entire
equity interest in CCA, (iii) The Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership ('MSLEF I'), and certain other private investors,
including MS&Co. and certain limited partners of MSLEF I investing in their
individual capacity (collectively, the 'MSLEF I Group') received $500 million in
respect of their shares of CCA common stock and (iv) SIBV received $41.75 per
share, or an aggregate of approximately $1.25 billion, in respect of its shares
of JSC stock, and the public stockholders received $43 per share of JSC stock.
Certain assets of JSC and CCA were also transferred to SIBV or one of its
affiliates (the 'Designated Assets'). Pursuant to a tender offer and consent
solicitation for certain debentures of CCA which were outstanding prior to the
consummation of the 1989 Transaction, MS&Co. received an aggregate of $3.7
million in consideration. MS&Co. also received $29.5 million for serving in its
capacity as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the 1989
Transaction. In addition, MS&Co. as underwriter of the Subordinated Debt
received aggregate net discounts and commissions of $34.6 million. In connection
with the sale of the Secured Notes to Morgan Stanley International, MS&Co.
received a placement fee of $7.5 million from CCA; in addition, CCA agreed to
indemnify MS&Co. against certain liabilities in connection therewith, including
liabilities under the Securities Act.

In connection with the issuance of the 1993 Notes, the Company entered into
an agreement with SIBV whereby SIBV committed to purchase up to $200 million
aggregate principal amount of 11 1/2% Junior Subordinated Notes maturing 2005 to
be issued by the Company. From time to time until December 31, 1994, the
Company, at its option, may issue the Junior Subordinated Notes, the proceeds of
which must be used to repurchase or otherwise retire Subordinated Debt. The
Company is obligated to pay SIBV for letter of credit fees incurred by SIBV in
connection with this commitment in addition to an annual commitment fee of
1.375% on the undrawn principal amount. The amount payable for such commitment
for 1993 was $2.9 million. The above commitments will be terminated upon the
consummation of the Offerings.

Net sales by JSC to JS Group, its subsidiaries and affiliates were $18.4
million, $22.8 million and $21.0 million for the years ended December 31, 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively. Net sales by JS Group, its subsidiaries and
affiliates to JSC were $49.3 million, $60.1 million and $11.8 million for the
years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Product sales to and
purchases from JS Group, its subsidiaries and affiliates were consummated on
terms generally similar to those prevailing with unrelated parties.

JSC provides certain subsidiaries and affiliates of JS Group with general
management and elective management services under separate management services
agreements. The services provided include, but are not limited to, management
information services, accounting, tax and internal auditing services, financial
management and treasury services, manufacturing and engineering services,
research and development services, employee benefit plan and management
services, purchasing services, transportation services and marketing services.
In consideration of general management services, JSC is paid a fee up to 2% of
the subsidiaries' or affiliates' gross sales, which fee amounted to $2.3
million, $2.4 million and $2.5 million for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. In
consideration for elective services, JSC received approximately $3.5 million,
$3.2 million and $2.9 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, for its cost
of providing such services. In addition, JSC paid JS Group and its affiliates
$0.4 million in 1993, $0.3 million in 1992 and $0.7 million in 1991 for
management services and certain other services.

In October 1991, an affiliate of JS Group completed a rebuild of the No. 2
paperboard machine owned by it, located in CCA's Fernandina Beach, Florida
paperboard mill (the 'Fernandina Mill'). Pursuant to the Fernandina Operating
Agreement, CCA operates and manages the machine, which is owned by a subsidiary
of SIBV. As compensation to CCA for its services, the affiliate of JS Group
agreed to reimburse CCA for production and manufacturing costs directly
attributable to the No. 2 paperboard machine and to pay CCA a portion of the
indirect manufacturing, selling and administrative costs incurred by CCA for the
entire Fernandina Mill. The compensation is determined by applying

72

<PAGE>
various formulas and agreed upon amounts to the subject costs. The amounts
reimbursed to CCA totaled $62.2 million, $54.7 million and $10.9 million in
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

CCA, JS Group and MSLEF II have had discussions from time to time regarding
the purchase of the No. 2 paperboard machine in the Fernandina Mill by the
Company from JS Group in exchange for cash or Holdings Common Stock. No
agreement has been reached as to any such transaction. The Company expects,
however, that it may in the future reach an agreement with regard to such
acquisition from JS Group but cannot predict when and on what terms such
acquisition would be consummated. Such acquisition will occur only if it is
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and is determined by the Board
of Directors to be on terms no less favorable than a sale made to a third party
in an arm's length transaction.

During 1990, certain assets of CCA comprising the business unit performing
management services for the foreign subsidiaries previously owned by CCA were
sold to a subsidiary of JS Group at a price equal to their net book value of
approximately $5.2 million. Net sales and income from operations related to
these assets were not material. Payment for the assets was received in February
1991.

On February 21, 1986, JSC purchased from Times Mirror 80% of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of SNC for approximately $132 million, including a
promissory note to National Westminster Bank plc in the amount of $42 million
(the 'Subordinated Note'). The Subordinated Note was guaranteed by JS Group. In
the 1992 Transaction, the Company prepaid $19.1 million aggregate principal
amount on the Subordinated Note. The remaining amount of $22.9 million was due
and paid on February 22, 1993.

DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS

The following is a brief discussion of the basic terms of and the
instruments governing certain indebtedness of the Company. The following
discussion does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to, the instruments governing the respective
indebtedness, which instruments are filed as exhibits to the Registration
Statement of which this Prospectus is a part.

TERMS OF NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT

GENERAL

Pursuant to a commitment letter dated February 10, 1994 (the 'Commitment
Letter') among Chemical Bank ('Chemical'), Chemical Securities Inc. ('CSI'),
Bankers Trust Company ('Bankers Trust'), BT Securities Corporation ('BTSC'), JSC
and CCA, Chemical has committed to provide $250 million of the New Bank
Facilities (as defined below), Bankers Trust has committed to provide $250
million of the New Bank Facilities and CSI and BTSC have agreed to use their
best efforts to assemble a syndicate of financial institutions (the 'Lenders')
to provide the balance of the remaining commitments for the New Bank Facilities
in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion, all upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, including the
execution of definitive financing agreements.

Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, the New Bank Facilities are expected to
consist of (i) the New Term Loans, consisting of two senior secured term loan
facilities to be provided to CCA in an aggregate principal amount of $1.05
billion, to be allocated between the Delayed Term Loan in an aggregate principal
amount of $850 million and the Initial Term Loan in an aggregate principal
amount of $200 million and (ii) the New Revolving Credit Facility consisting of
a seven year senior secured revolving credit facility available to JSC and CCA
in an aggregate principal amount of $450 million, of which up to $150 million
will be available as a letter of credit facility (the 'Letter of Credit
Facility').

The Commitment Letter provides that the commitments of Chemical and Bankers
Trust will terminate unless definitive financing agreements with respect thereto
shall have been executed and delivered on or prior to June 30, 1994.

In connection with the New Bank Facilities, Chemical will act as the
administrative agent (in such capacity, the 'Agent'), Chemical and Bankers Trust
will act as senior managing agents and CSI and

73

<PAGE>
BTSC will act as the arrangers for the New Bank Facilities. The Commitment
Letter also contemplates that certain managing agents will be appointed for the
New Bank Facilities.

JSC and CCA have agreed, jointly and severally, to pay certain fees to the
Agent for its own account and for the account of the other Lenders in connection
with the New Bank Facilities, payable as follows: (i) a commitment fee of 1/2 of
1% per annum on the undrawn amount of the Initial Term Loan and the New
Revolving Credit Facility, accruing, with respect to each Lender, on the date of
acceptance of such Lender's commitment and (ii) with respect to each Lender
which has a commitment under the Delayed Term Loan, (A) 1/2 of 1% per annum on
the amount of such commitment accruing for the period from and including the
date of acceptance of such Lender's commitment to but excluding the date of the
initial funding of the New Bank facilities (the 'Closing Date') or the earlier
termination of such Lender's commitment and (B) 3/4 of 1% per annum on the
undrawn amount of such Lender's commitment, accruing from and including the
Closing Date to the date of the funding of the Delayed Term Loan. All such
commitment fees will be payable on the Closing Date and, thereafter, in arrears
at the end of each quarter and upon termination of any commitment. The fees
payable in respect of letters of credit provided under the New Revolving Credit
Facility are in an amount equal to the greater of (a) the margin in excess of
the Adjusted LIBOR Rate applicable to the New Revolving Credit Facility at such
time minus 1/2 of 1% and (b) 1%. In addition, a separate fronting fee shall be
payable by JSC and CCA to the bank issuing the letters of credit for its own
account in an amount to be agreed. All letter of credit fees shall be payable on
the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit under the New
Revolving Credit Facility, and shall be payable in arrears at the end of each
quarter and upon the termination of the New Revolving Credit Facility. CSI, BTSC
and the Lenders shall receive such other fees as have been separately agreed
upon with CSI, BTSC, Chemical and Bankers Trust.

Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, JSC and CCA agreed, regardless of
whether the financing agreements relating to the New Bank Facilities are
executed or the commitments to provide the New Bank Facilities are terminated,
to reimburse Chemical, Bankers Trust, CSI and BTSC for, among other things, all
of their respective out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred or sustained by
such entities in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Commitment
Letter and to indemnify Chemical, Bankers Trust, CSI and BTSC, and each
director, officer, employee and affiliate thereof against certain claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses incurred or asserted in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter.

THE NEW BANK FACILITIES

The New Bank Facilities will be provided pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the New Credit Agreement.

Borrowings under the Initial Term Loan will be used, together with the
proceeds of the Equity Offerings, the Debt Offerings and the SIBV Investment, to
consummate the Bank Debt Refinancing. Borrowings under the Delayed Term Loan
must be made on or before December 15, 1994 and will be used solely to redeem or
repurchase the Subordinated Debt and pay accrued interest and the applicable
redemption premiums thereon, to repay amounts drawn under the New Revolving
Credit Facility prior to December 15, 1994 for the purpose of repurchasing
Subordinated Debt, and to pay the related fees and expenses in connection with
such repurchase or redemption. Borrowings under the New Revolving Credit
Facility are to be used for the sole purpose of providing working capital for
JSC, CCA and their subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes
including to fund open market or privately negotiated purchases of Subordinated
Debt prior to December 15, 1994. Amounts borrowed and outstanding under the New
Revolving Credit Facility to finance purchases of Subordinated Debt which
aggregate at least $20 million will be repaid with the proceeds of borrowings
from time to time under the Delayed Term Loan.

The obligations under the New Credit Agreement will be unconditionally
guaranteed by Holdings, JSC, CCA, SNC (but only to the extent permitted under
the Shareholders Agreement, dated as of February 21, 1986, between JSC and Times
Mirror) and certain other existing and subsequently acquired or organized
material subsidiaries of Holdings, JSC and CCA (each such entity providing such
a guaranty, a 'Guarantor'). The obligations of JSC and CCA under the New Credit
Agreement (including all guarantee obligations of JSC and CCA in respect
thereof) will be secured by a security

74

<PAGE>
interest in substantially all of the assets of JSC, CCA and their material
subsidiaries, with the exception of trade receivables of JSC, CCA and their
material subsidiaries sold to JSFC, and by a pledge of all the capital stock of
JSC, CCA and each material subsidiary of Holdings, JSC and CCA.

The Delayed Term Loan and the New Revolving Credit Facility will each
mature on the date which is seven years after the Closing Date. The Initial Term
Loan will mature on the date which is eight years after the Closing Date. The
outstanding principal amount of the New Term Loans is repayable as follows, such
repayments to be made at the end of each six month period after the Closing Date
as follows:

</TABLE>

The New Term Loans and the New Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid at
any time, in whole or in part, at the option of the borrowers. Voluntary
reductions of the unutilized portion of the New Revolving Credit Facility are
permitted at any time. Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, required prepayments
on the New Bank Facilities are to be made in an amount equal to (i) 75% of
Excess Cash Flow (to be defined as the parties shall mutually agree), reducing
to 50% of Excess Cash Flow upon the satisfaction of certain performance tests to
be agreed, (ii) 100% of the net proceeds of the issuance or incurrence of
certain indebtedness (not including the Debt Offerings), (iii) 100% of the net
proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales, (iv) 100% of the net
proceeds of certain condemnation or insurance proceeds, (v) in the event the
gross proceeds from the Equity Offerings and any other equity infusion in
Holdings is less than $500 million (the amount by which $500 million exceeds
such gross proceeds, the 'Differential'), the lesser of (A) 100% of the net
proceeds to Holdings of the sale of Holdings Common Stock in connection with the
exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option, if any, in connection with
the Equity Offerings and (B) the amount of the Differential, and (vi) 25% of the
net proceeds of the issuance of any other equity securities (other than the
Equity Offerings and the exercise of management stock options). Required
prepayments will be allocated pro rata between the Delayed Term Loan and the
Initial Term Loan, and will be applied pro rata against the remaining scheduled
amortization payments under each of the New Term Loans (and, if the Delayed Term
Loan has not then been drawn, the amount allocable thereto will permanently
reduce the commitments thereunder) or, if the New Term Loans have been fully
repaid, to permanently reduce the then existing commitments under the New
Revolving Credit Facility.

Interest on indebtedness outstanding under the Delayed Term Loan and the
New Revolving Credit Facility, from and including the Closing Date to but
excluding the first anniversary of the Closing Date, will be payable at a rate
per annum, selected at the option of the borrower, equal to the ABR Rate (as
defined below) plus 1.5% per annum or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus 2.5% per
annum. From and including the first anniversary of the Closing Date and
thereafter, the margin in excess of the ABR Rate

75

<PAGE>
or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate applicable to such New Bank Facilities will be
determined by reference to certain financial tests. Interest on indebtedness
outstanding under the Initial Term Loan will be payable at a rate per annum,
selected at the option of CCA, equal to the ABR Rate plus 2% per annum or the
Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus 3% per annum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the
first 90 days following the Closing Date, all such borrowings may only be made
with reference to the ABR Rate or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for one month
borrowings. All overdue installments of principal and, to the extent permitted
by law, interest on borrowings accruing interest based on the ABR Rate or the
Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2% in
excess of the interest rate then borne by such borrowings. The borrowers shall
have the option of selecting the type of borrowing and the length of the
interest period applicable thereto.

'ABR Rate' shall mean the higher of (a) the rate at which Chemical
announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (b) 1/2 of 1% in excess
of the Federal Funds Rate and (c) 1% in excess of the base certificate of
deposit rate.

'Adjusted LIBOR Rate' shall mean the London Interbank Offered Rate,
adjusted for statutory reserves at all times.

Interest based on the ABR Rate and the Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall be
determined based on the number of days elapsed over a 360 day year. Interest
based on the (i) ABR Rate shall be payable quarterly and (ii) Adjusted LIBOR
Rate shall be payable at the end of the applicable interest period but in any
event not less often than quarterly.

The New Credit Agreement will contain certain representations and
warranties, certain negative, affirmative and financial covenants, certain
conditions and certain events of default which are customarily required for
similar financings, in addition to other representations, warranties, covenants,
conditions and events of default appropriate to the specific transactions
contemplated thereby. Such covenants will include restrictions and limitations
of dividends, redemptions and repurchases of capital stock, the incurrence of
debt, liens, leases, sale-leaseback transactions, capital expenditures, the
issuance of stock, transactions with affiliates, the making of loans,
investments and certain payments, and on mergers, acquisitions and asset sales,
in each case subject to exceptions to be agreed upon. Furthermore, the Company
will be required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants, such
as minimum levels of consolidated earnings before depreciation, interest, taxes
and amortization, and minimum interest coverage ratios.

Events of default under the New Credit Agreement will include, among other
things, (i) failure to pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts when due;
(ii) violation of covenants; (iii) failure of any representation or warranty
made by the Company to the Lenders to be true in all material aspects; (iv)
cross default and cross acceleration with certain other indebtedness; (v)
'change of control' (the definition of which is to be mutually agreed upon);
(vi) certain events of bankruptcy; (vii) certain material judgments; (viii)
certain ERISA events; and (ix) the invalidity of the guarantees of the
indebtedness under the New Credit Agreement or of the security interests granted
to the Lenders, in certain cases with appropriate grace periods to be agreed
upon.

The conditions to the borrowing of the Delayed Term Loan are set forth
above. See 'Recapitalization Plan -- Subordinated Debt Refinancing'.

The foregoing summary of the Commitment Letter is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the text of such letter, a copy of which has been filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement
of which this Prospectus forms a part.

SECURITIZATION

In 1991, JSC and CCA entered into the Securitization in order to reduce its
borrowings under the 1989 Credit Agreement. The Securitization involved the sale
of Receivables to JSFC, a special purpose subsidiary of JSC. Under the
Securitization, JSFC currently has borrowings of $182.3 million outstanding from
EFC, a third-party owned corporation not affiliated with JSC, and has pledged
its interest in such Receivables to EFC. EFC issued CP Notes and Term Notes. EFC
also entered into a liquidity facility with the Liquidity Banks and a
subordinated loan agreement with the Subordinated Lender to provide additional
sources of funding. EFC pledged its interest in the Receivables assigned to

76

<PAGE>
it by JSFC to secure EFC's obligations to the Liquidity Banks, the Subordinated
Lender, and the holders of the CP Notes and the Term Notes. Neither the Company
nor JSFC is a guarantor of CP Notes, the Term Notes or borrowings under the
liquidity facility. See Note 5 to the Company's consolidated financial
statements and 'Recapitalization Plan -- Consents and
Waivers -- Securitization'.

TERMS OF 1993 NOTES

In April 1993, CCA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1993
Notes. The 1993 Notes are unsecured senior obligations of CCA and will mature
April 1, 2003. The 1993 Notes bear interest at 9.75% per annum. Interest is
payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1, of each year. The 1993 Notes are
not redeemable prior to maturity.

The 1993 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of CCA, which rank pari
passu with the other senior indebtedness of CCA, including, without limitation,
CCA's obligations under the New Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes, and are
senior in right to payment to the Subordinated Debt. CCA's obligations under the
New Credit Agreement, but not the 1993 Notes, will be secured by liens on
substantially all the assets of CCA and its subsidiaries with the exception of
cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The secured indebtedness will
have priority over the 1993 Notes with respect to the assets securing such
indebtedness.

The 1993 Note Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other
things, limit the ability of JSC and its subsidiaries (including CCA) to incur
indebtedness, pay dividends, engage in transactions with stockholders and
affiliates, issue capital stock, create liens, sell assets, enter into
sale-leaseback transactions, engage in mergers and consolidations and make
investments in unrestricted subsidiaries. The limitations imposed by the
covenants on JSC and its subsidiaries (including CCA) are subject to certain
exceptions.

Upon a Change of Control (as defined below), CCA is required to make an
offer to purchase the 1993 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest. Certain transactions with
affiliates of the Company may not constitute a Change of Control. 'Change of
Control' is defined to mean such time as (i)(a) a person or group, other than
MSLEF II, Morgan Stanley Group, SIBV, JS Group and any affiliate thereof,
(collectively, the 'Original Stockholders'), becomes the beneficial owner of
more than 35% of the total voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of
Holdings or a parent of Holdings and (b) the Original Stockholders beneficially
own, directly or indirectly, less than the then outstanding voting stock of
Holdings or a parent of Holdings beneficially owned by such person or group;
(ii)(a) a person or group, other than the Original Stockholders, becomes the
beneficial owner of more than 35% of the total voting power of the then
outstanding voting stock of JSC, (b) the Original Stockholders beneficially own,
directly or indirectly, less than the then outstanding voting stock of JSC
beneficially owned by such person or group and (c) CCA is a subsidiary of JSC at
the time that the later of (a) and (b) above occurs; or (iii) individuals who at
the beginning of any period of two consecutive calendar years constituted the
Board of Directors of JSC (together with any new directors whose election by the
Board of Directors or whose nomination for election by JSC's shareholders was
approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the Board of
Directors of JSC then still in office who either were members of the Board of
Directors of JSC at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination
for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of JSC then in office.
Pursuant to the Proposed 1993 Note Amendment, the Company and JSC are seeking to
eliminate clause (iii) above.

The payment of principal and interest on the 1993 Notes is unconditionally
guaranteed on a senior basis by JSC. Such guarantee ranks pari passu with the
other senior indebtedness of JSC, including, without limitation, JSC's
obligations under the New Credit Agreement (including its guarantees of CCA's
obligations thereunder) and JSC's guarantee of CCA's obligations under the
Senior Notes, and is senior in right of payment to JSC's guarantees of the
Subordinated Debt. JSC's obligations under the New Credit Agreement, but not its
guarantees of the 1993 Notes, will be secured by liens on substantially all the
assets of JSC and its subsidiaries with the exception of cash and cash
equivalents and trade receivables, and guaranteed by CCA and certain
subsidiaries of JSC and CCA. The secured indebtedness will have priority over
JSC's guarantees of the 1993 Notes with respect to the assets

77

<PAGE>
securing such indebtedness. In the event that (i) a purchaser of capital stock
of CCA acquires a majority of the voting rights thereunder or (ii) there occurs
a merger or consolidation of CCA that results in CCA having a parent other than
JSC and, at the time of and after giving effect to such transaction, such
purchaser or parent satisfies certain minimum net worth and cash flow
requirements, JSC will be released from its guarantee of the 1993 Notes. Such
sale, merger or consolidation will be prohibited unless certain other
requirements are met, including that the purchaser or the entity surviving such
a merger or consolidation expressly assumes JSC's or CCA's obligations, as the
case may be, and that no Event of Default (as defined in the 1993 Note
Indenture) occur or be continuing.

In connection with implementing the Recapitalization Plan, the Company
intends to amend the terms of the 1993 Note Indenture. Among other things, the
Proposed 1993 Note Amendment will modify the provisions of the 1993 Note
Indenture which limit the ability of Holdings, JSC and CCA to incur indebtedness
and to make certain restricted payments. See 'Recapitalization Plan -- Consents
and Waivers'.

In many respects, of the provisions at the 1993 Note Indenture described in
the second through fifth paragraphs of this Section (and often giving effect to
the Proposed 1993 Note Amendment) are substantially identical to those of the
Senior Notes.

The net proceeds from the offering of the 1993 Notes were used to repay
certain revolving credit indebtedness and term loan indebtedness outstanding
under the Old Bank Facilities. The Company has also entered into reverse
interest rate swap agreements which hedge a portion of the 1993 Note issue.

MS&Co. acted as underwriter in connection with the original offering of the
1993 Notes and received an underwriting discount of $12.5 million in connection
therewith.

SUBSTITUTION TRANSACTION

JSC is currently the guarantor on all of CCA's outstanding public
indebtedness (consisting of the 1993 Notes and the three classes of Subordinated
Debt) and will similarly guarantee the Senior Notes. Holdings will organize a
new subsidiary ('Smurfit Interco'), all the outstanding capital stock of which
will be owned by Holdings and which will own all of the outstanding capital
stock of JSC, but which will have no other significant assets (other than
intercompany note receivables) and, except for guarantees of indebtedness of
CCA, no indebtedness for borrowed money. Subject to obtaining the consent of the
holders of the 1993 Notes to the Proposed 1993 Note Amendment and the consents
necessary to amend the Securitization documents, Holdings intends (i) to cause
Smurfit Interco to replace JSC as guarantor under the indentures relating to
CCA's public indebtedness (and under the New Credit Agreement), (ii) to amend
such indentures so that references to JSC therein and in the 1993 Notes and the
Senior Notes shall be changed to be Smurfit Interco and (iii) to cause JSC to
merge into CCA, which shall succeed to all of JSC's assets and liabilities
(except that any guaranty of obligations of CCA by JSC shall be extinguished)
(collectively, the 'Substitution Transaction'). The purpose of the Substitution
Transaction is to maximize operating efficiencies by combining Holdings' two key
operating subsidiaries into one entity and achieve cost savings.

the date of issuance. No interest will be paid on the Junior Accrual Debentures
prior to December 1, 1994. On December 1, 1994 all interest accrued from the

1994 will be paid in one lump sum. From and after December 1, 1994 interest on
the Junior Accrual Debentures will be payable semiannually on each June 1 and
December 1, commencing June 1, 1995.

additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends and make other distributions; (iii)
create liens; and (iv) use the proceeds of certain asset sales.

Senior Notes for redemption will be made by the Series A Senior Note Trustee in
compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange,
if any, on which the Series A Senior Notes are listed or, if the Series A Senior
Notes are not listed on a national securities exchange, on a pro rata basis, by
lot or by such other method as the Series A Senior Note Trustee in its sole
discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate; provided that no Series A
Senior Note of $1,000 in principal amount at maturity or less shall be redeemed
in part. If any Series A Senior Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice
of redemption relating to such Series A Senior Note shall state the portion of
the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Series A Senior Note in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the
name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Series A Senior
Note.

The Credit Agreement contains covenants prohibiting the optional redemption
of the Senior Notes. See 'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Terms of New
Credit Agreement'.

RANKING

The Indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Notes will rank pari passu in
right of payment with all other senior Indebtedness of CCA, including, without
limitation, CCA's obligations under the Credit Agreement, the 1993 Notes and its
guarantee of JSC's obligations under the Credit Agreement. JSC's Guarantee of
the Senior Notes will rank pari passu in right of payment with all other
unsubordinated Indebtedness of JSC, including, without limitation, JSC's
obligations under the Credit Agreement, its guarantee of the 1993 Notes and its
guarantee of CCA's obligations under the Credit Agreement.

CCA's and JSC's obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by
pledges of substantially all of the assets of JSC, CCA and their material
subsidiaries and are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of CCA and JSC, and the
obligations of each such guaranteeing subsidiary are secured by certain assets
of such guaranteeing subsidiary. The Senior Notes and JSC's Guarantee of the
Senior Notes will be

81

<PAGE>

effectively subordinated to such security interests and guarantees to the extent
of such security interests and guarantees. After giving pro forma effect to the
Recapitalization Plan, including the Existing Subordinated Debt Refinancing, as
of December 31, 1993, CCA and its subsidiaries would have had outstanding
approximately $1,066.5 million of secured Indebtedness and JSC and its
subsidiaries (including CCA and its subsidiaries) would have had outstanding
approximately $1,311.7 million of secured Indebtedness, including in each case,
without limitation, Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement. See 'Risk
Factors -- Effect of Secured Indebtedness on the Senior Notes', 'Capitalization'
and 'Pro Forma Financial Data'.

GUARANTEE

CCA's obligations under the Senior Notes are Guaranteed by JSC.

Indebtedness of JSC or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Closing
Date, including the Senior Notes, shall be considered to be outstanding and (iv)
neither JSC nor CCA may Incur any Indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to
any other Indebtedness of JSC or CCA, as the case may be, unless such
Indebtedness, by its terms or the terms of any agreement or instrument pursuant
to which such Indebtedness is issued, is also expressly made subordinate to
JSC's Guarantee of the Senior Notes or the Senior Notes, as the case may be, at
least to the extent that such Indebtedness is subordinated to such other
Indebtedness; provided that the limitation in clause (iv) above shall not apply
to distinctions between categories of unsubordinated Indebtedness which exist by
reason of (a) any liens or other encumbrances arising or created in respect of
some but not all unsubordinated Indebtedness, (b) intercreditor agreements
between holders of different classes of unsubordinated Indebtedness or (c)

granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in the first
paragraph or clause (i) of the second paragraph of the 'Limitation on Liens'

under this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by reference to one
such provision and in part by reference to one or more other provisions of this
covenant permitting such Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance
with this 'Limitation on Indebtedness' covenant, (x) in the event that an item
of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the above clauses, JSC, in its sole discretion, shall classify such
item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such
Indebtedness in one of such clauses and (y) the amount of Indebtedness issued at
a price that is less than the principal amount thereof shall be equal to the
amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in conformity with GAAP.

contributed to the capital of JSC by Holdings plus (3) an amount equal to the

interest on Indebtedness, dividends, repayments of loans or advances, or other
transfers of assets, in each case to JSC or any Restricted Subsidiary from
Unrestricted Subsidiaries, or from redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as
Restricted Subsidiaries (valued in each case as provided in the definition of
'Investments'), not to exceed in the case of any Unrestricted Subsidiary the
amount of Investments previously made by JSC or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Unrestricted Subsidiary plus (4) $25 million.

right of payment to JSC's Guarantee of the Senior Notes, including premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest, with the proceeds of, or in exchange for,
Indebtedness Incurred under clause (iii) or (vi) of the second paragraph of the
'Limitation on Indebtedness' covenant; (iii) the payment of dividends on the
Capital Stock of JSC or CCA, following the initial public offering of Capital
Stock of Holdings provided for in the Recapitalization Plan, of up to 6% per
annum of the net proceeds received by JSC or CCA, as the case may be, from
Holdings out of the proceeds of (a) such public offering and (b) the SIBV

held by such Persons in accordance with the 1992 Stock Option Plan; provided
that such payments do not exceed $4 million in any fiscal year; or payments or
distributions to Holdings to enable Holdings to make any such payments; or (xii)
the payment of pro rata dividends to holders of Capital Stock of Smurfit
Newsprint; provided that, in the case of clauses (ii) through (vii), (xi) and
(xii), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or

connection with any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement for value of any security which is not Capital Stock
but which is convertible into or exchangeable for Capital Stock (including
options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock), such purchase,
repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement shall be
deemed covered by clause (iii) and not by clause (ii) of the first paragraph of
this covenant if the Board of Directors of JSC makes a good faith determination
that the value of the underlying Capital Stock, less any consideration payable
by the holder of such security in connection with such conversion or exchange,
is less than the value of the referenced security. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any amounts paid pursuant to clause (iii) of this second paragraph of
this 'Limitation on Restricted Payments' covenant shall reduce the amount
available for Restricted Payments under clause (C) of the first paragraph of
this 'Limitation on Restricted Payments' covenant. (Section 3.04)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an issuance of Capital Stock
of CCA or JSC (or Holdings or a Holdings Parent to the extent that the proceeds
therefrom are contributed to CCA) and (1) the repurchase, redemption or other
acquisition of Capital Stock out of the proceeds of such issuance, (2) the
acquisition of Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the
Senior Notes or the redemption of the Series A Senior Notes out of the proceeds
of such issuance, as permitted by clause (v) or (vi) above, then, in calculating
whether the conditions of clause (C) of the first paragraph of this 'Limitation
on Restricted Payments' covenant have been met with respect to any subsequent
Restricted Payments, both the proceeds of such issuance and the application of
such proceeds shall be included under clause (C).

LIMITATION ON DIVIDEND AND OTHER PAYMENT RESTRICTIONS AFFECTING RESTRICTED
SUBSIDIARIES

So long as any of the Senior Notes are outstanding, JSC will not, and will
not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or suffer to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of any kind
on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary (other than CCA) to (i) pay
dividends or make any other distributions permitted by applicable law on any
Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary owned by JSC or any other Restricted
Subsidiary, (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to JSC or any other Restricted
Subsidiary, (iii) make loans or advances to JSC or any other Restricted

Notes, the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Subordinated Debentures, the Junior
Accrual Debentures, any indenture or agreement related to any of the foregoing
or any agreements in effect on the Closing Date or in any Indebtedness
containing any such encumbrance or restriction that is permitted pursuant to
clause (v) below or in any extensions, refinancings, renewals or replacements of
any of the foregoing; provided that the encumbrances and restrictions in any
such extensions, refinancings, renewals or replacements are not materially less
favorable taken as whole to the Holders than those encumbrances or restrictions
that are then in effect and that are being extended, refinanced, renewed or
replaced; (iii) existing under any Receivables Program or any other agreement
providing for the Incurrence of Indebtedness (or any exhibit, appendix or
schedule to such agreement or other agreement executed as a condition to the
execution of, funding under or pursuant to such agreement); provided that the
encumbrances and restrictions in any such agreement are not materially less
favorable taken as a whole to the Holders than those encumbrances

96

<PAGE>
and restrictions contained in any Credit Agreement as of the Closing Date; (iv)
existing under or by reason of applicable law; (v) existing with respect to any
Person or the property or assets of such Person acquired by JSC or any
Restricted Subsidiary and existing at the time of such acquisition, which
encumbrances or restrictions are not applicable to any Person or the property or
assets of any Person other than such Person or the property or assets of such
Person so acquired; (vi) in the case of clause (vii) of the first paragraph of
this 'Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries' covenant, (A) that restrict in a customary manner the subletting,
assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is a lease, license,
conveyance or contract or similar property or asset, (B) existing by virtue of
any transfer of, agreement to transfer, option or right with respect to, or Lien
on, any property or assets of JSC or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise
prohibited by the Indenture or (C) arising or agreed to in the ordinary course
of business and that do not, individually or in the aggregate, detract from the
value of property or assets of JSC or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner
material to JSC and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole; or (viii) with
respect to a Restricted Subsidiary and imposed pursuant to an agreement that has
been entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the
Capital Stock of, or property and assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary. Nothing
contained in this 'Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries' covenant shall prevent JSC or any Restricted
Subsidiary from (1) entering into any agreement permitting or providing for the
incurrence of Liens otherwise permitted in the 'Limitation on Liens' covenant or
(2) restricting the sale or other disposition of property or assets of JSC or
any of its Subsidiaries that secure Indebtedness of JSC or any of its
Subsidiaries. (Section 3.05)

LIMITATION ON THE ISSUANCE OF CAPITAL STOCK OF JSC AND RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES

Under the terms of the Indenture, JSC will not and will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary (other than CCA), directly or indirectly, to issue or sell
any shares of its Capital Stock (including options, warrants or other rights to
purchase shares of such Capital Stock) except (i) to JSC or another Restricted
Subsidiary that is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of JSC, (ii) if, immediately after
giving effect to such issuance or sale, such Restricted Subsidiary would no
longer constitute a Restricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, (iii)
if the Net Cash Proceeds from such issuance or sale are applied, to the extent
required to be applied, pursuant to the 'Limitation on Asset Sales' covenant or
if such issuance or sale does not constitute an 'Asset Sale,' (iv) issuances or
sales to foreign nationals of shares of the Capital Stock of Foreign
Subsidiaries, to the extent mandated by applicable foreign law or (v) issuances
or sales of Capital Stock by JSC to Holdings. (Section 3.06)

LIMITATION ON TRANSACTIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Indenture, JSC will not, and will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary of JSC to, directly or indirectly, enter into, renew or
extend any transaction (including, without limitation, the purchase, sale, lease
or exchange of property or assets, or the rendering of any service) with any
holder (or any Affiliate of such holder) of 5% or more of any class of Capital
Stock of Holdings or with any Affiliate of JSC, except upon fair and reasonable
terms no less favorable to JSC or such Restricted Subsidiary of JSC than could
be obtained, at the time of such transaction or at the time of the execution of
the agreement providing therefor, in a comparable arm's-length transaction with
a Person that is not such a holder or an Affiliate.

The foregoing limitation does not limit, and shall not apply to, (i)
transactions (A) approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the
Board of Directors or (B) for which JSC or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers to
the Trustee a written opinion of a nationally recognized investment banking firm

Restricted Subsidiaries; (iii) the payment of reasonable and customary regular
fees to directors of JSC or any Restricted Subsidiary who are not employees of
JSC or any Restricted Subsidiary; (iv) any payments or other transactions
pursuant to any tax-sharing agreement between JSC, CCA and Holdings or any other

Payments' covenant; (vi) the provisions of management,

97

<PAGE>

determined that the provision of such services is in the best interests of JSC
and its Subsidiaries; (vii) any transaction required by the Times Mirror
Agreement; or (viii) any transaction contemplated by the terms of the
Recapitalization Plan. (Section 3.07)

LIMITATION ON LIENS

Under the terms of the Indenture, JSC will not, and will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on
any Principal Property, or any shares of Capital Stock or Indebtedness of any
Restricted Subsidiary, without making effective provision for all of the Senior
Notes and all other amounts due under the Indenture to be directly secured
equally and ratably with (or prior to) the obligation or liability secured by
such Lien for so long as such Lien affects such Principal Property, shares of
Capital Stock or Indebtedness unless, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate
amount of any Indebtedness so secured, plus, the Attributable Indebtedness for
all sale-leaseback transactions restricted as described in the 'Limitation on
Sale-Leaseback Transactions' covenant, does not exceed 10% of Adjusted
Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

The foregoing limitation does not apply to, and any computation of secured
Indebtedness under such limitation shall exclude, (i) Liens securing obligations
under (A) any Credit Agreement and (B) any Receivables Programs; (ii) other
Liens existing on the Closing Date; (iii) Liens securing Indebtedness of
Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Acquired Indebtedness and refinancings
thereof); (iv) Liens securing Indebtedness Incurred under clause (iv) or (v) of
the second paragraph of the 'Limitation on Indebtedness' covenant; (v) Liens
granted in connection with the extension, renewal or refinancing, in whole or in
part, of any Indebtedness described in clauses (i) through (iv) above; provided
that with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) the amount of Indebtedness secured
by such Lien is not increased thereby; and provided further that the extension,
renewal or refinancing of Indebtedness of JSC may not be secured by Liens on
assets of any Restricted Subsidiary (other than CCA) other than to the extent
the Indebtedness being renewed or refinanced was at any time previously secured
by Liens on assets of such Restricted Subsidiary; (vi) Liens with respect to
Acquired Indebtedness permitted under clause (viii) of the second paragraph of
the 'Limitation on Indebtedness' covenant and permitted refinancings thereof;
provided that such Liens do not extend to or cover any property or assets of JSC
or any Subsidiary of JSC other than the property or assets of the Subsidiary
acquired; (vii) Liens securing the Senior Subordinated Notes, the Subordinated
Debentures, the Junior Accrual Debentures or the 1993 Notes, in each case to the
extent required to be incurred pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing
such Indebtedness; or (viii) Permitted Liens. (Section 3.08)

LIMITATION ON SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS

Under the terms of the Indenture, JSC will not, and will not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any sale-leaseback transaction involving
any Principal Property, unless the aggregate amount of all Attributable
Indebtedness with respect to such transactions, plus all Indebtedness secured by
Liens on Principal Properties (excluding secured Indebtedness that is excluded
as described in the 'Limitation on Liens' covenant), does not exceed 10% of
Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

The foregoing restriction does not apply to, and any computation of
Attributable Indebtedness under such limitation shall exclude, any
sale-leaseback transaction if (i) the lease is for a period, including renewal
rights, of not in excess of three years; (ii) the sale or transfer of the
Principal Property is entered into prior to, at the time of, or within 12 months
after the later of the acquisition of the Principal Property or the completion
of construction thereof; (iii) the lease secures or relates to industrial
revenue or pollution control bonds; (iv) the transaction is between JSC and any
Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted Subsidiaries; or (v) JSC or such
Restricted Subsidiary, within 12 months after the sale of any Principal Property
is completed, applies an amount not less than the net proceeds received from
such sale to the retirement of unsubordinated Indebtedness, to Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary (other than CCA) or to the purchase of other property that
will constitute Principal Property or improvements thereto. (Section 3.09)

98

<PAGE>
LIMITATION ON ASSET SALES

Under the terms of the Indenture, in the event and to the extent that the
Net Cash Proceeds received by Holdings, JSC or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries from one or more Asset Sales occurring on or after the Closing Date
in any period of 12 consecutive months (other than Asset Sales by Holdings, JSC
or any Restricted Subsidiary to JSC or another Restricted Subsidiary) exceed 10%
of Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets in any one fiscal year (determined
as of the date closest to the commencement of such 12-month period for which a
consolidated balance sheet of JSC has been prepared), then JSC shall or shall
cause the relevant Restricted Subsidiary to (i) within 12 months (or, in the
case of Asset Sales of plants or facilities, 24 months) after the date Net Cash
Proceeds so received exceed 10% of Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets in
any one fiscal year (determined as of the date closest to the commencement of
such 12-month period for which a balance sheet of JSC and its Subsidiaries has
been prepared) (A) apply an amount equal to such excess Net Cash Proceeds to
repay unsubordinated Indebtedness of CCA or JSC, make a dividend or distribution
to JSC for application by JSC to repay unsubordinated Indebtedness of JSC, or
repay Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary of JSC, in each case owing to a
Person other than JSC or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or (B) invest an
equal amount, or the amount not so applied pursuant to clause (A) (or enter into
a definitive agreement committing to so invest within 12 months after the date
of such agreement), in property or assets of a nature or type or which will be
used in a business (or in a company having property and assets of a nature or
type, or engaged in a business) similar or related to the nature or type of the
property and assets of, or the business of, JSC and its Restricted Subsidiaries
existing on the date of such Investment (as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of JSC, whose determination shall be conclusive and evidenced
by a Board Resolution) and (ii) apply (no later than the end of such 12-month
period or 24-month period, as the case may be, referred to in clause (i)) such
excess Net Cash Proceeds (to the extent not applied pursuant to clause (i)) as
provided in the following paragraphs of this 'Limitation on Asset Sales'
covenant. The amount of such excess Net Cash Proceeds required to be applied (or
to be committed to be applied) during such 12-month period or 24-month period,
as the case may be, as set forth in clause (A) or (B) of the preceding sentence
and neither applied nor committed to be applied as set forth above by the end of
such period shall constitute 'Excess Proceeds.'

If, as of the first day of any calendar month, the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds not theretofore subject to an Excess Proceeds Offer (as defined
below) totals at least $10 million, CCA must, not later than the fifteenth
Business Day of such month, make an offer (an 'Excess Proceeds Offer') to
purchase from the Holders on a pro rata basis an aggregate principal amount of
Senior Notes equal to the Excess Proceeds on such date, at a purchase price
equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Notes, plus, in each case,
accrued interest (if any) to the date of purchase (the 'Excess Proceeds
Payment').

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) to the extent that any or all of the Net
Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale are prohibited or delayed by applicable local
law from being repatriated to the United States of America, the portion of such
Net Cash Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied pursuant to
this 'Limitation on Asset Sales' covenant but may be retained for so long, but
only for so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to
the United States of America (under the Indenture JSC will agree to promptly
take or cause the relevant Restricted Subsidiary to promptly take all reasonable
actions required by the applicable local law and within JSC's control to permit
such repatriation) and once such repatriation of any such affected Net Cash
Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be
immediately effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds will be applied in
the manner set forth in this 'Limitation on Asset Sales' covenant as if such
Asset Sale had occurred on the date of repatriation; and (ii) to the extent that
the Board of Directors of JSC has determined in good faith that repatriation of
any or all of the Net Cash Proceeds would have an adverse tax or other
consequence to JSC, the Net Cash Proceeds so affected may be retained outside
the United States of America for so long as such adverse tax or other
consequence would continue.

CCA shall commence an Excess Proceeds Offer by mailing a notice to the
Trustee and each Holder stating: (i) that the Excess Proceeds Offer is being
made pursuant to this 'Limitation on Asset Sales' covenant and that all Senior
Notes validly tendered will be accepted for payment on a pro rata basis; (ii)
the purchase price and the date of purchase (which shall be a Business Day no
earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed)
(the 'Excess Proceeds Payment Date'); (iii) that

99

<PAGE>
any Senior Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (iv) that, unless
CCA defaults in the payment of the Excess Proceeds Payment, any Senior Note
accepted for payment pursuant to the Excess Proceeds Offer shall cease to accrue
interest after the Excess Proceeds Payment Date; (v) that Holders electing to
have a Senior Note purchased pursuant to the Excess Proceeds Offer will be
required to surrender the Senior Note together with the form entitled 'Option of
the Holder to Elect Purchase' on the reverse side of the Senior Note completed,
to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Excess Proceeds Payment
Date; (vi) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the
Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the third
Business Day immediately preceding the Excess Proceeds Payment Date, a telegram,
telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder,
the principal amount of Senior Notes delivered for purchase and a statement that
such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Senior Notes are being
purchased only in part will be issued new Senior Notes equal in principal amount
to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes surrendered; provided that each
Senior Note purchased and each new Senior Note issued shall be in an original
principal amount of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof.

On the Excess Proceeds Payment Date, CCA shall (i) accept for payment on a
pro rata basis Senior Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Excess
Proceeds Offer; (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the
purchase price of all Senior Notes or portions thereof so accepted; and (iii)
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Trustee all Senior Notes or
portions thereof so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate specifying
the Senior Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment by CCA. The Paying
Agent shall promptly mail to the Holders of Senior Notes so accepted payment in
an amount equal to the purchase price, and the Trustee shall promptly
authenticate and mail to such Holders a new Senior Notes equal in principal
amount to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes surrendered; provided that
each Senior Notes purchased and each new Senior Notes issued shall be in an
original principal amount of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. CCA will
publicly announce the results of the Excess Proceeds Offer as soon as
practicable after the Excess Proceeds Payment Date. For purposes of this
'Limitation on Asset Sales' covenant, the Trustee shall act as the Paying Agent.

CCA will comply with Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and
regulations are applicable, in the event that such Excess Proceeds are received
by CCA under this 'Limitation on Asset Sales' covenant and CCA is required to
repurchase Senior Notes as described above and CCA may modify any of the
foregoing provisions of this 'Limitation on Asset Sales' covenant to the extent
it is advised by independent counsel that such modification is necessary or
appropriate in order to ensure such compliance. (Section 3.10)

REPURCHASE OF SENIOR NOTES UPON CHANGE OF CONTROL

(a) In the event of a Change of Control, each Holder shall have the right
to require the repurchase of its Senior Notes by CCA in cash pursuant to the
offer described below (the 'Change of Control Offer') at a purchase price equal
to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest (if any) to the
date of purchase (the 'Change of Control Payment'). Prior to the mailing of the
notice to Holders provided for in the succeeding paragraph, but in any event
within 30 days following any Change of Control, CCA covenants to (i) (A) repay
in full all unsubordinated Indebtedness of CCA or make a dividend or
distribution to JSC for application by JSC to repay in full all unsubordinated
Indebtedness of JSC or (B) offer to repay in full all such unsubordinated
Indebtedness of either JSC or CCA and to repay such unsubordinated Indebtedness
of each holder of such unsubordinated Indebtedness who has accepted such offer
or (ii) obtain the requisite consents, if any, under the instruments governing
any such unsubordinated Indebtedness of JSC or CCA to permit the repurchase of
the Senior Notes as provided for in the succeeding paragraph. CCA shall first
comply with the covenant in the preceding sentence before it shall be required
to repurchase Senior Notes pursuant to this 'Repurchase of Senior Notes upon
Change of Control' covenant.

(b) Within 30 days of the Change of Control, CCA shall mail a notice to the
Trustee and each Holder stating: (i) that a Change of Control has occurred, that
the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this 'Repurchase of Senior
Notes upon Change of Control' covenant and that all

100

<PAGE>
Senior Notes validly tendered will be accepted for payment; (ii) the purchase
price and the date of purchase (which shall be a Business Day no earlier than 30
days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the 'Change of
Control Payment Date'); (iii) that any Senior Notes not tendered will continue
to accrue interest; (iv) that, unless CCA defaults in the payment of the Change
of Control Payment, any Senior Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change
of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control
Payment Date; (v) that Holders electing to have any Senior Notes or portion
thereof purchased pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will be required to
surrender such Senior Notes, together with the form entitled 'Option of the
Holder to Elect Purchase' on the reverse side of such Senior Notes completed, to
the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of
business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Change of Control Payment
Date; (vi) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the
Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the third
Business Day immediately preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a
telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of such
Holder, the principal amount of Senior Notes delivered for purchase and a
statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Senior Notes
purchased; and (vii) that Holders whose Senior Notes are being purchased only in
part will be issued new Senior Notes equal in principal amount to the
unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes surrendered; provided that each Senior
Note purchased and each new Senior Note issued shall be in an original principal
amount of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof.

(c) On the Change of Control Payment Date, CCA shall: (i) accept for
payment Senior Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer; (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the
purchase price of all Senior Notes or portions thereof so accepted; and (iii)
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee, all Senior Notes or portions
thereof so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate specifying the Senior
Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment by CCA. The Paying Agent shall
promptly mail, to the Holders of Senior Notes so accepted, payment in an amount
equal to the purchase price, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and
mail to such Holders a new Senior Notes equal in principal amount to any
unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes surrendered; provided that each Senior
Notes purchased and each new Senior Notes issued shall be in an original
principal amount of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. CCA will publicly
announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable
after the Change of Control Payment Date. For purposes of this 'Repurchase of
Senior Notes upon Change of Control' covenant, the Trustee shall act as Paying
Agent.

(d) CCA will comply with Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and
regulations are applicable in the event that a Change of Control occurs under
this 'Repurchase of Senior Notes upon Change of Control' covenant and CCA is
required to repurchase Senior Notes as described above and CCA may modify any of
the foregoing provisions of this 'Repurchase of Senior Notes upon Change of
Control' covenant to the extent it is advised by independent counsel that such
modification is necessary or appropriate in order to ensure such compliance.
(Section 3.18)

If CCA is unable to repay all of its unsubordinated Indebtedness and is
also unable to obtain the consents of its unsubordinated creditors (and/or of
the holders of other Indebtedness, if any, of CCA or JSC outstanding at the time
of a Change of Control whose consent would be so required) to permit the
repurchase of Senior Notes either pursuant to clause (i)(B) or clause (ii) of
the first paragraph of the foregoing covenant, then CCA will have breached such
covenant. This breach will constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture if
it continues for a period of 30 consecutive days after written notice is given
to CCA by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Notes outstanding. In addition, the failure by CCA to
repurchase Senior Notes at the conclusion of the Change of Control Offer will
constitute an Event of Default without any waiting period or notice
requirements. JSC has guaranteed all payments due on the Senior Notes, including
those due by reason of the acceleration thereof following the occurrence of an
Event of Default. This obligation of JSC is not subject to any waiting period or
notice requirement once such an acceleration has occurred; as discussed above,
however, in certain circumstances there are notice and waiting period
requirements that must be satisfied before CCA's breach of the above covenant
constitutes an Event of Default.

101

<PAGE>
There can be no assurances that CCA (or JSC) will have sufficient funds
available at the time of any Change of Control to make any debt payment
(including repurchases of the Senior Notes) required by the foregoing covenant
and similar provisions contained in the Senior Subordinated Notes, the
Subordinated Debentures, the Junior Accrual Debentures, any Credit Agreement (as
well as in any other indebtedness which might be outstanding at the time).
Although there is some variation in the definition of 'Change of Control' among
such different classes of debt, there is substantial overlap. In any event, the
above covenant requiring CCA to repurchase the Senior Notes will, unless the
consents referred to above are obtained, require CCA and JSC to offer to repay
or repay all indebtedness outstanding under any Credit Agreement, and any other
indebtedness then outstanding which by its terms prohibits such repurchases of
the Senior Notes, either prior to or concurrently with such repurchases.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT

The following events will be defined as 'Events of Default' in the
Indenture: (a) default in the payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on)
any Senior Notes when the same becomes due and payable at maturity, upon
acceleration, redemption or otherwise; (b) default in the payment of interest on
any Senior Notes when the same becomes due and payable, and such default
continues for a period of 30 days; (c) JSC or CCA defaults in the performance of
or breaches any other covenant or agreement of JSC or CCA in the Indenture or
under the Senior Notes and such default or breach continues for a period of 30
consecutive days after written notice by the Trustee or the Holders of 25% or
more in aggregate principal amount of the Series A Senior Notes and the Series B
Senior Notes then outstanding taken together as one class or, in the case of any
such default or breach under only one Indenture, 25% or more in aggregate
principal amount of the Series A Senior Notes or the Series B Senior Notes, as
the case may be, then outstanding; (d) there occurs with respect to any issue or
issues of Indebtedness of JSC, CCA and/or one or more of their Significant
Subsidiaries having an outstanding principal amount of $50 million or more
individually or $100 million or more in the aggregate for all such issues of all
such Persons, whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be
created, an event of default that has caused the holder thereof to declare such
Indebtedness to be due and payable prior to its Stated Maturity and such
Indebtedness has not been discharged in full or such acceleration has not been
rescinded or annulled within 30 days of such acceleration; (e) any final
judgment or order (not covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess
of $50 million individually or $100 million in the aggregate for all such final
judgments or orders against all such Persons (treating any deductibles,
self-insurance or retention as not so covered) shall be rendered against JSC,
CCA or any of their Significant Subsidiaries and shall not be paid or
discharged, and there shall be any period of 30 consecutive days following entry
of the final judgment or order in excess of $50 million individually or that
causes the aggregate amount for all such final judgments or orders outstanding
and not paid or discharged against all such Persons to exceed $100 million
during which a stay of enforcement of such final judgment or order, by reason of
a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect; (f) a court having
jurisdiction in the premises enters a decree or order for (i) relief in respect
of JSC, CCA or any of their Significant Subsidiaries in an involuntary case
under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or
hereafter in effect, (ii) appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee,
custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of JSC, CCA or any of their
Significant Subsidiaries or for all or substantially all of the property and
assets of JSC, CCA or any of their Significant Subsidiaries or (iii) the winding
up or liquidation of the affairs of JSC, CCA or any of their Significant
Subsidiaries and, in each case, such decree or order shall remain unstayed and
in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; (g) JSC, CCA or any of their
Significant Subsidiaries (i) commences a voluntary case under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or
consents to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any
such law, (ii) consents to the appointment of or taking possession by a
receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar
official of JSC, CCA or any of their Significant Subsidiaries or for all or
substantially all of the property and assets of JSC, CCA or any of their
Significant Subsidiaries or (iii) effects any general assignment for the benefit
of creditors; (h) JSC, CCA and/or one or more of their Significant Subsidiaries
fails to make (i) at the final (but not any interim) fixed maturity of any issue
of Indebtedness a principal payment of $50 million or more or (ii) at the final
(but not any interim) fixed

102

<PAGE>
maturity of more than one issue of such Indebtedness principal payments
aggregating $100 million or more and, in the case of clause (i), such defaulted
payment shall not have been made, waived or extended within 30 days of the
payment default and, in the case of clause (ii), all such defaulted payments
shall not have been made, waived or extended within 30 days of the payment
default that causes the amount described in clause (ii) to exceed $100 million;
or (i) the non-payment of any two or more items of Indebtedness of JSC, CCA
and/or one or more of their Significant Subsidiaries that would constitute at
the time of such nonpayments, but for the individual amounts of such
Indebtedness, an Event of Default under clause (d) or clause (h) above, or both,
and which items of Indebtedness aggregate $100 million or more. (Section 5.01)

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause
(f) or (g) above that occurs with respect to JSC or CCA) occurs and is
continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Series A Senior Notes and Series B Senior
Notes then outstanding taken together as one class or, in the case of any such
Event of Default which occurs and is continuing under only one Indenture, 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Series A Senior Notes or the Series B Senior
Notes, as the case may be, then outstanding, by written notice to CCA (and to
the Trustee if such notice is given by the Holders (the 'Acceleration Notice')),
may, and the Trustee at the request of the Holders shall, declare the entire
unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Senior Notes
to be immediately due and payable. Upon a declaration of acceleration, such
principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest shall be immediately due and
payable. In the event of a declaration of acceleration because an Event of
Default set forth in clause (d), (h) or (i) above has occurred and is
continuing, such declaration of acceleration shall be automatically rescinded
and annulled if the event of default triggering such Event of Default pursuant
to clause (d), (h) or (i) shall be remedied, cured by JSC or CCA or waived by
the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 60 days after the declaration of
acceleration with respect thereto. If an Event of Default specified in clause
(f) or (g) above occurs with respect to JSC or CCA, all unpaid principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Senior Notes then outstanding shall
ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Series A Senior Notes and Series
B Senior Notes taken together as one class or, in the case of any default under
only one Indenture, a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Series A
Senior Notes or Series B Senior Notes, as the case may be, by written notice to
JSC, CCA and the Trustee, may waive all past defaults and rescind and annul a
declaration of acceleration and its consequences if (i) all existing Events of
Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on the Senior Notes that have become due solely by such declaration of
acceleration, have been cured or waived and (ii) the rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
(Section 5.02) For information as to the waiver of defaults, see
' -- Modification and Waiver.'

As a result of the foregoing voting provisions relating to Events of
Default under the Indenture, Holders of Series B Senior Notes even if acting
unanimously may not be able to (i) declare a default under the Series B Senior
Note Indenture following a default in the performance of or any breach of
covenants or agreements of JSC or CCA as set forth in clause (c) above, or (ii)
request acceleration of the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest
on, the Series B Senior Notes if an Event of Default occurs.

The Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Trustee. However the Trustee may refuse to follow any
direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture, that may involve the Trustee
in personal liability, or that the Trustee determines in good faith may be
unduly prejudicial to the rights of Holders of Senior Notes not joining in the
giving of such direction. (Section 5.05) A Holder may not pursue any remedy with
respect to the Indenture or the Senior Notes unless: (i) the Holder gives the
Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default; (ii) the Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Senior Notes make a
written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (iii) such Holder or
Holders offer the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any
costs, liability or expense; (iv) the Trustee does not comply with the request
within 60 days after receipt of the request

103

<PAGE>

and the offer of indemnity; and (v) during such 60-day period, the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes do not
give the Trustee a direction that is inconsistent with the request. (Section
5.06) However, such limitations do not apply to the right of any Holder of a
Senior Note to receive payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest
on, such Senior Note or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment,
on or after the due date expressed in the Senior Notes which right shall not be
impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder. For purposes of the
foregoing paragraph, actions that may be taken by Holders of at least a majority
or 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes may only be
taken by Holders of at least a majority or 25% (as the case may be) in aggregate
principal amount of the Series A Senior Notes and the Series B Senior Notes
taken together as one class or, in the case of any remedy which relates solely
to one Indenture or one class of Senior Notes, by Holders of at least a majority
or 25% (as the case may be) in aggregate principal amount of the Series A Senior
Notes or the Series B Senior Notes, as the case may be. (Section 5.02)

The Indenture will require certain officers of JSC and CCA to certify, on
or before a date not more than 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, that a
review has been conducted of the activities of JSC and CCA and their
Subsidiaries and JSC's and CCA's and their Subsidiaries' performance under the
Indenture and that JSC and CCA have fulfilled all obligations thereunder, or, if
there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying
each such default and the nature and status thereof. JSC and CCA will also be
obligated to notify the Trustee of any default or defaults in the performance of
any covenants or agreements under the Indenture. (Section 3.15)

CONSOLIDATION, MERGER AND SALE OF ASSETS

Neither JSC nor CCA shall consolidate with, merge with or into, or sell,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
property and assets (as an entirety or substantially an entirety in one
transaction or a series of related transactions) to, any Person (other than a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of JSC with a positive
net worth; provided that, in connection with any merger of JSC or CCA with a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of JSC, no consideration
(other than common stock in the surviving Person, JSC or CCA) shall be issued or
distributed to the stockholders of JSC) unless: (i) JSC or CCA shall be the
continuing Person, or the Person (if other than JSC or CCA) formed by such
consolidation or into which JSC or CCA is merged or that acquired or leased such
property and assets of JSC or CCA shall be a corporation organized and validly
existing under the laws of the United States of America or any jurisdiction
thereof and shall expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and
delivered to the Trustee, all of the obligations of JSC or CCA, as the case may
be, on all of the Senior Notes and under the Indenture; (ii) immediately after
giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing; (iii) immediately after giving effect to such
transaction on a pro forma basis, the Interest Coverage Ratio of the continuing
Person continuing as, or becoming the successor, obligor on the Senior Notes or
the Guarantee is at least 1:1, or, if less, equal to the Interest Coverage Ratio
of JSC or CCA, as the case may be, immediately prior to such transaction;
provided that, if the Interest Coverage Ratio of JSC or CCA, as the case may be,
before giving effect to such transaction is within the range set forth in column
(A) below, then the pro forma Interest Coverage Ratio of the continuing Person
becoming the successor obligor of the Senior Notes shall be at least equal to
the lesser of (1) the ratio determined by multiplying the percentage set forth
in column (B) below by the Interest Coverage Ratio of JSC or CCA, as the case
may be, prior to such transaction and (2) the ratio set forth in column (C)
below:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
(A) (B) (C)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- ------
<S> <C> <C>
1.11:1 to 1.99:1................................................................ 90 % 1.5:1
2.00:1 to 2.99:1................................................................ 80 % 2.1:1
3.00:1 to 3.99:1................................................................ 70 % 2.4:1
4.00:1 or more.................................................................. 60 % 2.5:1
</TABLE>

and provided further that, if the pro forma Interest Coverage Ratio of JSC, CCA
or any Person becoming the successor obligor of the Senior Notes, as the case
may be, is 3:1 or more, the calculation in the preceding proviso shall be
inapplicable and such transaction shall be deemed to have complied

104

<PAGE>
with the requirements of this clause (iii); (iv) immediately after giving effect
to such transaction on a pro forma basis, JSC, CCA or any Person becoming the
successor obligor of the Senior Notes shall have a Consolidated Net Worth equal
to or greater than the Consolidated Net Worth of JSC or CCA, as the case may be,
immediately prior to such transaction; and (v) JSC or CCA, as the case may be,
delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate (attaching the arithmetic
computations to demonstrate compliance with clauses (iii) and (iv)) and Opinion
of Counsel, in each case stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and
such supplemental indenture comply with this provision and that all conditions
precedent provided for herein relating to such transaction have been complied
with (in no event, however, shall such Opinion of Counsel cover financial
ratios, the solvency of any Person or any other financial or statistical data or
information); provided, however, that clauses (iii) and (iv) above do not apply
if, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of JSC or CCA, as
the case may be, whose determination shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution,
the principal purpose of such transaction is to change the state of
incorporation of JSC or CCA, as the case may be; and provided further that any
such transaction shall not have as one of its purposes the evasion of the
foregoing limitations.

JSC shall be released from all of its obligations under its Guarantee of
the Senior Notes and the Indenture if the purchaser of Capital Stock of CCA
having a majority of the voting rights thereunder, or the parent of CCA (other
than JSC) following a consolidation or merger of CCA, satisfies the requirements
of clauses (iii) and (iv) of the preceding sentence with respect to JSC.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in clause (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v)
above shall prevent the occurrence of (i) a merger or consolidation of JSC and
CCA, or either of their respective successors, (ii) the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of CCA to JSC, (iii) the sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of JSC to CCA or (iv) the assumption by JSC of
the Indebtedness represented by the Senior Notes.

In the event (i) JSC merges into CCA and (ii) in connection therewith a
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings ('Interco'), of which CCA
is at such time a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary, (x) guarantees the
obligations of CCA on the Senior Notes on the same terms and to the same extent
as JSC had guaranteed such obligations prior to the aforesaid merger, and (y)
assumes all obligations of JSC set forth in the Indenture (without giving effect
to the effect of the aforesaid merger on such obligations) (collectively, the
'Substitution Transaction') then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate to the effect that the
foregoing has occurred and the execution and delivery by CCA and Interco of a
supplemental indenture evidencing such merger and guarantee and assumption, and
without regard to the requirements set forth in clauses (i) through (v) of the
first paragraph under 'Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets', (a) all
references herein to 'CCA' shall continue to refer to CCA, as the survivor in
such merger, (b) all references to 'JSC' and to 'JSC's guarantee' shall refer to
Interco and to Interco's guarantee contemplated by clause (ii) above,
respectively; and (c) no breach of default under the Indenture shall be deemed
to have occurred solely by reason of the Substitution Transaction. (Section
4.01)

DEFEASANCE

Defeasance and Discharge. The Indenture will provide that JSC and CCA will
be deemed to have paid and will be discharged from any and all obligations in
respect of the Senior Notes on the 123rd day after the deposit referred to
below, and the provisions of the Indenture will no longer be in effect with
respect to the Senior Notes or JSC's Guarantee of the Senior Notes (except for,
among other matters, certain obligations to register the transfer or exchange of
the Senior Notes to replace stolen, lost or mutilated Senior Notes to maintain
paying agencies and to hold monies for payment in trust) if, among other things,
(A) CCA has deposited with the Trustee, in trust, money and/or U.S. Government
Obligations that through the payment of interest and principal in respect
thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount
sufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the
Senior Notes on the Stated Maturity of such payments in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture and the Senior Notes (B) JSC or CCA has delivered to the
Trustee (i) either an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that Holders will not
recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of
CCA's exercise of its option under this 'Defeasance' provision and will be
subject to federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at
the same times as

105

<PAGE>
would have been the case if such deposit, defeasance and discharge had not
occurred, which Opinion of Counsel must be accompanied by a ruling of the
Internal Revenue Service to the same effect unless there has been a change in
applicable federal income tax law after the date of the Indenture such that a
ruling is no longer required or a ruling directed to the Trustee received from
the Internal Revenue Service to the same effect as the aforementioned Opinion of
Counsel and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the creation of the
defeasance trust does not violate the Investment Company Act of 1940 and after
the passage of 123 days following the deposit, the trust fund will not be
subject to the effect of Section 547 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or
Section 15 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law, (C) immediately after giving
effect to such deposit on a pro forma basis, no Event of Default, or event that
after the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would become an Event of
Default, shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or
during the period ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit, and
such deposit shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, any other agreement or instrument to which JSC or CCA is a party
or by which JSC or CCA is bound, and (D) if at such time the Senior Notes are
listed on a national securities exchange, CCA has delivered to the Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Senior Notes will not be delisted as a
result of such deposit, defeasance and discharge. (Section 7.02)

Defeasance of Certain Covenants and Certain Events of Default. The
Indenture further will provide that the provisions of the Indenture will no
longer be in effect with respect to clauses (iii) and (iv) under 'Consolidation,
Merger and Sale of Assets' and all the covenants described herein under
'Covenants,' clause (c) under 'Events of Default with respect to such covenants
and clauses (iii) and (iv) under 'Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets,' and
clauses (d), (e), (h) and (i) under 'Events of Default' shall be deemed not to
be Events of Default, upon, among other things, the deposit with the Trustee, in
trust, of money and/or U.S. Government Obligations that through the payment of
interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will
provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued interest on the Senior Notes on the Stated Maturity of such payments
in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Senior Notes, the
satisfaction of the provisions described in clauses (B)(ii), (C), and (D) of the
preceding paragraph and the delivery by CCA to the Trustee of an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that, among other things, the Holders will not recognize
income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit
and defeasance of certain covenants and Events of Default and will be subject to
federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred. (Section 7.03)

Defeasance and Certain Other Events of Default. In the event CCA exercises
its option to omit compliance with certain covenants and provisions of the
Indenture with respect to the Senior Notes as described in the immediately
preceding paragraph and the Senior Notes are declared due and payable because of
the occurrence of an Event of Default that remains applicable, the amount of
money and/or U.S. Government Obligations on deposit with the Trustee will be
sufficient to pay amounts due on the Senior Notes at the time of their Stated
Maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Senior Notes at the
time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default. However, CCA will
remain liable for such payments and JSC's Guarantee with respect to such
payments will remain in effect.

The Credit Agreement contains a covenant prohibiting defeasance of the
Senior Notes. See 'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Terms of New Credit
Agreement'.

MODIFICATION AND WAIVER

Modifications and amendments of the Indenture may be made by JSC, CCA and
the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Series A Senior Notes and Series B
Senior Notes taken together as one class or, in the case of any such
modification or amendment which affects only one class of Senior Notes, a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Series A Senior Notes
or Series B Senior Notes, as the case may be, provided, however, that no such
modification or amendment may, without the consent of each Holder affected
thereby, (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment
of interest on, any Senior Note, (ii) reduce the principal amount of, or
premium, if any, or interest on, any Senior Note, (iii) change the place or
currency of payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on,

106

<PAGE>

any Senior Note, (iv) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of
any payment on or after the Stated Maturity (or, in the case of a redemption, on
or after the Redemption Date) of any Senior Note, (v) reduce the above-stated
percentage of outstanding Senior Notes, the consent of whose Holders is
necessary to modify or amend the Indenture, (vi) waive a default in the payment
of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Senior Notes, (vii) reduce
the percentage of aggregate principal amount of outstanding Senior Notes, the
consent of whose Holders is necessary for waiver of compliance with certain
provisions of the Indenture or for waiver of certain defaults, or (viii) release
JSC from its Guarantee of the Senior Notes. The provisions requiring the consent
or approval of specified percentages of Holders of either class of Senior Notes
or both classes of Senior Notes jointly cannot be modified or amended without
the consent of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Holders of such
class of Senior Notes or such two classes of Senior Notes jointly, as the case
may be. (Section 8.02)

To the extent that modifications and amendments of the Indenture may be
made with the consent of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Series A Senior Notes and Series B Senior Notes taken together as
one class, modifications and amendments of the Series B Senior Note Indenture
could be made without the consent of any Holder of Series B Senior Notes.

The Credit Agreement contains a covenant prohibiting JSC or CCA from
consenting to any modification of the Indenture or waiver of any provision
thereof without the consent of a specified percentage of the lenders under the
Credit Agreement. See 'Description of Certain Indebtedness -- Terms of New
Credit Agreement'.

NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF INCORPORATORS, SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR
EMPLOYEES

The Indenture provides that no recourse for the payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Senior Notes or for any claim
based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and no recourse under or upon any
obligation, covenant or agreement of JSC or CCA in the Indenture, or in any of
the Senior Notes or because of the creation of any Indebtedness represented
thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, shareholder, officer, director,
employee or controlling person of JSC or CCA or of any successor Person thereof.
Each Holder, by accepting the Senior Notes, waives and releases all such
liability. (Section 9.09)

CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

The Indenture provides that, except during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are specifically set forth
in such Indenture. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Trustee will exercise such rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture
and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person
would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own
affairs. (Section 6.01)

The Indenture and provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended, incorporated by reference therein contain limitations on the rights of
the Trustee, should it become a creditor of CCA or JSC, to obtain payment of
claims in certain cases or to realize on certain property received by it in
respect of any such claims, as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted
to engage in other transactions; provided, however, that if it acquires any
conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict or resign.

THE UNDERWRITER

Under the terms and subject to the conditions in the Underwriting Agreement
dated the date hereof (the 'Underwriting Agreement'), the Underwriter has agreed
to purchase, and CCA has agreed to sell to the Underwriter, all of the Senior
Notes.

The Underwriting Agreement provides that the obligation of the Underwriter
to pay for and accept delivery of the Senior Notes is subject to the approval of
certain legal matters by its counsel and to certain other conditions. The
Underwriter is obligated to take and pay for all Senior Notes offered hereby if
any are taken.

The Underwriter initially proposes to offer part of the Senior Notes
directly to the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page
hereof and part to certain dealers at a price that represents a concession not
in excess of % of the principal amount of the Senior Notes. The Underwriter
may allow, and such dealers may reallow, a concession not in excess of % of
the principal amount of the Senior Notes to certain other dealers. After the
initial offering of the Senior Notes, the offering price and other selling terms
may from time to time be varied by the Underwriter.

The Company has agreed to indemnify the Underwriter against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

Upon consummation of the Equity Offerings and the SIBV Investment,
affiliates of MS&Co. will own approximately % of the outstanding shares of
Holdings Common Stock ( % if the overallotment option is exercised in full).
See 'Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners'. In addition, MS&Co. owns
approximately $ million aggregate principal amount of the 1993 Notes,
approximately $ million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Subordinated
Notes, approximately $ million aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated
Debentures and approximately $ million aggregate principal amount of the Junior
Accrual Debentures.

The provisions of Schedule E ('Schedule E') to the By-laws of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the 'NASD') apply to the Debt
Offerings. Under the By-laws of the NASD, when a NASD member such as the
Underwriter distributes an affiliated company's debt securities that are rated
below investment grade, the yield on such debt securities can be no lower than
that recommended by a 'qualified independent underwriter.' The NASD requires
that the 'qualified independent underwriter' (i) be an NASD member experienced
in the securities or investment banking business, (ii) not be an affiliate of
the issuer of the securities and (iii) agree to undertake the responsibilities
and liabilities of an underwriter under the Securities Act. In accordance with
this requirement, is serving in such
role, and the yield to maturity on the Senior Notes will not be lower than
's recommended yield to maturity. also participated in the
preparation of the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is a part and
has performed due diligence with respect thereto. The Company has agreed to pay
a fee of $ in connection with the Debt Offerings and to reimburse
for certain expenses. The Company has also agreed to indemnify
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
Act.

Pursuant to the provisions of Schedule E, NASD members may not execute
transactions in the Senior Notes to any accounts over which they exercise
discretionary authority without prior written approval of the customer.

The Company has been advised by the Underwriter that it presently intends
to make a market in the Senior Notes, as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations. The Underwriter is not obligated to make a market in the Senior
Notes and any such market-making may be discontinued at any time at the sole
discretion of the Underwriter. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the
liquidity of, or trading market for, the Senior Notes.

From time to time MS&Co. has provided, and continues to provide, investment
banking services to Holdings, the Company and its affiliates. See 'Certain
Transactions'.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
JEFFERSON SMURFIT CORPORATION (U.S.)
(formerly Jefferson Smurfit Corporation)

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jefferson
Smurfit Corporation (U.S.) (formerly Jefferson Smurfit Corporation) as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholder's deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1993. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 16(b) of the Registration
Statement. These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Jefferson
Smurfit Corporation (U.S.) at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As described in Note 6 and Note 7 to the financial statements, in 1993, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and postretirement
benefits.

JEFFERSON SMURFIT CORPORATION (U.S.)
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993
(TABULAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS)

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (U.S.) (formerly Jefferson Smurfit
Corporation) hereinafter referred to as the 'Company' is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (formerly SIBV/MS Holdings, Inc.),
hereinafter referred to as 'Holdings'. Fifty percent of the voting stock of
Holdings is owned by Smurfit Packaging Corporation ('SPC') and Smurfit Holdings
B.V. ('SHBV'), indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Jefferson Smurfit Group plc
('JS Group'), a public corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of
Ireland. The remaining 50% is owned by The Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund
II, L.P. ('MSLEF II'). Holdings has no operations other than its investment in
JSC. In December 1989, pursuant to a series of transactions referred to
hereafter as the '1989 Recapitalization', Holdings acquired the entire equity
interest in JSC. Concurrently with Holdings' acquisition of JSC, Container
Corporation of America ('CCA') acquired its common equity interest not owned by
JSC. Prior to the 1989 Recapitalization, Smurfit International B.V. ('SIBV'), an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of JS Group, owned 78% of JSC's outstanding
common equity, the public owned the remaining common equity of JSC and JSC
indirectly owned 50% of the common stock and 100% of the preferred stock of CCA.
The remaining 50% of the common stock of CCA was owned by The Morgan Stanley
Leveraged Equity Fund, L.P. and other investors ('MSLEF I Group'). Both MSLEF II
and MSLEF I Group are affiliates of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated
('MS&Co.').

For financial accounting purposes, the 1989 acquisition by CCA of its
common equity owned by MSLEF I Group and the purchase of the JSC common equity
owned by SIBV were accounted for as purchases of treasury stock, resulting in a
deficit balance in stockholder's equity in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. The acquisition of JSC's minority interest, representing
approximately 22% of JSC's common equity, was accounted for as a purchase.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Significant
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At
December 31, 1993 cash and cash equivalents of $42.9 million are maintained as
collateral for obligations under the accounts receivable securitization program
(see Note 5).

Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized at the time products are
shipped.

Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market,
principally under the last-in, first-out ('LIFO') method except for $50.6
million in 1993 and $51.9 million in 1992 which are valued at the lower of
average cost or market. First-in, first-out costs (which approximate replacement
costs) exceed the LIFO value by $44.7 million and $46.3 million at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are carried at
cost. Provisions for depreciation and amortization are made using straight-line
rates over the estimated useful lives of the related assets and the terms of the
applicable leases for leasehold improvements.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its estimate of the useful
lives of certain machinery and equipment. Based upon historical experience and
comparable industry practice, the depreciable lives of the papermill machines
that previously ranged from 16 to 20 years were increased to an average of 23
years, while major converting equipment and folding carton presses that
previously averaged 12 years were increased to an average of 20 years. These
changes were made to better reflect the estimated periods during which such
assets will remain in service. These changes had the effect of reducing
depreciation expense by $17.8 million and decreasing net loss by $11.0 million
in 1993.

JEFFERSON SMURFIT CORPORATION (U.S.)
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
DECEMBER 31, 1993
(TABULAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS)

Timberland: The portion of the costs of timberland attributed to standing
timber is charged against income as timber is cut, at rates determined annually,
based on the relationship of unamortized timber costs to the estimated volume of
recoverable timber. The costs of seedlings and reforestation of timberland are
capitalized.

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs: Deferred debt issuance costs are amortized
over the terms of the respective debt obligations using the interest method.

Goodwill: The excess of cost over the fair value assigned to the net assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill and is being amortized using the straight-line
method over 40 years.

Income Taxes: The taxable income of the Company is included in the
consolidated federal income tax return filed by Holdings. The Company's income
tax provisions are computed on a separate return basis. State income tax returns
are filed on a separate return basis. Effective January 1, 1993, the Company
changed its method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to
the liability method required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
('SFAS') No. 109, 'Accounting for Income Taxes' (see Note 6).

Interest Rate Swap Agreements: The Company enters into interest rate swap
agreements which involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest
payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount. The
differential to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change and is
recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense.

Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications of prior year presentations
have been made to conform to the 1993 presentation.

3. INVESTMENTS

Equity in loss of affiliates of $39.9 million in 1991, which is net of
deferred income tax benefits of $18.5 million, includes the Company's (i)
write-off of its equity investment in Temboard, Inc., formerly Temboard and
Company Limited Partnership ('Temboard'), totalling $29.3 million, (ii)
write-off of its remaining equity investment in PCL Industries Limited ('PCL')
totaling $6.7 million, and (iii) proportionate share of the net loss of equity
affiliates, including PCL prior to the write-off of that investment, totaling
$3.9 million.

4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

TRANSACTIONS WITH JS GROUP

Transactions with JS Group, its subsidiaries and affiliates were as

(TABULAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS)

Product sales to and purchases from JS Group, its subsidiaries, and
affiliates are consummated on terms generally similar to those prevailing with
unrelated parties.

The Company provides certain subsidiaries and affiliates of JS Group with
general management and elective management services under separate Management
Services Agreements. In consideration for general management services, the
Company is paid a fee up to 2% of the subsidiaries' or affiliate's gross sales.
In consideration for elective services, the Company is reimbursed for its direct
cost of providing such services.

In October 1991 an affiliate of JS Group completed a rebuild of the No. 2
paperboard machine owned by the affiliate that is located in CCA's Fernandina
Beach, Florida paperboard mill (the 'Fernandina Mill'). Pursuant to an operating
agreement between CCA and the affiliate, the affiliate engaged CCA to operate
and manage the No. 2 paperboard machine. As compensation to CCA for its services
the affiliate reimburses CCA for production and manufacturing costs directly
attributable to the No. 2 paperboard machine and pays CCA a portion of the
indirect manufacturing, selling and administrative costs incurred by CCA for the
entire Fernandina Mill. The compensation is determined by applying various
formulas and agreed upon amounts to the subject costs. The amounts reimbursed to
CCA are reflected as reductions of cost of goods sold and selling and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

TRANSACTIONS WITH TIMES MIRROR

Under the terms of a long-term agreement, Smurfit Newsprint Corporation
('SNC'), a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, supplies newsprint to Times
Mirror, a minority shareholder of SNC, at amounts which approximate prevailing
market prices. The obligations of the Company and Times Mirror to supply and
purchase newsprint, respectively, are wholly or partially terminable upon the
occurrence of certain defined events. Sales to Times Mirror for 1993, 1992 and
1991 were $115.2 million, $114.0 million and $150.6 million, respectively.

</TABLE>

Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 1993, for the
next five years are $10.3 million in 1994, $220.6 million in 1995, $379.8
million in 1996, $431.5 million in 1997, and $273.0 million in 1998. In
addition, approximately $77.7 million in accrued interest related to the Junior
Subordinated Accrual Debentures (the 'Junior Accrual Debentures') becomes due in
1994. Accrued interest of approximately $58.9 million is classified as long-term
debt in the accompanying financial statements because it is the Company's
intention to refinance the Junior Accrual Debentures in December 1994 with the
proceeds from its $200 million commitment from SIBV described below.

1992 TERM LOAN

In August 1992, the Company repurchased $193.5 million of Junior Accrual
Debentures, and repaid $19.1 million of the Subordinated Note and $400 million
of the 1989 term loan facility ('1989 Term Loan'). The proceeds from a $231.8
million capital contribution by Holdings and a $400 million senior secured term
loan ('1992 Term Loan') were used to repurchase the Junior Accrual Debentures
and repay the loans. Premiums paid in connection with this transaction, the
write-off of related deferred debt issuance costs, and losses on interest rate
swap agreements, totaling $49.8 million (net of income tax benefits of $25.8
million), are reflected in the accompanying 1992 consolidated statement of
operations as an extraordinary loss.

Outstanding loans under the 1992 Term Loan bear interest primarily at rates
for which Eurodollar deposits are offered plus 3% (6.375% at December 31, 1993).
The 1992 Term Loan, which matures on December 31, 1997, may require principal
prepayments before then as defined in the 1992 Term Loan.

1989 TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

The 1989 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ('1989 Credit Agreement')
consists of the 1989 Term Loan and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility
(which expires in 1995) of which up to $125.0 million may consist of letters of
credit. The 1989 Term Loan, which expires in 1997, requires

(TABULAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS)

minimum annual principal reductions, subject to additional reductions if the
Company has excess cash flows or excess cash balances, as defined, or receives
proceeds from certain sales of assets, issuance of equity securities, permitted
indebtedness or any pension fund termination.

Outstanding loans under the 1989 Credit Agreement bear interest primarily
at rates for which Eurodollar deposits are offered plus 2.25%. The weighted
average interest rate at December 31, 1993 on outstanding Credit Agreement
borrowings was 5.95%. A commitment fee of 1/2 of 1% per annum is assessed on the
unused portion of the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 1993, the
unused portion of the revolving credit facility, after giving consideration to
outstanding letters of credit, was $112.1 million.

SENIOR SECURED NOTES

The Senior Secured Notes due in 1998 may be prepaid at any time. Mandatory
prepayment is required from a pro rata portion of net cash proceeds of certain
sales of assets or additional borrowings. The Senior Secured Notes bear interest
at rates for which three month Eurodollar deposits are offered plus 2.75% (6.25%
at December 31, 1993).

Obligations under the 1992 Term Loan, the 1989 Credit Agreement, and the
Senior Secured Notes Agreement share pro rata in certain mandatory prepayments
and the collateral and guarantees that secure these obligations. These
obligations are secured by the common stock of JSC and CCA and substantially all
of their assets, with the exception of cash and cash equivalents and trade
receivables, and are guaranteed by the Company. These agreements contain various
business and financial covenants including, among other things, (i) limitations
on the incurrence of indebtedness; (ii) limitations on capital expenditures;
(iii) restrictions on paying dividends, except for dividends paid by SNC; (iv)
maintenance of minimum interest coverage ratios; and (v) maintenance of
quarterly and annual cash flows, as defined.

In anticipation of violation of certain financial covenants at September
30, 1993, in connection with its 1992 Term Loan, 1989 Credit Agreement and the
Senior Secured Notes, the Company requested and received waivers from its lender
group. In addition, the Company's credit facilities were amended in December
1993, to modify financial covenants that had become too restrictive due to
continued pricing weakness in the paper industry. The Company complied with the
amended covenants at December 31, 1993.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION PROGRAM LOANS

The $230.0 million accounts receivable securitization program
('Securitization Program') provides for the sale of certain of the Company's
trade receivables to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote, limited purpose
subsidiary, Jefferson Smurfit Finance Corporation ('JS Finance'), which finances
its purchases of the receivables, through borrowings from a limited purpose
finance company (the 'Issuer') unaffiliated with the Company. The Issuer, which
is restricted to making loans to JS Finance, issued $95.0 million in fixed rate
term notes, issued $13.8 million under a subordinated loan, and may issue up to
$121.2 million in trade receivables backed commercial paper or obtain up to
$121.2 million under a revolving liquidity facility to fund loans to JS Finance.
At December 31, 1993, $47.1 million was available for additional borrowing.
Borrowings under the Securitization Program, which expires April 1996, have been
classified as long-term debt because of the Company's intent to refinance this
debt on a long-term basis and the availability of such financing under the terms
of the program.

At December 31, 1993, all assets of JS Finance, principally cash and cash
equivalents of $42.9 million and trade receivables of $173.8 million, are
pledged as collateral for obligations of JS Finance to the Issuer. Interest
rates on borrowings under this program are at a fixed rate of 9.56% for $95.0
million of the borrowings and at a variable rate on the remainder (3.94% at
December 31, 1993).

SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES

In April 1993, CCA issued $500.0 million of 9.75% Senior Unsecured Notes
due 2003 which are unconditionally guaranteed by JSC. Net proceeds from the
offering were used to repay: $100.0 million outstanding under the revolving
credit facility, $196.5 million outstanding under the 1989 Term Loan, and $191.0
million outstanding under the 1992 Term Loan. The write-off of related deferred
debt issuance costs and losses on interest rate swap agreements, totalling $37.8
million (net of income tax benefits of $21.7 million), are reflected in the
accompanying 1993 consolidated statement of operations as an extraordinary item.

In connection with the issuance of the Senior Unsecured Notes, the Company
entered into an agreement with SIBV whereby SIBV committed to purchase up to
$200 million of 11.5% Junior Subordinated Notes to be issued by the Company
maturing December 1, 2005. From time to time until December 31, 1994, the
Company, at their option, may issue the Junior Subordinated Notes, the proceeds
of which must be used to repurchase or otherwise retire subordinated debt. The
Company is obligated to pay SIBV for letter of credit fees incurred by SIBV in
connection with this commitment in addition to an annual commitment fee of
1.375% on the undrawn principal amount (See Note 4).

The Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2003, which are not redeemable
prior to maturity, rank pari passu with the 1992 Term Loan, the 1989 Credit
Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Unsecured Note Agreement
contains business and financial covenants which are substantially less
restrictive than those contained in the 1992 Term Loan, the 1989 Credit
Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Agreement.

OTHER NON-SUBORDINATED DEBT

Other non-subordinated long-term debt at December 31, 1993, is payable in
varying installments through the year 2004. Interest rates on these obligations
averaged approximately 9.76 % at December 31, 1993.

SUBORDINATED DEBT

The Senior Subordinated Notes, Subordinated Debentures and Junior Accrual
Debentures are unsecured obligations of CCA and are unconditionally guaranteed
on a senior subordinated, subordinated and junior subordinated basis,
respectively, by JSC. Semi-annual interest payments are required on the Senior
Subordinated Notes, and Subordinated Debentures. Interest on the Junior Accrual
Debentures accrues and compounds on a semi-annual basis until December 1, 1994
at which time accrued interest is payable. Thereafter, interest on the Junior
Accrual Debentures will be payable semi-annually.

The Senior Subordinated Notes are redeemable at CCA's option beginning
December 1, 1994 with premiums of 6.75% and 3.375% of the principal amount if
redeemed during the 12-month periods commencing December 1, 1994 and 1995,
respectively. The payment of principal and interest is subordinated to the prior
payment, when due, of all senior indebtedness, as defined.

The Subordinated Debentures are redeemable at CCA's option beginning
December 1, 1994 with premiums of 7% and 3.5% of the principal amount if
redeemed during the 12-month periods commencing December 1, 1994 and 1995,
respectively. The payment of principal and interest is subordinated to the prior
payment, when due, of all senior indebtedness, as defined, and the Senior
Subordinated Notes. Sinking fund payments to retire 33 1/3% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated Debentures are required on each
of December 15, 1999 and 2000.

The Junior Accrual Debentures are redeemable at CCA's option beginning
December 1, 1994 at 100% of the principal amount. The payment of principal and
interest is subordinated to the prior

payment, when due, of all senior indebtedness, as defined, the Senior
Subordinated Notes and the Subordinated Debentures. Sinking fund payments to
retire 33 1/3% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Junior Accrual
Debentures are required on each of December 1, 2002 and 2003.

Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes, Subordinated Debentures, and
Junior Accrual Debentures have the right, subject to certain limitations, to
require the Company to repurchase their securities at 101% of the principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a change of
control or in certain events from proceeds of major asset sales, as defined. The
Senior Subordinated Notes, Subordinated Debentures and Junior Accrual Debentures
contain various business and financial covenants which are less restrictive than
those contained in the 1992 Term Loan, the 1989 Credit Agreement and the Senior
Secured Notes Agreement.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS

At December 31, 1993, the Company has interest rate swap and other hedging
agreements with commercial banks which effectively fix (for remaining periods up
to 3 years) the Company's interest rate on $215 million of variable rate
borrowings at average all-in rates of approximately 9.1%. At December 31, 1993,
the Company had $435 million of swap commitments outstanding which were marked
to market in April 1993. The Company also has outstanding interest rate swap
agreements related to the Securitization Program that effectively convert $95.0
million of fixed rate borrowings to a variable rate (5.6% at December 31, 1993)
through December 1995, and convert $80.0 million of variable rate borrowings to
a fixed rate of 7.2% through January 1996. In addition, the Company is party to
interest rate swap agreements related to the Senior Unsecured Notes which
effectively converts $500.0 million of fixed rate borrowings to a variable rate
(8.6% at December 31, 1993) maturing at various dates through May 1995. The
Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other
parties to the interest rate swap agreements. However, the Company does not
anticipate non-performance by the counter parties.

Interest costs capitalized on construction projects in 1993, 1992 and 1991
totalled $3.4 million, $4.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Interest
payments on all debt instruments for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were $226.2 million,
$257.6 million and $273.1 million, respectively.

6. INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by SFAS
No. 109, 'Accounting for Income Taxes'. As permitted under the new rules, prior
years' financial statements have not been restated.

The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 as of January 1, 1993 was to
increase net income by $20.5 million. For 1993, application of SFAS No. 109
increased the pretax loss by $14.5 million because of increased depreciation
expense as a result of the requirement to report assets acquired in prior
business combinations at pretax amounts.

In adopting this new accounting principle, the Company (i) adjusted assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in prior business combinations from their
net-of-tax amounts to their pre-tax amounts and recognized the related deferred
tax assets and liabilities for those temporary differences, (ii) adjusted
deferred income tax assets and liabilities to statutory income tax rates and for
previously unrecognized tax benefits related to certain state net operating loss
carryforwards and, (iii) adjusted asset and liability accounts arising from the
1986 acquisition and the 1989 Recapitalization to recognize potential tax
liabilities related to those transactions. The net effect of these adjustments
on assets and liabilities was to increase inventory $23.0 million, increase
property, plant and equipment and timberlands $196.5 million, increase goodwill
$42.0 million, increase liabilities by $12.6 million, and increase deferred
income taxes by $228.4 million.

7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION PLANS

The Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all employees not covered by multi-employer plans. Plans that
cover salaried and management employees provide pension benefits that are based
on the employee's five highest consecutive calendar years' compensation during
the last ten years of service. Plans covering non-salaried employees generally
provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. These plans provide
reduced benefits for early retirement. The Company's funding policy is to make
minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations. The Company
also participates in several multi-employer pension plans, which provide defined
benefits to certain union employees.

In order to minimize significant year-to-year fluctuations in pension cost
caused by financial market volatility, the Company changed, effective as of
January 1, 1993 the method of accounting used for determining the market-related
value of plan assets. The method changed from a fair market value to a
calculated value that recognizes all changes in a systematic manner over a
period not to exceed four years and eliminates the use of a corridor approach
for amoritizing gains and losses. The effect of this change on 1993 results of
operations, including the cumulative effect of prior years, was not material.

Assumptions used in the accounting for the defined benefit plans were:

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS

The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for
all salaried and certain hourly employees. The Company has various plans under
which the cost may be borne either by the Company, the employee or partially by
each party. The Company does not currently fund these plans. These benefits are
discretionary and are not a commitment to long-term benefit payments. The plans
were amended effective January 1, 1993 to allow employees who retire on or after
January 1, 1994 to become eligible for these benefits only if they retire after
age 60 while working for the Company.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, 'Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions', which requires
companies to accrue the expected cost of retiree benefit payments, other than
pensions, during employees' active service period. The Company elected to
immediately recognize the accumulated liability, measured as of January 1, 1993.
The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle resulted in a
charge of $37.0 million (net of income tax benefits of $21.9 million). The
Company had previously recorded an obligation of $36.0 million in connection
with prior business combinations. The net periodic postretirement benefit cost
for 1993 was $9.8 million. In 1992 and 1991, the cost of the postretirement
benefits was recognized as claims were paid and was $6.4 million and $5.3
million, respectively.

Service cost of benefits earned............................................ $ 1.5
Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation............. 8.3
------
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost................................... $ 9.8
------

</TABLE>

A weighted-average discount rate of 7.6% was used in determining the APBO
at December 31, 1993. The weighted-average annual assumed rate of increase in
the per capita cost of covered benefits ('healthcare cost trend rate') was 11%,
with an annual decline of 1% until the rate reaches 5%. The effect of a 1%
increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would increase both APBO as
of December 31, 1993 by $5.7 million and the annual net periodic postretirement
benefit cost for 1993 by $.8 million.

1992 STOCK OPTION PLAN

Effective August 26, 1992, Holdings adopted the Holdings 1992 Stock 
Option Plan (the 'Plan') which replaced the 1990 Long-Term Management Incentive
Plan. Under the Plan, selected employees of Holdings and its affiliates and 
subsidiaries are granted non-qualified stock options, up to a maximum of 
603,656 shares, to acquire shares of common stock of Holdings. The stock 
options are exercisable at a price equal to the fair market value, as 
defined, of the common stock of Holdings on the date of grant. The options vest
pursuant to the schedule set forth for each option and expire upon the 
earlier of twelve years from the date of grant or termination of employment.
The stock options become exercisable upon the earlier of the occurrence of 
certain trigger dates, as defined, or eleven years from the date of grant.
Options for 494,215 and 502,645 shares, were outstanding at December 31, 
1993 and 1992, respectively at an exercise price of $100.00, none of which 
were exercisable.

8. LEASES

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment for production, selling
and administrative purposes under operating leases. Future minimum lease
payments at December 31, 1993, required under operating leases that have initial
or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are $30.3 million
in 1994, $22.5 million in 1995, $15.5 million in 1996, $11.3 million in 1997,
$8.3 million in 1998 and $19.1 million thereafter.

Net rental expense was $45.0 million, $42.2 million, and $38.7 million for
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

9. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as
follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
DECEMBER 31,
--------------------------------------------
1993 1992
-------------------- --------------------
CARRYING FAIR CARRYING FAIR
AMOUNT VALUE AMOUNT VALUE

Long-term debt, including current maturities....................... 2,629.4 2,686.4 2,535.4 2,540.4
Gain (loss) on interest rate swap agreements....................... (3.9) (35.5)
</TABLE>

The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximate fair value because of
the short maturity of those instruments. The fair value of the Company's
long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the
same remaining maturities. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements
is the estimated amount the Company would pay, net of accrued interest expense,
to terminate the agreements at December 31, 1993, taking into account current
interest rates and the current credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.

10. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

In September 1993, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $150 million to
recognize the effects of a restructuring program designed to improve the
Company's long-term competitive position and future profitability and to provide
for environmental and other matters. Charges related to the restructuring
program consist of approximately $96 million of expenses associated with plant
closures, reductions in workforce, realignment and consolidation of various
manufacturing operations and write-downs of nonproductive assets. The charge
also includes a provision of $54 million related primarily to environmental
remediation costs associated with plant closures, and existing and former
operating sites. See Restructuring and Other Charges section of Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Operation.

11. CONTINGENCIES

The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and claims arising out
of the conduct of its business. While the ultimate results of such suits or
other proceedings against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, the
management of the Company believes that resolution of these matters will not
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or
results of operation.

12. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company's business segments are paperboard/packaging products and
newsprint. Substantially all the Company's operations are in the United States.
The Company's customers represent a diverse range of industries including
paperboard and paperboard packaging, consumer products, wholesale trade,
retailing agri-business, and newspaper publishing located throughout the United
States. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer's financial
condition. The paperboard/packaging products segment includes the manufacture
and distribution of containerboard, boxboard and cylinderboard, corrugated
containers, folding cartons, fibre partitions, spiral cores and tubes, labels
and flexible packaging. A summary by business segment of net sales, operating
profit, identifiable assets, capital expenditures and depreciation, depletion
and amortization follows:

ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 ('Securities Act') may be permitted to directors, officers and
controlling persons of the Co-Registrants pursuant to the foregoing provisions,
or otherwise, the Co-Registrants have been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy
as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the
event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the
payment by the Co-Registrants of expenses incurred or paid by a director,
officer or controlling person of the Co-Registrants in the successful defense of
any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the
Co-Registrants will, unless in the opinion of their counsel the matter has been
settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
the question whether such indemnification by them is against public policy as
expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication
of such issue.

The Co-Registrants hereby undertake:

(1) That for purposes of determining any liability under the
Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed
as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and
contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Co-Registrants pursuant to
Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to
be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared
effective.

(2) That for the purpose of determining any liability under the
Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of
prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to
the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that
time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

(3) (a) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being
made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement;

(i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of
the Securities Act;

(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising
after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most
recent post-effective amendment thereof) which,

II-3

<PAGE>
individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in
the information set forth in the registration statement;

(iii) To include any material information with respect to the
plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration
statement or any material change to such information in the
registration statement.

(b) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the
Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be
a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein,
and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be
the initial bona fide offering thereof.

(c) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective
amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at
the termination of the offering.

(d) If the Co-Registrant is a foreign private issuer, to file a
post-effective amendment to the registration statement to include any
financial statements required by Rule 3-19 of Regulation S-X at the
start of any delayed offering or throughout a continuous offering.
