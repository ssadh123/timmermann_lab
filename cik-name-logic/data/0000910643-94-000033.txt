Item 2. Acquisition and Disposition of Assets

Since the last Form 8-K filed by New Plan Realty Trust (the
"Company") dated July 14, 1994, the Company has made the
following acquisitions, each of which occurred on July 25, 1994:

The Company acquired The Pines Apartments, located in
Clarksville, Indiana, from HEBCO, a partnership. The Pines
Apartments is a residential apartment complex consisting of 224
apartment units on approximately 10.5 acres. The Pines
Apartments is currently 95.5% occupied.

The Company acquired Cedar Village Apartments, also located
in Clarksville, Indiana, from HEBCO. Cedar Village Apartments is
a residential apartment complex consisting of 170 apartment units
on approximately 10.7 acres. Cedar Village Apartments is
currently 91.6% occupied.

The Company acquired Paddock Place Apartments, also located
in Clarksville, Indiana, from HEBCO. Paddock Place Apartments is
a residential apartment complex consisting of 240 apartment units
on approximately 10.7 acres. Paddock Place Apartments is
currently 98.8% occupied.

Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Statements and
Exhibits.

(a) and (b) Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired
and Pro Forma Financial Information.

The aggregate purchase price of the three acquired
properties (collectively, the "Properties") described in Item 2
above was approximately $15,310,000 million, all of which was
paid by the Company in cash. The purchase price of the
Properties, individually and in the aggregate, represents less
than 10% of the total unaudited assets of the Company.

However, because the Properties when added to prior
unaudited acquisitions exceeds 10% of the unaudited assets of the
Company, audited statements of revenues and certain operating
expenses relative to the Properties and pro forma condensed
financial information reflecting the acquisition of the
Properties will be filed under cover of Form 8-K/A as soon as
practicable, but not later than 60 days after this report on Form
8-K.

(c) Exhibits

None
