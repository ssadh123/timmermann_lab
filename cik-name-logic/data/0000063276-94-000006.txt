MATTEL, INC.
8% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES DUE 2001
Issued under Indenture dated as of March 15, 1991

Redemption Date: March 15, 1994
--------------------------------

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN pursuant to Section 3.03 of Article Three of the
above-mentioned Indenture that MATTEL, INC. (the "Company") has called for
redemption on March 15, 1994 the entire outstanding principal amount of the
Company's 8% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2001 (the "Debentures"),
at a redemption price of 104.571% of the principal amount thereof. Interest
in respect of the last semiannual interest period preceding redemption will be
paid on March 15, 1994 to holders of record on March 1, 1994.

Debentures called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent set
forth below together with the enclosed Letter of Transmittal & Redemption Form
duly completed to collect the redemption price. Additional information,
including important tax information, is set forth on the reverse side of the
Letter of Transmittal & Redemption Form.

Holders may also elect to convert Debentures into Common Stock of the Company
at a conversion price of $12.83 per share by presenting such Debentures to the
Conversion Agent set forth below at any time prior to the close of business on
March 15, 1994. As provided in the Debentures and the Indenture, and as
previously disclosed by letter to holders of the Debentures dated June 11, 1993
and in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 14, 1993, holders
who surrender their Debentures for conversion on or subsequent to March 1, 1994
and on or prior to March 15, 1994 will be required to deliver to the
Conversion Agent (on behalf of the Company) the amount of funds which is equal
to the interest falling due on March 15, 1994. Converting holders must also
complete the Conversion Notice on the reverse of the Debentures and satisfy the
other requirements contained in Paragraph 7 of the Debentures.

On March 15, 1994, the principal amount of the Debentures will become due and
payable at 104.571% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued
interest to March 15, 1994. Unless the Company defaults in making the
redemption payment, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to

Paying Agent of the Debentures redeemed.
