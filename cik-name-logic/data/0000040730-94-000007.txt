ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On June 6, 1994, two news releases were issued on the subject of
EDS-Sprint discussions. The content of the news releases was as follows:

Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and Sprint announced today that, in their
ongoing discussions, the companies are no longer considering a merger of
equals but are continuing to explore other forms of a strategic relationship.
The companies said they have been unable to reach agreement with respect to
the financial terms of a merger transaction.

This announcement follows a May 16 disclosure that the two companies had
been engaged in broad discussions, which included a possible merger of equals,
but that "significant issues, including relative values" remained to be
resolved.

EDS Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Les Alberthal and Sprint
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William T. Esrey said the two companies
continue to believe that convergence of their industries will create
tremendous opportunities.

"We have been in discussions concerning how to best integrate these
converging functions for the benefit of our customers," said Messrs. Esrey and
Alberthal. "Part of those discussions involved exploring a merger of equals.
That option is no longer being discussed, but there may be other ways we can
work together to achieve strategic objectives."

General Motors stated today that it would continue to consider a spin-
off of EDS to Class E shareholders to facilitate EDS' ability to attain its
strategic objectives. Such a spin-off could occur through an exchange of EDS
common stock for Class E stock and would be proposed only in a transaction
that is tax-free.
