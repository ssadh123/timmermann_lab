FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SCHERER REPORTS SALES AND EARNINGS FOR THE 
FOURTH QUARTER AND THE FULL FISCAL YEAR 1994 
COMPANY ANNOUNCES ANTICIPATED LITIGATION SETTLEMENT
AND PLANNED AUSTRALIAN PLANT RELOCATION

TROY, MI, May 18, 1994 ... R.P. Scherer Corporation announced today sales and
earnings for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 1994, ended March 31.

FOURTH QUARTER

SALES

Sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 were $120.8 million, representing
an increase of 22% over the same period a year ago. In constant exchange
rates, the sales increase was 25%, reflecting the continued strength of the
U.S. dollar. The Company's U.S. operations experienced a sales increase of 34%
during this period, while European operations' local currency sales grew at
27%. The Company's German subsidiary's sales, which were adversely impacted by
changes in health care regulations for the prior year fourth quarter, grew 20%
in local currency compared to a year ago. Revenues contributed by Pharmagel,
acquired last July, totaled $4.1 million for this year's fourth quarter.

OPERATING EARNINGS

In the fourth quarter, the Company earned operating income of $25.2 million
before special charges of $4.5 million for an anticipated litigation settlement
and planned relocation of a production facility discussed below, an increase of
26% from operating income of a year ago. If measured in constant exchange
rates, operating income would have increased 27%. Operating income in Germany,
as measured in local currency, increased by 50%, while the subsidiary's backlog
was up 24% over the prior year. Operating margin before R&D expense and the
special charges improved to 23.9% in this year's fourth quarter, compared to
23.1% for the same quarter last year.

In the fourth quarter, the Company succeeded in containing selling and
administrative expenses to only 14% of sales, compared to 15% in the same
period a year ago. Excluding Pharmagel, SG&A would have increased only 3% in
the fourth quarter versus the same period a year ago.

In commenting on these results, the Company spokesman said: "We are pleased
with the strong performance shown in the fourth quarter by nearly all of our
operating units. We are particularly encouraged by the continued operating
improvement at our German affiliate. The record high backlogs provide reason
for optimism for continued growth in the next fiscal year."

ANTICIPATED LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AND PLANNED AUSTRALIAN PLANT RELOCATION

The fourth quarter operating results of the Company were adversely impacted by
a $4.5 million pre-tax charge for the accrual of a proposed settlement for Paco
Development Partners (PDP II) litigation, which has been outstanding since
1990, and a decision made by the Company to relocate its Australian plant
operations.

The Company has reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs in the
PDP II litigation, and is in the process of formalizing that agreement and
seeking all the necessary approvals. The Company recognized
<PAGE> 4
during the fourth quarter the anticipated amount of settlement costs in excess
of previously provided reserves. In addition, during the fourth quarter, the
Company finalized its plans for the modernization and expansion of its
Australian manufacturing facility. The Company has purchased a new facility
and recognized as a charge to operations the costs it expects to incur on
disposal of its existing facility and land.

NET INCOME

In March 1994, the Company completed the renegotiation of its bank credit
facility and recognized an extraordinary loss of $0.3 million, or $.01 per
share, which represents the after-tax effect of the write-off of unamortized
deferred financing fees related to the former agreement.

Net income for the quarter of $6.5 million or $.41 per share, before the
special charges for the anticipated litigation settlement and planned
relocation of a production facility and the extraordinary loss from debt
extinguishment, represents an increase of 32% over net earnings of $.31 per
share for the same quarter last year.

FULL FISCAL YEAR RESULTS

SALES AND BACKLOG

Consolidated sales for the year were $449.3 million, an increase of 13% over
the previous year. Adjusted for foreign exchange rate differences between
years, sales grew by 19%. Pharmagel contributed $15.5 million to the sales
increase. Sales backlog worldwide at March 31, 1994 was $136.3 million, up 24%
from $110.2 million at the same time last year. When adjusted for constant
exchange rates, the backlog increased by 26% compared to a year ago and
represents a new record high.

The growth in worldwide sales of its core softgel products was led by the
Company's U.S. operations, with an increase of 37%. European operations'
reported sales gains were 4%, or 14% in constant exchange rates. The growth of
the European segment accelerated in the second half of the fiscal year as
economic conditions stabilized and pharmaceutical sales, which were adversely
affected earlier in the year by changes in health care regulations in Germany,
showed significant improvement.

The Company's Zydis advanced drug delivery technology generated revenues of
$7.8 million, an increase of 64%.

OPERATING INCOME

Operating income for fiscal 1994 was $82.9 million, a decrease of 6% from the
$88.1 million earned last year. Reported income was affected by charges
recorded for an anticipated litigation settlement and planned relocation of the
Australian production facility. Without these charges, operating income would
have been essentially comparable with last year. Research and development
expenses, net of customer reimbursements, increased by 15% to $13.1 million.
This increase reflects continued investment in the development of the Company's
advanced drug delivery systems.

NET INCOME

Income from continuing operations increased 7% to $30.9 million from the $29.0
million a year ago. Prior to recognizing special charges for the anticipated
litigation settlement and the planned relocation of a production facility, the
Company earned $1.40 per share, a 17% increase from $1.20 earned in prior year
on a comparable basis. Including the special charges, the Company generated
earnings from continuing operations of $1.27 per share, compared to $1.20 a
year ago.

In January 1994, the Company defeased all of its currently outstanding 14%
Senior Subordinated Debentures which resulted in an extraordinary loss of $15.5
million, or $.64 per share. The Company issued $100 million Senior Notes at 
6 3/4%, the proceeds of which, together with bank borrowings, funded the
defeasance.

R.P. Scherer Corporation, an international developer and manufacturer of drug
delivery systems, is the world's largest producer of soft gelatin capsules
("softgels"). The Company is currently developing and commercializing advanced
drug delivery systems, including SCHERERSOL(TM), ZYDIS(R) and PULSINCAP(R)
