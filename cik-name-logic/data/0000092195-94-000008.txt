NEWS RELEASE

June 30, 1994

SIGECO, LINCOLN NATURAL GAS MERGER TRANSACTION COMPLETED

A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company,
Spencer Energy Corp., is merging with and into Lincoln Natural Gas Company,
Inc., of Rockport, Indiana. This merger was completed on June 30, 1994,
with the final approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

As a result of the merger, Lincoln Natural Gas Company will continue to
operate as a separate subsidiary of Southern Indiana Gas and Electric
Company. Many benefits will result from the closer relationship of the two
companies, especially for the more than 1300 customers of Lincoln Natural
Gas Company in the city of Rockport and surrounding area in southwestern
Indiana, most of whom are also electric customers of SIGECO.

Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company distributes and transports
natural gas to over 100,000 customers in ten counties in southwestern
Indiana, and generates and distributes electricity to over 117,000
customers in the area.
