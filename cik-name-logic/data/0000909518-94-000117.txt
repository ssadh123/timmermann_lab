Item 5. Other Events.
-----------------

On June 30, 1994, National Intergroup, Inc. (the
"Registrant") and FoxMeyer Corporation, its 80.5% owned
subsidiary ("FoxMeyer"), entered into a definitive merger
agreement (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which FoxMeyer
will be merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Registrant (the "Proposed Merger") and become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Registrant. Under the terms of the Merger
Agreement, public stockholders of FoxMeyer will receive 0.90
shares of common stock of the Registrant ("NII Common Stock") for
each share of common stock of FoxMeyer (the "Exchange Ratio") in
a tax-free reorganization transaction. The Exchange Ratio is
subject to upward adjustment, based on the average price of NII
Common Stock during a 20-day period preceding the meeting of
stockholders that will be held to approve the Proposed Merger
(the "Stockholder's Meeting"), so that FoxMeyer's stockholders
will receive, in exchange for each share of FoxMeyer common
stock, NII Common Stock with a value of no less than $14.40 per
share. The Registrant may terminate the transaction if, as the
result of the adjustment, the Exchange Ratio is greater than one
for one.

The Merger Agreement has been approved by the respective
Boards of Directors of the Registrant and FoxMeyer. Consummation
of the Proposed Merger is conditioned upon, among other things,
(i) approval of the transaction by the holders of a majority of
the shares of FoxMeyer's common stock (which is assured since the
Registrant beneficially owns 80.5% of FoxMeyer's outstanding
common stock and has agreed to vote in favor of the Proposed
Merger), (ii) approval of the transaction by a majority of the
shares of NII Common Stock voting at the Stockholder's Meeting
and (iii) the effectiveness of a registration statement to be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to
the shares of NII Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Proposed Merger. 

The Registrant and FoxMeyer also announced that, based on
the Merger Agreement, they have entered into a Memorandum of
Understanding with counsel to the plaintiffs settling nine
Delaware stockholder suits that were filed following the
Registrant's announcement on March 1, 1994 of a prior proposal to
acquire the shares held by the public stockholders of FoxMeyer. 

Attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference is the
press release issued by the Registrant and FoxMeyer in connection
with the execution of the Merger Agreement and a copy of the
Merger Agreement.

NATIONAL INTERGROUP AGREES TO EXCHANGE ITS STOCK FOR
FOXMEYER CORPORATION SHARES HELD BY THE PUBLIC
Agreement Would Make FoxMeyer A Wholly Owned Subsidiary

DALLAS, TEXAS, July 1, 1994--National Intergroup, Inc.
(NYSE:NII) and its 80.5 percent owned subsidiary, FoxMeyer Corporation
(NYSE:FOX), announced today that they have entered into a definitive
merger agreement under which FoxMeyer would become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of National Intergroup. Pursuant to the terms of the
merger agreement, public stockholders of FoxMeyer (other than National
Intergroup) will receive 0.90 shares of National Intergroup common
stock (the "Exchange Ratio") for each share of FoxMeyer common stock
in a tax-free reorganization transaction.

The merger agreement has been approved by the boards of
directors of both National Intergroup and FoxMeyer. In approving the
merger agreement, the FoxMeyer board considered the favorable
recommendation of the special committee of FoxMeyer directors and the
opinion of Smith Barney Inc., the investment banking firm retained by
the FoxMeyer special committee, as to the fairness of the Exchange
Ratio, as adjusted as set forth below, from a financial point of view,
to FoxMeyer's common stockholders, other than National Intergroup and
its affiliates.

Consummation of the merger is conditioned upon, among other
requirements:

- Approval of the transaction by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding FoxMeyer shares, which is
assured, because National Intergroup beneficially owns
80.5 percent of the outstanding FoxMeyer shares and has
agreed to vote such shares in favor of the merger;

- Approval of the transaction by a majority of National
Intergroup's shares of common stock voting on the
merger; and

- The effectiveness of a registration statement to be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission with
respect to the shares of common stock of National
Intergroup that would be issued pursuant to the merger.

NYFS05...:\35\64935\0021\2252\REL70594.S30
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

The Exchange Ratio is subject to upward adjustment, so that
FoxMeyer's stockholders will receive National Intergroup stock with a
value no less than $14.40 per share in exchange for each FoxMeyer
share, based upon the average price of National Intergroup's common
stock during a 20-trading-day period preceding the stockholders'
meeting. National Intergroup has the right to terminate the
transaction if the result of the adjustment is an Exchange Ratio
greater than one share of National Intergroup common stock for one
share of FoxMeyer common stock.

National Intergroup and FoxMeyer also announced that, based
on the definitive merger agreement, they have entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding with counsel to plaintiffs settling
certain Delaware shareholder litigation which was commenced following
National Intergroup's March 1, 1994, announcement of a prior proposal
to acquire the shares held by the public stockholders of FoxMeyer.

The National Intergroup and FoxMeyer boards of directors
have postponed the companies' annual meetings of shareholders so that
the merger can be considered at the annual meeting. Their respective
annual meetings had been originally scheduled for August 10, 1994, in
Dallas, Texas. The annual meetings will be rescheduled after the
joint proxy statement/prospectus is available for mailing to
stockholders; at this time, the companies expect the mailing to take
place in September.

At its annual meeting, National Intergroup's board of
directors expects to recommend changing the corporation's name to
better reflect its expanding focus on the growing health care industry
in the United States and Canada.

FoxMeyer is a leading provider of health care products and
information-based services in the United States and Canada, with sales
of $5.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 1994.

<PAGE>

<PAGE>

Corporations, and the title to any real estate vested by deed or
otherwise, under the laws of the State of Delaware, in any of the
Constituent Corporations, shall not revert or be in any way impaired
by reason of the DGCL; but all rights of creditors and all liens upon
any property of any of the Constituent Corporations shall be preserved
unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the respective
Constituent Corporations shall thenceforth attach to the Surviving
Corporation, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if
said debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by
it. At the election of Parent, any direct wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent may be substituted for Acquisition as a constituent corporation

CONVERSION OF SHARES

SECTION 2.1. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Date,
--------------------
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Acquisition, the Company or the stockholders thereof:

(i) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Date (other than shares held by
Parent or the Company) shall automatically be converted into the right
to receive, and shall be exchanged for, 0.90 Parent Shares (the
"Ratio"); provided, however, that if the product of (x) the Average
-------- -------
Stock Price and (y) the Ratio, is less than $14.40, the Ratio shall be
increased so that the product of

NYFS05...:\35\64935\0001\2252\AGR51094.I9F
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

(x) the Average Stock Price and (y) the Ratio, as so increased, equals
$14.40 (the Ratio, as adjusted, being referred to herein as the
"Exchange Ratio"). The "Average Stock Price" shall mean the average
per share closing price on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") of
Parent Shares during the period of twenty consecutive trading days
commencing twenty-one trading days prior to the date of the
Stockholder Meeting of the Company (the "Meeting Date") and ending on
the second trading day prior to the Meeting Date. The Parent Shares
to be received upon the Merger shall be treasury shares and are
sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Merger Consideration."

(ii) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Date that is (A) owned by Parent or
the Company or (B) held in the treasury of the Company, shall be
cancelled and retired without any payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist, and no Parent Shares or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such shares of Common
Stock.

(iii) Each share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share,
of Acquisition issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Date shall remain unchanged and shall be the common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 2.2. Exchange of Shares. (a) Prior to the
------------------
Effective Date, the Parent shall designate a bank or trust

NYFS05...:\35\64935\0001\2252\AGR51094.I9F
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in connection
with the Merger. On the Effective Date, Parent shall take all steps
necessary to enable and cause the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration as and when certificates for shares of Common Stock are
properly surrendered. Parent Shares into which shares of Common Stock
shall be converted in the Merger shall be deemed to have been issued
as of the Effective Date. No dividends or other distributions
declared after the Effective Date with respect to Parent Shares and
payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Date
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates with
respect to which Parent Shares shall have been issued in the Merger
until such Certificates shall be surrendered for exchange as provided
herein, but (i) upon such surrender there shall be paid, without
interest, to the person in whose name the certificates representing
such Parent Shares shall be issued the amount of dividends theretofore
paid with respect to such Parent Shares as of any record date
subsequent to the Effective Date and the amount of any cash payable to
such person in lieu of fractional Parent Shares pursuant to this
Section 2.2 and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as soon as
practicable thereafter, there shall be paid to such person the amount
of dividends with a record date after the Effective Date but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with

NYFS05...:\35\64935\0001\2252\AGR51094.I9F
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

respect to such Parent Shares, subject in any case to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Date, the Company shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder as of
immediately prior to the Effective Date, and to each holder of an
outstanding certificate or certificates that as of the Effective Date
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the
"Certificates"), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates for payment thereof.

(c) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be requested, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (rounded down
to the nearest whole number of Parent Shares) deliverable in respect
of the shares of Common Stock theretofore evidenced by such
certificate or certificates (together with any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) and such
certificate or certificates shall forthwith be cancelled. Until
surrendered in

NYFS05...:\35\64935\0001\2252\AGR51094.I9F
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2(c), each
Certificate shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, but shall have no other
rights. If a Certificate or Certificates evidencing more than one
share of Common Stock shall be surrendered for exchange as provided in
this Agreement at one time by the same holder, the number of full
Parent Shares and the amount of cash in lieu of fractional Parent
Shares deliverable upon the surrender thereof shall be computed on the
basis of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock so
surrendered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent
nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Common
Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(d) If the Parent Shares are to be delivered to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in
exchange thereof is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment
of such Parent Shares that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and
otherwise in proper form for transfer, that such transfer otherwise be
proper and that the person requesting such transfer pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes payable by reason of the

NYFS05...:\35\64935\0001\2252\AGR51094.I9F
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid.

(e) No certificates representing fractional Parent Shares
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
pursuant to this Section 2.2. No dividend, stock split or other
change in the capital structure of Parent shall be applicable with
respect to any fractional share interest. Such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the holder thereof to vote or to any
rights as a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any fractional
Parent Shares, the Exchange Agent shall, on behalf of all holders of
fractional Parent Shares as soon as practicable after the Effective
Date, aggregate all such fractional interests (collectively, the
"Fractional Shares") and, at Parent's option, such Fractional Shares
shall be purchased by Parent or otherwise sold by the Exchange Agent
as agent for the holders of such Fractional Shares, in either case at
then prevailing price on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), all
in the manner provided in Section 2.2(f). Parent will pay all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs,
including expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in
connection with such sale of the Fractional Shares.

(f) To the extent not purchased by Parent, the sale of the
Fractional Shares by the Exchange Agent will be executed on the NYSE
or through one or more member firms of the NYSE and will

NYFS05...:\35\64935\0001\2252\AGR51094.I9F
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. In either case,
the Exchange Agent will determine the portion, if any, of the net
proceeds of such sale to which each holder of Fractional Shares is
entitled, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds of
the sale of the Fractional Shares, by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount of Fractional Shares to which such holder is
entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
Fractional Shares to which all holders of Fractional Shares are
entitled.

(g) As soon as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Fractional Shares in
lieu of such Fractional Shares, the Exchange Agent will mail such
amounts, without interest, to such holders; provided, however, that no
-------- -------
such amount will be paid to any holder of such Fractional Shares prior
to the surrender by such holder of the Certificates formerly
representing such holder's shares of Common Stock. All cash proceeds
from the sale of Fractional Shares to be paid pursuant to this
Section, if unclaimed at the sixth month anniversary of the Effective
Date, shall be released and paid by the Exchange Agent to Parent,
after which time persons entitled thereto may look only to Parent for
payment thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange
Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable for any cash proceeds
delivered to a

NYFS05...:\35\64935\0001\2252\AGR51094.I9F
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.

(h) Promptly following the date that is six months after
the Effective Date, the Exchange Agent shall return to Parent all
Parent Shares in its possession, and the Exchange Agent's duties shall
terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate formerly
representing a share of Common Stock may surrender such Certificate to
Parent and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration.

(i) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as
determined in accordance with this Article II; provided, however, that
-------- -------
the Board of Directors of Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to give Parent a bond in such
sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

SECTION 2.3. Closing of Transfer Books. After the
-------------------------
Effective Date there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date. If, after the
Effective Date, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Article II. 

SECTION 2.4. Stock Options. At the Effective Date, the
-------------
Company's obligations with respect to each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Common Stock (collectively, the "Stock Options" and
each a "Stock Option") granted pursuant to the Company's Stock Option
and Performance Award Plan (the "Company Stock Option Plan") shall be
assumed by Parent. The Stock Options assumed by Parent shall continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in
the stock option plans and agreements pursuant to which such Stock
Options were issued as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Date, except that (a) the number of shares for which such Stock Option
shall be exercisable shall equal the product of the Exchange Ratio and
the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Date (rounded down to the nearest
whole number), and (b) the per share exercise price for the Parent
Shares issuable upon the exercise of such assumed Stock Option shall
be equal to the aggregate exercise

NYFS05...:\35\64935\0001\2252\AGR51094.I9F
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

price for the shares of Common Stock subject to the Stock Option,
divided by the number of Parent Shares deemed to be purchasable
pursuant to the Option. The date of grant shall be the date on which
the Stock Option was originally granted. Parent shall (i) reserve for
issuance the number of Parent Shares that will become issuable upon
the exercise of such Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.4 and
(ii) at the Effective Date, execute a document evidencing the
assumption by Parent of the Company's obligations with respect thereto
under this Section 2.4. Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall affect the
schedule of the vesting (or the acceleration thereof) with respect to
the Stock Options, in accordance with the terms thereof, to be assumed
by Parent as provided in this Section 2.4.

any action taken by any such person on behalf of the Company),
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring on or prior to the
Effective Date (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to,
or on or after, the Effective Date. In each case such indemnification
shall be to the full extent a corporation is permitted under
applicable law to indemnify its own directors and officers, as the
case may be (and Parent will pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each such director or
officer of the Company seeking indemnification hereunder to the full
extent permitted by law).

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in which

Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or the Surviving Corporation
or any other agreements.

representations and warranties of Parent, Acquisition and the Company
