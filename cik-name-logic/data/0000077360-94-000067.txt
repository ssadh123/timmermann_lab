NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Accounting and valuation methods

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared
using in principle the accounting and valuation methods applied
by Schroff GmbH.

To improve the clarity of presentation, items in the balance
sheet and income statement are combined. They are stated
separately in the Notes.

Where the financial statements of the consolidated foreign
subsidiary companies under local legislation deviate from the
uniform methods, the assets, equity and liabilities concerned
are revalued for inclusion in the consolidated accounts. This
also leads to an adjustment of the income statements, with
corresponding effect on results for the year.

In detail, the following valuation principles are applied:

Intangible assets: purchase cost required to be capitalized
under tax law less scheduled and exceptional depreciation. 
Rapid economic consumption is reflected in the determination
of service life. The derivative goodwill capitalized at Schroff
GmbH is amortized in line with tax provisions.

Tangible assets: purchase or manufacturing cost required to
be capitalized under tax law less scheduled and exceptional
depreciation.

Depreciation methods;

- - - buildings in Germany by the declining-balance method in
diminishing rates, straight-line method for foreign companies,

- - - plant and equipment in Germany and Europe by the declining-
balance method at the highest rates permissible under tax law,

- - - changeover from the declining-balance to the straight-line
method as soon as the latter leads to higher depreciation,

- - - outside Europe the straight-line method of depreciation is
applied.

Opportunities for higher depreciation under tax provisions are
used. Items with a purchase cost of up to DM800 are written
down to zero in the year of purchase. Exceptional depreciation
is charged on tangible assets of expired or diminished
serviceability.

The differences between the depreciation necessary under
commercial law - calculated in the case of scheduled
depreciation by the straight-line method - and the higher
depreciation permissible under tax law are taken as fixed-asset
value adjustments under tax law to special items with an equity
portion. These are released during the service life of the
respective tangible assets.

For shares in affiliated companies the application of the equity
method under Art. 311 para. 2 of the Commercial Code (HGB)
is dispensed with. They are valued at purchase cost.

Loans: nominal value less any required discounting and
writedowns for loss in value.

Inventories: highest purchase or manufacturing cost required
to be capitalized under tax law.

Inventory risks inherent in materials, supplies, merchandise
and finished products as a result of slow inventory
turnover, reduced utility, lower reproduction costs or lower
replacement or selling prices are taken into account.

Apart from order-related direct costs, product
manufacturing cost includes proportional manufacturing
overheads. If the sales revenue of an order fails to cover
the amount capitalized plus all costs still to be expected,
the excess amount is deducted from capitalized cost. If
the excess amount is higher than the capitalized cost an
accrual is set up in the appropriate amount. This ensures
that all inventories are valued without incurring a loss.

For Schroff GmbH an additional downward revaluation was
formed in financial statements II (Handelsbilanz II).

Receivables and miscellaneous assets: purchase cost (nominal
values) less appropriate adjustments for all recognizable risks
and financing costs. A global allowance is deducted for
general risks on receivables. Non-interest-bearing receivables
due after more than one year are discounted to their present
value.

Differences between issue amount and higher repayment
amount of loans are stated as assets under prepaid expense
and deferred charges and written down to schedule over the
respective term of the loan.

Accruals for pension: calculated according to actuarial
principles under Art. 6a of the Income Tax Law (EstG), applying
a discount rate of 6% p.a.

Receivables and liabilities in foreign currency: original
exchange rate or less favourable rate prevailing on the balance
sheet date if they have not been hedged.

The consolidated group

The parent company Schroff GmbH and four foreign
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts.

Not included are three foreign subsidiaries which are not
material for presenting a true and fair view or are dormant (Art.
296 para. 2, Commercial Code).

The consolidated group remains unchanged against the
previous year. 

Consolidation principles

In consolidating subsidiaries the revaluation method specified
under Art. 301 para. 1 No. 2, Commercial Code, is applied.

The differences arising from capital consolidation are netted
with equity.

Receivables and liabilities between consolidated companies are
eliminated. Sales revenue and other income from supplies and
services between companies included in the consolidated
financial statements are netted with related expense, to the
extent that they are not to be stated as company-produced
additions to fixed assets. Inter-company results are eliminated.

Currency translation

In translating the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries into
DM, the rate of exchange on the balance-sheet date is used. 

Differences were taken to equity.

In the income statements, deprecation, taxes on income and
net income/loss for the year are translated at the rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date, all other expense and
income at average rates for the year. The balance arising from
using different exchange rates is allocated to other operating
income or other operating expense.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Income
Statement for the Year Ended December 31, 1993

The pro forma income statement adjustments are based in part
on the estimated income statement effect of all December 31,

assumptions. Reference is made to the material accompanying
the December 31, 1993 pro forma balance sheet below for a
discussion of such adjustments.
[FN]

pension expense, depreciation applicable to fixed asset
adjustments and capitalization of a lease.

FN(b) To increase goodwill and to amortize adjusted goodwill
over 25 years.

FN(c) To recognize additional expense of new borrowings
using the 1994 7% average interest rate applicable to
the subsidiary's German credit facility borrowings. 

FN(d) To record the estimated income tax expense computed
at an incremental effective rate of 45%, associated with
the additional income net of expenses resulting from
the pro forma adjustments.

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed
balance sheet shows the balance sheets of Pentair and Schroff
