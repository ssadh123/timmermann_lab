REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
of Cambrex Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of the
Nobel/Profarmaco Group (the "Group") as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related combined statements of operations and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These combined financial
statements are the responsibility of the management of the Group. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform our audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 8 to the combined financial statements, in 1993, the Group
changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

(1) THE COMPANY

The combined financial statements of the Nobel/Profarmaco Group (hereafter
referred to as the "Group") includes the accounts of Nobel Chemicals AB, Nobel
Chemicals International AB, Profarmaco Nobel S.r.l., and three sales companies.

The primary operations and production of the Group are within Nobel
chemicals AB and Profarmaco Nobel S.r.l. which are located in Karlskoga, Sweden
and Paullo, Italy, respectively. The sales companies of the Group are located
in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The primary function 
of such sales companies is to distribute the Group's products to its own and 
nearby markets. The Group's customer base is located in Europe, North and 
South America, and the Far East.

The Group's operations are focused upon two areas; pharmaceutical
chemicals and fine chemicals. The pharmaceutical operations produce active
ingredients for generic and proprietary pharmaceutical companies. The fine
chemical operations develop and manufacture a broad range of nitrated
compounds and derivatives for sale as intermediate chemicals in pigments and
dyes, agrochemicals, x-ray contrast media, vitamins and cosmetic products.

Prior to October of 1994, the parent of all of the companies within the
Group was Akzo Nobel AB located in Stockholm, Sweden. In October of 1994, all
of the common stock of the entities within the Group were purchased by Cambrex
Corporation ("Cambrex"), a U.S. company.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Combination

The combined financial statements include the accounts of the Group. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Cash Equivalents

Temporary cash investments with an original maturity of less than three 
months are considered cash equivalents.

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments consist principally of accounts receivable.
Concentration of credit risk exists inasmuch as the Company sells its products
to customers primarily in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. However,
receivables are spread among many customers and are geographically dispersed.
No customer represents more than 10% of sales or receivables.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in,
first-out basis, or market.

<PAGE> 9
NOBEL/PROFARMACO GROUP
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(IN THOUSANDS)

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation. Plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives for each applicable asset group as follows:

Buildings and improvements . . . . . . . . 20-36 years
Machinery and equipment . . . . . . . . . . 5-10 years

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line
basis as follows:

Patents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Amortized over the remaining
life of individual patents
(average 5 years)
Goodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5-20 years
Product technology . . . . . . . . 5 to 17 years
Trademarks and other . . . . . . . 1 to 20 years

Receivables and payables in foreign currencies

The balance sheets of foreign entities included in the Group are translated
according to the current rate method which provides that assets and liabilities
are translated at period end rates. Income statements are translated at the
average rate for the period. Translation differences arising from the
translation of income statements and balance sheets are recorded directly to
the Net Investment in Group.

Income Taxes

Entities within the Group file income tax returns in their respective
countries of domicile. Deferred taxes are recorded based upon differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and
available tax credit carryforwards.

Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $12,008 $17,050
======= =======
</TABLE>

Short term debt consists primarily of term notes in the amounts of $7,630
and $10,878 as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. This debt matured
in April of 1994. Interest accrues at approximately LIBOR plus 1% and is
payable quarterly in respect of the principle amount of the loan outstanding
from the drawdown date until maturity. The remaining short term debt consists
primarily of interest bearing advances from customers.

All debt was satisfied by Akzo Nobel AB, the Group's parent, prior to the
purchase of the Group by Cambrex in October 1994.

(8) INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, the Group adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes "(SFAS 109). The
cumulative effect of this change was the recognition of a deferred tax benefit
of $1,153.

In summary, SFAS 109 requires the determination of deferred tax assets and
liabilities by applying applicable tax rates to the difference between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Additionally, it
requires separate balance sheet disclosure of deferred tax assets and
liabilities and has different recognition criteria for certain deferred tax
assets than Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11, the standard under
which the Group's financial statements were previously prepared. As permitted
under SFAS109, prior year financial statements have not been restated.

The provision/(benefit) for income taxes varies from the statutory rates in
1993 and 1992 primarily as a result of capital contributions to/from the parent
company as well as revaluations of plant, property and equipment which are 
considered in the computation of local income tax liabilities. Such 
differences have been treated as a permanent difference in these financial 
statements. There is no benefit for income taxes in 1991 as the Group cannot
avail itself of tax loss carrybacks within its local tax jurisdictions.

(8) INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

The Group has tax loss carry forwards in Sweden totalling approximately
$1,473 to offset against future taxable income generated in Sweden on an
indefinite carry forward basis. Accordingly, the Group has recognized a
deferred tax asset relating to these carry forwards in 1993. During that year,
$657 of those net operating losses were utilized resulting in a remaining
deferred tax asset of $496 at December 31, 1993. In addition, the Group has 
approximately $7,224 in potential tax loss carry forwards for which they have 
applied for approval with the Swedish tax authorities. It is uncertain 
whether the Group will receive such approval and, therefore, be able to 
realize the benefit of such carryforwards. Therefore, no related asset has 
been recorded.

(9) NET INVESTMENT IN THE NOBEL/PROFARMACO GROUP

The net investment in the Nobel/Profarmaco Group represents the net
investment of the Group's parent company as well as the net of all loans,
advances, intercompany balances with the Group's parent company and
subsidiaries, and translation adjustments.

(10) OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES 

Other non-current liabilities consist of the following:

----------------
1993 1992

Pension Liabilities $4,330 $5,105
Accrual for severance pay 2,367 2,466
----- -----
$6,697 $7,571
===== =====

Nobel Chemicals AB participates in a defined benefit pension plan
(non-contributory for employees) which cover essentially all employees in its
Swedish operations. This plan (Swedish FPG/PRI pensions) forms part of a
Swedish multi-employer pension plan which is centrally administered. The level
of benefits and actuarial assumptions are established jointly for all plans,
and cannot unilaterally be changed by the participating companies. A
prerequisite for joining the FPG/PRI system is that a company reports the
actuarially calculated pension obligation as a liability in its balance sheet.

In Sweden, the pension liabilities are generally not funded. Pension
costs, including the interest on unfunded costs for the years ended December
31, 1993 and 1992 amounted to $163 and $551 respectively.

Since the pension plans are unfunded, the accumulated and projected benefit
obligations exceed plan assets. A summary of the funded status of the
significant plans is as follows:

(10) OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)

Assumptions used for the defined plans for the three years were:
Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.5%
Rates of increase in compensation levels . . . . . . 4.5%
Inflation rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.5%

As the Group's benefit plan has no assets, no expected return on assets is
included in the computation of the pension liability and expense.

Under Italian law, severance pay accrues in favor of employees which they
(or in the event of their death, their heirs) are entitled to collect upon
termination of employment. The amount payable related to each year's service
is calculated on the basis of the remuneration of such year and is subject to
annual revaluations based on increases in the Italian cost of living index. 
Provision of the effect of such revaluations is made as increases in the cost
of living index are realized. 

(11) OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE

There were no individually significant components in other expense in 1993.

Other income in 1992 consisted primarily of $30,023 representing insurance
proceeds net of related losses from an explosion at Nobel Chemicals during the
same year.

(12) FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

The nature and geographical locations of the Group's operations are
described in Note 1. Sales outside the United States are geographically
dispersed among the European countries, South America and the Far East and are
summarized as follows:

(14) CONTINGENCIES

Contingencies exist for the Group relating to litigation and claims 
arising out of the normal course of business. However, management is of the
opinion that while the ultimate liability resulting from these matters may 
have a material effect upon the results of operations in any given year, they 
will not have a material adverse effect upon the Group's financial position.

CAMBREX CORPORATION
PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

During 1994, Cambrex acquired the Nobel Chemicals Group (as described in
Note 1 to the attached Combined Financial Statements), the Fine Chemicals
Business of the Hexcel Corporation located in Teeside, United Kingdom, and the
Topanol product line of Zeneca Limited.

The following unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for
the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and for the year ended December 31,
1993, gives effect to the acquisitions as if they occurred on January 1, 1993. 
Actual debt incurred to finance these acquisitions during 1994 differs from the
debt presented in these pro forma financial statements. This is primarily
attributable to the assumption that cash outflows related to these businesses 
which would have occurred during the period from January 1993 through September
1994 would have been funded through additional debt.

The proforma information for the nine month period ended September 30, 1994,
is derived from the unaudited interim financial statements of Cambrex, the 
Nobel/Profarmaco Group and the other acquisitions for the period then ended. 
The pro forma information for the year ended December 31, 1993 is derived 
from the audited financial statements of Cambrex, the Nobel/Profarmaco Group 
and the other acquisitions for the year then ended. Such proforma information,
in the opinion of Cambrex management, reflects adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation of results. The unaudited pro forma statements give effect to the
transactions under the purchase method of accounting and the assumptions and
adjustments as described in the accompanying note.

The unaudited pro forma financial statements may not be indicative of the
results that actually would have occurred if the combination had been in effect
on the dates indicated or of future results of operations of the combined
companies. The unaudited pro forma financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and notes of Cambrex as filed in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993, and subsequent
filings, and the financial statements of the Nobel/Profarmaco Group included
elsewhere herein.

CAMBREX CORPORATION
NOTE TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS
(UNAUDITED)

The pro forma adjustments to the accompanying statement of operations for 
the nine months ended September 30, 1994, and for the year ended December 31, 
1993, assume the Businesses were acquired January 1, 1993. In summary, these 
adjustments:

- - Reflect additional depreciation and amortization expense which would
have been recorded by Cambrex due to increased asset values and shorter
estimated useful lives.

- - Record additional interest expense which would have been incurred by
Cambrex in connection with the financing of the purchase of the
acquisitions at a borrowing rate of 6%.

- - Record the tax effects of the pro forma adjustments at applicable rates.

Specifically, the nature of the pro-forma adjustments represent:

1. The payment of additional interest and other expenses with cash on hand.

2. Revaluation of plant, property and equipment to fair market value (net of 
accumulated depreciation on the revaluation increment).

3. The recording of goodwill and other intangibles net of accumulated
amortization.

4. Reduction of tax liabilities due to the adjustment of the provision for
income taxes.

5. The net additional long term debt required to finance the acquisitions and
operation of the acquired businesses.

6. Activities of the businesses acquired during the period January 1, 1994 to
September 30, 1994 not previously reported.

7. Additional depreciation and amortization expenses.

8. Elimination of intercompany interest income.

9. Elimination of intercompany interest expense net of interest expense
assumed to be incurred by Cambrex Corporation. The latter aggregates 
$5,736 for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and $6,992 for the 
year ended December 31, 1993.

10. The recognition of the tax benefit of additional expenses to the extent tax
liabilities could be reduced.
