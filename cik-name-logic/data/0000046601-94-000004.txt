Item 5. Other Events

On January 4, 1994, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Heilig-Meyers
Company ("Heilig-Meyers") acquired, effective as of January 1,
1994, certain assets relating to 92 stores of McMahan Furniture
Company ("McMahan") of Carlsbad, California. Sixty-five of these
stores are in California, twelve in Arizona, seven in New Mexico,
four in Texas, three in Nevada and one in Colorado. The purchase
price, net of accounts receivable and real estate, was
approximately $55 million. Accounts receivable of approximately
$100 million were securitized and purchased by an unaffiliated
party. Heilig-Meyers will act as servicer for these accounts. 
Heilig-Meyers has entered into an interim lease for the 70 stores
owned by McMahan entities and has assumed the leases on the
remaining store properties. It is expected that the real estate
owned by McMahan entities will be purchased by an unaffiliated
entity for approximately $57 million and leased to Heilig-Meyers. 
This transaction is scheduled to close later in January 1994. 
McMahan also operates banking and specialty insurance entities,
which it will retain.
