NOTES TO COMBINED SUMMARY OF REVENUES
AND CERTAIN RENTAL EXPENSES

The combined summaries of revenues and certain rental
expenses reflect the combined operations of The Village at
Old Tampa Bay Apartments, Peppertree Apartments and
Beechwood Apartments (the "properties") for the year ended
December 31, 1992 based upon the audited combined statements
of rental operations of the properties appearing elsewhere
herein and for the nine month period ended September 30,
1993 based upon the unaudited combined statements of rental
operations of the properties. During 1992 and a portion of
1993, the properties were owned and operated by entities
other than United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. (the "Trust").

The summary has been prepared on the accrual method of
accounting. Rental expenses include repair and maintenance
expenses, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and
certain other expenses. In accordance with the regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, mortgage interest
expenses, depreciation, and general and administrative costs
have been excluded from operating expenses, as they are
dependent upon a particular owner, purchase price or
financial arrangement.

In assessing the properties, management considered the
existing and potential tenant base, expected job growth in
the area, occupancy rates, the competitive nature of the
market and comparative rental rates. Furthermore, current
and anticipated maintenance and repair costs, real estate
taxes and anticipated capital improvements were assessed.
