Item 2. 

On August 5, 1994, Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. (the
"Registrant"), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Canandaigua
West, Inc., acquired certain of the assets of Heublein, Inc.
("Heublein"). The acquisition was made pursuant to an Asset
Purchase Agreement dated August 3, 1994 (the "Asset Purchase
Agreement") entered into between Heublein and the Registrant. 
The acquisition included the wine brands Almaden and Inglenook as
well as Belaire Creek Cellars, Chateau La Salle and Charles Le
Franc table wines, Le Domaine Champagne and Almaden, Hartley and
Jacques Bonet brandy. The Registrant also acquired wineries in
Madera and Escalon, California and the grape juice concentrate
business which Heublein had conducted at the Madera winery, along
with certain foreign duty credits related thereto. The
Registrant intends to operate such wineries and continue the sale
of products under the acquired brands. The consideration for the
transaction was the result of arms-length negotiations and
consisted of the following (the terms used hereinafter have the
same respective meanings as set forth in the Asset Purchase
Agreement which is attached hereto as an exhibit):

(a) Cash Purchase Price in the amount of $130,554,577, which
is the sum of (i) the estimated Book Values, as of the
closing date, of the inventories, prepaid expenses, and
property, plant and equipment and deferred mold charges
included in the assets acquired by the Registrant (the
"Purchased Assets"), (ii) $25,000,000, paid by the
Registrant for the Almaden brands, and (iii) $500,000,
paid by the Registrant as consideration for Heublein's
covenant not to compete with the Registrant in the United
States for a period of 5 years following the Closing in
the production and sale of grape juice concentrate or
sale of packaged wines bearing the designation "Chablis"
or "Burgundy" except where, among other exceptions, such
designations are currently used with certain brands
retained by Heublein, less the sum of (a) the estimated
Book Value, as of the Closing Date, of the liabilities
assumed by the Registrant (the "Assumed Balance Sheet
Liabilities"), and (b) $47,575,000. Following the
Closing, Heublein will deliver to the Registrant a
Closing Statement setting forth the aggregate Book Value,
as of the Closing Date, of those items included in part
(i), above, and deducting therefrom the aggregate Book
Value, as of the Closing Date, of the items included in
part (a), above. The Closing Statement will also set
forth the amount (the "Adjustment Amount"), by which the
actual Book Value of the Purchased Assets, as of the
Closing Date, exceeds or is less than $152,629,577, the
estimate of such amounts as of the Closing Date. The
Adjustment Amount will be paid by the Registrant or by
Heublein, as appropriate, provided that the Registrant
will be entitled to raise objections to the Book Values
set forth in the Closing Statement. If, following such
objections, the Registrant and Heublein are unable to
agree on such Book Values, then the objections will be
submitted to an internationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants, designated jointly by the
Registrant and Heublein, whose decision regarding the
resolution of the objections shall be final and binding
on the Registrant and Heublein.

(b) The issuance to Heublein of options (the "Options") to
purchase an aggregate of 600,000 shares of the
Registrant's Class A Common Stock, consisting of (i)
200,000 shares at an exercise price of $30.00 per share
and (ii) 400,000 shares at an exercise price of $35.00
per share. The Options are immediately exercisable by
Heublein and expire on August 5, 1996. The Options are
subject to anti-dilution adjustments and will not be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

(c) The assumption of certain operating liabilities relating
to the assets and business acquired from Heublein which
are subject to adjustment pending receipt of the final
Closing Statement.

(d) The issuance to Heublein of a certain nonrecourse
promissory note (the "Foreign Duty Credit Note" in the
amount of $3,673,766.21 pursuant to which the Registrant
shall pay to Heublein certain duty drawback amounts which
the Registrant receives resulting from the exportation of
certain grape juice concentrate.

The source of the cash payment made at closing, together with
payment of other costs and expenses required by the transaction,
was financing provided to the Registrant pursuant to a certain
Second Amendment and Restatement dated as of August 5, 1994 of
Amendment and Restatement of Credit Agreement dated as of
June 29, 1993 (the "Amended Credit Agreement") among the
Registrant, its principal operating subsidiaries (the
"Subsidiaries"), and a syndicate of 11 banks for which The Chase
Manhattan Bank (National Association) ("Chase") acts as agent. 
The syndicate includes Chase, Chase's Rochester Division, the
First National Bank of Boston, Manufacturers and Traders Trust
Company, NBD Bank, N.A., National City Bank, PNC Bank, National
Association, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., American National Bank and
Trust Company of Chicago, The First National Bank of Chicago and
the Dawia Bank, Ltd. (the "Banks"). The Amended Credit Agreement
provides for (i) a $224,000,000 term loan facility due in
June 2000, (ii) a $185,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility expiring
in June 2000 and (iii) the previously existing $28,200,000
irrevocable letter of credit issued in connection with the
Registrant's June 29, 1993 acquisition of Barton Incorporated. 
In connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, the Banks have
continued their liens and security interests in substantially all
of the assets of the Registrant and the Subsidiaries and were
given liens and security interests in the assets acquired from
Heublein, including mortgage liens and security interests in all
accounts and general intangibles, inventory, equipment,
trademarks and other properties. Repayment of the loans is also
guaranteed by the Subsidiaries.

The foregoing information contained in this Form 8-K with
respect to the acquisition and the financing thereof is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Asset
Purchase Agreement and the Amended Credit Agreement, copies of
which are attached hereto as Exhibits.

Item 5. Press Release

On August 5, 1994, the Registrant and Heublein issued the
following joint press release:

Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. (NASDAQ/NMS:WINEA & WINEB) and
Heublein, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of International Distillers and
Vintners, the drinks sector of Grand Metropolitan PLC

transaction under which Canandaigua has acquired from Heublein
the brands Almaden and Inglenook, as well as the Belaire Creek

brandy. Canandaigua also acquired Heublein's wineries in Madera
and Escalon, California, and the grape juice concentrate business
operated by Heublein at the Madera winery. 

Marvin Sands, Chairman of the Board of Canandaigua said, 
"This acquisition, which includes the Nation's third and sixth
largest wine brands, strategically positions Canandaigua as a
leader in the domestic table wine business. With separate sales
forces and distribution networks for the acquired brands and
Canandaigua's current brands, we believe we will succeed in
maintaining the continued success of our entire portfolio,
including the newly acquired brands." Sands added, "Having
recently visited the Madera winery, one of the largest in the
world, I found a high level of excitement among our new employees
who joined Canandaigua which is highly devoted to the continued
development of the wine business in the United States."

Robert M. Furek, President and Chief Executive Officer,
Heublein, said, "The sale positions us for continued growth and
illustrates our long-term strategy of focusing on premium brands
while reducing our cost base." He added, "We can now provide
even stronger support for our portfolio of vintage dated and
varietal wines, including such highly successful brands as
Beaulieu Vineyard, Glen Ellen, Blossom Hill and M.G. Vallejo."

The consideration for the transaction consisted of a cash
purchase price of approximately $130.5 million, the assumption by
Canandaigua of approximately $4.8 million of operating
liabilities, and the issuance to Heublein by Canandaigua of
options to purchase 200,000 shares of Canandaigua's Class A
Common Stock at an exercise price of $30 per share and 400,000
shares of its Class A Common Stock at $35 per share. As a result
of discussions between Heublein and Canandaigua following the
initial announcement regarding this transaction, Heublein has
retained its wineries in Paicines and Reedley, California and its
minority interest in the Madera Glass Company. Heublein has also
retained accounts receivable associated with the business being
sold.

The acquisition and related activities were financed by a
$180 million increase in Canandaigua's term loans and a $90
million increase in its revolving credit line under Canandaigua's
existing credit facility, all of which was arranged through The
Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association). The increase in
Canandaigua's revolving credit line will be used primarily to
purchase grapes from the 1994 harvest relative to the acquired
business. 

For Heublein's fiscal year ended September 30, 1993, net
sales (excluding federal excise taxes) related to the assets and
business being sold were approximately $235 million.

Effective upon closing, Canandaigua consolidated the acquired
business into its wine division and hired virtually all of the
employees from Heublein related to the acquired business. 
Employees who were not offered jobs by Canandaigua or not
retained by Heublein will receive severance benefits and
outplacement services from Heublein.

International Distillers and Vintners is the world's largest
wine and spirits business by volume. Heublein, based in
Farmington, Connecticut, produces, imports and markets more than
100 brands of wines and spirits, including Beaulieu Vineyard,
Glen Ellen, Blossom Hill and Mouton Cadet wines, Smirnoff vodka,
Jose Cuervo tequila, Black Velvet Canadian whisky and Christian
Brothers brandy. The company's domestic wine business is managed
by the San Mateo, California-based Heublein wine division under
the direction of Christopher P. Mottern, Executive Vice
President.

Canandaigua Wine Company, headquartered in Canandaigua, New
York, is the second largest wine producer, fourth largest
marketer of imported beers and eighth largest producer and
marketer of distilled spirits in the United States. The
Company's principal brands, giving effect to the acquisition,
include Corona beer, Almaden Wines, Inglenook Wines, Richards
Wild Irish Rose wines, Paul Masson wines, Taylor California
Cellars wines, Cook's champagne, St. Pauli Girl beer, Cribari
wines, Manischewitz wines, J. Roget champagne, Barton gin and
vodka, Tsingtao beer, Ten High bourbon and Montezuma tequila. 
Canandaigua's Wine Division is managed by Chris Kalabokes, Sr.
Vice President and President of the Wine Division.

Statement or the 75th day after the Closing Date, whichever is
later. Any Adjustment Amount required by this Section 2.5 or by
Section 2.6 shall be paid in immediately available funds to the
party entitled to receive such Adjustment Amount by wire transfer
to a bank account specified by such receiving party, together
with interest thereon at the Prime Rate for the period from the

pursuant to Section 2.6, as applicable.

2.6. Disagreements As To Book Values. Unless Buyer,
within 45 days after receipt of the Closing Statement, or the
75th day after the Closing Date, whichever is later, gives
Heublein notice objecting in good faith to a Book Value
calculation set forth in the Closing Statement, specifying the
basis for such objection and its computation of such Book Values,
the Book Values and calculations as set forth in the Closing
Statement shall be final and binding upon the parties. If such
notice is given by Buyer in good faith and within said period,
the parties shall negotiate in good faith with a view to agreeing
upon such Book Values and calculations. If such negotiations
fail to resolve all disputed items within ten days after Buyer's
notice is given to Heublein, the remaining disputed items shall
be submitted to an internationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants, designated jointly by Heublein and Buyer, for
final resolution. After affording each of the parties and their
accountants the opportunity to present their positions as to such
determination (which opportunity shall not extend for more than
45 days), the accounting firm selected pursuant to this Section
shall determine the disputed items and the Adjustment Amount and
such determination shall be final and binding. The fees, costs
and expenses of the accounting firm selected pursuant to this
Section shall be borne equally by Heublein and Buyer. If Buyer
provides Heublein with notice of objection in accordance with
Section 2.6, any portion of the Adjustment Amount not in dispute,
together with interest thereon, shall be paid immediately to
Heublein pursuant to Section 2.5 without deduction or offset.

2.7. Quantity And Merchantability Of Specified
Inventories. For purposes of determining as of the Closing Date
the quantity of the Specified Inventories and whether such
Specified Inventories are Merchantable, Heublein and Buyer shall
follow the procedures set forth on Exhibit 2.7 hereto and shall

SECTION 12. REQUIRED CONSENTS; RELEASES

all Assumed Liabilities under or relating to the Assigned
Contracts and (ii) to cause Buyer to be substituted in the place
of Heublein for all purposes under the Assigned Contracts.

12.2. Absence Of Required Consents.

(a) To the extent that any Purchased Assets or
Assumed Liabilities related thereto are not assignable or
transferable without a Required Consent, the absence of which

material penalty or loss, and such Required Consent is not

(b) Buyer will cooperate with any reasonable
proposal from Heublein designed to obviate any such Required
Consent with respect to any Assigned Contract.

(c) So long as any such Required Consent is not
obtained or obviated with respect to an Assigned Contract,
Heublein may use all reasonable efforts to (i) provide to Buyer
the benefits of such Assigned Contract (such benefits to be at
Buyer's cost) and cooperate in any reasonable and lawful
arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Buyer, without
incurring any financial obligation to Buyer other than to provide
such benefits, and (ii) subject to indemnification arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to Heublein, enforce at the request,
under the direction, for the account and at the expense of Buyer
any rights of Heublein arising from such Assigned Contracts

Buyer is provided the benefits pursuant to this subsection of any
Assigned Contract, Buyer will perform for the benefit of the

obligations under the Assigned Contract, to enable Heublein to
perform such obligations without expense or liability to
Heublein.

Buyer shall not assume or be obligated in any manner with respect
to any benefits payable pursuant to the terms of the Collective
Bargaining Agreements to any employee of Heublein who is retired

except for up to 5 additional Available Employees with whom Buyer
has made other mutually acceptable arrangements for continued
employment), employment with Buyer following the Closing on terms
(including, without limitation, compensation and vacation
benefits, insurance benefits and other benefits) that are
comparable to the terms provided by Buyer to its own employees of
the same rank and seniority, and, in the case of wages and
salaries that are in no event less than the wages and salaries
being paid by Heublein to such employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer shall recognize the seniority of all non-union employees
who are hired by Buyer (including, where appropriate, awarding
credit under any pension plans or other benefit plans maintained
by Buyer for all service credited to the New Employees under any
of Heublein's pension plans or other benefit plans, but only for
purposes of eligibility and vesting and only to the extent
permitted by law and by such plans). On the Closing Date,
subject to any authorized offsets or deductions Heublein is
otherwise entitled to make, Heublein shall pay to the New
Employees the benefits associated with any unused vacation time
of such employees with respect to their employment by Heublein.

(b) Heublein shall be free to make offers of
continued employment to any Available Employee who does not
become a New Employee or is no longer an employee of Buyer or its
affiliates. Heublein shall not make any offer of employment to
any New Employee within two years of the Closing Date unless such
New Employee is no longer an employee of Buyer or its affiliates. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Heublein desires to retain as
employees of Heublein those Available Employees identified on
Exhibit 13.2C (the "Designated Employees"). Except for those
Designated Employees set forth on Exhibit 13.2D and identified
thereon as Designated Employees to whom Buyer may make offers of
employment, Buyer shall not within two years of the Closing Date
directly or indirectly itself or through any affiliate of Buyer
make any offer for employment to any Designated Employee.

13.3. Severance. Buyer shall reimburse Heublein for all
severance or separation payments as described in Exhibit 13.3
(the "Separation Allowance"). Such reimbursement shall be made
by Buyer after Heublein has incurred such expense and within 15
days after Heublein invoices Buyer for the same.

13.4. No Third Party Beneficiaries. No provision of this
Section 13 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any
employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) of Heublein or any of its affiliates in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or in
respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any Plan.

consultants and other representatives shall have access (on a
current basis) to all data and information collected and
conclusions reached by the Environmental Consultants, including,
without limitation, raw data, boring logs, splits of all samples
taken and laboratory results obtained by the Environmental
Consultants, and may contact the Environmental Consultants
directly. Heublein shall be provided with a draft of the
environmental surveys at least five days prior to its issuance
and shall be entitled to receive from the Environmental

regarding matters reflected or referred to in such draft
environmental surveys. Buyer shall use its best efforts to cause
the Environmental Consultants to comply with the provisions of
this Section 14.

(b) by either Heublein or Buyer at any time after
August 31, 1994 (or such later date as the parties may, in their
discretion, agree upon) if the Closing shall not have occurred by
such time unless the failure of the Closing to take place on or
before such time is attributable to the breach by such party of
its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or of any of its other obligations hereunder; or

(c) by either Heublein or Buyer if the purchase
of the Purchased Assets or Business contemplated hereby shall
violate any non-appealable final order, decree or judgment of any
court or governmental body having competent jurisdiction or if
there shall be a statute, rule or regulation that makes such
purchase illegal or otherwise prohibited.

15.2. Effect Of Termination. Upon the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 15.1 hereof, (a) Buyer shall

promptly to Heublein any payments or other sums received by Buyer
that relate to any sales, shipments or other matters occurring
before the Closing Date or that otherwise are properly for the
account of Heublein. If, after the Closing Date, Heublein shall
wish to make a claim or otherwise take action under an Assigned
Contract with respect to a liability or expense of Heublein that
is not an Assumed Liability, Buyer shall assist, cooperate and
consult with Heublein with respect to such action and shall remit
promptly to Heublein any payments or other sums received by Buyer
that relate thereto. Heublein shall remit promptly to Buyer any
payments or other sums received by Heublein after the Closing

the Closing Date.

16.2. Differentiation Between Products Of Heublein and
Buyer. After the Closing, Buyer will continue date coding
products in the manner heretofore utilized by Heublein, or
another reasonably appropriate manner, to insure that products
and goods of the Business finished and sold by Buyer can be
distinguished from products of the Business finished and sold by
Heublein.

16.3. Further Assurances. From and after the Closing Date,
each party hereto shall provide to the other party hereto such

reasonably necessary for the purpose of preparing tax returns and
financial statements and responding to tax audits covering
Heublein's operations as of or prior to the Closing Date shall be
retained and made available to Heublein for the period open for
assessments or refunds as determined or required by applicable
tax laws, rules or regulations and if, at the end of such period,
Heublein or its successors or assigns shall be involved in any
tax audit, investigation, litigation or other proceeding, then
for such additional period as Heublein may reasonably request in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
not have any liability to Heublein for any consequential, special
or punitive damages arising out of any destruction of any
documents by an agent or employee of Buyer other than a willful
destruction in violation of this Section 16.4.

16.5. Surplus Equipment. If any equipment not used in the
conduct of the Business, not acquired by Buyer at Closing and
identified by Heublein to Buyer prior to the Closing (to the
extent practicable) remains in the Facilities after the Closing,
Buyer will permit Heublein to remove such equipment at Heublein's
expense upon reasonable notice from Heublein.

16.6. Transitional Services. For a period of up to 12
months after the Closing Date, Heublein will provide and make
available to Buyer reasonable access to data processing services

employment tax requirements and, for a period not to exceed 60
days, toll-free customer relations telephone service currently

transition as expeditiously as possible. Following the Closing
and if so requested by Buyer, Heublein shall, to the extent
permitted by law, maintain in effect, at Buyer's expense, all
licenses, permits, authorizations, approvals and land use
variances relating to the Business (the "Permits") which Buyer
has been unable to obtain using reasonable efforts and shall
permit Buyer, for such reasonable period as Buyer lacks the
Permits necessary to conduct the Business, to act as the agent of
Heublein and to exercise Heublein's rights and privileges
thereunder so that there will be no interruption in sales of
products sold under the Specified Brands. Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Heublein from and against any and all

consent of Heublein's auditors to include such information in
required reports and filings, shall be paid solely by Heublein.

16.10. Intangible Property. After Closing, Heublein (i)
will not infringe upon any intellectual property rights relating
to the Specified Brands, (ii) shall reasonably cooperate with
Buyer at Buyer's expense in Buyer's efforts after the Closing to
maintain, protect, and enforce such intellectual property rights
and shall execute all documents reasonably required to enable
Buyer to accomplish such efforts, and (iii) shall, at its sole
expense, take all reasonable steps to cause registrations and
pending applications for trademarks related to the Specified
Brands to be: (a) of record in each applicable jurisdiction in
the name of Heublein, and (b) in all other respects in condition
for transfer to Buyer, provided however that nothing in part
(iii) of this Section 16.10 shall require Heublein to take any
such action where it would be commercially impractical to do so. 
Nothing in this Section 16.10 shall in any way limit Heublein's
rights under Section 18.1 of this Agreement.

16.11. Promotional Programs; Coupon Redemptions. 
Following the Closing, Buyer shall (i) discharge all of the
obligations under Promotional Programs put into effect by
Heublein prior to Closing which obligations relate to sales made
by Buyer following the Closing, and (ii) discharge all of the
obligations under Promotional Programs related to sales made by
Heublein prior to Closing, only if such Promotional Programs
constitute Assumed Balance Sheet Liabilities. Following the
Closing, Heublein shall discharge all coupon redemption
obligations related to coupons for the Specified Brands
distributed by Heublein prior to the Closing, regardless of the
dates on which the coupon redemption periods expire.

16.12. Use Up Rights. For a period of one year following
the Closing Date, Heublein shall cooperate with Buyer, at 
Buyer's sole expense, in connection with Buyer's reasonable
efforts to obtain "use-up" rights with respect to labels and
trade dress included in the Purchased Assets including, if so
requested by Buyer, confirmation to federal and state alcoholic
beverage authorities that Buyer is authorized by Heublein to use
such labels and trade dress.

16.13. Possession. Heublein shall deliver to Buyer
actual possession of the Purchased Assets to the extent actual
possession of such Purchased Assets can reasonably be delivered.

16.14. Option for Brandy. Buyer shall have the option
for a period of three months following the Closing Date to
purchase from Heublein the brandy identified on Exhibit 16.14 at
a price of $3.21 per proof gallon payable in cash within 15 days
following Buyer's exercise of its option. Buyer shall exercise
such option by giving written notice to Heublein of such exercise
at any time during the three month period and delivery of the
brandy being acquired shall be made to Buyer by Heublein upon its
receipt of payment.

SECTION 17. INDEMNIFICATION

17.1. Indemnification By Heublein. Subject to the
limitations contained in this Section 17 and in the other
provisions of this Agreement (including the provisions of
Exhibit 2.7 and Section 7 hereof), from and after the Closing
Date, Heublein shall hold harmless and indemnify Buyer and its
affiliates (which term includes, directors and employees) from
and against any Damages actually incurred by them (or any of
them) as a result of or in connection with:

(a) any breach by Heublein of any representation
or warranty of Heublein set forth in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto;

(b) any breach by Heublein of any covenant or
agreement of Heublein set forth in this Agreement or in any other
agreement referred to herein; or

(c) any failure by Heublein to pay, perform,
satisfy or discharge any debt, liability or obligation of
Heublein with respect to the Business or any matter relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, that
existed before the Closing and relates to product liability for
finished goods produced by Heublein before the Closing except in
each case for any debt, liability or obligation included in the
Assumed Liabilities or otherwise assumed by Buyer pursuant to or
in connection with this Agreement or for which Heublein expressly
has no responsibility pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement or any Related Agreements.

17.2. Indemnification By Buyer. Subject to the limitations
contained in this Section 17 and in the other provisions of this
Agreement (including the provisions of Section 7 hereof), from
and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall hold harmless and
indemnify Heublein and its affiliates (which term includes
directors and employees) from and against any Damages actually
incurred by them (or any of them) as a result of or in connection
with:

(a) any breach by Buyer of any representation or
warranty of Buyer set forth in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto;

(b) any breach by Buyer of any covenant or
agreement of Buyer set forth in this Agreement or in any other
agreement referred to herein;

(c) any failure by Buyer to pay, perform, satisfy
or discharge any debt, obligation or liability included in the
Assumed Liabilities or otherwise assumed by Buyer pursuant to or
in connection with this Agreement or any of the Related
Agreements;

(d) any failure by Buyer to pay, perform, satisfy
or discharge any debt, obligation or liability that relates to
claims or matters based upon action or inaction of Buyer after
the Closing or otherwise in respect of Buyer's conduct of the
Business or ownership and operation of the Purchased Assets from
and after the Closing Date;

(e) any disclosure or other communication by
Buyer that is subject to the requirements of any federal or state
securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or any failure on the part of
Buyer to make any required disclosure or communication under such
laws or any other applicable federal or state securities laws;

(f) any federal or state claim or cause of action
brought by any security holder or former security holder of Buyer
(including any derivative action); or

(g) any change made at or after the Closing by
Buyer (or any of its successors or assigns) in the brokerage or
distribution arrangements relating to any products or goods being
sold under any of the Specified Brands (including, without
limitation, any change arising from or relating to (i) any
termination by Buyer of any broker or distributor, (ii) any 
withdrawal by Buyer of any brand or product item from any broker
or distributor, or (iii) any appointment by Buyer of any broker
or distributor to broker or distribute any brand or product
item).

17.3. Knowledge Of Breach. For purposes of this
Section 17, neither party hereto shall be deemed to have breached
any representation, warranty or covenant if (i) such party shall
have notified the other party hereto in writing, on or prior to
the Closing Date, of the breach of, or of any facts or
circumstances constituting or resulting in the breach of, such
representation, warranty or covenant and (ii) none of such
party's principal representatives who actively participated in
the negotiation of this Agreement can be shown to have had actual
knowledge of such breach, facts or circumstances on or prior to
the date of this Agreement and to have willfully failed to
disclose them.

17.4. Deductible Amount. Without limiting the effect of
any of the other limitations set forth herein, Heublein shall not
be required to make any indemnification payments hereunder with
respect to any breach of any of its representations and
warranties, except to the extent that the cumulative amount of
the Damages actually incurred by Buyer as a direct result of all
such breaches actually exceeds $1,000,000; and Heublein shall
only be required to pay, and shall only be liable for, the amount
by which the cumulative amount of the Damages actually incurred
by Buyer as a direct result of all such breaches actually exceeds
$1,000,000.

17.5. Subrogation. To the extent that either party hereto
(the "Indemnifying Party") makes or is required to make any
indemnification payment hereunder to the other party hereto (the
"Indemnitee"), the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to, and
shall be entitled to exercise, any rights and remedies (including
rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of
recovery) that the Indemnitee or any of the Indemnitee's
affiliates may have against any other person with respect to any
claim or other matter, or with respect to any Damages or
circumstances, to which such indemnification payment relates. 
The Indemnitee shall permit the Indemnifying Party to use the
name of the Indemnitee and the names of the Indemnitee's
affiliates in any transaction or any proceeding or other matter
involving any of such rights or remedies; and the Indemnitee
shall take such actions as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request for the purpose of enabling the Indemnifying Party to
perfect or exercise its right of subrogation hereunder.

17.6 Exclusivity. The right of each party hereto to
demand and receive indemnification payments pursuant to this
Section 17 shall be the sole remedy exercisable by such party and
its affiliates with respect to any breach by any other party
hereto of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth herein or in the certificates delivered pursuant hereto; it
being understood that the foregoing shall not prohibit specific
performance if available under applicable law as a remedy
exercisable by either party with respect to any breach by the
other party hereto of any provision of this Agreement.

17.7. Right To Cure Breach Of Section 5.6. In lieu of
making any indemnification payments that it would otherwise be
required to make to Buyer with respect to any diminution in the
value of the items referred to in Section 5.6 in connection with
any breach of the representation and warranty set forth in
Section 5.6 hereof, Heublein may, at its option, replace the
items that do not conform to the standard set forth in said
Section 5.6 with items that do conform to such standard, as
provided in the Inventory Testing Procedures attached hereto as
Exhibit 2.7; it being understood that the foregoing shall not
prevent Buyer from recovering any Damages to which it might
otherwise be entitled by reason of the breach of Section 5.6
hereof.

17.8. Defense Of Claims. If either party hereto (the
"Indemnitee") receives notice or otherwise obtains knowledge of
any claim or other matter with respect to which the other party
hereto (the "Indemnifying Party") may become obligated to hold
harmless or indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder (irrespective of
the deductible set forth in Section 17.4), then the Indemnitee
shall promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice
describing such claim or other matter in reasonable detail and
specifying the estimated amount of the Damages that may be
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume
the defense of such claim or other matter at its own expense and
with its own counsel, provided such counsel is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee. If the Indemnifying Party elects
to assume the defense of such claim or other matter,
(i) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay or otherwise
indemnify the Indemnitee against any attorneys' fees or other
expenses incurred on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with
such claim or other matter following the Indemnifying Party's
election to assume the defense of such claim or other matter,
(ii) the Indemnitee shall fully cooperate as reasonably requested
by the Indemnifying Party in the defense or settlement of such
claim or other matter, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall keep
the Indemnitee informed of all material developments and events
relating to such claim or other matter, and (iv) the Indemnitee
shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, in the
defense of such claim or other matter. In no event will the
Indemnifying Party be liable for any settlement or admission of
liability with respect to such claim or other matter without its
prior written consent.

SECTION 18. USE OF CERTAIN NAMES

18.1. Inglenook Name. Buyer agrees that notwithstanding
the fact that "Inglenook" is one of the Specified Brands being
sold to Buyer, Heublein and its affiliates, successors and
assigns shall have the perpetual right to continue to use,
without payment of any fee or other amount, the names "Inglenook
Chateau" and "Inglenook Winery" (and variations thereof approved
in writing by Buyer) in connection with the ownership and
operation of that certain real property and improvements in Napa
Valley, California owned by Heublein and commonly known as the
"Inglenook Winery;" provided, however, that such name shall not
be used (i) as a part of the brand name, tradename, trademark or
logo of, or used on the label of, any beverage or food product or
other consumer product or service produced by Heublein or any of
its affiliates, successors or assigns, or (ii) otherwise to sell
or distribute any beverage or food product by Heublein or any of
its affiliates, successors or assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (x) the right to use the name "Inglenook Chateau" and
"Inglenook Winery" and variations thereof shall cease in the
event that Heublein or its affiliates, successors and assigns
fail to make use of such names for a consecutive period in excess
of two years or use such names in a manner which has a material
adverse impact on the use of such names by Buyer in the sale of
its wines, and (y) Heublein and its affiliates, successors and
assigns shall have the right to sell and distribute any or all of
the Inglenook library wines which are being retained by Heublein
as a part of the Excluded Assets.

18.2. Certain Restrictions And Agreements On Use Of Certain
Specified Brands. Buyer acknowledges that those Specified Brands
set forth on Exhibit 18.2 hereto are subject to certain
restrictions and agreements on the use thereof in advertising or
marketing, as more specifically described on Exhibit 18.2. Buyer
agrees to comply (and agrees to require each of its successors in
interest and assigns to comply) with the restrictions and
agreements set forth on Exhibit 18.2, and Buyer further
acknowledges and agrees that De La Salle Institute, a nonprofit
religious corporation organized under the laws of California, is
a third party beneficiary of the provisions of this Section 18.2,
with rights to enforce the restrictions and agreements set forth
on Exhibit 18.2 and in this Section 18.2 as against Buyer and
each of its successors and assigns. Buyer further agrees that in
the event of the breach or threatened breach of the covenant set
forth in this Section 18.2, the damage or imminent damage to
Heublein will be irreparable and extremely difficult to estimate,
making any remedy at law or in damages inadequate. Accordingly,
the parties agree that Heublein and, as set forth above, the De
La Salle Institute, each shall be entitled to injunctive relief
against Buyer and each of its successors and assigns in the event
of any breach or threatened breach of such covenant by Buyer or
any of its successors or assigns, in addition to any other relief
(including damages) available to Heublein under this Agreement or
under law. Heublein represents that (i) it has fully complied
with restrictions contained in, and is not in default under the
restrictions and agreements related to the use of Specified
Brands set forth in Exhibit 18.2, and (ii) the restrictions and
agreements described in Exhibit 18.2 constitute all restrictions
and agreements regarding the use of the Specified Brands in
advertising or marketing contained in the agreement referred to
in Exhibit 18.2.

subject to the requirements of any federal or state securities
laws, including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, or the inaccuracy or insufficiency of any

irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the performance of such
obligations by an instrument satisfactory to Heublein.

19.7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other
instruments and agreements referred to herein or executed in

parties hereto and supersede all other agreements and
understandings between the parties hereto relating to the subject
matter hereof.

19.8. Waiver. No failure on the part of either party
hereto to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy
hereunder, and no delay on the part of either party hereto in
exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy hereunder, shall
operate as a waiver thereof; and no single or partial exercise of
any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy.

19.9. Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended,
modified, altered or supplemented except by means of an agreement
or other instrument executed on behalf of both of the parties
hereto.

19.10. Parties In Interest. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to provide any rights or remedies to any person other

Salle Institute, and their respective successors and assigns, if

Amendment and Restatement dated as of June 29, 1993 of Credit
Agreement dated as of September 30, 1991 (as heretofore modified

for, among other things, the increase of the amount of credit

Effective Date (as hereinafter defined) shall continue and remain
outstanding and not be repaid on the Effective Date but shall be
assigned and reallocated among the Banks as provided in Section
2.01 and 2.04 hereof.

Accordingly, the parties hereto hereby agree that the

interest or other amounts payable by the Company hereunder
in respect of such Reimbursement Obligation (other than the
commissions, charges, costs and expenses payable to the
Issuing Bank pursuant to clause (f) of this Section 2.03). 
Upon receipt by the Issuing Bank from or for account of the
Company of any payment in respect of such Reimbursement
Obligation or any such interest or other amount (including
by way of setoff or application of proceeds of any
collateral security) the Issuing Bank shall promptly pay to
the Agent for account of each Barton Letter of Credit Bank
entitled thereto, such Barton Letter of Credit Bank's
Proportionate Share of such payment, each such payment by
the Issuing Bank to be made in the same money and funds in
which received by the Issuing Bank. In the event any pay-
ment received by the Issuing Bank and so paid to the Barton
Letter of Credit Banks hereunder is rescinded or must other-
wise be returned by the Issuing Bank, each Barton Letter of
Credit Bank shall, upon the request of the Issuing Bank
(through the Agent), repay to the Issuing Bank (through the
Agent) the amount of such payment paid to such Bank, with
interest at the rate specified in clause (g) of this
Section 2.03.

(f) The Company shall pay to the Agent for account of
the Issuing Bank in respect of the Barton Letter of Credit
an issuance fee in an amount equal to the Letter of Credit
Fee Percentage of the daily average undrawn face amount of
the Barton Letter of Credit for the period from and
including the date of issuance of the Barton Letter of
Credit to and including the date the Barton Letter of Credit
is drawn in full, expires or is terminated (such fee to be
non-refundable, to be paid in arrears on each Quarterly Date
and on the Barton Letter of Credit Termination Date and to
be calculated, for any day, after giving effect to any
payments made under the Barton Letter of Credit on such
day). The Issuing Bank shall pay to the Agent for account
of each Barton Letter of Credit Bank (other than the Issuing
Bank), from time to time at reasonable intervals (but in any
event at least quarterly), but only to the extent actually
received from the Company, an amount equal to such Bank's
Proportionate Share of all such fees in respect of the 
Barton Letter of Credit (including any such fee in respect
of any period of any renewal or extension thereof).

In addition, the Company shall pay to the Agent solely
for account of the Issuing Bank a fronting fee in respect of
the Barton Letter of Credit in an amount equal to 1/8 of 1%
per annum of the daily average undrawn face amount of the
Barton Letter of Credit for the period from and including
the date of issuance of the Barton Letter of Credit to and
including the date the Barton Letter of Credit is drawn in
full, expires or is terminated (such fee to be
non-refundable, to be paid in arrears on each Quarterly Date
and on the Barton Letter of Credit Termination Date and to
be calculated, for any day, after giving effect to any
payments made under the Barton Letter of Credit on such day)
plus all commissions, charges, costs and expenses in the
amounts customarily charged by the Issuing Bank from time to
time in like circumstances with respect to the issuance of
the Barton Letter of Credit and drawings and other
transactions relating thereto.

(g) To the extent that any Barton Letter of Credit
Bank fails to pay any amount required to be paid pursuant to
clause (d) or (e) of this Section 2.03 on the due date
therefor, such Bank shall pay interest to the Issuing Bank
(through the Agent) on such amount from and including such
due date to but excluding the date such payment is made at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate (as in effect
from time to time), provided that if such payment is not
made within three Business Days of such due date then, such
Barton Letter of Credit Bank shall be obligated retro-
actively to the due date to pay interest in respect of such
payment at the rate of interest provided for Base Rate Loans
pursuant to Section 3.02 hereof.

(h) The issuance by the Issuing Bank of any modifica-
tion or supplement to the Barton Letter of Credit hereunder
shall be subject to the same conditions applicable under
this Section 2.03 to the issuance of the Barton Letter of
Credit, and no such modification or supplement shall be
issued hereunder unless each Barton Letter of Credit Bank
shall have consented thereto.

The Company hereby indemnifies and holds harmless each Barton
Letter of Credit Bank and the Agent from and against any and all
claims and damages (including, without limitation, consequential
damages), losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such Bank
or the Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such Bank
or the Agent by any Person whatsoever) by reason of or in
connection with the execution and delivery or transfer of or
payment or refusal to pay by the Issuing Bank under the Barton
Letter of Credit; provided that the Company shall not be required
to indemnify any Bank or the Agent for any claims, damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to
the extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Issuing Bank in determining whether a request
presented under the Barton Letter of Credit complied with the
terms of the Barton Letter of Credit or (y) in the case of the
Issuing Bank, such Bank's failure to pay under the Barton Letter
of Credit after the presentation to it of a request strictly
complying with the terms and conditions of the Barton Letter of
Credit. Nothing in this Section 2.03 is intended to limit the
other obligations of the Company, any Bank or the Agent under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Issuing Bank shall not be liable for
consequential damages.

2.04 Revolving Letters of Credit. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Revolving Credit
Commitments may be utilized, upon the request of the Company, in
addition to the Revolving Credit Loans provided for by Section
2.01(a) hereof, by the issuance by the Issuing Bank of commer-
cial, documentary or standby letters of credit (collectively with
the Qingdao Letter of Credit and the Existing Letters of Credit,
"Revolving Letters of Credit") for account of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (as specified by the Company), provided that
in no event shall (i) the aggregate amount of all Letter of
Credit Liabilities in respect of Revolving Letters of Credit,
together with the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving
Credit Loans, exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitments as in effect from time to time, (ii) the outstanding
aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Liabilities in respect
of Revolving Letters of Credit exceed $12,000,000, and (iii) the
expiration date of any Revolving Letter of Credit extend beyond
the earlier of the Revolving Credit Termination Date and the date
twelve months following the issuance of such Revolving Letter of
Credit. The following additional provisions shall apply to
Letters of Credit:

(a) The Company shall give the Agent at least three
Business Days' irrevocable prior notice (effective upon
receipt) specifying the Business Day (which shall be no
later than 30 days preceding the Revolving Credit Termi-
nation Date) each Revolving Letter of Credit is to be issued
and the account party or parties therefor and describing in
reasonable detail the proposed terms of such Revolving
Letter of Credit (including the beneficiary thereof) and the
nature of the transactions or obligations proposed to be
supported thereby. Upon receipt of any such notice, the
Agent shall advise the Issuing Bank of the contents thereof.

(b) On each day during the period commencing with the
issuance (or, in the case of the Existing Letters of Credit
and the Qingdao Letter of Credit, commencing on the
Effective Date) by the Issuing Bank of any Revolving Letter
of Credit and until such Revolving Letter of Credit shall
have expired or been terminated, the Revolving Credit
Commitment of each Revolving Credit Bank shall be deemed to
be utilized for all purposes of this Agreement in an amount
equal to such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage
of the then undrawn face amount of such Revolving Letter of
Credit. Each Revolving Credit Bank (other than the Issuing
Bank) agrees that, upon the issuance of any Revolving Letter
of Credit hereunder (or, in the case of the Existing Letters
of Credit and the Qingdao Letter of Credit, upon the
Effective Date), it shall automatically acquire a
participation in the Issuing Bank's liability under such
Revolving Letter of Credit in an amount equal to such Bank's
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such liability,
and each Revolving Credit Bank (other than the Issuing Bank)
thereby shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
assume, as primary obligor and not as surety, and shall be
unconditionally obligated to the Issuing Bank to pay and
discharge when due, its Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentage of the Issuing Bank's liability under such
Revolving Letter of Credit.

(c) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Revolving
Letter of Credit of any demand for payment under such
Revolving Letter of Credit, which demand substantially
complies with the terms and conditions thereof, the Issuing
Bank shall promptly notify the Company (through the Agent)
of the amount to be paid by the Issuing Bank as a result of
such demand and the date on which payment is to be made by
the Issuing Bank to such beneficiary in respect of such
demand. Notwithstanding the identity of the account party
of any Revolving Letter of Credit, the Company hereby
unconditionally agrees to pay and reimburse the Agent for
account of the Issuing Bank for the amount of each such
demand for payment under such Revolving Letter of Credit at
or prior to the date on which payment is to be made by the
Issuing Bank to the beneficiary thereunder, without
presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any
kind.

(d) Forthwith upon its receipt of a notice referred to
in clause (c) of this Section 2.04, the Company shall advise
the Agent whether or not the Company intends to borrow
hereunder to finance its obligation to reimburse the Issuing
Bank for the amount of the related demand for payment and,
if it does, submit a notice of such borrowing as provided in
Section 4.05 hereof.

(e) Each Revolving Credit Bank (other than the Issuing
Bank) shall pay to the Agent for account of the Issuing Bank
at the Principal Office in Dollars and in immediately
available funds, the amount of such Bank's Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage of any payment under a Revolving
Letter of Credit upon notice by the Issuing Bank (through
the Agent) to such Revolving Credit Bank requesting such
payment and specifying such amount. Each such Revolving
Credit Bank's obligation to make such payment to the Agent
for account of the Issuing Bank under this clause (e), and
the Issuing Bank's right to receive the same, shall be
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the
failure of any other Revolving Credit Bank to make its
payment under this clause (e), the financial condition of
the Company (or any other account party), the existence of
any Default or the termination of the Commitments. Each
such payment to the Issuing Bank shall be made without any
offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

(f) Upon the making of each payment by a Revolving
Credit Bank to the Issuing Bank pursuant to clause (e) above
in respect of any Revolving Letter of Credit, such Bank
shall, automatically and without any further action on the
part of the Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, acquire
(i) a participation in an amount equal to such payment in
the Reimbursement Obligation in respect of such Revolving
Letter of Credit owing to the Issuing Bank by the Company
hereunder and under the Revolving Letter of Credit Documents
relating to such Revolving Letter of Credit and (ii) a
participation in a percentage equal to such Bank's Revolving
Credit Commitment Percentage in any interest or other
amounts payable by the Company hereunder and under such
Revolving Letter of Credit Documents in respect of such
Reimbursement Obligation (other than the commissions,
charges, costs and expenses payable to the Issuing Bank
pursuant to clause (g) of this Section 2.04). Upon receipt
by the Issuing Bank from or for account of the Company of
any payment in respect of any such Reimbursement Obligation
or any such interest or other amount (including by way of
setoff or application of proceeds of any collateral
security) the Issuing Bank shall promptly pay to the Agent
for account of each Revolving Credit Bank entitled thereto,
such Revolving Credit Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentage of such payment, each such payment by the Issuing
Bank to be made in the same money and funds in which
received by the Issuing Bank. In the event any payment
received by the Issuing Bank and so paid to the Revolving
Credit Banks hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned by the Issuing Bank, each Revolving Credit Bank
shall, upon the request of the Issuing Bank (through the
Agent), repay to the Issuing Bank (through the Agent) the
amount of such payment paid to such Bank, with interest at
the rate specified in clause (j) of this Section 2.04.

(g) The Company shall pay to the Agent for account of
the Issuing Bank in respect of each Revolving Letter of
Credit that is a standby letter of credit an issuance fee in
an amount equal to Letter of Credit Fee Percentage of the
daily average undrawn face amount of such Revolving Letter
of Credit for the period from and including the date of
issuance of such Revolving Letter of Credit (i) in the case
of a Revolving Letter of Credit that expires in accordance
with its terms, to and including such expiration date and
(ii) in the case of a Revolving Letter of Credit that is
drawn in full or is otherwise terminated other than on the
stated expiration date of such Revolving Letter of Credit,
to but excluding the date of such Revolving Letter of Credit
is drawn in full or is terminated (such fee to be non-
refundable and to be paid in arrears on each Quarterly Date
and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date). The Company
shall pay to the Agent for account of the Issuing Bank in
respect of each Revolving Letter of Credit that is a
commercial or documentary letter of credit an issuance fee
in an amount equal to 1% per annum of the initial face
amount of such Letter of Credit for the period from and
including the date of issuance of such Revolving Letter of
Credit to and including the expiration date (such fee to be
non-refundable and to be paid in arrears on each Quarterly
Date and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date). The
Issuing Bank shall pay to the Agent for account of each
revolving Credit Bank (other than the Issuing Bank), from
time to time at reasonable intervals (but in any event at
least quarterly), but only to the extent actually received
from the Company, an amount equal to such Bank's Revolving
Credit Commitment Percentage of all such fees in respect of
each Revolving Letter of Credit (including any such fee in
respect of any period of any renewal or extension thereof).

In addition, the Company shall pay to the Agent for
account of the Issuing Bank a fronting fee in respect of
each Letter of Credit (other than the Qingdao Letter of
Credit) in an amount equal to 1/8 of 1% per annum of the
daily average undrawn face amount of such Revolving Letter
of Credit for the period from and including the date of
issuance of such Revolving Letter of Credit (i) in the case
of a Revolving Letter of Credit that expires in accordance
with its terms, to and including such expiration date and
(ii) in the case of a Revolving Letter of Credit that is
drawn in full or is otherwise terminated other than on the
stated expiration date of such Revolving Letter of Credit,
to but excluding the date such Revolving Letter of Credit is
drawn in full or is terminated (such fee to be
non-refundable and to be paid in arrears on each Quarterly
Date and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date) plus all
commissions, charges (including negotiation fees), costs and
expenses in the amounts customarily charged by the Issuing
Bank from time to time in like circumstances with respect to
the issuance of each Revolving Letter of Credit and drawings
and other transactions relating thereto.

(h) Promptly following the end of each calendar month,
the Issuing Bank shall deliver (through the Agent) to each
Revolving Credit Bank and the Company a notice describing
the aggregate amount of all Revolving Letters of Credit
outstanding at the end of such month. Upon the request of
any Revolving Credit Bank from time to time, the Issuing
Bank shall deliver any other information reasonably
requested by such Bank with respect to each Revolving Letter
of Credit then outstanding.

(i) The issuance by the Issuing Bank of each Revolving
Letter of Credit shall, in addition to the conditions
precedent set forth in Section 7 hereof, be subject to the
conditions precedent that (i) such Revolving Letter of
Credit shall be in such form, contain such terms and support
such transactions as shall be satisfactory to the Issuing
Bank consistent with its then current practices and proce-
dures with respect to letters of credit of the same type and
(ii) the Company shall have executed and delivered such
applications, agreements and other instruments relating to
such Revolving Letter of Credit as the Issuing Bank shall
have reasonably requested consistent with its then current
practices and procedures with respect to letters of credit
of the same type, provided that in the event of any conflict
between any such application, agreement or other instrument
and the provisions of this Agreement or any Security Docu-
ment, the provisions of this Agreement and the Security
Documents shall control.

(j) To the extent that any Bank shall fail to pay any
amount required to be paid pursuant to clause (e) or (f) of
this Section 2.04 on the due date therefor, such Bank shall
pay interest to the Issuing Bank (through the Agent) on such
amount from and including such due date to but excluding the
date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Rate (as in effect from time to time),
provided that if such Bank shall fail to make such payment
to the Issuing Bank within three Business Days of such due
date, then, retroactively to the due date, such Bank shall
be obligated to pay interest on such amount at the
Post-Default Rate.

(k) The issuance by the Issuing Bank of any modifica-
tion or supplement to any Revolving Letter of Credit here-
under shall be subject to the same conditions applicable
under this Section 2.04 to the issuance of new Revolving
Letters of Credit, and no such modification or supplement
shall be issued hereunder unless either (i) the respective
Revolving Letter of Credit affected thereby would have
complied with such conditions had it originally been issued
hereunder in such modified or supplemented form or (ii) each
Revolving Credit Bank shall have consented thereto. Upon
any modification or renewal or reissuance by the Issuing
Bank of the Qingdao Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank
shall forthwith notify the Agent and the Company of the new
Qingdao Letter of Credit Limit for purposes of this
Agreement.

(l) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
the amount of the Qingdao Letter of Credit for all purposes
of this Agreement and the other Basic Documents (including,
without limitation, the usage of the Revolving Credit
Commitments hereunder, the calculation of fee under clause
(g) above and the obligation of the Revolving Credit Banks
to participate in Reimbursement Obligations arising upon
drawings thereunder) shall be deemed to be equal to the
Qingdao Letter of Credit Limit and any Letter of Credit
Liability arising in respect of the Qingdao Letter of Credit
in excess of the Qingdao Letter of Credit Limit shall be
solely for the account of the Issuing Bank, and no other
Bank shall be obligated to participate in such excess
amount, nor shall such excess amount be entitled to the
benefits of the Security Documents.

(m) Pursuant to Section 2.04 of the Existing Credit
Agreement, Chase, as an Issuing Bank, has issued various
Letters of Credit (collectively, the "Existing Letters of
Credit"). On the Effective Date, the Existing Letters of
Credit and the Qingdao Letter of Credit shall automatically,
and without any action on the part of any Person, become
Revolving Letters of Credit hereunder. On the Effective
Date, immediately prior to the satisfaction by the Company
of the conditions precedent to effectiveness set forth in
Section 7 hereof, (i) Chase shall, by assignment from any
Existing Bank that will not be a Revolving Credit Bank
hereunder, acquire all of such Existing Bank's interest in
the Letter of Credit Liabilities (as defined in the Existing
Credit Agreement) as of the Effective Date in respect of the
Existing Letters of Credit and the Qingdao Letter of Credit
(the "Existing Letter of Credit Liabilities") and (ii) the
Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of the
Existing Banks (after giving effect to such assignments) all
letter of credit fees accrued through the Effective Date in
respect of the Existing Letters of Credit and the Qingdao
Letter of Credit. Each Revolving Credit Bank (other than
the Issuing Bank) agrees that, on the Effective Date, it
shall acquire (and, in the case of any Existing Bank that is
a Revolving Credit Bank, it shall automatically continue)
interests in the Existing Letter of Credit Liabilities in
such amounts so that the Revolving Credit Banks shall hold
Existing Letter of Credit Liabilities ratably in accordance
with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments.

The Company hereby indemnifies and holds harmless each Revolving
Credit Bank and the Agent from and against any and all claims and
damages, losses, liabilities (including, without limitation,
consequential damages), costs or expenses that such Bank or the
Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such Bank or the
Agent by any Person whatsoever) by reason of or in connection
with the execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or
refusal to pay by the Issuing Bank under any Revolving Letter of
Credit; provided that the Company shall not be required to
indemnify any Bank or the Agent for any claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the
extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence
of the Issuing Bank in determining whether a request presented
under any Revolving Letter of Credit complied with the terms of
such Revolving Letter of Credit or (y) in the case of the Issuing
Bank, such Bank's failure to pay under any Revolving Letter of
Credit after the presentation to it of a request strictly
complying with the terms and conditions of such Revolving Letter
of Credit. Nothing in this Section 2.04 is intended to limit the
other obligations of the Company, any Bank or the Agent under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Issuing Bank shall not be liable for
consequential damages.

2.05 Changes of Commitments.

(a) The aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitments shall be automatically reduced to zero on the
Revolving Credit Termination Date.

(b) The Company shall have the right at any time or
from time to time (i) so long as no Revolving Credit Loans or
Letter of Credit Liabilities in respect of Revolving Letters of
Credit are outstanding, to terminate the Revolving Credit
Commitments, (ii) to reduce the aggregate unused amount of the
Revolving Credit Commitments (for which purpose use of the
Revolving Credit Commitments shall be deemed to include the
aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Liabilities in respect of
Revolving Letters of Credit), (iii) to terminate the Term Loan
Commitments (but only if simultaneously therewith or prior
thereto the Barton Letter of Credit Commitments and the Revolving
Credit Commitments are being or have been terminated in full) and
(iv) so long as the Barton Letter of Credit is no longer out-
standing, to terminate the Barton Letter of Credit Commitments;
provided that (x) the Company shall give notice of each such
termination or reduction as provided in Section 4.05 hereof and
(y) each partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount at
least equal to $1,000,000 or in multiples of $500,000 in excess
thereof.

(c) The aggregate amount of the Term Loan Commitments
shall be automatically reduced to zero on the Term Loan
Commitment Termination Date.

(d) The Company will from time to time take such
action on its part, and will use reasonable efforts to cause the
Seller Representatives (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agree-
ment) from time to time to take such action on their part, as
shall be necessary to cause the beneficiary under the Barton
Letter of Credit to instruct that the face amount of the Barton
Letter of Credit be reduced on the dates and in the amounts
specified in Section 2.12(a) of the Stock Purchase Agreement. 
Each reduction in the face amount of the Barton Letter of Credit
shall result in an automatic and simultaneous reduction in the
aggregate amount of the Barton Letter of Credit Commitments in an
amount equal to the amount of such reduction. Any portion of the
Barton Letter of Credit Commitments not used on the Barton Letter
of Credit Termination Date shall be automatically terminated. 

(e) The Commitments once terminated or reduced may not
be reinstated.

2.06 Commitment Fee. The Company shall pay to the
Agent for account of each Bank a commitment fee on the daily
average unused amount of such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment
(for which purpose the aggregate amount of any Letter of Credit
Liabilities in respect of Revolving Letters of Credit shall be
deemed to be a pro rata (based on the Revolving Credit Commit-
ments) use of each Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment), for the
period from and including the date hereof to but not including
the earlier of the date such Revolving Credit Commitment is
terminated and the Revolving Credit Termination Date, at a rate
per annum equal to 3/8 of 1%. The Company shall pay to the Agent
for account of each Bank a commitment fee on the daily average
unused amount of such Bank's Term Loan Commitment, for the period
from and including the date hereof to but not including the
earlier of the date such Term Loan Commitment is terminated and
the Term Loan Commitment Termination Date, at a rate per annum
equal to 3/8 of 1%. The Company shall pay to the Agent for
account of the Barton Letter of Credit Banks a commitment fee on
the daily average unused amount of such Bank's Barton Letter of
Credit Commitment (for which purpose the aggregate amount of the
Letter of Credit Liabilities in respect of the Barton Letter of
Credit shall be deemed to be a pro rata (based on the Barton
Letter of Credit Commitments) use of such Bank's Barton Letter of
Credit Commitment), for the period from and including the date
hereof to but not including the earlier of the date such Barton
Letter of Credit Commitment is terminated and the Barton Letter
of Credit Termination Date, at a rate per annum of 3/8 of 1%. 
Accrued commitment fees shall be payable on each Quarterly Date
and on the earlier of the date the relevant Commitments are
terminated and the Revolving Credit Termination Date (in the case
of the Revolving Credit Commitments) or the Term Loan Commitment
Termination Date (in the case of the Term Loan and Barton Letter
of Credit Commitments). All commitment fees hereunder shall be
computed as set forth in Section 4.03 hereof.

2.07 Lending Offices. The Loans of each Type made by
each Bank shall be made and maintained at such Bank's Applicable
Lending Office for Loans of such Type.

2.08 Several Obligations; Remedies Independent. The
failure of any Bank (such Bank, a "Non-Funding Bank") to make any
Loan to be made by it on the date specified therefor shall not
relieve any other Bank (each such other Bank, an "Other Bank") of
its obligation to make its Loan on such date, but neither any
Other Bank nor the Agent shall be responsible for the failure of
any Non-Funding Bank to make a Loan to be made by such Non-
Funding Bank, and no Non-Funding Bank shall have any obligation
to the Agent or any Other Bank for the failure by such Non-
Funding Bank to make any Loan required to be made by such Non-
Funding Bank. The foregoing shall not relieve any Non-Funding
Bank from any liability it may have to the Company in respect of
its failure to honor its obligation to make the respective Loan. 
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, each
Bank hereby agrees with each other Bank that no Bank shall take
any action to protect or enforce its rights arising out of this
Agreement or the Notes (including, without limitation, exercising
any rights of off-set) without first obtaining the prior written
consent of the Agent or the Majority Banks, it being the intent
of the Banks that any such action to protect or enforce rights
under this Agreement and the Notes shall be taken in concert and
at the direction or with the consent of the Agent or the Majority
Banks and not individually by a single Bank.

2.09 Notes.

(a) The Revolving Credit Loans (other than the
Swingline Loans) made by each Bank shall be evidenced by a single
promissory note of the Company substantially in the form of
Exhibit A-1 hereto, dated the date hereof, payable to such Bank
in a principal amount equal to the amount of its Revolving Credit
Commitment as originally in effect and otherwise duly completed.

(b) The Term Loans made by each Bank shall be
evidenced by two promissory notes of the Company each
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto, dated the date
hereof, payable to such Bank in the respective principal amounts
provided in the next sentence and otherwise duly completed. The
aggregate principal amount of such notes executed and delivered
to any Bank shall be equal to the amount of such Bank's Term Loan
Commitment as originally in effect, the first of which notes (the
"Mortgage Note") being in a principal amount equal to 2/224 of
the amount of such Bank's Term Loan Commitment and to be secured
by all of the collateral security provided for pursuant to the
Security Documents (including, without limitation, the Mortgages
covering real property of the Obligors in New York) and the
second of which notes (the "Non-Mortgage Note") being in a
principal amount equal to 222/224 of the amount of such Bank's
Term Loan Commitment and to be secured by all of the collateral
security provided for pursuant to the Security Documents
(excluding, however, the Mortgages covering real property of the
Obligors in New York). Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, all payments and prepayments of the
Term Loans hereunder shall be deemed to be applied first to the
portion of the Term Loans evidenced by the Non-Mortgage Notes
(until the same shall have been paid in full) and last to the
portion of the Term Loans evidenced by the Mortgage Notes.

(c) The Swingline Loans made by the Swingline Bank
shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of the Company
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-3 hereto, dated the date
hereof, payable to the Swingline Bank in a principal amount equal
to $8,000,000 and otherwise duly completed.

(d) The date, amount, Type, interest rate and duration
of Interest Period (if applicable) of each Loan of each Class
made by each Bank to the Company, and each payment made on
account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Bank
on its books and, prior to any transfer of the Note evidencing
the Loans of such Class held by it, endorsed by such Bank on the
schedule attached to such Note or any continuation thereof;
provided that the failure of such Bank to make any such recorda-
tion or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the
Company to make a payment when due of any amount owing hereunder
or under such Note in respect of the Loans to be evidenced by
such Note.

(e) No Bank shall be entitled to have its Notes
subdivided, by exchange for promissory notes of lesser denomina-
tions or otherwise, except in connection with a permitted assign-
ment of all or any portion of such Bank's relevant Commitment,
Loans and Notes pursuant to Section 12.06(b) hereof.

2.10 Optional Prepayments and Conversions or
Continuations of Loans. Subject to Section 4.04 hereof, the
Company shall have the right to prepay Loans, or to Convert Loans
of one Type into Loans of another Type or Continue Loans of one
Type as Loans of the same Type, at any time or from time to time,
provided that: (a) the Company shall give the Agent notice of
each such prepayment, Conversion or Continuation as provided in
Section 4.05 hereof (and, upon the date specified in any such
notice of prepayment, the amount to be prepaid shall become due
and payable hereunder); (b) Eurodollar Loans may be prepaid or
Converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Loans; and (c) prepayments of the Term Loans, shall be applied to
the installments of the Term Loans in inverse order of their
maturities.

2.11 Mandatory Prepayments and Reductions of Commit-
ments.

(a) Borrowing Base. Until the Revolving Credit
Termination Date, the Company shall from time to time immediately
prepay the Revolving Credit Loans (and/or provide cover for
Letter of Credit Liabilities in respect of Revolving Letters of
Credit as specified in clause (h) below) in such amounts as shall
be necessary so that at all times the aggregate outstanding
amount of the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding together with
the Letter of Credit Liabilities in respect of Revolving Letters
of Credit shall not exceed the Borrowing Base, such amount to be
applied, first, to Revolving Credit Loans outstanding and,

the Loans (and/or provide cover for the Letter of Credit Liabili-
ties as specified in clause (h) below), and the Commitments shall
be subject to automatic reduction, on the dates, and in the

be subject to automatic reduction, in an aggregate amount equal
to the excess of (A) 65% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year
over (B) the aggregate amount of prepayments of Term Loans made
during such fiscal year pursuant to Section 2.10 hereof and,
after the payment in full of the Term Loans, the aggregate amount

fied in clause (h) below), and the Commitments shall be subject
to automatic reduction, in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of
the Net Available Proceeds of the Current Disposition and such
prior Dispositions, such prepayment and reduction to be effected
in each case in the manner and to the extent specified in
clause (g) of this Section 2.11.

shall be effected as follows:

(i) first, the amount of the prepayment specified in
such clauses shall be applied to the Term Loans in the
inverse order of the maturities of the installments of the
Term Loans then outstanding; 

(ii) second, the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be
automatically reduced by an amount equal to any excess over
the amount referred to in the foregoing clause (i) (and to
the extent that, after giving effect to such reduction, the
aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans,
together with the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit
Liabilities in respect of Revolving Letters of Credit would
exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Company shall,
first, prepay Revolving Credit Loans and, second, provide

of Credit as specified in clause (h) below.

(h) Cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities. In the
event that the Company shall be required pursuant to this
Section 2.11 to provide cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities,
the Company shall effect the same by paying to the Agent immedi-
ately available funds in an amount equal to the required amount,
which funds shall be retained by the Agent in the Collateral
Account (as provided therein as collateral security in the first
instance for the Letter of Credit Liabilities) until such time as
the Letters of Credit shall have been terminated and all of the
Letter of Credit Liabilities paid in full.

(i) Change of Control. In the event that the Company
shall be required pursuant to the provisions of any instrument
evidencing or governing any Subordinated Indebtedness to redeem,
or make an offer to redeem or repurchase, all or any portion of
such Subordinated Indebtedness as a result of a change of control
(however defined), then, concurrently with the occurrence of the
event giving rise to such change of control, the Company shall
prepay the Loans (and/or provide cover for the Letter of Credit
Liabilities as specified in clause (h) above) in full, and the
Commitments shall be automatically reduced to zero.

(j) Subordinated Indebtedness. Without limiting the
obligation of the Company to obtain the consent of the Majority
Banks to the issuance of any Subordinated Indebtedness not
permitted hereunder, upon the receipt by the Company of any cash
proceeds from any issuance of Subordinated Indebtedness, the
Company shall prepay the Loans (and/or provide cover for the

therewith) minus (B) the cash proceeds so received and applied to
refinance other Subordinated Indebtedness as contemplated by
Section 9.22 hereof, such prepayment and reduction to be effected

and other amounts to be made by the Company under this Agreement
and the Notes and, except to the extent otherwise provided
therein, all payments to be made by the Company under any other
Basic Document, shall be made in Dollars, in immediately avail-
able funds, without deduction, set-off or counterclaim, to the
Agent at account number NYAO-DI-900-9-000002 maintained by the
Agent with Chase at the Principal Office, not later than
1:00 p.m. New York time on the date on which such payment shall

date to be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding

(b) The Company shall, at the time of making each
payment under this Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank,
specify to the Agent (which shall so notify the intended
recipient(s) thereof) the Loans, Reimbursement Obligations or
other amounts payable by the Company hereunder to which such
payment is to be applied (and in the event that the Company fails
to so specify, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Agent may distribute such payment to the Banks
for application in such manner as it or the Majority Banks,
subject to Section 4.02 hereof, may determine to be appropriate).

(c) Each payment received by the Agent under this
Agreement or any Note for account of any Bank shall be paid by
the Agent promptly to such Bank, in immediately available funds,
for account of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for the Loan
or other obligation in respect of which such payment is made.

(d) If the due date of any payment under this
Agreement or any Note would otherwise fall on a day that is not a
Business Day, such date shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any principal so
extended for the period of such extension.

4.02 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent
otherwise provided herein: (a) each borrowing of Loans of a
particular Class from the Banks under Section 2.01 hereof shall
be made from the relevant Banks, each payment of commitment fee
under Section 2.06 hereof in respect of Commitments of a particu-
lar Class shall be made for account of the relevant Banks, and
each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of
a particular Class under Section 2.05 hereof shall be applied to
the respective Commitments of such Class of the relevant Banks,
pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments
of such Class; (b) the making, Conversion and Continuation of
Revolving Credit Loans and Term Loans of a particular Type (other
than Conversions provided for by Section 5.04 hereof) shall be
made pro rata among the relevant Banks according to the amounts
of their respective Revolving Credit and Term Loan Commitments
(in the case of making of Loans) or their respective Revolving
Credit Loans and Term Loans (in the case of Conversions and
Continuations of Loans) and the then current Interest Period for
each Eurodollar Loan shall be coterminous; (c) each payment or
prepayment of principal of Revolving Credit Loans and Term Loans
by the Company shall be made for account of the relevant Banks
pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal
amounts of the Loans of such Class held by them; and (d) each
payment of interest on Revolving Credit Loans and Term Loans by
the Company shall be made for account of the relevant Banks pro
rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans
then due and payable to the respective Banks. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, borrowings, payments and prepayments of Swingline
Loans shall be made without regard to the foregoing provisions of
this Section 4.02; provided that each mandatory prepayment made
pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof in respect of Revolving Credit
Loans shall be applied ratably to all Revolving Credit Loans
(including, without limitation, the Swingline Loans).

4.03 Computations. Interest on Loans and Reimburse-
ment Obligations and commitment fee and letter of credit fees
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual
days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which payable.

4.04 Minimum Amounts. Except for mandatory prepay-
ments made pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof and Conversions or
prepayments made pursuant to Section 5.04 hereof, each borrowing,
Conversion and partial prepayment of principal of Loans shall be
in an aggregate amount at least equal to $1,000,000 or in
multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof (borrowings, Conversions
or prepayments of or into Loans of different Types or, in the
case of Eurodollar Loans, having different Interest Periods at
the same time hereunder to be deemed separate borrowings,
Conversions and prepayments for purposes of the foregoing, one
for each Type or Interest Period). Anything in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, the aggregate principal amount of
Eurodollar Loans having the same Interest Period shall be in an
amount at least equal to $2,000,000 or in multiples of $100,000
in excess thereof and, if any Eurodollar Loans would otherwise be
in a lesser principal amount for any period, such Loans shall be
Base Rate Loans during such period. As provided in Section
2.01(c)(iii) hereof, the provisions of this Section 4.04 shall
not apply to Swingline Loans.

4.05 Certain Notices. Notices by the Company to the
Agent of terminations or reductions of the Commitments, of
borrowings, Conversions, Continuations and optional prepayments
of Loans and of Classes of Loans, of Types of Loans and of the
duration of Interest Periods shall be irrevocable and shall be
effective only if received by the Agent not later than 12:00 noon
New York time on the number of Business Days prior to the date of
the relevant termination, reduction, borrowing, Conversion,
Continuation or prepayment or the first day of such Interest
Period specified below:

Number of
Business
Notice Days Prior

Termination or reduction
of Commitments 4

Borrowing or prepayment of,
or Conversions into,
Base Rate Loans 1

Borrowing or prepayment of,
Conversions into, Continuations
as, or duration of Interest
Period for, Eurodollar Loans 3

Each such notice of termination or reduction shall specify the
amount and the Class of the Commitments to be terminated or
reduced. Each such notice of borrowing, Conversion, Continuation
or optional prepayment shall specify the Class of Loans to be
borrowed, Converted, Continued or prepaid and the amount (subject
to Section 4.04 hereof) and Type of each Loan to be borrowed,
Converted, Continued or prepaid and the date of borrowing,
Conversion, Continuation or optional prepayment (which shall be a
Business Day). Each such notice of the duration of an Interest
Period shall specify the Loans to which such Interest Period is
to relate. The Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of the
contents of each such notice. In the event that the Company
fails to select the Type of Loan, or the duration of any Interest
Period for any Eurodollar Loan, within the time period and other-
wise as provided in this Section 4.05, such Loan (if outstanding
as a Eurodollar Loan) will be automatically Converted into a Base
Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period for
such Loan or (if outstanding as a Base Rate Loan) will remain as,
or (if not then outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Loan. 
As provided in Section 2.01(c)(iii) hereof, the provisions of
this Section 4.05 shall not apply to Swingline Loans.

4.06 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the
Agent shall have been notified by a Bank or the Company (the
"Payor") prior to the date on which the Payor is to make payment
to the Agent of (in the case of a Bank) the proceeds of a Loan to
be made by such Bank, or a participation in a Letter of Credit
drawing or an interest in an Existing Loan to be acquired by such
Bank, hereunder or (in the case of the Company) a payment to the
Agent for account of one or more of the Banks hereunder (such
payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which notice
shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend
to make the Required Payment to the Agent, the Agent may assume
that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon
such assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount
thereof available to the intended recipient(s) on such date; and,
if the Payor has not in fact made the Required Payment to the
Agent, the recipient(s) of such payment shall, on demand, repay
to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on
the date (the "Advance Date") such amount was so made available
by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day and,
if such recipient(s) shall fail promptly to make such payment,
the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount, on demand,
from the Payor, together with interest as aforesaid, provided
that if neither the recipient(s) nor the Payor shall return the
Required Payment to the Agent within three Business Days of the
Advance Date, then, retroactively to the Advance Date, the Payor
and the recipient(s) shall each be obligated to pay interest on
the Required Payment as follows:

(i) if the Required Payment shall represent a payment
to be made by the Company to the Banks, the Company and the
recipient(s) shall each be obligated retroactively to the
Advance Date to pay interest in respect of the Required
Payment at the Post-Default Rate (and, in case the
recipient(s) shall return the Required Payment to the Agent,
without limiting the obligation of the Company under
Section 3.02 hereof to pay interest to such recipient(s) at
the Post-Default Rate in respect of the Required Payment),
and

(ii) if the Required Payment shall represent proceeds
of a Loan to be made by the Banks to the Company, the Payor
and the Company shall each be obligated retroactively to the
Advance Date to pay interest in respect of the Required
Payment at the rate of interest provided for such Required
Payment pursuant to Section 3.02 hereof (and, in case the
Company shall return the Required Payment to the Agent,
without limiting any claim the Company may have against the
Payor in respect of the Required Payment).

4.07 Sharing of Payments, Etc.

(a) The Company agrees that, in addition to (and
without limitation of) any right of set-off, banker's lien or
counterclaim a Bank may otherwise have, each Bank shall be
entitled, at its option (but subject, as between the Banks, to
the provisions of the last sentence of Section 2.08 hereof), to
offset balances held by it for account of the Company at any of
its offices, in Dollars or in any other currency, against any
principal of or interest on any of such Bank's Loans, Reimburse-
ment Obligations or any other amount payable to such Bank here-
under, that is not paid when due (regardless of whether such
balances are then due to the Company), in which case it shall
promptly notify the Company and the Agent thereof, provided that
such Bank's failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity thereof.

(b) If any Bank shall obtain from any Obligor payment
of any principal of or interest on any Loan of any Class or
Letter of Credit Liability owing to it or payment of any other
amount under this Agreement or any Note held by it or any other
Basic Document through the exercise of any right of set-off,
banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise
(other than from the Agent as provided herein), and, as a result
of such payment, such Bank shall have received a greater percent-
age of the principal of or interest on the Loans of such Class or
Letter of Credit Liabilities or such other amounts then due here-
under or thereunder by such Obligor to such Bank than the percent-
age received by any other Bank, it shall promptly purchase from
such other Banks participations in (or, if and to the extent
specified by such Bank, direct interests in) the Loans of such
Class or Letter of Credit Liabilities or such other amounts,
respectively, owing to such other Banks (or in interest due
thereon, as the case may be) in such amounts, and make such other
adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end
that all the Banks shall share the benefit of such excess payment
(net of any expenses that may be incurred by such Bank in obtain-
ing or preserving such excess payment) pro rata in accordance
with the unpaid principal of and/or interest on the Loans of such
Class or Letter of Credit Liabilities or such other amounts,
respectively, owing to each of the Banks. To such end all the
Banks shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the
resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored.

(c) The Company agrees that any Bank so purchasing
such a participation (or direct interest) may exercise all rights
of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar rights with
respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were a
direct holder of Loans or other amounts (as the case may be)
owing to such Bank in the amount of such participation.

(d) Nothing contained herein shall require any Bank to
exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Bank to
exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right
with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of any
Obligor. If, under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar law, any Bank receives a secured claim in lieu of a
set-off to which this Section 4.07 applies, such Bank shall, to
the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such
secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Banks
entitled under this Section 4.07 to share in the benefits of any
recovery on such secured claim.

Section 5. Yield Protection, Etc. 

5.01 Additional Costs.

(a) The Company shall pay directly to each Bank from
time to time such amounts as such Bank may reasonably determine
to be necessary to compensate such Bank for any costs that such
Bank reasonably determines are attributable to its making or
maintaining of any Eurodollar Loans or its obligation to make any
Eurodollar Loans hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receiv-
able by such Bank hereunder in respect of any of such Loans or
such obligation (such increases in costs and reductions in
amounts receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"),
resulting from any Regulatory Change that:

(i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts
payable to such Bank under this Agreement or its Notes in
respect of any of such Loans (other than taxes imposed on or
measured by the overall net income of such Bank or of its
Applicable Lending Office for any of such Loans by the
jurisdiction in which such Bank has its principal office or
such Applicable Lending Office); or

(ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirements (other than the Reserve
Requirement utilized in the determination of the Eurodollar
Rate for such Loan) relating to any extensions of credit or
other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities
of, such Bank (including, without limitation, any of such
Loans or any deposits referred to in the definition of
"Eurodollar Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof), or any
commitment of such Bank (including, without limitation, the
Commitments of such Bank hereunder); or

(iii) imposes any other condition affecting this
Agreement or its Notes (or any of such extensions of credit
or liabilities) or its Commitments.

If any Bank requests compensation from the Company under this
Section 5.01(a), the Company may, by notice to such Bank (with a
copy to the Agent), suspend the obligation of such Bank there-
after to make or Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base
Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans, until the Regulatory Change
giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case
the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable),
provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such
Bank to receive the compensation so requested.

(b) Without limiting the effect of the provisions of
paragraph (a) of this Section 5.01, in the event that, by reason
of any Regulatory Change, any Bank either (i) incurs Additional
Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level
of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of
such Bank that includes deposits by reference to which the
interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in
this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other
assets of such Bank that includes Eurodollar Loans or (ii)
becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category
of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Bank so
elects by notice to the Company (with a copy to the Agent), the
obligation of such Bank to make or Continue, or to Convert Base
Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be suspended
until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which
case the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable).

(c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.01 (but without duplication), the
Company shall pay directly to each Bank from time to time on
request such amounts as such Bank may reasonably determine to be
necessary to compensate such Bank (or, without duplication, the
bank holding company of which such Bank is a subsidiary) for any
costs that it reasonably determines are attributable to the main-
tenance by such Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office or such
bank holding company), pursuant to any law or regulation or any
interpretation, directive or request (whether or not having the
force of law and whether or not failure to complete therewith
would be unlawful) of any court or governmental or monetary
authority (i) following any Regulatory Change or (ii) implement-
ing any risk-based capital guideline or other requirement
(whether or not having the force of law and whether or not the
failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) heretofore or
hereafter issued by any government or governmental or supervisory
authority implementing at the national level the Basel Accord
(including, without limitation, the Final Risk-Based Capital
Guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (12 C.F.R. Part 208, Appendix A; 12 C.F.R. Part 225,
Appendix A) and the Final Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (12 C.F.R. Part 3,
Appendix A)), of capital in respect of its Commitments or Loans
(such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount
equal to any reduction of the rate of return on assets or equity
of such Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office or such bank
holding company) to a level below that which such Bank (or any
Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding company) could
have achieved but for such law, regulation, interpretation,
directive or request). For purposes of this Section 5.01(c) and
Section 5.06 hereof, "Basel Accord" shall mean the proposals for
risk-based capital framework described by the Basel Committee on
Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices in its paper
entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and
Capital Standards" dated July 1988, as amended, modified and
supplemented and in effect from time to time or any replacement
thereof.

(d) Each Bank shall notify the Company of any event
occurring after the date of this Agreement entitling such Bank to
compensation under paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 5.01 as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within 45 days, after
such Bank obtains actual knowledge thereof; provided that (i) if
any Bank fails to give such notice within 45 days after it
obtains actual knowledge of such an event, such Bank shall, with
respect to compensation payable pursuant to this Section 5.01 in
respect of any costs resulting from such event, only be entitled
to payment under this Section 5.01 for costs incurred from and
after the date 45 days prior to the date that such Bank does give
such notice and (ii) each Bank will designate a different Applic-
able Lending Office for the Loans of such Bank affected by such
event if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the
amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole opinion of
such Bank, be disadvantageous to such Bank, except that such Bank
shall have no obligation to designate an Applicable Lending
Office located in the United States of America. Each Bank will
furnish to the Company a certificate setting forth the basis and
amount of each request by such Bank for compensation under
paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 5.01. Determinations and
allocations by any Bank for purposes of this Section 5.01 of the
effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b)
of this Section 5.01, or of the effect of capital maintained
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 5.01, on its costs or
rate of return of maintaining Loans or its obligation to make
Loans, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of
the amounts required to compensate such Bank under this
Section 5.01, shall be conclusive.

5.02 Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determina-
tion of any Eurodollar Base Rate for any Interest Period:

(a) the Agent determines, which determination shall be
conclusive, that quotations of interest rates for the rele-
vant deposits referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar
Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof are not being provided in
the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for
purposes of determining rates of interest for Eurodollar
Loans as provided herein; or

(b) if the related Loans are Revolving Credit Loans,
the Majority Revolving Credit Banks or, if the related Loans
are Term Loans, the Majority Term Banks determine, which
determination shall be conclusive, and notify the Agent that
the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definition
of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof upon the
basis of which the rate of interest for Eurodollar Loans for
such Interest Period is to be determined are not likely
adequately to cover the cost to such Banks of making or
maintaining Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Company and each Bank prompt notice
thereof and, so long as such condition remains in effect, the
Banks shall be under no obligation to make additional Eurodollar
Loans, to Continue Eurodollar Loans or to Convert Base Rate Loans
into Eurodollar Loans, and the Company shall, on the last day(s)
of the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding
Eurodollar Loans, either prepay such Loans or Convert such Loans
into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.10 hereof.

5.03 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any
Bank or its Applicable Lending Office to honor its obligation to
make or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Bank shall
promptly notify the Company thereof (with a copy to the Agent)
and such Bank's obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert
Loans of any other Type into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended
until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain
Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 5.04
hereof shall be applicable).

5.04 Treatment of Affected Loans. If the obligation
of any Bank to make Eurodollar Loans or to Continue, or to
Convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended
pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof, such Bank's Eurodollar
Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on
the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for
Eurodollar Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by
Section 5.01(b) or 5.03 hereof, on such earlier date as such Bank
may specify to the Company with a copy to the Agent) and, unless
and until such Bank gives notice as provided below that the
circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof that gave
rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

(a) to the extent that such Bank's Eurodollar Loans
have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of
principal that would otherwise be applied to such Bank's
Eurodollar Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate
Loans; and

(b) all Loans that would otherwise be made or
Continued by such Bank as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or
Continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate
Loans of such Bank that would otherwise be Converted into
Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.

If such Bank gives notice to the Company with a copy to the Agent
that the circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof
that gave rise to the Conversion of such Bank's Eurodollar Loans
pursuant to this Section 5.04 no longer exist (which such Bank
agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist)
at a time when Eurodollar Loans made by other Banks are out-
standing, such Bank's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically
Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest
Period(s) for such outstanding Eurodollar Loans, to the extent
necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by
the Banks holding Eurodollar Loans and by such Bank are held pro
rata (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in
accordance with their respective Commitments.

5.05 Compensation. The Company shall pay to the Agent
for account of each Bank, upon the request of such Bank through
the Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the
reasonable opinion of such Bank) to compensate it for any loss,
cost or expense that such Bank determines is attributable to:

(a) any payment, mandatory or optional prepayment or
Conversion of a Eurodollar Loan made by such Bank for any
reason (including, without limitation, the acceleration of
the Loans pursuant to Section 10 hereof) on a date other
than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or

(b) any failure by the Company for any reason (includ-
ing, without limitation, the failure of any of the condi-
tions precedent specified in Section 7 hereof to be satis-
fied) to borrow a Eurodollar Loan from such Bank on the date
for such borrowing specified in the relevant notice of
borrowing given pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof.

Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such
compensation shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of (i) the amount of interest that otherwise would have accrued
on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or Converted or not
borrowed for the period from the date of such payment, prepay-
ment, Conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of the then
current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a
failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan that would
have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing) at the
applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein
over (ii) the amount of interest that otherwise would have
accrued on such principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the
interest component of the amount such Bank would have bid in the
London interbank market for Dollar deposits of leading banks in
amounts comparable to such principal amount and with maturities
comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by such
Bank).

5.06 Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit. 
Without limiting the obligations of the Company under
Section 5.01 hereof (but without duplication), if as a result of
any Regulatory Change or any risk-based capital guideline or
other requirement heretofore or hereafter issued by any govern-
ment or governmental or supervisory authority implementing at the
national level the Basel Accord there shall be imposed, modified
or deemed applicable any tax, reserve, special deposit, capital
adequacy or similar requirement against or with respect to or
measured by reference to Letters of Credit issued or to be issued
hereunder and the result shall be to increase the cost to any
Bank or Banks of issuing (or purchasing participations in) or
maintaining its obligation hereunder to issue (or purchase
participations in) any Letter of Credit hereunder or reduce any
amount receivable by any Bank hereunder in respect of any Letter
of Credit (which increases in cost, or reductions in amount
receivable, shall be the result of such Bank's or Banks' reason-
able allocation of the aggregate of such increases or reductions
resulting from such event), then, upon demand by such Bank or
Banks (through the Agent), the Company shall pay immediately to
the Agent for account of such Bank or Banks, from time to time as
specified by such Bank or Banks (through the Agent), such addi-
tional amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Bank or
Banks (through the Agent) for such increased costs or reductions
in amount. A statement as to such increased costs or reductions
in amount incurred by any such Bank or Banks, submitted by such
Bank or Banks to the Company shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error as to the amount thereof.

Section 6. Guarantee.

6.01 Guarantee. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby
jointly and severally guarantee to each Bank and the Agent and
their respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in
full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or

Interest Rate Protection Agreements entered into pursuant to the
requirements set forth in Section 9.16 hereof and all other
amounts from time to time owing to the Banks or the Agent by the
Company under this Agreement and under the Notes and by any
Obligor under any of the other Basic Documents, in each case
strictly in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof (such
obligations being herein collectively called the "Guaranteed
Obligations"). The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby further jointly
and severally agree that if the Company shall fail to pay in full

maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the
terms of such extension or renewal.

6.02 Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of
the Subsidiary Guarantors under Section 6.01 hereof are absolute
and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the value,
genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the obli-
gations of the Company under this Agreement, the Notes or any
other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or
any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of
or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any
other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor,
it being the intent of this Section 6.02 that the obligations of
the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and
unconditional, joint and several, under any and all circum-
stances. In full recognition and in furtherance of the fore-
going, each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that:

(a) Without affecting the enforceability or effective-
ness of Section 6.01 hereof in accordance with its terms and
without affecting, limiting, reducing, discharging or termi-
nating the liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor, or the

notice or demand of any kind or nature whatsoever:

(i) amend, supplement, modify, extend, renew,

such amendment with respect to any Basic Document to
which it is a party);

its discretion determine;

(viii) release any Person (including any other
Subsidiary Guarantor) from any personal liability with

any Bank a party in possession in contemplation of law,
except at its option);

(xiv) enter into such other transactions or
business dealings with any other Subsidiary Guarantor,
the Company, any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company
or any other guarantor of all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations as the Agent or any Bank may
desire; and 

(xv) do all or any combination of the actions set
forth in this 6.02(a).

(b) The enforceability and effectiveness of this
Section 6 and the liability of the Subsidiary Guarantors,

any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or the lack of
perfection or continuing perfection or failure of the
priority of any lien on any collateral for all or any

any other Person or to take any action whatsoever to
mitigate or reduce such or any other Subsidiary
Guarantor's liability under this Section 6, neither the
Agent nor any Bank being under any obligation to take

obligations under this Agreement, the Notes or any
other agreement or instrument referred to herein or
therein;

(vi) any failure of the Agent or any Bank to give
notice after any Default of sale or other disposition

(viii) any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure or
sale of, or other election of remedies with respect to,
any interest in real property or other collateral
serving as security for all or any part of the Guaran-
teed Obligations, even though such foreclosure, sale or
election of remedies may impair the subrogation rights
of any Subsidiary Guarantor or may preclude any Subsidi-
ary Guarantor from obtaining reimbursement, contribu-
tion, indemnification or other recovery from any other
Subsidiary Guarantor, the Company any other guarantor
or any other Person and even though the Company may

(c) Each Subsidiary Guarantor represents and warrants
to the Agent that it has established adequate means of
obtaining financial and other information pertaining to the
business, operations and condition (financial and otherwise)
of the Company and its properties on a continuing basis and
that such Subsidiary Guarantor is now and will in the future
remain fully familiar with the business, operations and
condition (financial and otherwise) of the Company and its
properties. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further represents
and warrants that it has reviewed and approved this Agree-
ment and the related Basic Documents and is fully familiar
with the transactions contemplated by such Basic Documents
and that it will in the future remain fully familiar with
such transaction and with any new Basic Documents and the
transaction contemplated by such Basic Documents. Each
Subsidiary Guarantor hereby expressly waives and relin-
quishes any duty on the part of the Agent or the Banks
(should any such duty exist) to disclose to such or any
other Subsidiary Guarantor any matter of fact or other
information related to the business, operations or condition
(financial or otherwise) of the Company or its properties or
to any Basic Documents or the transactions undertaken
pursuant to, or contemplated by, such Basic Documents,
whether now or in the future known by the Agent or any Bank.

6.03 Reinstatement. The obligations of the Subsidiary
Guarantors under this Section 6 shall be automatically reinstated
if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on
behalf of the Company in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceed-
ings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise and the Subsidi-
ary Guarantors jointly and severally agree that they will
indemnify the Agent and each Bank on demand for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees of
counsel) incurred by the Agent or such Bank in connection with
such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and
expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that
such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or
similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

6.04 Subrogation. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
waives all rights of subrogation or contribution, whether arising
by contract or operation of law (including, without limitation,
any such right arising under the Federal Bankruptcy Code) or
otherwise by reason of any payment by it pursuant to the provi-
sions of this Section 6 and further agrees with the Company for
the benefit of each of its creditors (including, without limita-
tion, each Bank and the Agent) that any such payment by it shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, constitute a dividend on
the common stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor owned by the
Company or a return of capital paid by such Subsidiary Guarantor
to the Company and, otherwise, an investment in the equity
capital of the Company by such Subsidiary Guarantor. Each
Subsidiary Guarantor understands that, by reason of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.04, the exercise by the Agent or any
Bank of the rights, remedies, powers and privileges that it has
under this Section 6 and under the other Basic Documents will
result in nonreimbursable liabilities under this Agreement. 
Nevertheless, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby authorizes and
empowers the Agent and the Banks to exercise, in its or their
sole discretion, any combination of such rights, remedies, powers
and privileges as they, in their sole discretion, shall deem
appropriate.

6.05 Remedies. The Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and
severally agree that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors and
the Banks, the obligations of the Company under this Agreement
and the Notes may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as
provided in Section 10 hereof (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in
said Section 10) for purposes of Section 6.01 hereof notwith-
standing any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing
such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically
due and payable) as against the Company and that, in the event of
such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become
automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not
due and payable by the Company) shall forthwith become due and
payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for purposes of said
Section 6.01.

6.06 Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this
Section 6 is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all
Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising.

6.07 Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any
action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any
state or Federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obliga-
tions of any Subsidiary Guarantor under Section 6.01 hereof would
otherwise be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforce-
able, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on
account of the amount of its liability under said Section 6.01,
then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary,
the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by
such Subsidiary Guarantor, any Bank, the Agent or any other
Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest
amount which is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the
claims of other creditors as determined in such action or
proceeding.

fore delivered to each Bank a true and complete copy of the
Barton Stock Purchase Agreement as in effect on the date hereof.

Barton Stock Purchase Agreement) on or before the one hundred and
eightieth day following the Closing (as so defined) and, as a

the foregoing, the Company will give to the Agent for delivery by
the Agent to each Bank notice of the assertion of any Environ-

hereof);

(b) comply with the requirements of all applicable
laws, rules, regulations and orders of governmental or
regulatory authorities (including, without limitation,
requirements under the relevant statutes relating to 
alcoholic beverages) if failure to comply with such require-
ments could have a Material Adverse Effect;

(c) pay and discharge all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges or levies imposed on it or on its
income or profits or on any of its Property prior to the
date on which penalties attach thereto (except for any such
tax, assessment, charge or levy the payment of which is
being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings and

Adverse Effect;

(d) maintain all of its Properties necessary to its

tatives to gain access to any other information in posses-
sion or obtainable by any of the Obligors for purposes of
bi-annual collateral audits prepared for the Banks, all to
the extent reasonably requested by such Bank or the Agent
(as the case may be).

9.04 Insurance. The Company will, and will cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, keep insured by financially sound and
reputable insurers all Property of a character usually insured by
corporations engaged in the same or similar business similarly
situated against loss or damage of the kinds and in the amounts
customarily insured against by such corporations and carry such
other insurance as is usually carried by such corporations,
provided that in any event the Company will maintain (with
respect to itself and each of its Subsidiaries):

(1) Casualty Insurance -- insurance against loss or
damage covering all of the tangible real and personal
Property and improvements of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries by reason of any Peril (as defined below) in
such amounts (subject to such deductibles as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Majority Banks) as shall be
reasonable and customary and sufficient to avoid the insured
named therein from becoming a co-insurer of any loss under
such policy but in any event in an amount (i) in the case of
fixed assets and equipment (excluding vehicles as to which
the Company may self-insure against physical damage to motor
vehicles in a manner and to the extent that corporations
engaged in the same or similar business similarly situated
customarily self-insure), at least equal to 90% of the
actual replacement cost of such assets (excluding founda-
tion, footings and excavation costs), subject to deductibles
as aforesaid and (ii) in the case of inventory, not less
than the replacement cost thereof, subject to deductibles as
aforesaid, provided that damage resulting from earthquake
and flood may be subject to stop-loss limits not less than
$15,000,000 in the aggregate.

(2) Automobile Liability Insurance for Bodily Injury
and Property Damage -- insurance against liability for
bodily injury and property damage in respect of all vehicles
(whether owned, hired or rented by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) at any time located at, or used in connection
with, its Properties or operations in such amounts as are
then customary for vehicles used in connection with similar
Properties and businesses, but in any event to the extent
required by applicable law.

(3) Comprehensive General Liability Insurance --
insurance against claims for bodily injury, death or
Property damage occurring on, in or about the Properties
(and adjoining streets, sidewalks and waterways) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in such amounts as are then
customary for Property similar in use in the jurisdictions
where such Properties are located.

(4) Workers' Compensation Insurance -- workers'
compensation insurance (including, without limitation,
Employers' Liability Insurance) to the extent required by
applicable law.

(5) Product Liability Insurance -- insurance against
claims for bodily injury, death or Property damage resulting
from the use of products sold by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, products sold,
manufactured or processed by Barton or any of its Subsidi-
aries prior to the Barton Acquisition, products manufactured
or processed by Vintners prior to the Vintners Acquisition
and products manufactured or processed by Heublein prior to
the Heublein Acquisition) in such amounts as are then
customarily maintained by responsible persons engaged in
businesses similar to that of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

(6) Business Interruption Insurance -- insurance
against loss of operating income by reason of any Peril.

(7) Other Insurance -- such other insurance as is
generally carried by owners of similar Properties in the
jurisdictions where such Properties are located, in such
amounts and against such risks as are then customary for
Property similar in use.

Such insurance shall be written by financially responsible
companies selected by the Company and acceptable to the Majority
Banks, and (other than workers' compensation) shall name the
Agent as additional insured, or loss payee, as its interests may
appear. Each policy referred to in this Section 9.04 shall
provide that it will not be canceled or reduced, or allowed to
lapse without renewal, except after not less than 30 days' notice
to the Agent and shall also provide that the interests of the
Agent and the Banks shall not be invalidated by any act or negli-
gence of the Company or any Person having an interest in any
Property covered by the Mortgages nor by occupancy or use of any
such Property for purposes more hazardous than permitted by such
policy nor by any foreclosure or other proceedings relating to
such Property. The Company will advise the Agent promptly of any
policy cancellation, reduction or amendment.

On or before the Effective Date, the Company will
deliver to the Agent certificates of insurance satisfactory to
the Agent evidencing the existence of all insurance required to
be maintained by the Company hereunder setting forth the respec-
tive coverages, limits of liability, carrier, policy number and
period of coverage. The Company will not obtain or carry sepa-
rate insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of
loss with that required by this Section 9.04 unless the Agent is
the named insured thereunder, with loss payable as provided
herein. The Company will immediately notify the Agent whenever
any such separate insurance is obtained and shall deliver to the
Agent the certificates evidencing the same.

Without limiting the obligations of the Company under
the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.04, in the event the
Company shall fail to maintain in full force and effect insurance
as required by the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.04,
then the Agent may, but shall have no obligation so to do,
procure insurance covering the interests of the Banks and the
Agent in such amounts and against such risks as the Agent (or the
Majority Banks) shall reasonably deem appropriate with respect to
the requirements of the foregoing provisions and the Company
shall reimburse the Agent in respect of any premiums paid by the
Agent in respect thereof.

For purposes hereof, the term "Peril" shall mean,
collectively, fire, lightning, flood, windstorm, hail,
earthquake, explosion, riot and civil commotion, vandalism and
malicious mischief, damage from aircraft, vehicles and smoke and
all other perils covered by the "all-risk" endorsement then in
use in the jurisdictions where the Properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are located.

9.05 Prohibition of Fundamental Changes. The Company
will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter
into any transaction of merger or consolidation or amalgamation,
or liquidate, wind up or dissolve itself (or suffer any liqui-
dation or dissolution). The Company will not, nor will it permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, acquire any business or Property
from, or capital stock of, or be a party to any acquisition of,
any Person except for the Heublein Acquisition, Barton Acquisi-
tion and the Vintners Acquisition, purchases of inventory and
other Property to be sold or used in the ordinary course of
business, Investments permitted under Section 9.08 hereof, and
Capital Expenditures permitted under Section 9.13 hereof. The
Company will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to,

or Property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired (including,
without limitation, receivables and leasehold interests, but

equal to the Net Available Proceeds in respect of such Equity
Issuance (provided that, the aggregate amount of all such
adjustments shall be no greater than $60,000,000) and (ii) upon
receipt by the Banks of the financial statements referred to in
Section 9.01(i) hereof (so long as the amount determined pursuant
to the succeeding clause (y) is greater than zero), each of the
respective amounts set forth above shall be adjusted by
subtracting therefrom an amount equal to the product of (x) .75

effect one or more Interest Rate Protection Agreements with one
or more of the Banks (and/or with a bank or other financial
institution having capital, surplus and undivided profits of at
least $500,000,000), which effectively enables the Company (in a
manner satisfactory to the Majority Banks), to protect itself
against three-month London interbank offered rates exceeding

to the following respective amounts at the following respective
dates:

indirectly: (a) make any Investment in an Affiliate; (b) trans-
fer, sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of any Property to
an Affiliate; (c) merge into or consolidate with or purchase or
acquire Property from an Affiliate; or (d) enter into any other
transaction directly or indirectly with or for the benefit of an
Affiliate (including, without limitation, guarantees and assump-
tions of obligations of an Affiliate); provided that (x) any
Affiliate who is an individual may serve as a director, officer
or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and receive
reasonable compensation for his or her services in such capacity
and (y) the Company and its Subsidiaries may enter into transac-
tions (other than extensions of credit by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to an Affiliate) providing for the leasing of
Property, the rendering or receipt of services or the purchase or
sale of inventory and other Property in the ordinary course of
business if the monetary or business consideration arising there-
from would be substantially as advantageous to the Company and
its Subsidiaries as the monetary or business consideration which
would obtain in a comparable transaction with a Person not an
Affiliate. During any period that the Company is a public
company regulated by, and required to file regular periodic
reports with, the Securities and Exchange Commission, any compen-
sation paid to an executive officer of the Company (who is an
Affiliate) which has been specifically approved by the board of
directors of the Company during such period will be deemed to be
reasonable for purposes of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may enter into so-called split-dollar life
insurance agreements substantially in the form of Schedule VI
hereto, so long as the aggregate amount of premiums payable by
the Company during any fiscal year pursuant to such agreements
shall not exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate. 

9.18 Use of Proceeds. The Company will use the

ments); provided that, neither the Agent nor any Bank shall have
any responsibility as to the use of any of such proceeds.

9.19 Certain Obligations Respecting Subsidiaries. The
Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, take
such action from time to time as shall be necessary to ensure
that each of its Subsidiaries is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary (other
than with respect to BB Servicios, S.A. de C.V. or Monarch Wine
Company, Limited Partnership, as to which the ownership interest
of the Company shall not fall below that indicated on Schedule
III hereto). The Company will not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to enter into, after the date of this Agreement, any indenture,
agreement, instrument or other arrangement that, directly or
indirectly, prohibits or restrains, or has the effect of pro-
hibiting or restraining, or imposes materially adverse conditions
upon, the incurrence or payment of Indebtedness, the granting of
Liens, the declaration or payment of dividends, the making of
loans, advances or Investments or the sale, assignment, transfer
or other disposition of Property.

9.20 Additional Subsidiary Guarantors. The Company
will take such action, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to
take such action, from time to time as shall be necessary to
ensure that all Subsidiaries of the Company (other than Inactive
Subsidiaries) are Subsidiary Guarantors and, thereby, "Obligors"
hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in
the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall form
any new Subsidiary after the date hereof which the Company or the
respective Subsidiary anticipates will not be an Inactive
Subsidiary (or, in the event that any Inactive Subsidiary shall
cease to be an Inactive Subsidiary), the Company or the respec-
tive Subsidiary will cause such new Subsidiary (or such Inactive
Subsidiary which ceases to be an Inactive Subsidiary) to become a
"Subsidiary Guarantor" (and, thereby, an "Obligor") hereunder
pursuant to a written instrument in form and substance satisfac-
tory to each Bank and the Agent, and to deliver such proof of
corporate action, incumbency of officers, opinions of counsel and
other documents as is consistent with those delivered by each
Obligor pursuant to Section 7.01 hereof upon the Effective Date
or as any Bank or the Agent shall have requested.

9.21 Modifications of Certain Documents. The Company
will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, consent
to any modification, supplement or waiver of any of the provi-
sions of (i) the Barton Acquisition Documents (excluding
adjustments agreed to by the Seller Representative (as defined in
the Barton Stock Purchase Agreement) and the Company pursuant to
Section 2.1(e) of the Barton Stock Purchase Agreement), (ii) the
Vintners Acquisition Documents or (iii) the Heublein Acquisition
Documents without, in the case of any of clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) above, the prior consent of the Agent (with the approval of
the Majority Banks). In addition, notwithstanding the provisions
of Sections 9.05(f) and 9.05(g), the Company will not consent to
any modification, supplement or waiver of its Certificate of
Incorporation as in effect on the date hereof without the prior
consent of the Agent (with the approval of the Majority Banks).

9.22 Subordinated Indebtedness. The Company may after
the date hereof incur additional Subordinated Indebtedness
subject to the following conditions each of which shall have been
fulfilled in form and substance satisfactory to the Majority
Banks:

(a) such Indebtedness shall be subordinated to the
obligations of the Company to pay principal of and interest
on the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations and all other
amounts payable hereunder on terms in form and substance
satisfactory to the Majority Banks, it being understood that
the terms and provisions of the Senior Subordinated Note
Indenture are satisfactory to the Majority Banks;

(b) such Indebtedness shall be an obligation of the
Company only, and none of its Subsidiaries shall be
contingently or otherwise obligated in respect thereof,
unless subordinated to the obligations of such Subsidiary to
pay principal of and interest on the Loans, the
Reimbursement Obligations and all other amounts payable
hereunder on terms in form and substance satisfactory to the
Majority Banks, it being understood that the terms and
provisions of the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture are
satisfactory to the Majority Banks;

(c) the aggregate principal amount of such Indebt-
edness together with the aggregate principal amount of all
other Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company shall not
exceed $280,000,000 at any one time (including interest that
will accrue after the date of issuance);

(d) the proceeds of such Indebtedness shall be applied
either to (i) refinance other Subordinated Indebtedness or
(ii) prepay Loans (and/or provide cover for the Letter of
Credit Liabilities) as provided in Section 2.11(j) hereof,
provided that the aggregate principal amount of any such
refinancing Subordinated Indebtedness shall not exceed the
aggregate principal amount, plus accrued interest and
premium, if any, on the Subordinated Indebtedness being
refinanced;

(e) the terms of such Indebtedness shall not provide
for payment of any portion of the principal thereof prior to
the date six months after the final maturity of the Loans
hereunder;

(f) at the time of issuance of such Indebtedness, and
after giving effect thereto, the Interest Coverage Ratio
shall not be less than the ratio in effect at that time as
set out in Section 9.14 hereof (Interest Expense for such
purpose to be calculated under the assumption that such
Indebtedness was issued at the beginning of such period and
that any other Indebtedness to be retired with the proceeds
thereof was in fact retired on such date of issuance);

(g) terms in respect of financial and other covenants,
events of default and mandatory prepayments applicable to
such Indebtedness shall have been reasonably determined by
the Majority Banks to be terms that are at the time
customary in the market for subordinated debt being incurred
by borrowers, and in transactions, comparable in the
reasonable judgment of the Majority Banks to the Company and
proposed debt issuance, it being understood that the terms
in respect of financial and other covenants, events of
default and mandatory prepayments included in the Senior
Subordinated Note Indenture are, in the judgment of the
Majority Banks, comparable to those customary in such
market;

(h) at the time of issuance of such Indebtedness, and
after giving effect thereto, the Company shall be in
compliance with Sections 9.10, 9.11, 9.12 and 9.15 hereof
(the determination of such ratios (and such amount with
respect to Tangible Net Worth) shall be calculated under the
assumption that such Indebtedness was issued, at the
beginning of such period and that any other Indebtedness to
be retired with the proceeds thereof was in fact retired on
such date of issuance), and the Company shall have delivered
to the Agent a certificate of its chief financial officer to
such effect setting forth in reasonable detail the
computations necessary to determine such compliance; and

(i) at the time of such issuance, and after giving
effect thereto, no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing hereunder and the Company shall
have delivered to the Agent a certificate of its chief
financial officer to such effect. 

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value, or set
apart any money for a sinking, defeasance or other analogous fund
for, the purchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition
of, or make any voluntary payment or prepayment of the principal
of or interest on, or any other amount owing in respect of, any
Subordinated Indebtedness, except that the Company may (i) make
payments on the regularly-scheduled payment dates with respect to
the principal of and interest on the Subordinated Indebtedness as
in effect on the date hereof (or, as to any Subordinated Indebt-
edness issued after the date hereof, as originally in effect),
and (ii) so long as no Default shall have occurred and be contin-
uing (or will occur as a result of such payment), from the pro-
ceeds of Subordinated Indebtedness issued in accordance with the
first paragraph of this Section 9.22, redeem Subordinated
Indebtedness that is being refinanced as contemplated in clause
(d) of the first paragraph of this Section 9.22. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will consent to any modifi-
cation, supplement or waiver of any of the provisions of any
Subordinated Indebtedness without the prior consent of the Agent
(with the approval of the Majority Banks).

9.23 Eligible Inventory Located in Off-Premises
Warehouses. The Company will not, nor will it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, maintain Eligible Inventory at Off-Premises
Warehouses in an amount in excess of $40,000,000 (as to the
Company and all Subsidiaries) at any time unless either (a) the
amount of such excess is subtracted from the amount of Eligible
Inventory in determining the Borrowing Base or (b) the Company or
such Subsidiary has taken such steps as are necessary to ensure
that the Banks have a valid prior perfected security interest in
such Eligible Inventory (including, without limitation, the
filing of an appropriate uniform commercial code financing state-
ment in the respective jurisdiction in which such Eligible
Inventory is located naming the Company or such Subsidiary as
"secured party" and the delivery of satisfactory evidence that
such an arrangement constitutes a consignment or first priority
perfected security interest under applicable law and that such
security interest has been validly assigned to the Agent under
the Security Agreement).

Section 10. Events of Default. If one or more of the
following events (herein called "Events of Default") shall occur
and be continuing:

(a) The Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall
default in the payment when due (whether at stated maturity
or at mandatory or optional prepayment) of any principal of
any Loan or any Reimbursement Obligation; or the Company or
any Subsidiary Guarantor shall default in the payment when
due of any interest on any Loan or any Reimbursement Obliga-
tion, or any fee or any other amount payable by it hereunder
or under any other Basic Document and such default shall
continue unremedied for two (or more) Business Days; or

(b) The Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall default
in the payment when due of any principal of or interest on any
of its other Indebtedness, or in the payment when due of any
amount under any Interest Rate Protection Agreement, or in the
payment when due of any amount under the Barton Stock Purchase
Agreement, provided that such payment due and owing is in an
amount greater than or equal to $100,000; or any event speci-
fied in any note, agreement, indenture or other document
evidencing or relating to Indebtedness in an aggregate princi-
pal amount greater than or equal to $100,000 or any event
specified in any Interest Rate Protection Agreement shall occur
(and shall continue beyond any applicable period of grace) if
the effect of such event is to cause, or to permit the holder
or holders of such Indebtedness (or a trustee or agent on
behalf of such holder or holders) to cause, such Indebtedness
to become due, or to be prepaid in full (whether by redemption,
purchase, offer to purchase or otherwise), prior to its stated

which claims or liabilities (insofar as they are payable by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries but after deducting

Effect; or

THEREUPON: (1) in the case of an Event of Default other than one
referred to in clause (f) or (g) of this Section 10 with respect
to any Obligor, the Agent may, by notice to the Company, termi-
nate the Commitments and/or terminate the Barton Letter of Credit
(as provided therein) and/or declare all or any portion of the
principal amount then outstanding of, and the accrued interest
on, the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations and other amounts
payable by the Obligors hereunder and under the Notes (including,
without limitation, any amounts payable under Section 5.05
hereof) to be forthwith due and payable (provided that (x) if so
requested by the Majority Revolving Credit Banks or, with respect
to Swingline Loans, by the Swingline Bank, the Agent shall take
such action with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitments
and/or the Revolving Credit Loans, Reimbursement Obligations in
respect of Revolving Letters of Credit, Swingline Loans and such
interest and other amounts to the extent owed to the Revolving
Credit Banks, or the Swingline Bank, as the case may be, (y) if
so requested by the Majority Term Banks, the Agent shall take
such action with respect to the Term Loan Commitments and the
Term Loans and such interest and other amounts to the extent owed
to the Term Loan Banks and (z) if so requested by the Majority
Barton Letter of Credit Banks, the Agent shall take such action
with respect to the Barton Letter of Credit Commitments and the
termination of the Barton Letter of Credit (as provided therein)
and/or the Reimbursement Obligations in respect of the Barton
Letter of Credit and such interest and other amounts to the
extent owed to the Barton Letter of Credit Banks), whereupon such
amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentment,
demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived by each Obligor; and (2) in the case
of the occurrence of an Event of Default referred to in clause
(f) or (g) of this Section 10 with respect to any Obligor, the
Commitments shall automatically be terminated and all of the
principal amount then outstanding of, and the accrued interest
on, the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations and all other
amounts payable by the Obligors hereunder and under the Notes
(including, without limitation, any amounts payable under
Section 5.05 hereof) shall automatically become immediately due
and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other
formalities of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived
by each Obligor (and the Agent may terminate the Barton Letter of
Credit as provided therein).

In addition, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default (if the Agent has declared
the principal amount then outstanding of, and accrued interest
on, the Revolving Credit Loans and/or the Barton Letter of Credit
Loans and all other amounts payable by the Company hereunder and
under the Notes to be due and payable), the Company agrees that
it shall, if requested by the Agent or the Majority Revolving
Credit Banks or the Majority Barton Letter of Credit Banks, as
the case may be, through the Agent (and, in the case of any Event
of Default referred to in clause (f) or (g) of this Section 10
with respect to the Company, forthwith, without any demand or the
taking of any other action by the Agent or such Banks) provide
cover for the Letter of Credit Liabilities by paying to the Agent
immediately available funds in an amount equal to the then aggre-
gate undrawn face amount of all effected Letters of Credit, which
funds shall be held by the Agent in the Collateral Account as
collateral security in the first instance for the Letter of
Credit Liabilities and be subject to withdrawal only as therein
provided.

Section 11. The Agent.

11.01 Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Bank
hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act as
its agent hereunder and under the other Basic Documents with such
powers as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of
this Agreement and of the other Basic Documents, together with
such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
Agent (which term as used in this sentence and in Section 11.05
and the first sentence of Section 11.06 hereof shall include
reference to its affiliates and its own and its affiliates'
officers, directors, employees and agents): (a) shall have no
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in
this Agreement and in the other Basic Documents, and shall not by
reason of this Agreement or any other Basic Document be a trustee
for any Bank; (b) shall not be responsible to the Banks for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement or in any other Basic Document, or in any certifi-
cate or other document referred to or provided for in, or
received by any of them under, this Agreement, any Note or any
other Basic Document, or for the value, validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Basic Document or any other document referred to or
provided for herein or therein or for any failure by the Company
or any other Person to perform any of its obligations hereunder
or thereunder; (c) shall not be required to initiate or conduct
any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder or under any
other Basic Document, except as may be necessary to enforce any
of the Security Documents; (d) shall not be responsible for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any
other Basic Document or under any other document or instrument
referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection
herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct; and (e) shall not be responsible to the
Company or the Banks for (i) determining whether or not any of
the transactions contemplated hereby qualifies as a Highly
Leveraged Transaction, (ii) notifying the Banks regarding the
Highly Leveraged Transaction status of any transaction
contemplated hereby or of any change in that status or (iii) the
correctness of any determination as to Highly Leveraged
Transaction status. The Agent may employ agents and
attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence
or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys- in-fact selected
by it in good faith. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of
any Note as the holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and
until a notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have
been filed with the Agent, together with the consent of the
Company to such assignment or transfer (to the extent provided in
Section 12.06(b) hereof).

11.02 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication
(including, without limitation, any thereof by telephone,
telecopy, telex, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of
the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected
by the Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement or any other Basic Document, the Agent shall in
all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, hereunder or thereunder in accordance with instructions
given by the Majority Banks or, if provided herein, in accordance
with the instructions given by the Majority Revolving Credit
Banks, the Majority Term Banks or all of the Banks as is required
in such circumstance, and such instructions of such Banks and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding
on all of the Banks.

11.03 Defaults. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default. The Agent
shall (subject to Sections 11.01 and 11.07 hereof) take such
action with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the
Majority Banks or, if provided herein, the Majority Revolving
Credit Banks or the Majority Term Banks, provided that, unless
and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as
it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Banks except
to the extent that this Agreement expressly requires that such
action be taken, or not be taken, only with the consent or upon
the authorization of the Majority Banks, the Majority Revolving
Credit Banks, the Majority Term Banks or all of the Banks.

11.04 Rights as a Bank. With respect to its
Commitments and the Loans made by it, Chase (and any successor
acting as Agent) in its capacity as a Bank hereunder shall have
the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may
exercise the same as though it were not acting as the Agent, and
the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise
indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. Chase
(and any successor acting as Agent) and its affiliates may (with-
out having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from,
lend money to, make investments in and generally engage in any
kind of banking, trust or other business with the Obligors (and
any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates) as if it were not acting
as the Agent, and Chase and its affiliates may accept fees and
other consideration from the Obligors for services in connection
with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for
the same to the Banks.

11.05 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify
the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 12.03
hereof, but without limiting the obligations of the Company under
said Section 12.03, and including in any event any payments under
any indemnity that the Agent is required to issue to any bank
referred to in Section 4.02 of the Security Agreement to which
remittances in respect of Accounts, as defined therein, are to be
made) ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal amount
of the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations held by the Banks (or,
if no Loans or Reimbursement Obligations are at the time out-
standing, ratably in accordance with their respective Commit-
ments), for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent (including
by any Bank) arising out of or by reason of any investigation in
or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
other Basic Document or any other documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (including, without limitation, the costs and
expenses that the Company is obligated to pay under Section 12.03
hereof, and including also any payments under any indemnity that
the Agent is required to issue to any bank referred to in
Section 4.02 of the Security Agreement to which remittances in
respect of Accounts, as defined therein, are to be made, but
excluding, unless a Default has occurred and is continuing,
normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the perfor-
mance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any
of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents,
provided that no Bank shall be liable for any of the foregoing to
the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the party to be indemnified.

11.06 Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Banks. Each
Bank agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on
the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis of the Company and its Subsidiaries and decision to
enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at
the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any of the
other Basic Documents. The Agent shall not be required to keep
itself informed as to the performance or observance by any
Obligor of this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents or
any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein
or to inspect the Properties or books of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other docu-
ments and information expressly required to be furnished to the
Banks by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other
information concerning the affairs, financial condition or
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of
their affiliates) that may come into the possession of the Agent
or any of its affiliates.

11.07 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly
required of the Agent hereunder and under the other Basic
Documents, the Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in
failing or refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it
shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction from the
Banks of their indemnification obligations under Section 11.05
hereof against any and all liability and expense that may be
incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action.

11.08 Resignation or Removal of Agent. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided
below, the Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof
to the Banks and the Company, and the Agent may be removed at any
time with or without cause by the Majority Banks. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Majority Banks shall have the right
to appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have
been so appointed by the Majority Banks and shall have accepted
such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving
of notice of resignation or the Majority Banks' removal of the
retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Banks, appoint a successor Agent, that shall be a bank which has
an office in New York, New York with a combined capital and
surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such succes-
sor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent,
and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's resignation or
removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 11
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
the Agent.

11.09 Consents under Basic Documents. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 12.04 hereof with respect to this
Agreement, the Agent may, with the prior consent of the Majority
Banks (but not otherwise), consent to any modification, supple-
ment or waiver under any of the Basic Documents, provided that,
without the prior consent of each Bank, the Agent shall not
(except as provided herein or in the Security Documents) release
any collateral or otherwise terminate any Lien under any Basic
Document providing for collateral security, or agree to
additional obligations being secured by such collateral security
(unless the Lien for such additional obligations shall be junior
to the Lien in favor of the other obligations secured by such
Basic Document), except that no such consent shall be required,
and the Agent is hereby authorized and instructed, to release any
Lien covering Property which is the subject of a disposition of
Property permitted hereunder or to which the Majority Banks have
consented.

Section 12. Miscellaneous.

12.01 Waiver. No failure on the part of the Agent or
any Bank to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of
dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement or any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege under this Agreement or any Note preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege. The remedies provided herein are cumulative
and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

12.02 Notices. All notices, requests and other
communications provided for herein and under the Security Docu-

below its name on the signature pages hereof (below the name of
the Company, in the case of any Subsidiary Guarantor); or, as to
any party, at such other address as shall be designated by such
party in a notice to each other party. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, all such communications shall be

receipt, in each case given or addressed as aforesaid.

reimburse (a) the Agent for paying all reasonable out-of-pocket

Agreement and the other Basic Documents and the extension of
credit hereunder and (ii) any modification, supplement or waiver

for all costs, expenses and other charges in respect of any
collateral audit requested by the Agent or the Majority Banks
pursuant to Section 9.01(g) hereof.

The Company hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and
each Bank and their respective directors, officers, employees,
attorneys and agents from, and hold each of them harmless
against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses incurred by any of them (including, without limitation,
any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses
incurred by the Agent to any Bank, whether or not the Agent or
any Bank is a party thereto) arising out of or by reason of any

threatened investigation or litigation or other proceedings)
relating to the extensions of credit hereunder or any actual or

Commitment(s) (or portion(s) thereof) so assigned. Upon each
such assignment the assigning Bank shall pay the Agent an
assignment fee of $3,000.

(c) A Bank may sell or agree to sell to one or more
other Persons a participation in all or any part of any Loans,
Revolving Letter of Credit Interest or Barton Letter of Credit
Interest held by it, or in its Commitments, in which event each
purchaser of a participation (a "Participant") shall be entitled
to the rights and benefits of the provisions of Section 9.01(j)
hereof with respect to its participation in such Loans, Revolving
Letter of Credit Interest, Barton Letter of Credit Interest and
Commitments as if (and the Company shall be directly obligated to
such Participant under such provisions as if) such Participant
were a "Bank" for purposes of said Section, but, except as other-
wise provided in Section 4.07(c) hereof, shall not have any other
rights or benefits under this Agreement or any Note or any other
Basic Document (the Participant's rights against such Bank in
respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agree-
ments executed by such Bank in favor of the Participant). All
amounts payable by the Company to any Bank under Section 5 hereof
in respect of Loans, Revolving Letter of Credit Interest or
Barton Letter of Credit Interest held by it, and its Commitments,
shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold or agreed to
sell any participations in such Loans, Revolving Letter of Credit
Interest, Barton Letter of Credit Interest and Commitments, and
as if such Bank were funding each of such Loan, Revolving Letter
of Credit Interest, Barton Letter of Credit Interest and Commit-
ments in the same way that it is funding the portion of such
Loan, Revolving Letter of Credit Interest, Barton Letter of
Credit Interest and Commitments in which no participations have
been sold. In no event shall a Bank that sells a participation
agree with the Participant to take or refrain from taking any
action hereunder or under any other Basic Document except that
such Bank may agree with the Participant that it will not, with-
out the consent of the Participant, agree to (i) increase or
extend the term, or extend the time or waive any requirement for
the reduction or termination, of such Bank's related Commitment,
(ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal of or
interest on the related Loan or Loans, Reimbursement Obligations
or any portion of any fee hereunder payable to the Participant,
(iii) reduce the amount of any such payment of principal, (iv)
reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon, or any fee
hereunder payable to the Participant, to a level below the rate
at which the Participant is entitled to receive such interest or
fee, (v) alter the rights or obligations of the Company to prepay
the related Loans or (vi) consent to any modification, supplement
or waiver hereof or of any of the other Basic Documents to the
extent that the same, under Section 11.09 or 12.04 hereof,
requires the consent of each Bank.

(d) In addition to the assignments and participations
permitted under the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.06,
any Bank may assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans
and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security
pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by
such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the
assigning Bank from its obligations hereunder.

(e) A Bank may furnish any information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Bank
from time to time to assignees and participants (including pros-
pective assignees and participants), subject, however, to the
provisions of Section 12.12(b) hereof.

(f) Anything in this Section 12.06 to the contrary
notwithstanding, no Bank may assign or participate any interest
in any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation held by it hereunder to
the Company or any of its Affiliates without the prior written
consent of each Bank.

(g) Anything in this Section 12.06 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Swingline Bank may not assign, or sell a
participation in, the Swingline Loans.

12.07 Survival. The obligations of the Company under
Sections 5.01, 5.05, 5.06 and 12.03 hereof and the obligations of
the Banks under Section 11.05 hereof shall survive the repayment
of the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations and the termination of
the Commitments.

and section headings appearing herein are included solely for
convenience of reference and are not intended to affect the

constitute one and the same instrument and any of the parties
hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such
counterpart.

12.10 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This
Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the law of the State of New York. Each Obligor
hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York and
of any New York state court sitting in New York City for the

applicable law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have
to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such
a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

12.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OBLIGOR, THE AGENT
AND EACH BANK HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS

in the form of Exhibit J hereto; and provided further that in no
event shall any Bank or the Agent be obligated or required to
return any materials furnished by the Company.

Section 4. Cash Proceeds of Collateral.

4.01 Collateral Account. Pursuant to the Existing
Security Agreement a cash collateral account with the Agent (the
"Collateral Account") has been established in the name and under
the control of Chase into which there shall be deposited from
time to time the cash proceeds of any of the Collateral
(including proceeds of insurance thereon) required to be deliv-
ered to the Agent pursuant hereto and into which the Obligors may
from time to time deposit any additional amounts which any of
them wishes to pledge to the Agent for the benefit of the Banks
as additional collateral security hereunder. The balance from
time to time in the Collateral Account shall constitute part of
the Collateral hereunder and shall not constitute payment of the
Secured Obligations until applied as hereinafter provided. 
Except as expressly provided in the next sentence, the Agent
shall remit the collected balance standing to the credit of the
Collateral Account to or upon the order of the Obligors as the
Obligors through the Company shall from time to time instruct. 
However, at any time following the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the Agent may (and, if
instructed by the Banks as specified in Section 11.03 of the
Credit Agreement, shall) in its (or their) discretion apply or
cause to be applied (subject to collection) the balance from time
to time standing to the credit of the Collateral Account to the
payment of the Secured Obligations in the manner specified in
Section 5.09 hereof. The balance from time to time in the
Collateral Account shall be subject to withdrawal only as
provided herein.

4.02 Proceeds of Accounts. At any time after the
occurrence and during the continuance of a Default, each Obligor
shall instruct (and, in the event that such Obligor fails to so
instruct within 5 Business Days of the Agent's request therefor,
such Obligor hereby authorizes the Agent so to instruct) all
account debtors and other Persons obligated in respect of all
Accounts to make all payments in respect of the Accounts either
(a) directly to the Agent (by instructing that such payments be
remitted to a post office box which shall be in the name and
under the control of the Agent) or (b) to one or more other banks
in the United States of America (by instructing that such pay-
ments be remitted to a post office box which shall be in the name
and under the control of the Agent) under arrangements, in form
and substance satisfactory to the Agent pursuant to which such
Obligor shall have irrevocably instructed such other bank (and
such other bank shall have agreed) to remit all proceeds of such
payments directly to the Agent for deposit into the Collateral
Account. All payments made to the Agent, as provided in the
preceding sentence, shall be immediately deposited in the
Collateral Account. In addition to the foregoing, each Obligor
agrees that if the proceeds of any Collateral hereunder (includ-
ing the payments made in respect of Accounts) shall be received
by it, such Obligor shall as promptly as possible deposit such
proceeds into the Collateral Account. Until so deposited, all
such proceeds shall be held in trust by such Obligor for and as
the property of the Agent and shall not be commingled with any
other funds or property of such Obligor.

4.03 Investment of Balance in Collateral Account. 
Amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be invested
from time to time in such Permitted Investments as the Obligors
through the Company (or, after the occurrence and during the
continuance of a Default, the Agent) shall determine, which
Permitted Investments shall be held in the name and be under the
control of the Agent, provided that at any time after the occur-
rence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Agent may (and, if instructed by the Banks as specified in
Section 11.03 of the Credit Agreement, shall) in its (or their)
discretion at any time and from time to time elect to liquidate
any such Permitted Investments and to apply or cause to be
applied the proceeds thereof to the payment of the Secured
Obligations in the manner specified in Section 5.09 hereof. 

4.04 Cover for Letter of Credit Liabilities. Amounts
deposited into the Collateral Account as cover for Letter of
Credit Liabilities under the Credit Agreement pursuant to Section
2.11(h) or Section 10 thereof shall be held by the Agent in a
separate sub-account (designated "Letter of Credit Liabilities
Sub-Account") and all amounts held in such sub-account shall
constitute collateral security first for the Letter of Credit
Liabilities outstanding from time to time and second as
collateral security for the other Secured Obligations hereunder.

Section 5. Further Assurances; Remedies. In
furtherance of the grant of the pledge and security interest
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, the Obligors hereby jointly and
severally agree with each Bank and the Agent as follows:

5.01 Delivery and Other Perfection. Each Obligor
shall:

(a) if any of the above-described shares, securities,
moneys or property required to be pledged by such Obligor
under clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Section 3 hereof are
received by such Obligor, forthwith either (x) transfer and
deliver to the Agent such shares or securities so received
by such Obligor (together with the certificates for any such
shares and securities duly endorsed in blank or accompanied
by undated stock powers duly executed in blank) all of which
thereafter shall be held by the Agent, pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, as part of the Collateral or (y) take
such other action as the Agent shall deem necessary or
appropriate to duly record the Lien created hereunder in
such shares, securities, monies or property referred to in
said clauses (a), (b) and (c);

(b) deliver and pledge to the Agent any and all
Instruments, endorsed and/or accompanied by such instruments
of assignment and transfer in such form and substance as the
Agent may request; provided, that so long as no Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, such Obligor may
retain for collection in the ordinary course any Instruments
received by it in the ordinary course of business and the
Agent shall, promptly upon request of such Obligor through
the Company, make appropriate arrangements for making any
other Instrument pledged by such Obligor available to it for
purposes of presentation, collection or renewal (any such
arrangement to be effected, to the extent deemed appropriate
by the Agent, against trust receipt or like document);

(c) give, execute, deliver, file and/or record any
financing statement, notice, instrument, document, agreement
or other papers that may be necessary or desirable (in the
judgment of the Agent) to create, preserve, perfect or
validate any security interest granted pursuant hereto or to
enable the Agent to exercise and enforce its rights here-
under with respect to such security interest, including,
without limitation, causing any or all of the Stock
Collateral to be transferred of record into the name of the
Agent or its nominee (and the Agent agrees that if any Stock
Collateral is transferred into its name or the name of its
nominee, the Agent will thereafter promptly give to the
respective Obligor copies of any notices and communications
received by it with respect to the Stock Collateral pledged
by such Obligor hereunder), provided that notices to account
debtors in respect of any Accounts or Instruments shall be
subject to the provisions of clause (h) below;

(d) keep full and accurate books and records relating
to the Collateral, and stamp or otherwise mark such books
and records in such manner as the Agent may reasonably
require in order to reflect the security interests granted
by this Agreement;

(e) furnish to the Agent from time to time (but,
unless a Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no
more frequently than annually on August 31 of each year)
statements and schedules further identifying and describing
the Patent Collateral and the Trademark Collateral (and
noting in particular any additional patents and trademarks
acquired by, or requested in the name of, the Obligors) and
such other reports in connection with the Patent Collateral
and the Trademark Collateral, as the Agent may reasonably
request, all in reasonable detail;

(f) promptly upon request of the Agent, following
receipt by the Agent of any statements, schedules or reports
pursuant to clause (e) above, modify this Agreement by
amending Annex 2 and/or 3 hereto to include any Patent or
Trademark which becomes part of the Collateral under this
Agreement;

(g) permit representatives of the Agent, upon
reasonable notice, at any time during normal business hours
to inspect and make abstracts from its books and records
pertaining to the Collateral, and permit representatives of
the Agent to be present at such Obligor's place of business
to receive copies of all communications and remittances
relating to the Collateral, and forward copies of any
notices or communications received by such Obligor with
respect to the Collateral, all in such manner as the Agent
may require;

(h) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
any Default, upon request of the Agent, promptly notify
(and, in the event that such Obligor does not so notify
within 5 Business Days, such Obligor hereby authorizes the
Agent so to notify) each account debtor in respect of any
Accounts or Instruments that such Collateral has been
assigned to the Agent hereunder, and that any payments due
or to become due in respect of such Collateral are to be
made directly to the Agent.

5.02 Other Financing Statements and Liens. Except as
otherwise permitted under Section 9.06 of the Credit Agreement,
without the prior written consent of the Agent (granted with the
authorization of the Banks as specified in Section 11.09 of the
Credit Agreement), the Obligors shall not file or suffer to be on
file, or authorize or permit to be filed or to be on file, in any
jurisdiction, any financing statement or like instrument with
respect to the Collateral in which the Agent is not named as the
sole secured party for the benefit of the Banks.

5.03 Preservation of Rights. The Agent shall not be
required to take steps necessary to preserve any rights against
prior parties to any of the Collateral.

5.04 Special Provisions Relating to Certain
Collateral.

(a) Stock Collateral.

(1) The Obligors will cause the Stock Collateral to
constitute at all times 100% of the total number of shares of
each class of capital stock of each Issuer then outstanding.

(2) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, the Obligors shall have the right to exercise
all voting, consensual and other powers of ownership pertaining
to the Stock Collateral for all purposes not inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, the Notes or
any other instrument or agreement referred to herein or therein,
provided that the Obligors jointly and severally agree that they
will not vote the Stock Collateral in any manner that is incon-
sistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement,
the Notes or any such other instrument or agreement; and the
Agent shall execute and deliver to the Obligors or cause to be
executed and delivered to the Obligors all such proxies, powers
of attorney, dividend and other orders, and all such instruments,
without recourse, as the Obligors may reasonably request for the
purpose of enabling the Obligors to exercise the rights and
powers which they are entitled to exercise pursuant to this
Section 5.04(a)(2).

(3) Unless and until an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, the Obligors shall be entitled to receive and
retain any dividends on the Stock Collateral paid in cash out of
earned surplus.

(4) If any Event of Default shall have occurred, then
so long as such Event of Default shall continue, and whether or
not the Agent or any Bank exercises any available right to
declare any Secured Obligation due and payable or seeks or pur-
sues any other relief or remedy available to it under applicable
law or under this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, the Notes or
any other agreement relating to such Secured Obligation, all
dividends and other distributions on the Stock Collateral shall
be paid directly to the Agent and retained by it in the
Collateral Account as part of the Stock Collateral, subject to
the terms of this Agreement, and, if the Agent shall so request
in writing, the Obligors jointly and severally agree to execute
and deliver to the Agent appropriate additional dividend,
distribution and other orders and documents to that end, provided
that if such Event of Default is cured, any such dividend or
distribution theretofore paid to the Agent shall, upon request of
the Obligors (except to the extent theretofore applied to the
Secured Obligations) be returned by the Agent to the Obligors.

(b) Intellectual Property.

(1) For the purpose of enabling the Agent to exercise
rights and remedies under Section 5.05 hereof at such time as the
Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and
remedies, and for no other purpose, each Obligor hereby grants to
the Agent, to the extent permissible, an irrevocable,
non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or
other compensation to such Obligor) to use, assign, license or
sublicense any of the Intellectual Property now owned or here-
after acquired by such Obligor, wherever the same may be located,
including in such license reasonable access to all media in which
any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all
computer programs used for the compilation or printout thereof.

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, but subject to the provisions of Section 9.05 of the
Credit Agreement which limit the right of the Obligors to dispose
of their property, so long as no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Obligors will be permitted to
exploit, use or not use, enjoy, protect, license, sublicense,
assign, sell, dispose of or take other actions with respect to
the Intellectual Property in the ordinary course of the business
of the Obligors. In furtherance of the foregoing, unless an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing the Agent
shall from time to time, upon the request of the Obligors through
the Company, execute and deliver any instruments, certificates or
other documents, in the form so requested, which the Obligors
through the Company shall have certified are appropriate (in
their judgment) to allow them to take any action permitted above
(including relinquishment of the license provided pursuant to
clause (1) immediately above as to any specific Intellectual
Property). Further, upon the payment in full of all of the
Secured Obligations and cancellation or termination of the
Commitments or release of the Collateral, the Agent shall grant
back to the Obligors the license granted pursuant to clause (1)
immediately above. The exercise of rights and remedies under
Section 5.05 hereof by the Agent shall not terminate the rights
of the holders of any licenses or sublicenses theretofore granted
by the Obligors in accordance with the first sentence of this
clause (2). In addition, the Agent shall release any Lien which
it is authorized and instructed to release pursuant to Section
11.09 of the Credit Agreement. The Agent agrees that, from time
to time upon the written request of the Obligors, the Agent will
execute and deliver such documents and do such other acts and
things as the Obligors may reasonably request in order fully to
effect the purposes of the preceding sentence. 

(c) Motor Vehicles. If at any time requested by the
Agent, deliver to the Agent originals of the certificates of
title or ownership for the Motor Vehicles owned by it with the
Agent listed as lienholder.

(d) Fixtures. Each Fixture Holder hereby covenants
and agrees that the Fixtures will be kept on or at the Property
and that it will not remove any Fixtures from the Property,
except such portions or items of the Fixtures which are consumed
or worn out in ordinary usage, all of which shall be promptly
replaced by the Fixture Holder, except as otherwise permitted by
Section 9.03 or 9.05 of the Credit Agreement. This Agreement
constitutes a "fixture filing" as such term is used in the
Uniform Commercial Code. 

5.05 Events of Default, etc. During the period during
which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:

(i) each Obligor shall, at the request of the
Agent, assemble the Collateral owned by it at such place or
places, reasonably convenient to both the Agent and such
Obligor, designated in its request;

(ii) the Agent may make any reasonable compromise or
settlement deemed desirable with respect to any of the
Collateral and may extend the time of payment, arrange for
payment in installments, or otherwise modify the terms of,
any of the Collateral;

(iii) the Agent shall have all of the rights and
remedies with respect to the Collateral of a secured party
under the Uniform Commercial Code (whether or not said Code
is in effect in the jurisdiction where the rights and
remedies are asserted) and such additional rights and
remedies to which a secured party is entitled under the laws
in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies
hereunder may be asserted, including, without limitation,
the right, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to exer-
cise all voting, consensual and other powers of ownership
pertaining to the Collateral as if the Agent were the sole
and absolute owner thereof (and each Obligor agrees to take
all such action as may be appropriate to give effect to such
right);

(iv) the Agent in its discretion may, in its name or
in the name of the Obligors or otherwise, demand, sue for,
collect or receive any money or property at any time payable
or receivable on account of or in exchange for any of the
Collateral, but shall be under no obligation to do so; and

(v) the Agent may, upon ten Business Days' prior
written notice to the Obligors of the time and place, with
respect to the Collateral or any part thereof which shall
then be or shall thereafter come into the possession,
custody or control of the Agent, the Banks or any of their
respective agents, sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose
of all or any of such Collateral, at such place or places as
the Agent deems best, and for cash or on credit or for
future delivery (without thereby assuming any credit risk),
at public or private sale, without demand of performance or
notice of intention to effect any such disposition or of
time or place thereof (except such notice as is required
above or by applicable statute and cannot be waived) and the
Agent or any Bank or anyone else may be the purchaser,
lessee, assignee or recipient of any or all of the
Collateral so disposed of at any public sale (or, to the
extent permitted by law, at any private sale), and there-
after hold the same absolutely, free from any claim or right
of whatsoever kind, including any right or equity of redemp-
tion (statutory or otherwise), of the Obligors, any such
demand, notice or right and equity being hereby expressly
waived and released. In the event of any sale, assignment,
or other disposition of any of the Trademark Collateral, the
goodwill connected with and symbolized by the Trademark
Collateral subject to such disposition shall be included,
and the Obligors shall supply to the Agent or its designee,
for inclusion in such sale, assignment or other disposition,
all Intellectual Property relating to such Trademark
Collateral. The Agent may, without notice or publication,
adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be
adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and
place fixed for the sale, and such sale may be made at any
time or place to which the same may be so adjourned.

The proceeds of each collection, sale or other disposition under
this Section 5.05, including by virtue of the exercise of the
license granted to the Agent in Section 5.04(b)(1) hereof, shall
be applied in accordance with Section 5.09 hereof.

The Obligors recognize that, by reason of certain
prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and applicable state securities laws, the Agent may be compelled,
with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Collateral, to
limit purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to
acquire the Collateral for their own account, for investment and
not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. The
Obligors acknowledge that any such private sales may be at prices
and on terms less favorable to the Agent than those obtainable
through a public sale without such restrictions, and, notwith-
standing such circumstances, agree that any such private sale
shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable
manner and that the Agent shall have no obligation to engage in
public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any
Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the
respective Issuer or issuer thereof to register it for public
sale.

5.06 Deficiency. If the proceeds of sale, collection
or other realization of or upon the Collateral pursuant to
Section 5.05 hereof are insufficient to cover the costs and
expenses of such realization and the payment in full of the
Secured Obligations, the Obligors shall remain liable for any
deficiency.

5.07 Removals, etc. Without at least 30 days prior
written notice to the Agent, no Obligor shall (i) maintain any of
its books or records with respect to the Collateral at any office
or maintain its chief executive office or its principal place of
business at any place, or permit any Inventory or Equipment to be
located anywhere other than at the address indicated beneath the
signature of the Company to the Credit Agreement or at one of the
locations identified in Annex 5 hereto under its name or in
transit from one of such locations to another or (ii) change its
corporate name, or the name under which it does business, from
the name shown on the signature pages hereto.

5.08 Private Sale. The Agent and the Banks shall
incur no liability as a result of the sale of the Collateral, or
any part thereof, at any private sale pursuant to Section 5.05
hereof conducted in a commercially reasonable manner. Subject to
the Agent and the Banks exercising any rights or remedies in a
commercially reasonable manner, each Obligor hereby waives any
claims against the Agent or any Bank arising by reason of the
fact that the price at which the Collateral may have been sold at
such a private sale was less than the price which might have been
obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount
of the Secured Obligations, even if the Agent accepts the first
offer received and does not offer the Collateral to more than one
offeree.

5.09 Application of Proceeds. Except as otherwise
herein expressly provided and except as provided below in this
Section 5.09, the proceeds of any collection, sale or other
realization of all or any part of the Collateral pursuant hereto,
and any other cash at the time held by the Agent under Section 4
hereof or this Section 5, shall be applied by the Agent:

First, to the payment of the costs and expenses of such
collection, sale or other realization, including reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Agent and the
reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and counsel, and
all expenses incurred and advances made by the Agent in
connection therewith;

Next, to the payment in full of the Secured
Obligations, in each case equally and ratably in accordance
with the respective amounts thereof then due and owing or as
the Banks holding the same may otherwise agree; and

Finally, to the payment to the respective Obligor, or
its successors or assigns, or as a court of competent
jurisdiction may direct, of any surplus then remaining.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the proceeds of any cash or other
amounts held in the "Letter of Credit Liabilities Sub-Account" of
the Collateral Account pursuant to Section 4.04 hereof shall be
applied first to the Letter of Credit Liabilities outstanding
from time to time and second to the other Secured Obligations in
the manner provided above in this Section 5.09.

As used in this Section 5, "proceeds" of Collateral
shall mean cash, securities and other property realized in
respect of, and distributions in kind of, Collateral, including
any thereof received under any reorganization, liquidation or
adjustment of debt of the Obligors or any issuer of or obligor on
any of the Collateral.

5.10 Attorney-in-Fact. Without limiting any rights or
powers granted by this Agreement to the Agent while no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default pursuant to which
the then outstanding principal amount of and accrued interest on
the Loans are declared to be immediately due and payable and 5
Business Days after the occurrence and during the continuance of
any other Event of Default, the Agent is hereby appointed the
attorney-in-fact of each Obligor for the purpose of carrying out
the provisions of this Section 5 and taking any action and
executing any instruments which the Agent may deem necessary or
advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment as
attorney-in-fact is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as the
Agent shall be entitled under this Section 5 to make collections
in respect of the Collateral, the Agent shall have the right and
power to receive, endorse and collect all checks made payable to
the order of any Obligor representing any dividend, payment, or
other distribution in respect of the Collateral or any part
thereof and to give full discharge for the same.

5.11 Perfection. Prior to or concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Obligor shall
(i) file such financing statements and other documents in such
offices as the Agent may request to perfect the security
interests granted by Section 3 of this Agreement and (ii) deliver
to the Agent all certificates identified in Annex 1 hereto,
accompanied by undated stock powers duly executed in blank.

5.12 Termination. When all Secured Obligations shall
have been paid in full and the Commitments of the Banks under the
Credit Agreement and all Letter of Credit Liabilities shall have
expired or been terminated, this Agreement shall terminate, and
the Agent shall forthwith cause to be assigned, transferred and
delivered, against receipt but without any recourse, warranty or
representation whatsoever, any remaining Collateral and money
received in respect thereof, to or on the order of the respective
Obligors and to be released and canceled all licenses and rights
referred to in Section 5.04(b)(1) hereof. The Agent shall also
execute and deliver to the respective Obligors upon such
termination such Uniform Commercial Code termination statements,
certificates for terminating the Liens on the Motor Vehicles and
such other documentation as shall be reasonably requested by the
respective Obligors to effect the termination and release of the
Liens on the Collateral.

5.13 Expenses. The Obligors jointly and severally
agree to pay to the Agent all out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable expenses for legal services of every kind) of, or
incident to, the enforcement of any of the provisions of this
Section 5, or performance by the Agent of any obligations of the
Obligors in respect of the Collateral which the Obligors have
failed or refused to perform, or any actual or attempted sale, or
any exchange, enforcement, collection, compromise or settlement
in respect of any of the Collateral, and for the care of the
Collateral and defending or asserting rights and claims of the
Agent in respect thereof, by litigation or otherwise, including
expenses of insurance, and all such expenses shall be Secured
Obligations to the Agent secured under Section 3 hereof.

5.14 Further Assurances. Each Obligor agrees that,
from time to time upon the written request of the Agent, such
Obligor will execute and deliver such further documents and do
such other acts and things as the Agent may reasonably request in
order fully to effect the purposes of this Agreement.

Section 6. Miscellaneous.

6.01 No Waiver. No failure on the part of the Agent
or any of its agents to exercise, and no course of dealing with
respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise by the Agent or any of its agents of
any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or remedy. The remedies herein are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

waived, altered or amended only by an instrument in writing duly
executed by each Obligor and the Agent (with the consent of the

Any such amendment or waiver shall be binding upon the Agent and
each Bank, each holder of any Secured Obligation and each
Obligor.

responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents
or attorneys-in-fact selected by it in good faith.

6.08 Severability. If any provision hereof is invalid
and unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, (i) the other provisions hereof shall
remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the Agent and the Banks in order
to carry out the intentions of the parties hereto as nearly as
may be possible and (ii) the invalidity or unenforceability of
any provision hereof in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

6.09 The Agent. As provided in Section 11 of the
Credit Agreement, each Bank has appointed The Chase Manhattan
Bank (National Association) as its Agent for purposes of this
Agreement. Following the payment in full of all Secured Obliga-
tions outstanding under the Credit Agreement and the termination
or expiration of the Commitments and Letter of Credit Liabilities
thereunder, the provisions of said Section 11 shall be deemed to

and expiration and termination of the Commitments and Letter of
Credit Liabilities, the term "Majority Banks" (as used in said
