GLOBAL NATURAL RESOURCES ANNOUNCES PURCHASE OF
ITS COMMON STOCK FROM THE NOEL GROUP

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- Global Natural Resources Inc. (NYSE:GNR) announced
today that it has purchased 705,196 shares of its common stock from the Noel
Group Inc. (NASDAQ: NOEL) in a private transaction. The purchase price was
$5,288,970, or $7.50 per share. These shares will be held in Treasury.

"This is a positive economic transaction for Global and its
shareholders. We are grateful for the role that Noel has played as a
constructive shareholder over a number of years. This represents a further
step in a process begun almost two years ago by Noel, of reducing its
involvement in Global," said Robert F. Vagt, President and Chief Executive
Officer. In conjunction with this sale, Noel will reduce its representation on
Global's Board of Directors from four members to two.

Global Natural Resources is engaged in worldwide oil and gas
exploration and production and in natural gas gathering, processing and
marketing. The Company has operations and interests in North America,
Tatarstan - Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Ivory Coast.
