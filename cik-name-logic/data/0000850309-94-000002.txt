Trust Agreement, dated as of December 21, 1993 (the "Basic Agreement"), as
supplemented by Trust Supplement No. ____-____ thereto, dated as of
________ __, 199_ (collectively, the "Agreement"), between the Trustee and
Smith's Food & Drug Centers, Inc., a corporation incorporated under
Delaware law (the "Company"), a summary of certain of the pertinent
provisions of which is set forth below. To the extent not otherwise
defined herein, the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings
assigned to them in the Agreement. This Certificate is one of the duly
authorized Certificates designated as "Pass Through Certificates, ____-
____" (herein called the "Certificates"). This Certificate is issued under
and is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Agreement, to
which Agreement the Certificateholder of this Certificate by virtue of the
acceptance hereof assents and by which such Certificateholder is bound.
The property of the Trust includes certain Notes (the "Trust Property").
Each issue of the Notes is secured by a security interest in an aircraft
leased to the Company.

Each of the Certificates represents a Fractional Undivided
Interest in the Trust and the Trust Property and has no rights, benefits or
interest in respect of any other separate trust established pursuant to the
terms of the Basic Agreement for any other series of certificates issued
pursuant thereto. The undivided percentage interest in the Trust
represented by each of this Certificate (as specified above) and the other

(x) the aggregate of the Face Amount of this Certificate (as specified
above) and of the other Pass Through Certificates, Series ____-____ and (y)

Scheduled Payments. Subject to and in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement, in the event that Special Payments on the Notes are received by
the Trustee, from funds then available to the Trustee, there shall be
distributed on the applicable Special Distribution Date, to the Person in
whose name this Certificate is registered at the close of business on the
15th day preceding the Special Distribution Date, an amount in respect of
such Special Payments on the Notes, the receipt of which has been confirmed
by the Trustee, equal to the product of the percentage interest in the
Trust evidenced by this Certificate and an amount equal to the sum of such
Special Payments so received. If a Regular Distribution Date or Special
Distribution Date is not a Business Day, distribution shall be made on the
immediately following Business Day with the same force and effect as if
made on such Regular Distribution Date or Special Distribution Date and no
interest shall accrue during the intervening period. The Trustee shall
mail notice of each Special Payment and the Special Distribution Date
therefor to the Certificateholder of this Certificate.

Distributions on this Certificate will be made by the Trustee by
check mailed to the Person entitled thereto, without the presentation or
surrender of this Certificate or the making of any notation hereon. Except
as otherwise provided in the Agreement and notwithstanding the above, the
final distribution on this Certificate will be made after notice mailed by
the Trustee of the pendency of such distribution and only upon presentation
and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency of the Trustee
specified in such notice.

The Certificates do not represent a direct obligation of, or an
obligation guaranteed by, or an interest in, the Company or the Trustee or
any affiliate thereof. The Certificates are limited in right or payment,
all as more specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. All
payments or distributions made to Certificateholders under the Agreement
shall be made only from the Trust Property and only to the extent that the
Trustee shall have sufficient income or proceeds from the Trust Property to
make such payments in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Each
Certificateholder of this Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, agrees
that it will look solely to the income and proceeds from the Trust Property
to the extent available for distribution to such Certificateholder as
provided in the Agreement. This Certificate does not purport to summarize
the Agreement and reference is made to the Agreement for information with
respect to the interests, rights, benefits, obligations, proceeds, and
duties evidenced hereby. A copy of the Agreement may be examined during
normal business hours at the principal office of the Trustee, and at such
other places, if any, designated by the Trustee, by any Certificateholder
upon request.

The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of
the Company and the rights of the Certificateholders under the Agreement at
any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the
Certificateholders holding Certificates evidencing Fractional Undivided
Interests aggregating not less than a majority in interest in the Trust.
Any such consent by the Certificateholder of this Certificate shall be
conclusive and binding on such Certificateholder and upon all future
Certificateholders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon
the transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without
the consent of the Certificateholders of any of the Certificates.

As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the Register
upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of transfer at the
offices or agencies maintained by the Trustee in its capacity as Registrar,
or by any successor Registrar, in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New
York, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in
form satisfactory to the Trustee and the Registrar duly executed by the
Certificateholder hereof or such Certificateholder's attorney duly
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of
authorized denominations evidencing the same aggregate Fractional Undivided
Interest in the Trust will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

The Certificates are issuable only as registered Certificates
without coupons in minimum denominations of $1,000 Fractional Undivided
Interests and integral multiples thereof. As provided in the Agreement and
subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Certificates are
exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing
the same aggregate Fractional Undivided Interest in the Trust, as requested
by the Certificateholder surrendering the same.

No service charge will be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange, but the Trustee shall require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection
therewith.

The Trustee, the Registrar, and any agent of the Trustee or the
Registrar may treat the person in whose name this Certificate is registered
as the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the Trustee, the
Registrar, nor any such agent shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary.

The obligations and responsibilities created by the Agreement and
the Trust created thereby shall terminate upon the distribution to
Certificateholders of all amounts required to be distributed to them
pursuant to the Agreement and the disposition of all property held as part
of the Trust Property.

THE AGREEMENT AND THIS CERTIFICATE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS
PROVISIONS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed
by the Trustee, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be entitled
to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Trustee has caused this Certificate to be
duly executed.

Section 2.5 Refunding.

(a) Refunding of Notes. The Owner Participant, the Owner
Trustee and the Lessee each acknowledge that, so long as the Owner
Participant's Net Economic Return is preserved, it is in their best
interests to effect a reduction in the amounts of the installments of Basic
Rent payable by the Lessee during the Basic Term. Subject to Article VI of
the Indenture, if a Qualified Investment Banking Firm delivers a written
report to the Owner Participant and the Lessee stating that in its
reasonable judgment, based upon the Lessee's credit quality, the prevailing
interest rates for long-term debt, market conditions and prepayment
penalties or Premium, if any, of the Notes, the redemption of either (1)
all of the Outstanding Notes related to a Property or (2) all of the Notes
held in a particular Pass Through Trust and the issuance of Refunding Notes
in replacement therefor will be cost effective, then the Owner Participant
may, or if the Lessee shall have so requested, shall, cause the Owner
Trustee to effect a refunding of all the Outstanding Notes (or any
particular series or subseries thereof) with the proceeds of Refunding
Notes; provided that such refunding shall be subject to the fulfillment, on
or before the Refunding Date, of the conditions set forth below and in
Section 2.5(e), and that no refunding pursuant to this Section 2.5(a) shall
occur if two refundings pursuant to this Section 2.5(a) shall have occurred
(unless the Owner Participant shall have otherwise consented in writing).
Prior to the commencement of any refunding pursuant to this Section 2.5(a),
the Owner Participant must have received a written consent from the Lessee
stating that it approves of all of the terms and conditions of the proposed
refunding. The Debt Refinancing and the alternate refinancing pursuant to
Section 2.7 shall not constitute a refunding of Notes under this
Section 2.5.

(b) Refunding Proceeds. On the Refunding Date, if the
provisions of this Section have been satisfied or waived by the party for
whose benefit such provisions are included, then, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Indenture, the Refunding Notes shall be issued in one or
more series or subseries by the Owner Trustee and authenticated by the
Indenture Trustee under and pursuant to the Indenture, shall be in an
aggregate principal amount (subject to Section 2.5(e)(16)) equal to the
current principal amount of Notes to be refunded as of the date of such
refunding plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus the Transaction
Expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of such Refunding Notes,
shall have a weighted average life-to-maturity and final maturities meeting
the requirements of the first paragraph of Section 2.5(c), shall bear
interest at a fixed rate or fixed rates per annum and shall be payable as
set forth in or determined under the Indenture and the Related Supplemental
Indentures. The proceeds of the sale of such Refunding Notes shall be paid
directly to the Indenture Trustee at the Indenture Trustee's Office in
immediately available funds and applied to the redemption of the
Outstanding Notes (or a particular series or subseries thereof).

(c) Adjustments Under the Leases. In connection with any
refunding of any Outstanding Notes (or a particular series or subseries
thereof), a Qualified Investment Banking Firm referred to in Section 2.5(a)
shall determine the number of series of Refunding Notes to be issued and
the interest rate or rates applicable thereto (which shall reflect actual
market conditions). Based upon such determination, such Qualified
Investment Banking Firm shall determine the principal amount (in an
aggregate principal amount as determined in accordance with Section
2.5(b)), the amortization schedule and the maturities of all series of
Refunding Notes (provided that the Owner Trustee shall have no obligation
to proceed with any such refunding if, in addition to the conditions set
forth in Section 2.5(e), the aggregate weighted average life-to-maturity of
the Refunding Notes immediately following the refunding varies from the
remaining aggregate weighted average life-to-maturity reflected in the debt
amortization schedule for the Notes to be refunded by more than six months
or the final maturity of any Refunding Note is later than the original
final maturity of any Note to be refunded) so as to minimize the amounts of
the installments of Basic Rent payable by the Lessee during the Basic Term,
while preserving the Owner Participant's Net Economic Return.

In the case of any refunding of Outstanding Notes, the adjustment
of the percentages for Basic Rent payable in respect of the period from and
after the Refunding Date and amounts payable in respect of Casualty Value
and Termination Value from and after the Refunding Date pursuant to Section
3 of each Lease shall be effected in such a manner as to provide to the
Lessee, consistent with the requirements of Section 3 of each Lease, the
net savings in interest expense accruing as a result of, and the full
economic benefit of, such refunding.

(d) Cooperation. Each of the Lessee, the Owner Trustee, the
Connecticut Trustee, the Remainderman, the Indenture Trustee, the Initial
Noteholder or the Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, the Owner
Participant Parent and the Owner Participant agrees that it will cooperate
in connection with any refunding of Outstanding Notes and, if applicable,
the Pass Through Certificates and the issuance of any Refunding Notes
(which may include a public offering of pass through trust certificates or
other similar securities) and that it will enter into such additional
agreements and such supplements or amendments to or consents, if any, under
each of the Transaction Documents as reasonably may be requested by the
Owner Participant to effectuate the same; provided, however, that neither
the Indenture Trustee nor the Pass Through Trustee shall be obligated to
enter into any additional agreements, supplements, amendments or consents
that would be contrary to the Indenture, the Pass Through Trust Agreement
or the Pass Through Trust Supplements or that would adversely affect the
Noteholders.

(e) Conditions to Refunding. In addition to the limitations
set forth in Sections 2.5(a) and 2.5(c), (i) the Owner Trustee shall have
no obligation to proceed with any refunding or refinancing transaction as
contemplated by this Section 2.5 if such transaction would adversely affect
the Owner Participant's rights under the Transaction Documents or result in
any augmentation of its obligations thereunder or if the documentation is
not reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant and (ii) the
obligations of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, and the Owner
Participant to participate in a refunding of any Outstanding Notes shall be
subject to the fulfillment, on or before the applicable Refunding Date, of
the following conditions precedent (with each instrument, document,
evidence, certificate, opinion or other writing to be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the
Owner Participant):

(1) Authentication Request, etc. The Owner Trustee shall
have delivered to the Indenture Trustee an Owner Trustee Request,

Notes to be refunded shall have been called for redemption and
shall be redeemable on the Refunding Date, (B) on or before the
Refunding Date, the Lessee shall have paid to the Owner Trustee
an amount, which amount shall be deemed to be Supplemental Rent,
equal to accrued interest on the Notes to be refunded from and
including the later of the date thereof and the date to which
interest thereon shall have been paid to but excluding the
applicable Refunding Date and Premium, if any, which amount shall
have been turned over by the Owner Trustee to the Indenture
Trustee to redeem the Notes to be refunded, and (C) the Owner
Trustee shall have executed, and the Indenture Trustee shall have
authenticated and delivered, the Refunding Notes.

caused to have been obtained and shall have delivered to the
Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee copies of documents or
other evidence of all Governmental Action required in connection
with the issuance, authentication and sale of any Refunding Notes
or any other related securities such as pass through trust
certificates.

(5) No Adverse Accounting Treatment. The Refunding Notes
shall not cause the transaction effected pursuant to the
respective Leases to be classified (x) by the Owner Participant
as other than a leveraged lease, as defined under then current
GAAP for leveraged leases and (y) by the Lessee as other than an
operating lease in conformity with GAAP.

(6) Documents. The Lessee, the Owner Participant, the
Connecticut Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Pass Through
Trustee and the Owner Trustee each shall have received executed
counterparts of such agreements, instruments and documents as are
contemplated or required by this Agreement to be delivered in
connection with the issuance of any Refunding Notes.

(7) Litigation. The Owner Participant, the Indenture
Trustee, the Connecticut Trustee and the Owner Trustee each shall
have received an Officers' Certificate of the Lessee, dated as of
the Refunding Date, to the effect that there is no action, suit
or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Lessee,
threatened, that questions the validity or enforceability of any
Refunding Notes or of any obligation of the Lessee under any of
the Transaction Documents to be executed and delivered or to be
amended in connection with the issuance of any Refunding Notes.

(8) No Violation of Applicable Law. The transactions to be
consummated in connection with the refunding shall not violate
any Applicable Law binding upon the Lessee or any other parties
hereto or relevant to the respective Properties.

(9) Tax Consequences. In the opinion of the Owner
Participant's Tax Counsel, such refunding shall not cause any
adverse Federal, state or local tax consequences to the Owner
Participant (other than consequences for which the Owner
Participant would be indemnified by the Lessee pursuant to the
terms of the Tax Indemnification Agreement, this Agreement or
another written undertaking by the Lessee, if any, to indemnify
the Owner Participant if the Lessee is then Investment Grade (and
if the Lessee is not Investment Grade, in an amount and in a
manner satisfactory to the Owner Participant in its sole
discretion)).

(10) Consents and Approvals. All consents and approvals
related to the Lessee or the Properties or any party hereto
required to effect the issuance of the Refunding Notes shall have
been obtained.

(11) Absence of Liens. After giving effect to the
refunding, if such refunding involves less than all of the
Outstanding Notes, no Lien (other than Permitted Liens) shall
exist upon any of the Properties and the Owner Participant, the
Indenture Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee shall have
received a supplemental title insurance policy or an endorsement
to the then- existing policy, in either case, insuring that the
Liens of the Related Supplemental Indentures continue to
constitute valid, first priority liens on the Related Indenture
Estates, and Officers' Certificate of the Lessee stating that,
the condition of the first clause of this Section 2.5(e)(11) has
been met, which title insurance policy or endorsement and
Officers' Certificate shall be sufficient for purposes of this
Section 2.5(e)(11) to satisfy the condition set forth in this
Section 2.5(e)(11).

(12) Refunding Fee. With respect to any second

Counsel, Lessees' Special Counsel and Pass Through Trustee's
Counsel each dated the applicable Refunding Date and addressed to
the Owner Participant, the Connecticut Trustee, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee, addressing such matters relating to
the refunding as the Owner Participant, the Connecticut Trustee,
the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may reasonably
request. The Pass Through Trustee shall have received a
favorable opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Pass
Through Trustee to the effect that the proposed refunding does
not, and cannot reasonably be expected to, make the Pass Through
Trust an "investment company" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

representations and warranties of the Lessee set forth in Section

Trustee and the Owner Participant shall have received an
Officers' Certificate of the Lessee, dated as of the Refunding
Date, to such effect and to the effect that no Event of Default
or Event of Loss is in existence, or will exist after taking into
account the refunding.

Connecticut Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee
shall have received such information and copies of such other
documents as any of them may reasonably request in connection
with the refunding.

provision contained in this Section 2.5, the aggregate principal

and at the time each post-effective amendment thereto becomes
effective does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading and the final Prospectus either contained in the
Registration Statement or a post-effective amendment thereto
filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act in connection
with the sale of the Pass Through Certificates will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except that these representations
and warranties do not apply to statements or omissions contained
in the Registration Statement, such final Prospectus or any
Prospectus supplement based upon information furnished to the
Lessee in writing by the Underwriters expressly for the use
therein or to statements or omissions in the statement of
eligibility on Form T-1 of the Pass Through Trustee; (B) the
Registration Statement and each post-effective amendment thereto
filed with the SEC will have become effective prior to any

(e) Adjustments Under the Leases. In connection with the
Debt Refinancing, a Qualified Investment Banking Firm shall determine the
aggregate principal amount and the interest rate or rates applicable to the
Refinancing Notes (which shall reflect actual market conditions), the
amortization schedule and the maturities of all series of Refinancing Notes
(provided that the Owner Trustee shall have no obligation to proceed with
any such refinancing if, in addition to the conditions set forth in Section
2.6(f), the aggregate weighted average life-to-maturity reflected in the
debt amortization schedule for the Notes to be refinanced by more than six
months or the final maturity of any Refinancing Note is more than six
months later than the original final maturity of any Note to be refunded)
so as to minimize the amounts of the installments of Basic Rent payable by
the Lessee during the Basic Term, while preserving the Owner Participant's
Net Economic Return. The adjustment of the percentages for Basic Rent
payable in respect of the period from and after the Debt Refinancing Date
and amounts payable in respect of Casualty Value and Termination Value from
and after the Debt Refinancing Date pursuant to Section 3 of each Lease
shall be effected in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 3

Owner Trustee, the Connecticut Trustee, the Indenture Trustee,
the Pass Through Trustee and the Owner Participant shall have

the representations and warranties of the parties (other than the
Initial Noteholder) set forth in Article V shall be true and
correct in all material respects on and as of the Debt
Refinancing Date with the same effect as though made on and as of
the Debt Refinancing Date.

(9) Maximum Principal Amount. Notwithstanding any provision
contained in this Section 2.6, the aggregate principal amount of
such Refinancing Notes (other than Subsequent Notes) as
determined in accordance with applicable tax principles
immediately after giving effect to the Debt Refinancing shall not
exceed the lesser of (A) 105% of the aggregate original principal

for leveraged leases and (y) by the Lessee as other than an
operating lease in conformity with GAAP.

(13) Tax Consequences. In the opinion of the Owner
Participant's Tax Counsel, the Debt Refinancing shall not cause
any adverse Federal, state or local tax consequences to the Owner
Participant (other than consequences for which the Owner
Participant would be indemnified by the Lessee pursuant to the
terms of the Tax Indemnification Agreement, this Agreement or
another written undertaking by the Lessee, if any, to indemnify
the Owner Participant if the Lessee is then Investment Grade (and
if the Lessee is not Investment Grade, in an amount and in a
manner satisfactory to the Owner Participant in its sole
discretion)).

(14) Absence of Liens. After giving effect to the Debt
Refinancing, no Lien (other than Permitted Liens) shall exist
upon the Properties, and the Owner Participant, the Connecticut
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee shall
have received a supplemental title insurance policy or an
endorsement to the then-existing policy, in either case, insuring
that the Liens of the Related Supplemental Indentures constitute
valid, first priority liens on the Related Indenture Estates and

of the first clause of this Section 2.6(f)(14) has been met,

with the Debt Refinancing.

Section 2.7 Failure to Consummate Debt. (a) Series J Notes
Remain Outstanding. If for any reason the Debt Refinancing shall not occur
prior to the Outside Date, the Series J Notes (or any Refunding Notes as
shall have been issued in accordance with Section 2.5 in respect of the
Series J Notes) shall remain Outstanding in accordance with the terms
thereof and the Related First Supplemental Indentures. After the Outside
Date, the Lessee shall use its best efforts to refinance the Outstanding
Series J Notes (or any Refunding Notes as shall have been issued in
accordance with Section 2.5 in respect of the Series J Notes) on the
earliest possible date and on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee
and the Owner Participant through the issuance of Optional Refinancing
Notes. Any such refinancing shall be concluded as if such refinancing were
being made in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of Section
2.6(a). The Initial Noteholder or any Affiliate thereof may provide the
refinancing debt on terms reasonably acceptable to it, but shall not be
obligated to provide such refinancing debt.

(b) Cooperation. The Lessee and each of the Owner Participant,
the Owner Participant Parent, the Owner Trustee, the Connecticut Trustee,
the Remainderman, the Initial Noteholder and the Indenture Trustee agrees
to cooperate to effect the refinancing as contemplated by Section 2.7(a)
and to negotiate in good faith to conclude such additional agreements,
documents, or instruments and such supplements, amendments, consents or
waivers in respect of the Transaction Documents as may be reasonably
requested by the Lessee to effect such refinancing, including, without
limitation, any amendment or supplement to this Agreement and the
Indenture. It is agreed that such refinancing debt may take the form of
public, private, institutional or commercial bank debt and the terms of
such refinancing shall reflect then current market terms of public or
private debt, as applicable, in leveraged leases, to borrowers similarly
situated to the Lessee.

(c) Adjustments. If a Trigger Event shall have occurred, the
Lessee and the Owner Trustee shall adjust the Basic Rent, Casualty Value
and Termination Value payable under each Lease as set forth in Annex I
attached hereto; provided, however, in no event shall any adjustment
pursuant to Annex I result in any adverse tax consequences to the Owner
Participant (other than consequences for which the Owner Participant would
be indemnified by the Lessee pursuant to the terms of the Tax
Indemnification Agreement, this Agreement or another written undertaking by
the Lessee, if any, to indemnify the Owner Participant if the Lessee is
then Investment Grade (and, if the Lease is not Investment Grade, in an
amount and in a manner satisfactory to the Owner Participant in its sole
discretion)).

(d) Additional Lessee Covenants. If a Trigger Event shall have
occurred, each of the Lessee covenants and agreements contained in Annex II
attached hereto (the "Additional Lessee Covenants") shall automatically and
without further action be incorporated into and become part of this
Agreement. Each of the parties agrees that references in any other
Transaction Document to the covenants and agreements of the Lessee
contained in Section 6.1 hereof or in this Agreement generally shall be
deemed to include the Lessee covenants and agreements contained in Annex
II. Each of the parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) from the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the Outside Date, the
Lessee shall have no duties or obligations whatsoever to observe or
perform, or take any other actions whatsoever in respect of the Additional
Lessee Covenants and such Additional Lessee Covenants shall not form a part
of this Agreement, (ii) the Lessee shall become obligated to observe and
perform the Additional Lessee Covenants if, and only if, the Trigger Event
shall have occurred, and (iii) upon the occurrence of the Debt Refinancing
or any other refinancing contemplated by this Section 2.7, the Lessee shall
have no duties or obligations whatsoever to observe or perform, or take any
other action whatsoever (contingent or otherwise) in respect of, the
Additional Lessee Covenants and such Additional Lessee Covenants shall
cease to be in force and effect (if then in effect) and shall automatically
and without further action be deleted from this Agreement (if then in
effect), at which time, in any event, this Agreement shall be read as if
this Section 2.7(d) and Annex II had never existed.

(e) Initial Noteholder. The Initial Noteholder shall not assign
any Series J Notes or part thereof or offer any participation in any Series
J Notes, it being the intent that the Initial Noteholder shall be the sole
holder of each Series J Note and all interests therein; provided, however,
that if a Trigger Event shall have occurred, (i) the Initial Noteholder may
assign all of the Series J Notes with the prior written consent of the
Lessee and the Owner Participant, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, and, other than the reissuance of the Series J Notes to reflect
such assignment pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and the First
Supplemental Indentures, no other amendment or modification shall be made
to the Transaction Documents (except as provided below), and (ii) the
Initial Noteholder may offer participation in the Series J Notes, with the
prior written consent of the Lessee and the Owner Participant, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, so long as any such
participation (A) shall not require the reissuance of any Series J Notes,
(B) the Initial Noteholder shall remain the sole Holder of record of each
Series J Note, and (C) none of the parties hereto other than the Initial
Noteholder shall have any duty, obligation or liability whatsoever to any
participant, it being agreed the Initial Noteholder shall remain solely
obligated with respect to any obligations or liabilities of the Initial
Noteholder and shall be the sole person entitled to any of the direct
rights, interests or benefits of the Initial Noteholder in and to the
Transaction Documents. It is agreed that any indemnity available to the
Initial Noteholder shall be available to any permitted assignee of the
Initial Noteholder, provided, that (i) such assignee is a citizen of any
state or commonwealth of the United States or the District of Columbia and
(ii) unless expressly agreed by the Lessee in any required consent, the
Lessee shall only be required to indemnify such assignee only to the extent
it would have had to indemnify the Initial Noteholder.

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. The Lessee has the corporate power and authority to
conduct its business as now conducted, to own or hold under lease its
properties and to enter into and perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which it is or is to become a party. The Lessee
is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in the State of California. Lessee has not failed to qualify
to do business or to be in good standing in any other jurisdiction where
failure so to qualify or to be in good standing would materially and
adversely affect the business or financial condition of the Lessee or the
ability of the Lessee to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document to which it is or is to become a party.

(b) Due Authorization; No Conflict. Each of the Transaction
Documents to which the Lessee is or is to become a party has been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Lessee and
has been, or on the Closing Date will have been, duly executed and
delivered by such Lessee, and the execution, delivery and performance
thereof by the Lessee does not, and on the Closing Date will not, (i)
require any approval of the stockholders of the Lessee or any approval or
consent of any trustee or holder of any indebtedness or obligation of the
Lessee, other than such consents and approvals as have been, or, on or
prior to the Closing Date, will have been, obtained, (ii) contravene any
Applicable Law binding on the Lessee or the charter or by-laws of the
Lessee or (iii) contravene or result in any breach of or constitute any
default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than pursuant
to the Transaction Documents) upon any property of the Lessee under the
Lessee's charter or by-laws, any material indenture, mortgage, loan
agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Lessee is a
party or by which the Lessee or any of its properties are bound.

(c) Governmental Action. On or prior to the Closing Date,
all Governmental Action set forth on Schedule 3 [(Part I)], together with
that which is otherwise required in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance by the Lessee of the Transaction Documents to which the
Lessee is or is to become a party, has been or will have been obtained,
given or made but for those Governmental Actions set forth on Schedule 3
(Part II) (as identified specifically and with respect to general classes
of Governmental Actions), all of which are either (x) not required on the
Closing Date and cannot be obtained or (y) typically not applied for prior
to the time they are required (and the Lessee has no reason to believe will
not be timely obtained). The sale of the Properties at the Purchase Price
therefor and the payment of Rent under the Leases are consistent in all
material respects with and do not contravene any Governmental Action
specified in Schedule 3 (Part I).

(d) Enforceability. Each of the Transaction Documents to
which the Lessee is or is to become a party constitutes, or, when executed
and delivered by the Lessee, will constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Lessee, enforceable against the Lessee in accordance with
the terms thereof, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors', mortgagees' or lessors' rights in general and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(e) Litigation. Except as disclosed in Schedule 8, there is
no action, suit or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Lessee,
threatened against the Lessee before or by any Governmental Authority that
questions the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document to which the Lessee is or is to become a party or that
would, if adversely determined, have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Lessee to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents to which the Lessee is or is to become a party.

(f) Financial Statements. The consolidated balance sheets
of the Lessee and its consolidated subsidiaries as of January 2, 1993 and
October 2, 1993, and the related statements of income and cash flows of the
Lessee and its consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended January
2, 1993 and the nine months ended October 2, 1993, contained or
incorporated by reference in the Lessee's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended January 2, 1993 the Lessee's Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended October 2, 1993, respectively, fairly
present the consolidated financial condition of the Lessee and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of such dates and the result of operations of
the Lessee and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods ended on such
dates, all in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (subject in the
case of the October 2, 1993 financial statements to normal year-end audit
adjustments).

(g) No Material Adverse Change. Since October 2, 1993,
there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition of the
Lessee and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(h) No Defaults. No Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and no condition exists that constitutes, or
with the giving of notice of lapse of time or both would constitute, an
event of default by the Lessee under any material indenture, mortgage, loan
agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Lessee is a
party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound. No Event of
Loss has occurred and no event or condition has occurred which would, with
the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, constitute an Event
of Loss.

(i) Financial Advisors. Except for Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated, Goldman Sachs & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc, the Lessee has
not retained any broker, finder or financial advisor in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

(j) No Broker. There is no real estate broker or agent to
whom a commission is due as a result of the sale of the Properties.

(k) Liens. On the Closing Date, the Lessee will have
transferred to the Owner Trustee and the Remainderman good and marketable
fee simple title to the Lessor Interests and the Remainderman Interests,
respectively, and a valid and subsisting leasehold estate, in each case
free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Upon execution,
acknowledgement, delivery and recordation of the First Supplemental
Indentures by the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, the First
Supplemental Indentures shall create the valid and perfected first priority
mortgage liens and security interests which they purport to create on, in
and to the Related Indenture Estates free and clear of all Liens other than
Permitted Liens.

(l) Location of Chief Executive Offices. The Chief Executive
Offices (as such term is used in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code)
and the principal place of business of the Lessee and the offices where it
keeps its records concerning the Properties and the transactions
contemplated hereby are located at 1550 South Redwood Road, Salt Lake City,
Utah 84104.

(m) Investment Company. Neither the Lessee nor any
subsidiary of the Lessee is an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(n) Securities Act. Except as contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, the Lessee has not offered (and on the Closing Date
will not have offered) any interest in the Properties, the Series J Notes,
the Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate or the Leases, or any similar
securities of the Lessee or the Trust, to, or solicited any offer to
acquire any of the same from, any Person, in violation of Section 5 of the
Securities Act, nor has it authorized any Person to take any such action,
and the Lessee has not taken any action that would subject any interest in
the Properties, the Refinancing Notes, the Trust Estate, the Indenture
Estate or the Leases (other than the Pass Through Certificates) to the
registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

(o) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

(p) Environmental Matters. To the best of Lessee's
knowledge, it has complied and is now complying with all Environmental Laws
and the requirements of any permits issued under such Environmental Laws
with respect to each of the Properties. There are no circumstances that
may prevent or interfere with the Lessee's ability to operate and maintain
each of the Properties as contemplated by the Transaction Documents in full
compliance with applicable Environmental Laws. To the best of the Lessee's
knowledge, except as identified in the Environmental Report, there are no
past, pending or threatened Environmental Claims against the Lessee or the
Properties. The Lessee has not used, and does not intend to use any
portion of the Properties, or any modifications thereto, for such purposes
other than (i) as necessary to operate and maintain the Properties and (ii)
in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws. To the best of the
Lessee's knowledge, except as identified in the Environmental Report,
Hazardous Materials have not at any time been released, deposited or
disposed of on or from the Properties in any way contrary to that which is
allowed or permitted under applicable Environmental Laws. There are no
present or, to the knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Lessee, past
actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents,
including the release, emission, discharge, presence or disposal of
Hazardous Materials, that, in the Lessee's reasonable opinion could (i)
form the basis of an Environmental Claim against the Lessee or any Property
that individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect
on the operations or financial condition of the Lessee, (ii) cause any
Property to be subject to any restrictions on its ownership, occupancy, use
or transferability under any Environmental Law, or (iii) interfere with the
continued operation and maintenance of the Properties. To the best of the
Lessee's knowledge, except as identified in the Environmental Report, there
are not now and never have been any underground storage tanks located at,
on or under the Properties; there is no asbestos contained in, forming part
of, or contaminating any part of the Properties; and no polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) are used, stored, located at or contaminate any part of
the Properties.

(q) ERISA. Assuming that the Owner Participant is not
acquiring its interest in the Trust with assets of any "employee benefit
plan" (or its related trust) as defined in section 3(3) of ERISA or of any
"plan" (or its related trust) as defined in section 4975(a)(1) of the Code,
the execution, delivery and performance by the Lessee of this Participation
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Lessee is or is
to become a party will not involve any prohibited transaction within the
meaning of section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code.

Properties have been substantially completed and each of the stores located

valid temporary or permanent Certificates of Occupancy for each of the
Properties that the Lessee occupies as of the Closing Date. With respect
to each Property for which the Lessee has obtained only a temporary
Certificate of Occupancy, the Lessee has no knowledge of any condition or
state of facts that could prevent the issuance of a permanent Certificate
of Occupancy in the ordinary course of business with respect to the
applicable Property.

(t) Subdivision. Each of the Properties has been subdivided
in compliance with Applicable Law and constitutes a legally distinct parcel
or parcels that can be independently and validly conveyed and mortgaged.

Remainderman, and the use and occupancy of the Properties by the Lessee, in
each case, in the operation of Lessee's Business, shall comply with
Applicable Law, including, without limitation, all applicable zoning and
similar land use laws and regulations, as of the Closing Date, except in
any case where the failure to comply would not have an adverse effect on
the value, utility or remaining useful life of the respective Improvements
except to an insignificant extent or where Applicable Law does not require
the Lessee or the Properties to be in compliance.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS, THE LESSEE DOES NOT MAKE NOR SHALL THE LESSEE BE DEEMED TO HAVE
MADE, AND THE LESSEE HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE VALUE, CONDITION, WORKMANSHIP, DESIGN,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR USE OF ANY OF THE PROPERTIES OR ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO
ANY OF THE PROPERTIES.

(w) Legal Effect. The Deeds are effective under applicable
California law to convey all of Lessee's right, title and interest in the
Improvements and the Estates for Years. The Leases constitute operating
Leases under applicable California law.

that constitutes, or with the lapse of time would constitute, (i) a default
or event of default under any of Lessee's material agreements relating to
indebtedness for money borrowed or (ii) the covenants set forth in Annex
II.

this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

as practicable obtain a permanent Certificate of Occupancy for each
Property for which a permanent Certificate of Occupancy has not been issued

material respects with all Environmental Laws now or hereafter applicable
(unless exempted or deferred by any applicable Governmental Authority) to
the Lessee or the Properties, or the use, modification, maintenance or
operation thereof, and shall have sole responsibility for the expenses
(including legal and other professional fees and expenses and costs of
investigation) associated with such compliance, except to the extent that
the failure to so comply does not result in any material adverse effect on
the Lessee's ability to perform and observe its obligations hereunder or of
the value or utility of the Property. The Lessee will conduct any
investigation, study, sampling and testing deemed necessary by the Lessee
in its reasonable opinion and undertake any cleanup, removal, remedial or
other action reasonably necessary to remove and clean up or remediate all
Hazardous Materials at or released on or from the Properties, or any

mortgage or deed of trust made by the Lessor covering any Leased Property
(including, without limitation, the Indenture and the Related Supplemental
Indenture), (ii) the giving of a deed in lieu of foreclosure by any Lessor
with respect to such Leased Property, (iii) a transfer of such Leased
Property resulting from the filing of a petition in bankruptcy or other
similar insolvency proceeding by or against the Lessor, or (iv) any other
transfer by the Lessor of title to such Leased Property permitted by the
terms of the Transaction Documents, the Lessee shall, at the request of the
purchaser or transferee, as the case may be, attorn to the purchaser or
other transferee, including the Indenture Trustee, upon any such

Lessee might have against the Lessor, (iii) shall not be bound by any

it or any of its Affiliates (excluding for purposes hereof the Owner
Trustee in both its fiduciary and trust capacities) on or against any of
the Properties, the Owner Trustee's interest in the Leases, or any part
thereof or interest therein, and the Owner Participant agrees that it will,
at its own cost and expense (without right to indemnity under this
Agreement), take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge and
satisfy in full any such Lessor's Lien, except for any Lessor's Lien
attributable to the Owner Participant that is being contested by the Owner
Participant in good faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently
conducted, so long as such proceedings do not (i) involve any danger of the
sale, forfeiture or loss of any Property or any part thereof or interest
therein, (ii) interfere with the use, possession or disposition of any
Property or any part thereof or interest therein, (iii) interfere with the
payment of Rent, or (iv) impair the validity, perfection or priority of the
Lien of the Indenture. After the Lease Termination Date, the Owner
Participant may create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lessor's Liens
attributable to it or any of its Affiliates on or against a Property or any
part thereof or interest therein. The Owner Participant agrees to
reimburse the Lessee, the Remainderman, the Indenture Trustee, the Initial

that may be incurred by the Lessee, the Remainderman, the Indenture Trustee
and the Pass Through Trustee as a result of the failure of the Owner
Participant to discharge and satisfy any such Lessor's Lien.

(b) Quiet Enjoyment. The Owner Participant acknowledges and
agrees that, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and the applicable Lease shall have been declared in default
pursuant to Section 16(a) of such Lease, the Lessee shall have the

shall pay any expenses for which it may be responsible pursuant to Section

the financing of Modifications pursuant to Section 8(f) of any Lease and
shall otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 8(f). The Owner
Participant acknowledges, and agrees to be bound by, Section 19 of each

or, so long as any of the Notes are outstanding, the validity, perfection
or priority of the Lien of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures,
or any rights of the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture or the
Supplemental Indentures (in which case the prior written consent of the
Indenture Trustee to such amendment or supplement also must be obtained).
Except as permitted or contemplated by the Transaction Documents, the Owner
Participant agrees that prior to the Lease Termination Date, without the
prior written consent of the Lessee, or so long as there are any
Outstanding Notes or any obligations under the Indenture remain unpaid or
the Lien of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures has not been
satisfied and discharged, it will not terminate or revoke the Connecticut
Trust Agreement or permit the Connecticut Trustee to terminate or revoke
the Trust Agreement or the trusts thereby created or cause, suffer or
permit the Connecticut Trustee to transfer any interest in the Lessor
Interests. The Owner Trustee or any successor may resign or be removed by
the Owner Participant, a successor may be appointed and a successor may be
qualified in accordance with Article IX of the Connecticut Trust Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Article VIII of the
Connecticut Trust Agreement may not be amended so long as there are any
Outstanding Notes.

(e) Further Assurances. The Owner Participant shall cause
to be promptly and duly taken, executed, acknowledged, delivered and
recorded all such further acts, documents and assurances as the Lessee or
Indenture Trustee from time to time may reasonably request in order to

Trustee or the Connecticut Trustee as the case may be, are materially
greater than the customary and usual fees for similar services performed in
the same geographic area, the Owner Participant shall pay such excess fees
or, at the expense of the Lessee, remove, or cause to be removed, the Owner
Trustee or the Connecticut Trustee, as the case may be, and substitute or
cause to be substituted a new Owner Trustee or the Connecticut Trustee, as
the case may be, that is reasonably acceptable to the Lessee in accordance
with the provisions of the Trust Agreement.

(h) Lessee's Judgments and Claims. The Owner Participant
agrees that the terms of Section 4 of each Lease do not create any immunity
of the assets or moneys of the Owner Participant from satisfying any
judgments or claims the Lessee may have against the Owner Participant for

(d) Further Assurances. The Remainderman Participant shall
cause to be promptly and duly taken, executed, acknowledged, delivered and
recorded all such further acts, documents and assurances as the Lessee, the
Owner Trustee, the Connecticut Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Pass
Through Trustee from time to time may reasonably request in order to carry
out more effectively the intent and purposes of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

(e) Right of First Offer. If at any time during the Lease
Terms or at a time when the Lessor has rights under the Ground Leases or
the Option Agreements, the Remainderman Participant desires to sell or
transfer its interest in the Remainderman, it shall first offer such
interest to the Lessor on the same terms and conditions as are set forth in
Section 8.2, except that the Lessor must notify the Remainderman
Participant of its decision to accept such offer within 10 Business Days of
receipt of such offer or the Lessor's rights under this Section 6.6 will
terminate.

Section 6.7 Covenants and Agreements of the Remainderman
Trustee. The Remainderman Trustee in its individual capacity covenants and
agrees with each of the parties hereto as follows:

(a) Remainderman's Liens. The Remainderman Trustee hereby

Agreement that the Remainderman Trustee will not directly or indirectly
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Remainderman Trustee's Liens
on or against any part of the Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate or the
Properties, and the Remainderman Trustee agrees that it will at its own
cost and expense (without right to indemnify under this Agreement) promptly
take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge and satisfy in full
all such Remainderman Trustee's Liens attributable to it in its individual
capacity. The Remainderman Trustee hereby indemnifies and holds harmless
the Lessee, the Indenture Trustee, the Connecticut Trustee, the Initial
Noteholder, the Pass Through Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Owner
Participant from and against any loss, cost or expense (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) which may be suffered or incurred by
any of them as the result of the failure of the Remainderman Trustee to
discharge and satisfy any such Remainderman Trustee's Lien.

(b) Change in Chief Executive Office. The Remainderman
Trustee shall notify the Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee,
the Pass Through Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee promptly after any
change in its chief executive office and place of business or the office
where it keeps its records concerning its accounts relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.8 Covenants and Agreements of the Remainderman. The

Liens. The Remainderman will engage in no activities or businesses and
will not incur any indebtedness for money borrowed, other than those
contemplated under the Remainderman Trust Agreement and other Transaction
Documents and will maintain its existence as a Delaware business trust for
so long as it shall have any obligations hereunder or under any of the
other Transaction Documents. The Remainderman will keep the Remainderman
Trust Estate free and clear of Remainderman's Liens and shall not, prior to
the termination of any Lease sell, assign, or otherwise transfer its
interest in the Related Remainderman Trust Estate except as contemplated by
the Transaction Documents.

(b) Chief Place of Business of the Remainderman Trust, etc.
The Remainderman agrees that it shall not change its chief place of
business, its chief executive office or the office where it keeps its
records concerning the Remainderman Trust Estate, unless it shall have
given the Owner Participant and the Lessee at least 30 days' prior written
notice of such change.

(c) Bankruptcy Proceedings. None of the Remainderman
Participant, the Remainderman Trustee nor the Remainderman shall

(i) institute, take, or cause to taken, any action
intended to result in the institution against the
Remainderman of any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency or liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings
under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law,

(ii) consent to, or execute any document
specifically acquiescing in the taking by the Remainderman
of, any action which would result in the commencement of any
such proceedings against the Remainderman, or

(iii) execute and document specifically
acquiescing in any such proceedings commenced by others
against the Remainderman.

(d) Quiet Enjoyment. The Remainderman acknowledges and
agrees that, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and the Leases shall have been declared in default pursuant to
Section 16(a) of such Leases and the Ground Lease shall have been entered
into, the Lessee shall have the exclusive rights to possession, control,
use and enjoyment of the Properties and the Remainderman will not take any
action that would interrupt or interfere with the Lessee's peaceable
possession, control, use and enjoyment of any respective Property in any
manner that is not otherwise prohibited by Section 6(a) of such Leases.

(e) Lessee's Judgment and Claims. The Remainderman
acknowledges and agrees that the terms of Section 4 of each Lease do not
create any immunity of the assets or moneys of the Remainderman from
satisfying any judgments or claims the Lessee may have against the
Remainderman for any breach of the Remainderman's obligations to the Lessee
under any of the Transaction Documents.

(f) Further Assurances. The Remainderman shall cause to be
promptly and duly taken, executed, acknowledged, delivered and recorded all
such further acts, documents and assurances as the Lessee, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee from time to
time may reasonably request in order to carry out more effectively the
intent and purposes of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents to
which it is a party, and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including, without limitation, any changes to the form of Ground Lease
necessary to ensure such Ground Lease is enforceable under California law.

Section 6.9 Covenants and Agreements of the Initial Noteholder.
The Initial Noteholder covenants and agrees with each of the other parties
hereto as follows:

(a) Initial Noteholder's Liens. The Initial Noteholder
hereby unconditionally agrees with and for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement that the Initial Noteholder will not directly or indirectly
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Initial Noteholder's Liens on
or against any part of the Indenture Estate, and the Initial Noteholder
agrees that it will at its own cost and expense (without right to indemnity
under this Agreement) promptly take such action as may be necessary to duly
discharge and satisfy in full any Initial Noteholder's Liens. The Initial
Noteholder hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the Lessee, the
Remainderman Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Connecticut Trustee, the
Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant from and against any loss, cost or
expense (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) which may be
suffered or incurred by any of them as the result of the failure of the
Initial Noteholder to discharge and satisfy any such Initial Noteholder's
Lien.

(b) Quiet Enjoyment. Notwithstanding any other provision of
the Indenture or of any other Transaction Document, the Initial Noteholder
warrants, covenants and agrees that, unless an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Initial Noteholder shall not (i) name the
Lessee as a party in any action or procedures to foreclose the Lien of the
Indenture, unless such joinder shall be required under Applicable Law, and
in which case the Initial Noteholder shall not seek affirmative relief from
the Lessee in such action nor shall the respective Lease be cut off or
terminated nor the Lessee's possession thereunder be disturbed in any such
action or proceeding, (ii) the Lessee shall have the exclusive rights to
possession, control, use and enjoyment of the Properties and the Initial
Noteholder will not take any other action that would interrupt or interfere
with the Lessee's peaceable possession, control, use and enjoyment of any
respective Property in any manner, and (iii) subject to the next succeeding
sentence of this Section 6.9(b), the Initial Noteholder will recognize the
Leases and the Lessee's rights thereunder. Upon any acquisition by the
Initial Noteholder or any purchaser at foreclosure or transfer pursuant to
a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code
(collectively, a "Successor Landlord") of the Owner Trustee's interest in
any Lease, such Lease shall continue as a direct Lease between the
Successor Landlord and the Lessee upon all terms, covenants and conditions
set forth in such Lease, except that the Successor Landlord shall not be
(A) liable for any previous act or omission of Lessor under such Lease, (B)
subject to any offsets, claims, defenses or counterclaims the Lessee may
have against the Owner Trustee, (C) bound by any prepayment of Rent not
actually received by Successor Landlord or (D) bound by any amendment to
such Lease requiring the Initial Noteholder's consent unless such consent
was obtained.

(c) Further Assurances. The Initial Noteholder shall cause
to be promptly and duly taken, executed, acknowledged, delivered and
recorded all such further acts, documents and assurances as the Lessee from
time to time may reasonably request in order to carry out more effectively
the intent and purposes of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents
to which it is a party, and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

(d) ERISA. The Initial Noteholder agrees that (i) it shall
not permit any ERISA Plan sponsored or maintained by the Initial
Noteholder, any ERISA Affiliate or any PTE 90-24 Affiliate thereof to
purchase or hold any Note, and (ii) neither the Initial Noteholder nor any
PTE 90-24 Affiliate thereof shall act in a fiduciary capacity with respect
to the purchase or holding by any ERISA Plan of any Note, in either case
(i) or (ii) which would constitute a nonexempt "prohibited transaction"
within the meaning of ERISA Section 406 or Code Section 4975.

of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnity set forth in this Section 7.1
shall not extend to any Expense imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
any Indemnitee to the extent the same relates to or arises out of one or
more of the following circumstances:

Indemnification Agreement and Section 7.06 of Pass Through Trust Agreement
exclusively provide for the Lessee's liability with respect to such Taxes);

(6) acts or events that occur after the earlier of (x) the
surrender of possession of any Property pursuant to Section 5(b) of each

Through Trustee, the Connecticut Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as the case
may be, to distribute in accordance with the Indenture, any Supplemental
Indenture, the Pass Through Trust Agreement, any Pass Through Trust
Supplement, the Connecticut Trust Agreement or the Trust Agreement, as the
case may be, any amounts received and distributable by it thereunder;

(9) the authorization or giving or withholding of any amendment,
modification, supplement, waiver, termination, approval or consent with
respect to this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents other
than such as have been consented to or requested by the Lessee and other
than such as occur while an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
and which are not given or entered into in violation of any of the
Transaction Documents (other than to the extent that such actions violate
the provisions of the Transaction Documents requiring the consent of the
Lessee);

(10) any Expense that is (x) included in Transaction Expenses and
for which the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant is responsible

Agreement or any other Transaction Document or otherwise to bear such
Expense without right of reimbursement or indemnity under this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document;

(11) any amount constituting an amount payable by the Owner
Trustee under the Indenture or the Notes resulting from an Indenture Event

Certificates or similar interest, which statement or representation is
based on written information supplied or made available by such Indemnitee
for inclusion in such registration statement;

(16) any Indenture Event of Default that does not also constitute

any increase in the cost to the Indenture Trustee or holder of a Note of
making available, funding or maintaining the loans represented by a Note,
or any reduction in the rate of return on capital of the Indenture Trustee
or holder of a Note, in each case as a result of (x) the introduction of or
any change in or in the interpretation of any Applicable Law or (y) the
compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank (or
comparable agency) or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (y) for
which a payment of Stipulated Loss Value or Termination Value paid by the
Lessee in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Documents is
intended, as calculated, to compensate such Indemnitee, provided that this
clause (18) shall only be construed to limit the Lessor's obligations under
this Section 7.1 and not otherwise to limit any damages which any
Indemnitee may be entitled to recover under applicable law for any breach
of any of the Transaction Documents.

Whether or not any of the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, except to the extent that any of the items hereinafter
described are Transaction Expenses that are the responsibility of the Owner
Trustee pursuant to Section 10.1, the Lessee shall pay: (a) the fees
(whether ordinary or extraordinary), expenses and disbursements of, and all
other amounts payable to, the Indenture Trustee, as trustee under the
Indenture, with respect to the administration of the Indenture Estate and
of any Pass Through Trustee, Indenture Trustee, co-trustee or additional
trustee appointed pursuant to the Indenture, including the reasonable fees
and expenses of any such Person's counsel, except to the extent such fees,
expenses or disbursements are attributable to an Indenture Event of Default
that is not also an Event of Default; (b) the fees (whether ordinary or
extraordinary), expenses and disbursements of the Owner Trustee (and any co-
trustee or separate trustee), as trustee under the Trust Agreement, with
respect to the administration of the Trust Estate, including the reasonable
fees and expenses of its counsel, except to the extent such fees, expenses
or disbursements are attributable to an Indenture Event of Default that is
not also an Event of Default; (c) the fees (whether ordinary or
extraordinary); expenses and disbursements of the Connecticut Trustee (and
any co-trustee or separate trustee) as trustee under the Connecticut Trust
Agreement with respect to the administration of the Connecticut Trust
Estate, including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel, except
to the extent such fees, expenses or disbursements are attributable to an
Indenture Event of Default that is not also an Event of Default; (c) the
fees (whether ordinary or extraordinary); (d) the fees (whether ordinary or
extraordinary), expenses and disbursements of the Remainderman Trustee (and
any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed pursuant to the Remainderman
Trust Agreement), as trustee under the Remainderman Trust Agreement, with
respect to the administration of the Remainderman Trust Estate, including
the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel, except to the extent such
fees, expenses or disbursements are attributable to an Indenture Event of
Default that is not also an Event of Default; and (e) all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by each of the Owner Participant, the
Connecticut Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Remainderman Participant, the
Remainderman Trustee and the Indenture Trustee in connection with (i) the
entering into or giving or withholding of any proposed amendment,
modification, supplement, waiver, termination, approval or consent
requested by the Lessee or (ii) any Event of Loss or any redemption,
prepayment, refinancing or assumption of the Notes by the Lessee, at the
Lessee's request or attributable to the events specified in Section 2.5
hereof, or Sections 8, 9, 14, 16 or 20 of each Lease, as the case may be;
provided, however, that the Lessee shall not be obligated to pay any such
fees, costs or expenses of an Indemnitee to the extent they relate to or
arise out of any of the circumstances described in clauses (l) through (18)
above with respect to such Indemnitee.

With respect to any amount that the Lessee is requested by an
Indemnitee to pay by reason of this Section 7.1, such Indemnitee shall, if
so requested by the Lessee and prior to any payment, submit such additional
information to the Lessee as the Lessee may reasonably request properly to
substantiate the requested payment. In the case of any Expense indemnified
by the Lessee hereunder which is covered by a policy of insurance
maintained by or for the benefit of the Lessee, each Indemnitee agrees,
subject to the proviso in the second sentence of the next paragraph, to
cooperate with the insurers in the exercise of their rights to investigate,
defend or compromise such Expense as may be required to retain the benefits
of such insurance with respect to such Expense.

In case any action, suit or proceeding shall be brought against
any Indemnitee for which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification,
such Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Lessee of the commencement
thereof (but the failure to do so shall not relieve the Lessee of its
obligation to indemnify such Indemnitee except to the extent that the
Lessee is prejudiced as a result of such failure). Subject to the rights
of insurers under policies of insurance maintained by or for the benefit of
Lessee, the Lessee or its insurers shall have the right to investigate, and
the right in its sole discretion to defend or compromise, any Expense for
which indemnification is sought under this Section 7.1, and at the Lessee's
expense, each Indemnitee shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of
the Lessee in connection therewith; provided that the Lessee or the insurer
shall not be entitled to assume and control the defense of any such action,
suit or proceeding if, in the reasonable opinion of such Indemnitee, such
defense or compromise involves the potential imposition of criminal
liability on such Indemnitee or a conflict of interest between such
Indemnitee and the Lessee. Where the Lessee or the insurers under a policy
of insurance undertakes the defense of an Indemnitee with respect to an
Expense, no additional legal fees or expenses of such Indemnitee in
connection with the defense of such Expense shall be indemnified hereunder
unless such fees or expenses were incurred at the request of the Lessee or
such insurers. Subject to the requirements of any policy of insurance, an
Indemnitee shall be entitled, at its own expense, acting through counsel
acceptable to the Lessee, to participate in any action, suit or proceeding
the defense of which has been assumed by the Lessee pursuant to the
preceding provisions, provided, that such party's participation does not,
in the opinion of the independent counsel to the Lessee or its insurers,
interfere with such control; and such participation shall not constitute a
waiver of the indemnification provided in this Section 7.1.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Lessee shall
not under any circumstances be liable for the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for each of (i) the Owner Participant and the Owner
Trustee (and their respective successors and permitted assigns, agents and
servants), and (ii) the Indenture Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee (and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, agents and servants).
Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, in any action,
suit or proceeding to which any Indemnitee is a party, the Lessee shall not
enter into any settlement or other compromise with respect to any Expense
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee unless the Lessee
acknowledges in writing reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee such
Indemnitee's right to full indemnification under this Section 7.1 with
respect to such Expense. No Indemnitee shall enter into any settlement or
other compromise with respect to any Expense without the prior written
consent of the Lessee unless such Indemnitee waives its rights to be
indemnified under this Section 7.1 with respect to such Expense.

Each Indemnitee shall supply the Lessee with such information and
documents requested by the Lessee as are reasonably necessary or desirable
for the Lessee to participate in any action, suit or proceeding to the
extent permitted by this Section 7.1.

Upon payment in full of any Expense by the Lessee pursuant to
this Section 7.1 to or on behalf of an Indemnitee, the Lessee, without any
further action, shall be subrogated to any and all claims that such
Indemnitee may have in respect thereof (other than claims in respect of
insurance policies maintained by such Indemnitee at its own expense), and
such Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Lessee and give such further
assurances as are reasonably necessary to enable the Lessee vigorously to
pursue such claims. So long as no Event of Default or Special Default has
occurred and is continuing, should an Indemnitee receive any refund,
payment, or insurance proceeds in whole or in part, with respect to any
Expense paid by the Lessee hereunder, it shall promptly pay the amount
refunded, paid or received (but not an amount in excess of the amount the
Lessee or any of its insurers has paid in respect of such Expense) over to
the Lessee.

Nothing in this Section 7.1 shall be construed as a guaranty by
the Lessee of any residual value in any Property or as a guaranty of the
Notes or the Pass Through Certificates.

Section 7.2 General Tax Indemnity. Except as provided in Section
7.3, the Lessee shall pay, and on written demand shall indemnify, protect,
defend and hold each Tax Indemnitee harmless, on an After-Tax Basis, from
and against, any and all Taxes levied or imposed on or with respect to any
Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee, any Property, or any portion thereof or
interest therein, any sublessee or other user thereof or otherwise by any
United States federal government or taxing authority or by any state or
local government or taxing authority or any political subdivision thereof
(or any taxing authority thereof or therein) in connection with or in any
way relating to (a) the construction, preparation, installation,
inspection, delivery, non-delivery, acceptance, rejection, purchase,
ownership, possession, rental, lease, sublease, maintenance, repair,
storage, transfer of title, redelivery, use, operation, condition, sale,
settlement of any insurance claim, mortgaging, pledging, financing,
retirement, abandonment, modification, replacement, transportation,
acquisition, transfer, substitution, control, location, refinancing,
repossession, registration, reregistration, return or other application or
disposition of all or any part of any interest in the Properties, or any
portion thereof or interest therein or the imposition of any Lien (or
incurring of any liability to refund or pay over any amount as a result of
any Lien) thereon, (b) the payment or receipt of Interim Rent, Basic Rent
or Supplemental Rent or the receipts or earnings arising from or received
with respect to any Property or any part thereof or any interest therein or
any applications or dispositions thereof, (c) any other amount paid or
payable pursuant to any Transaction Document (including, without
limitation, any amounts paid or payable on or with respect to the Notes or
the Pass Through Certificates) or any document related thereto or the
property, income or other proceeds with respect to any of the property held
in the Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate or any Pass Through Trust, (d)
any Property, or any part thereof or any interest therein, (e) all or any
of the Transaction Documents, the Underwriting Agreement, any other
documents contemplated thereby, and amendments, supplements, waivers or
consents thereto, (f) the offer, issuance, sale, purchase, delivery,
refinancing, reoptimization or holding of the Notes or the Pass Through
Certificates or any other securities in connection with or with respect to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, (g) Taxes or
liability imposed on the Owner Participant Parent or Owner Participant
only, under Section 4975 of the Code, or Sections 406, 407, 502(i) or
502(l) of ERISA as a result of the sale of the Pass Through Certificates in
accordance with the Transaction Documents, or (h) otherwise with respect to
or in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.

If, by reason of any Tax payment made to or for the account of a
Tax Indemnitee by or on behalf of the Lessee pursuant to this Section 7.2,
such Tax Indemnitee actually realizes a reduction as Taxes for which the
Lessee is not required to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee hereunder or under
the Tax Indemnification Agreement and that was not previously taken into
account in computing such payment, such Tax Indemnitee shall promptly pay
on an After-Tax Basis to the Lessee an amount equal to the actual net
reduction in Taxes, if any, realized by such Tax Indemnitee; provided,
however, that (A) such Tax Indemnitee shall not be obligated to make any
payment pursuant to this Section 7.2 if, and for so long as, a Default or
an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (B) no Tax
Indemnitee shall be obligated to make any payment to the Lessee pursuant to
this Section 7.2 to the extent that the amount of such payment would exceed
(x) the amount of all prior payments paid by or on behalf of the Lessee to
such Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 7.2, less (y) the amount of
all prior payments by such Tax Indemnitee to the Lessee pursuant to this
Section 7.2, but any such excess shall reduce pro tanto any amount that
the Lessee is subsequently obligated to pay pursuant to this Section 7.2.
Each Tax Indemnitee agrees to use its reasonable efforts, and further
agrees to take such actions as the Lessee may reasonably request, to
realize any reduction, tax benefit or other savings that would reduce the
Lessee's indemnity obligation or would be required to be paid by such Tax
Indemnitee to the Lessee as soon as they are available; provided, however,
that (i) no Tax Indemnitee shall be required to take any action which, in
its good faith judgment, would have any adverse tax consequences to it
(other than consequences for which the Tax Indemnitee would be indemnified
by the Lessee pursuant to the terms of the Tax Indemnification Agreement,
this Agreement or another written undertaking by the Lessee, if any, to
indemnify the Tax Indemnitee if the Lessee is then Investment Grade (and if
the Lessee is not Investment Grade, in an amount and in a manner
satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee in its sole discretion)) and (ii) the
conduct of any proceeding or action hereunder shall be controlled by the
Tax Indemnitee. Any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenditures
incurred in pursuing the actions contemplated by the preceding sentence
shall be for the account of Lessee.

If it is later determined that the Tax Indemnitee was not
entitled to such tax benefit, the portion of such tax benefit that is
disallowed, reduced, repaid, lost or recaptured will be treated as Taxes
for which the Lessee must indemnify the Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this
Section 7.2, subject to the contest provisions of Sections 7.4 through
7.11.

Section 7.3 Exclusions from General Tax Indemnity. Section 7.2

of such Tax Indemnitee not being a citizen or resident of, or not being
organized under the laws of, the United States or any political subdivision
thereof;

(f) any Tax that is enacted or adopted by its express terms
as a direct substitute for any Tax that would not have been indemnified
against pursuant to this Article VII;

(g) Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnitee to the extent that
such Taxes would have been imposed on a Tax Indemnitee in the absence of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents;

(h) so long as the Owner Trustee is receiving all Basic Rent
without reduction on account of contested Taxes, Taxes that are being
contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.4, during the
pendency of such contest;

(i) Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnitee caused by such Tax

(j) Taxes that are imposed on any Tax Indemnitee as a result
of the actual gross negligence, or actual willful misconduct of such Tax
Indemnitee or its Affiliate;

(k) Taxes related to any Property that are attributable to
any event occurring after the earliest of (i) the expiration or early
termination of a Lease provided that the Lessee has paid in full all
amounts then due under such Lease, (ii) the return of possession of such
Property to the Lessor, provided in any such case that such Property is
returned in accordance with Section 5(b) of such Lease (but not if such Tax
arises in connection with an act, circumstance or event prior to such

Transaction Documents or any Notes, or from any voluntary transfer of any
interest in such Tax Indemnitee or from any involuntary transfer of any of
the foregoing interests resulting from the bankruptcy or insolvency of, or
a foreclosure against the Tax Indemnitee (in each case, other than any such

with the exercise of any of the Lessee's rights or obligations under any of
the Transaction Documents);

(m) Taxes imposed on the Connecticut Trust, the Trust, the

of such Trust respectively, or (ii) that exceed the amounts that would have
been imposed if the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
had been consummated directly by the Owner Participant without such Trust;

(n) any interest, penalties, fines or additions to Tax
attributable to the failure of a Tax Indemnitee to file any return in
accordance with the procedural requirements of Applicable Law and on a
timely basis pursuant to its obligations under Section 7.4, except to the
extent that such failure is caused by the failure of the Lessee to fulfill
its obligations, if any, under Section 7.4 with respect to such return or
claim;

(o) any Taxes (other than any amount required to make a
payment on an After-Tax Basis) imposed on an original Tax Indemnitee or a

extent of the excess of such Taxes over the amount of such Taxes that would
have been imposed against the original Tax Indemnitee had there not been a
transfer of the Properties, or any interest therein or in a Tax Indemnitee
or an interest arising under any Transaction Document or any Notes by the
original Tax Indemnitee (other than any such transfer that occurs while a
Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing);

Taxes imposed on the Indenture Trustee that result from Indenture Trustee's
Liens;

(q) any Tax that would not have been imposed but for (i) an
amendment, modification, consent or waiver to any Transaction Document not
consented to by the Lessee (except for (A) any such amendment,
modification, consent, or waiver while a Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing or (B) any amendment, modification, consent or
waiver required by Applicable Law or required by the Transaction
Documents);

(r) other than with respect to any Tax Indemnitee that is
the Owner Participant, the Trust Estate, the Owner Trustee, or any
Affiliate of any of the foregoing, Taxes imposed against or payable by a
Tax Indemnitee pursuant to Sections 3406 or 4701 of the Code or any other
provision of applicable law requiring a withholding;

(s) Taxes imposed against or payable by a Tax Indemnitee
that would not have been imposed but for any failure of such Tax Indemnitee
or its Affiliate to comply with (x) certification, information,
documentation, reporting or other similar requirements (each being a
"Requirement") concerning the nationality, residence, identity or
connection with the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, if such compliance is
required by statute or by regulation of the jurisdiction imposing such
Taxes as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Taxes and such a
Tax Indemnitee was eligible to comply with such Requirement (other than
with respect to any Tax Indemnitee that is the Owner Participant, the Trust
Estate, the Owner Trustee, or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing); or
(y) any other Requirements under the tax laws or regulations of the
jurisdiction imposing such Taxes that would establish entitlement to
otherwise applicable relief or exemption from such Taxes if such compliance
by the Tax Indemnitee was timely requested by the Lessee in writing and
such Tax Indemnitee was eligible to comply with such Requirement; provided,
however, that in no event shall any Tax Indemnitee be required to take any
action hereunder which, in its good faith judgment, would have any adverse
tax consequence to it (other than consequences for which the Tax Indemnitee
would be indemnified by the Lessee pursuant to the terms of the Tax
Indemnification Agreement, this Agreement or another written undertaking by
the Lessee, if any, to indemnify the Tax Indemnitee if the Lessee is then
Investment Grade (and if the Lessee is not Investment Grade, in an amount
and in a manner satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee in its sole
discretion));

(t) other than with respect to any Tax Indemnitee that is
the Owner Participant, the Trust Estate, the Owner Trustee, or any
Affiliate of any of the foregoing, Taxes imposed against or payable by the
Pass Through Trustee, any Noteholder, or the Pass Through Investors or
Taxes imposed in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the Pass
Through Certificates or resulting from or in respect of the payment of any
interest, principal or any other amount in connection with the Notes or the
Pass Through Certificates (other than those Taxes specifically identified
as exceptions to the exceptions regarding any Indenture Trust, the
Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Estate, any Pass Through Trust or the Pass
Through Trustee in Sections 7.3(a) and 7.3(b)); or

(u) except as provided in Section 7.2(g), Taxes or liability
incurred by any Tax Indemnitee resulting from any prohibited transaction
described in Section 406 or 407 of ERISA or Section 4975(c) of the Code.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 7.3 to the
contrary, the Lessee will indemnify the Owner Trustee, the Trust Estate and
the Owner Participant (and any Affiliate of any of the foregoing) on an
After-Tax Basis for any obligation with respect to United States federal
withholding Taxes imposed on the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant (or
any Affiliate of either thereof) with respect to the Notes or Pass Through
Certificates (or any debt issued to refinance or refund such Notes or Pass
Through Certificates) or as a result of a claim by the Internal Revenue
Service (the "Service") asserted against the Trust Estate, the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant (or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing)
with respect to any such withholding Tax; provided, however, that (A) the
Lessee shall be subrogated to the rights and defenses of the Owner Trustee
and the Owner Participant (and any Affiliate of either thereof) in respect
of such withholding Taxes, including the rights and defenses set forth
under the Transaction Documents, (B) as to claims asserted by the Service,
the Lessee shall have rights comparable, where appropriate, to the rights
set forth in Section 7.4 through 7.11 of this Article VII to require a
contest of the fact and amount of such claims, and (C) the Lessee shall
have no indemnification obligation under this sentence to the extent such
obligation of the Owner Trustee or Owner Participant (or any Affiliate of
either thereof) is caused by (y) the actual gross negligence or actual
willful misconduct of the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant (or any
Affiliate of either thereof) or (z) a failure of the Owner Trustee or the
Owner Participant (or any Affiliate of either thereof) to fulfill its
obligations described in clause (B) of this proviso but only if such
failure precludes the Lessee's ability to contest the tax.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 7.3 to the
contrary, the Lessee further will indemnify the Owner Trustee, the Trust
Estate, and the Owner Participant (and any Affiliate of either thereof) on
an After-Tax Basis for any obligation with respect to Taxes imposed on the
Pass Through Trust, the Pass Through Trustee or the holders of the Pass
Through Certificates or as a result of a claim by the Service asserted
against the Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate, the Indenture Trustee, the
Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant with respect to Taxes payable by the
Pass Through Trust, the Pass Through Trustee or the holders of the Pass
Through Certificates; provided, however, that (A) the Lessee shall be
subrogated to the rights and defenses of the Owner Trustee and the Owner
Participant (and any Affiliate of any thereof) in respect of such Taxes,
including the rights and defenses set forth under the Transaction
Documents; (B) as to claims asserted by any taxing authority, the Lessee
shall have rights comparable, where appropriate, to the rights set forth in
Section 7.4 through 7.11 of this Article VII to require a contest of the
fact and amount of such claims, and (C) the Lessee shall have no
indemnification obligation under this sentence to the extent such
obligation of the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant or the Indenture
Trustee (or any Affiliate of any thereof) is caused by (y) the actual gross
negligence or actual willful misconduct of the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant (or any Affiliate of any thereof), or (z) a failure of the
Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant (or any Affiliate of any thereof) to
fulfill its obligations described in clause (B) of this proviso but only if
such failure precludes the Lessee's ability to contest the tax.

Section 7.4 Contests
(a) If any proposed adjustment or written claim shall be
made against any Tax Indemnitee, or if any proceeding shall be commenced
against any Tax Indemnitee (including a written notice of such proceeding),
for any Taxes as to which the Lessee may have an indemnity obligation
pursuant to Section 7.2, or if any Tax Indemnitee shall determine that any
Taxes as to which the Lessee may have an indemnity obligation pursuant to
Section 7.2 may be payable, and if the amount of such proposed adjustment,
claim or Tax, plus any related adjustment, claim or Tax with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents that have been or
could be raised in an audit of such Tax Indemnitee by the taxing authority
in question for any other taxable period (including all future periods) of
such Tax Indemnitee with respect to which an assessment of a Tax deficiency
is not barred by the statute of limitations, would result in an additional
liability for Taxes of such Tax Indemnitee in excess of (x) in the case of
any contest the Lessee is permitted hereunder to conduct in its own name
without the participation of the Tax Indemnitee, $1,000 and (y) in the case
of any other contest, $10,000, then (i) such Tax Indemnitee shall promptly
notify the Lessee in writing of such proposed adjustment, claim, proceeding
or Tax, provided, however, that the failure to notify the Lessee pursuant
to this Section 7.4(a)(i) shall not relieve the Lessee of any obligation to
indemnify the Tax Indemnitee hereunder unless such failure precludes the
Lessee from initiating or continuing the contest of such claim for Taxes;
(ii) if requested in writing to do so by the Lessee, such Tax Indemnitee
shall extend the time by which it is required to respond to any such
proposed adjustment, claim or proceeding if such extension would not
otherwise adversely affect such Tax Indemnitee in any manner for which it
is not indemnified pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document; (iii) if not required to do so by Applicable Law, shall not
without the consent of the Lessee take any action (including the payment of
any Tax) with respect to such proposed adjustment, claim, proceeding or Tax
for 30 days (or, if an extension to respond described in clause (ii) has
been obtained, for an additional period of time equal to the length of such
extension) after giving such notice to the Lessee provided, however, that
if the Tax Indemnitee shall be required by law or regulation to take action
prior to the end of such 30-day period, such Tax Indemnitee shall, in such
notice to Lessee, so inform Lessee, and such Tax Indemnitee shall not take
any action with respect to such claim or Tax without the consent of Lessee
(not to be unreasonably withheld) before 10 days from the receipt of such
notice by the Lessee unless the Tax Indemnitee shall be required by law or
regulation to take action prior to the end of such 10 day period; and (iv)
if the Lessee requests in writing within such 30-day or shorter period that
such proposed adjustment, claim or Tax be contested, such Tax Indemnitee
shall at the expense of the Lessee contest or the Lessee may (or at the
request of the Tax Indemnitee shall) contest in good faith in Lessee's
name, if permitted by Applicable Law, provided, however, that the claim can
be segregated procedurally from Tax claims for which the Lessee is not
obligated to indemnify the Tax Indemnitee, or otherwise in the name of such
Tax Indemnitee (upon the written consent of such Tax Indemnitee) the
validity, applicability or amount of the proposed adjustment, claim or Tax,
including determining (1) whether any action shall initially be by way of
judicial or administrative proceedings, or both, (2) whether any such
proposed adjustment, claim or Tax shall be contested by resisting payment
thereof or by paying the same and seeking a refund thereof and (3) the
court or other judicial body before which judicial action, if any, shall be
commenced; provided, however, that, in the case of any contest that is or
is to be controlled by the Lessee: (A) the Tax Indemnitee may retain or
reassert control of any such contest at any time if, in the judgment of
such Tax Indemnitee, there is a possibility that the Lessee's conduct of
such contest could have an adverse impact on the financial or public
relations interest of the Tax Indemnitee and (B) if the Tax Indemnitee
shall not have retained or reasserted control of any such contest, the
Lessee shall consult with and keep reasonably informed the Tax Indemnitee
and its designated counsel with respect to such contest and shall timely
provide the Tax Indemnitee with copies of the relevant portions of all
documents relating to such contest.

(b) A Tax Indemnitee shall not be required, and the Lessee
shall not be permitted, to take or continue any action pursuant to this
Section 7.4 other than the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
first sentence of Section 7.4(a), and the Lessee shall be required to pay
any such Taxes without contest, unless (i) the Lessee shall have agreed in
writing,to pay and shall pay to the Tax Indemnitee on demand all costs and
out-of-pocket expenses that the Tax Indemnitee may incur in connection with
contesting such proposed adjustment, claim or determination (including
without limitation all costs, expenses, legal and accounting fees and
disbursements); (ii) such Tax is one with respect to which the Lessee has
agreed in writing that it would be required to indemnify the Tax Indemnitee
in the event the contest is unsuccessful unless the contest is ultimately
resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction on a clearly articulated
basis that establishes that there is no basis for indemnification
hereunder; (iii) the action to be taken will not result in any substantial
danger of sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any lien (other
than a Permitted Lien) on, the Properties or any part thereof or interest
therein or the risk of imposition of any criminal penalties; (iv) no
Default or Event of Default has occurred or is continuing; and (v) the Tax
Indemnitee has been provided with an opinion of tax counsel, selected by
the Lessee and reasonably acceptable to the Tax Indemnitee, which opinion
shall be furnished at the Lessee's sole expense, to the effect that there
is a Reasonable Basis for contesting or appealing such tax claim (or in the
case of any appeal of any adverse judicial decision an opinion of such
counsel to the effect that the Tax Indemnitee more likely than not will
prevail in such appeal). In no event shall any appeal to the United States
Supreme Court be required or permitted hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 7.4 to the
contrary, no Tax Indemnitee shall be required to contest any tax claim if
the subject matter thereof shall be of a continuing nature and there shall
have been a final adverse determination with respect thereto, unless there
shall have been a change in fact or law, (including, without limitation,
amendments to or adoption of statutes or regulation, administrative rulings
and court decisions) enacted, promulgated or decided after such claim shall
have been so previously decided, and such Tax Indemnitee shall have
received an opinion of counsel, selected by the Lessee and reasonably
acceptable to the Tax Indemnitee, which opinion shall be furnished at the
Lessee's sole expense, to the effect that as a result of such change in
fact or law it is more likely than not that the Tax Indemnitee shall
prevail in the contest of such claim.

(c) If the contest of any adjustment shall involve paying
the additional tax and suing for a refund, the Lessee shall advance to or
pay on behalf of the Tax Indemnitee, on an interest-free basis and at no
additional net after-tax cost to such Tax Indemnitee, the amount of such
additional tax, as well as any related interest, penalties or additions to
tax that are required to be paid with respect thereto. Upon a Final
Determination of any adjustment in respect of which the Lessee shall have
advanced funds to or paid funds on behalf of the Tax Indemnitee or, if
earlier, upon receipt by the Tax Indemnitee of a refund or credit of any
amounts paid by or on behalf of the Tax Indemnitee based on the adjustment
and in respect of which amounts the Lessee shall have previously advanced
funds to or on account of the Tax Indemnitee, then, to the extent such
Final Determination is adverse, the Lessee shall indemnify the Tax
Indemnitee to the extent provided by Section 7.2, and promptly after such
Final Determination the Tax Indemnitee shall repay to the Lessee the funds
advanced by the Lessee pursuant to this paragraph, together with any
related interest received by the Tax Indemnitee as a result of such refund
or credit (fairly attributable to amounts advanced by the Lessee) or saved
by the Tax Indemnitee because the refund or credit (fairly attributable to
amounts advanced by the Lessee) is used as an offset in another taxable
year.

(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided, in the event
Lessee has complied with the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.4, the
Tax Indemnitee shall not be entitled to settle, compromise or pay such Tax
so long as such contest is being prosecuted in good faith.

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 7.4,
a Tax Indemnitee shall not be required to contest any claim or permit the
Lessee to contest any claim and may settle any contest without the consent
of the Lessee if such Tax Indemnitee (A) shall waive its right to indemnity
under Section 7.2 with respect to such claim for such Tax (and any claim
made by any taxing authority with respect to other taxable periods that are
based, in whole or in part, upon the resolution of such claim, or the
contest of which is precluded by the resolution of such claim), and (B)
shall pay to the Lessee any amount previously paid or advanced by the
Lessee pursuant to this Section 7.4 with respect to such claim for such Tax
or the contest of such Tax (other than amounts advanced pursuant to clause
(i) of Section 7.4(b)) plus interest on such amounts at the interest rates
specified in Section 6621(a)(1) of the Code.

Section 7.5 Refunds or Credits. If any Tax Indemnitee or any
Affiliate thereof shall receive a refund of (or receive a credit against,
or any other current reduction in, any Tax not indemnified by the Lessee
pursuant to this Article VII) all or any part of any Taxes paid, reimbursed
or advanced by the Lessee pursuant to this Article VII (or would have
received such a refund, credit or reduction but for a counterclaim or other
claim not indemnified by the Lessee hereunder (a "Deemed Refund")),
provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, within 30 days of such receipt (or, in the case of a Deemed
Refund, within 30 days of the final determination of such Deemed Refund),
the Tax Indemnitee shall pay to the Lessee, an amount equal to the lesser
of (xx) the amount of such refund or credit or Deemed Refund plus or minus
any net tax benefit or cost (taking into account any Taxes incurred by such
Tax Indemnitee by reason of the receipt or accrual of such refund or credit
or Deemed Refund) realized by such Tax Indemnitee as a result of any
payment by such Tax Indemnitee made pursuant to this sentence (including
this clause (xx)) and (yy) the amount of such tax payment, reimbursement or
advance by Lessee to such Tax Indemnitee, it being intended that such Tax
Indemnitee shall retain a net tax benefit pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 7.4
only if the Lessee shall first have been reimbursed for any payments,
reimbursements and advances of taxes by it to such Tax Indemnitee pursuant
to Sections 7.2 and 7.4. If, in addition to such refund, credit or
reduction or Deemed Refund, as the case may be, such Tax Indemnitee shall
actually receive (or would have received but for a counterclaim or other
claim not indemnified by the Lessee hereunder) an amount representing
interest on the amount of such refund, credit or reduction, or Deemed
Refund, as the case may be, such Tax Indemnitee shall pay to the Lessee on
an After-Tax Basis, within 30 days of such receipt or, in the case of a
Deemed Refund, within 30 days of the final determination of such Deemed
Refund, that proportion of such interest that shall be fairly attributable
to Taxes paid, reimbursed or advanced by the Lessee prior to the receipt of
such refund or Deemed Refund. If it is later determined that the Tax
Indemnitee was not entitled to such refund or credit, the portion of such
refund or credit that is disallowed, reduced lost, repaid or recaptured
will be treated as Taxes for which the Lessee must indemnify the Tax
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 7.2, subject to the contest provisions of
Section 7.4 through 7.11.

Section 7.6 Payments. Any Tax indemnifiable under this Article
VII shall be paid directly when due to the applicable taxing authority if
direct payment is permitted. If direct payment to the applicable taxing
authority is not permitted or is otherwise not made, any amount payable to
a Tax Indemnitee pursuant to Section 7.2 shall be paid in immediately
payable funds within 30 days after receipt of a written demand therefor
from such Tax Indemnitee accompanied by a written statement describing in
reasonable detail the amount so payable, but not before the date that the
relevant Taxes are due. No Tax shall be payable to the applicable taxing
authority or the Tax Indemnitee, as the case may be, before any contest to
which the Lessee is entitled under Section 7.4 is concluded. Any payments
made pursuant to Sections 7.2 through 7.5 shall be made directly to the Tax
Indemnitee entitled thereto or the Lessee, as the case may be, in
accordance with Section 13.9. In the event a Tax Indemnitee makes a tax
payment with respect to any such Taxes that are due and payable at the time
of such payment (other than with funds advanced to such Tax Indemnitee on
an interest-free basis by the Lessee pursuant to this Article VII) the
Lessee shall pay to the Tax Indemnitee interest on the amount of such
payment at the Overdue Interest Rate from (i) the date of payment by the
Tax Indemnitee if the Tax Indemnitee notifies the Lessee that such payment
has been made within 5 days of making such payment, or (ii) from the date
the Tax Indemnitee notifies the Lessee of such indemnity payment in all
other cases, in either case to the date of payment by Lessee to the Tax
Indemnitee hereunder. Any amount payable under Sections 7.2 through 7.5
that is not paid when due shall bear interest at the Overdue Interest Rate.

Any amount payable to the Lessee pursuant to the terms of this
Article VII shall not be paid to or retained by the Lessee if at the time
of such payment or retention a Default or an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing. At such time as there shall not be continuing
any such Default or Event of Default, such amount shall be paid to the
Lessee to the extent not previously paid to the Lessee.

Section 7.7 Reports. If any report, return or statement is
required to be filed with respect to any Taxes that are subject to
indemnification under this Article VII, the Lessee shall promptly notify
the appropriate Tax Indemnitee of such requirement and, if the Lessee is
permitted by Applicable Law to do so and has been furnished at the Lessee's
sole expense with such information, not within the control of the Lessee,
as (i) is in such Tax Indemnitee's control, (ii) is reasonably available to
such Tax Indemnitee, (iii) is necessary to file such report, return or
statement, and (iv) has been requested in writing by the Lessee, shall
timely file such report, return or statement with respect to such Taxes
(unless such Tax Indemnitee has notified the Lessee in writing that such
Tax Indemnitee intends to file such report, return or statement); provided,
however, that if the Lessee is not permitted by Applicable Law to file any
such report, return or statement the Lessee will promptly notify the
appropriate Tax Indemnitee that it is not so permitted. If the Lessee is
not permitted by Applicable Law to file any such report, return or
statement, then if the Lessee has been furnished at the Lessee's sole
expense with such information, not within the control of the Lessee, as (i)
is in such Tax Indemnitee's control, (ii) is reasonably available to such
Tax Indemnitee, (iii) is necessary to file such report, return or
statement, and (iv) has been requested in writing by the Lessee, the Lessee
shall, if practicable and if the report, statement or return to be filed
reflects only information in respect of the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents, prepare and furnish to such Tax Indemnitee not
later than 15 days prior to the date such report, statement or return is
required to be filed (determined without regard to extensions) a proposed
form of such report, statement or return for filing by the appropriate Tax
Indemnitee. If the Tax Indemnitee shall have notified the Lessee of its
intention to prepare and file any return, statement or report subject to
this Section 7.7, or in the case of any other return, statement or report
subject to this Section 7.7 required to be prepared and filed by the Tax
Indemnitee, the Lessee, at its expense, shall make available or provide to
such Tax Indemnitee, upon request, such records and information as is
within the Lessee's control or otherwise is reasonably available to the
Lessee to the extent required to prepare such return, statement or report.
With respect to any report, return, or statement that is required to be
filed with respect to any Taxes that are subject to indemnification under
this Article VII, the Lessee shall either show the ownership of the
respective Property in the Owner Trustee and send a copy of such report,
return or statement to the Owner Trustee and the appropriate Tax Indemnitee
or, where not permitted to show such ownership, shall promptly notify the
Owner Participant of such requirement and prepare and deliver to the Owner
Trustee and the appropriate Tax Indemnitee a proposed form of such report,
return or statement reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Trustee within a
reasonable time prior to the time such report, return or statement is to be
filed.

The Lessee shall hold each Tax Indemnitee harmless from and
against all liability arising out of any insufficiency or inaccuracy of any
report, return or statement if such insufficiency or inaccuracy results
from the insufficiency or inaccuracy of any information required to be
supplied by the Lessee in preparing and filing such report, statement or
return.

If no report, statement or return is required to be filed with
respect to a Tax subject to indemnification under this Section 7.7, the
Lessee will promptly notify the Tax Indemnitee of such Tax not later than
30 days prior to the due date for payment of such Tax. Subject to Section
7.6 above, not later than the date any Tax described in the preceding
clause is required to be paid by the Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee will either
(1) if permitted by Applicable Law, pay such Tax directly to the
appropriate taxing authority or (2) pay the Tax Indemnitee the amount of
such Tax in immediately available funds.

Section 7.8 Verification. At the Lessee's request, the amount of
any indemnity payment by the Lessee pursuant to Section 7.2 or any payment
by a Tax Indemnitee to the Lessee pursuant to Section 7.5 shall be verified
using the procedures established in Section 3(f)(ii) of each Lease.

Section 7.9 Survival. The obligations and liabilities arising
under this Article VII shall continue in full force and effect,
notwithstanding the expiration or earlier termination of each Lease and the
other Transaction Documents, until all such obligations have been satisfied
and such liabilities have been paid in full, and shall be binding and inure
to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and assigns.

Section 7.10 Forms, etc. Each Tax Indemnitee agrees to furnish
to the Lessee from time to time, at the written request and expense of
Lessee, such duly executed and properly completed forms as may be necessary
or appropriate in order to claim any reduction of or exemption from any
withholding or other Tax imposed by any taxing authority in respect of any
payments otherwise required to be made by Lessee, as the case may be,
pursuant to the Transaction Documents, which reduction or exemption may be
available to such Tax Indemnitee; provided, however, that no Tax Indemnitee
shall have any obligation to comply with any request or take any other
action pursuant to this Section 7.10 if (i) in order to comply with such
request or take such action the Tax Indemnitee would be required to make
any inaccurate statement or (ii) by complying with such request, the Tax
Indemnitee would suffer, in the good faith opinion of such Tax Indemnitee,
any adverse consequences (other than consequences for which the Tax
Indemnitee would be indemnified by the Lessee pursuant to the terms of the
Tax Indemnification Agreement, this Agreement or another written
undertaking by the Lessee, if any, to indemnify the Tax Indemnitee if the
Lessee is then Investment Grade (and if the Lessee is not Investment Grade,
in an amount and in a manner satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee in its
sole discretion)).

Section 7.11 Non-Parties. If any Tax Indemnitee is not a party
to this Agreement, Lessee may require the Tax Indemnitee to agree in
writing, in a form reasonably acceptable to Lessee, to the terms of this
Article VII, before making any payment to such Tax Indemnitee under Article
VII.

ARTICLE VIII

TRANSFERS OF THE OWNER PARTICIPANT'S INTERESTS;
RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER; AND NO TRANSFER BY OWNER
TRUSTEE OR CONNECTICUT TRUSTEE

Section 8.1 Transfer of Owner Participant's Interest. The Owner
Participant shall not directly or indirectly (whether through the
Connecticut Trustee or otherwise) assign, convey or otherwise transfer
(whether by consolidation, merger, sale of assets or otherwise) any of its
right, title or interest in and to the Properties, the Trust Estate, this
Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Connecticut Trust Agreement, the
Connecticut Trust Estate, the Tax Indemnification Agreement or any other
Transaction Document and (so long as any Notes are Outstanding) the
Indenture Estate; provided, however, that, after the Closing Date, subject
to fulfillment of the conditions set forth below in this Article VIII, the
Owner Participant (and any Transferee to whom a transfer is duly made
pursuant to this Article VIII) may transfer all or a portion of its right,
title and interest in and to the Properties (at any point in time that the
Connecticut Trust Agreement and the Trust Agreement do not exist), the
Connecticut Trust Estate, this Agreement, the Connecticut Trust Agreement,
the Tax Indemnification Agreement and each other Transaction Document to
which the Owner Participant is a party or by which the Owner Participant is
bound to one or more Transferees. Each such transfer shall be subject to
the fulfillment of the following conditions:

(a) at no time shall there be more than four Owner
Participants and each Owner Participant shall at all times have an interest
in the Lessor Interests and Lessor of at least 20%;

(b) the Transferee (if other than the Lessee) shall at the
time of transfer (i) be a Qualified Institution or (ii) an Affiliate of the
Owner Participant Parent, and if such Affiliate is not a Qualified
Institution, the Owner Participant Parent shall provide a guaranty, in
scope and substance satisfactory to the Lessee, of all of the obligations
of the Transferee under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents;

(c) the Lessee, the Owner Trustee, the Connecticut Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee, and the Initial Noteholder or the Pass Through
Trustee, as the case may be, shall have received at least 45 days' prior
notice of the proposed transfer, which notice shall specify the name and
address of the proposed transferee;

(d) the Transferee shall have all requisite power and
authority to enter into and perform the obligations of the Owner
Participant under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which the Owner Participant is a party and, upon giving effect to the
proposed transfer, the Transferee will not be in breach of any covenant,
agreement or condition required to be performed or observed by the Owner
Participant in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which
the Owner Participant is a party;

(e) the Transferee shall have duly authorized, executed and
delivered to the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Initial
Noteholder or the Pass Through Trustee, as applicable, and the Lessee an
agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit O;

(f) the Transferee shall have made the representations and
warranties required to be made by the Owner Participant set forth in
Section 5.2(a) and, assuming that they were made in reference to the
transfer referred to above or to documents required to be executed or
prepared (including amendments to the Transaction Documents) in connection
with the transfer, the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
5.2(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (i) shall be true and correct as to the
Transferee as of the effective date of the transfer in all material
respects with the same effect as if made on such date and each of the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Initial Noteholder or the Pass Through
Trustee, as applicable, and the Lessee shall have received an Officers'
Certificate of the Transferee to such effect;

(g) such transfer shall not violate any provisions of the
Securities Act (and no registration pursuant to such Act or the rules and
regulations thereunder shall be required in connection with such
conveyance) and shall not violate any provision of, or create a
relationship that would be in violation of, any other Applicable Law;

(h) the Transferee shall have duly authorized, executed,
acknowledged, delivered, recorded or caused to be recorded any instrument
requested by the Indenture Trustee or its counsel for the purpose of
affirming or continuing the validity, perfection and priority of the lien
of the Indenture;

(i) for so long as the Lessee is a Lessee under the
respective Leases, neither the Transferee nor any of its Affiliates shall
at the time of proposed transfer be (A) a Person, a substantial part of
whose business is the operation of retail stores, including the sale of
food and/or drug products (the "Lessee's Business"), in the general
geographic area in which the Lessee conducts the Lessee's Business or (B)
otherwise be a Person instituting or threatening to institute any
involuntary or hostile corporate transaction affecting control of the
Lessee ("Adverse Relationship"); provided, however, for the purpose of this
paragraph (i), a Transferee and any of its Affiliates shall not be deemed
to be engaged in the Lessee's Business solely by reason of their ownership
of securities or other interests of any entity engaged in any of the
Lessee's Business so long as either (x) in the case of a Transferee that is
a bank, insurance company, finance subsidiary (similar to the Owner
Participant Parent) or other financial institution, (i) such securities are
held as portfolio investments and (ii) either (A) the consolidated sales of
such entity for its latest fiscal year were less than $100,000,000.00, (B)
such Transferee and its Affiliates do not beneficially own in the aggregate
more than a 25% equity interest in such entity on a fully diluted basis and
such entity is not an Affiliate (other than by virtue of the rights and
powers that arise solely from the ownership of such equity interest) of
such Transferee or any of its Affiliates or (C) the book value of the
interest of the Transferee and its Affiliates in such entity does not
exceed 1% of the consolidated assets of the Transferee and its Affiliates
determined at the end of its latest fiscal year or (y) in all other cases,
(i) such entity is not an Affiliate of such Transferee or any of its
Affiliates and (ii) the Transferee and its Affiliates do not beneficially
own in the aggregate more than a 5% equity interest in such entity on a
fully diluted basis;

(j) the transfer will not result in any adverse tax
consequences to the Owner Participant for which the Lessee is liable under
any Transaction Document other than any such consequence for which the
Lessee has been relieved of its obligation to indemnify; and

(k) the transferring Owner Participant or the Transferee
shall have delivered to the Lessee, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Trustee, the Connecticut Trustee, the Initial Noteholder or the Pass
Through Trustee, as the case may be, a favorable opinion of counsel (which
may be in-house counsel) reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee as to the
due authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the agreement
referred to in paragraph (e) above, and as to the matters referred to in
paragraphs (d) (except as to breach of covenant, condition or agreement),
(e) and (g) above.

From and after any transfer effected in accordance with this
Article VIII, the Transferee shall be deemed the "Owner Participant" (or,
in the case of a partial transfer, an "Owner Participant") for all purposes
of the Transaction Documents and shall be deemed to have made all of the
Investment, or in the case of a partial transfer, that portion of the
Investment previously made by the Owner Participant to the extent
attributable to the interest transferred to it, and, except as provided in
the last sentence of this paragraph, each reference to the Owner
Participant contained in the Transaction Documents shall be deemed to
include a reference to the Transferee for all purposes. If as a result of
any such transfer there shall be more than one Owner Participant, any
requirement for the consent or approval of, or instructions from, the Owner
Participant under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be
deemed to be satisfied if such consent or approval or instructions are
given by Owner Participants having at least 51% of the aggregate interest
in the Trust Estate. If as a result of any transfer pursuant to this
Article VIII, there is more than one Owner Participant, then the parties
hereto agree that the Trust Agreement shall be amended to reflect the
existence of more than one Owner Participant and the form of any such
amendment shall be reasonably acceptable to the Owner Trustee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VIII,
after any transfer effected in accordance with this Article VIII, the
transferring Owner Participant shall not be released from any obligation
arising or accruing prior to such transfer, but shall not be liable for any
obligation arising or accruing after such transfer to the extent of such
transfer. Notwithstanding any transfer effected in accordance with this
Article VIII, the transferring Owner Participant shall nevertheless be
entitled to all benefits accrued and all rights vested or arising with
respect to the period prior to such transfer, including, without
limitation, any right to indemnification under this Agreement or the Tax
Indemnification Agreement, to the exclusion of the Transferee unless the
transferring Owner Participant shall have assigned such benefits and rights
to the Transferee and provided evidence of such assignment in form and
substance satisfactory to the Lessee.

The foregoing restrictions on transfers by the Owner Participant
set forth in this Article VIII shall be of no force or effect after the
latest Lease Termination Date in respect of any Leases that have not
expired or terminated, subject to Section 20 of each Lease. If an Event of
Default described under Sections 15(a), (b) or (f) has occurred and is
continuing, then the foregoing restrictions set forth in clauses (a), (b)
and (j)(x) need not be complied with by the Owner Participant for so long
as such Event of Default continues. If an Event of Default described under
Sections 15(a) or (b) of each Lease has occurred and is continuing (other
than in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding) and
the respective Leases have been declared in default or if an Event of
Default as described in Section 15(f) has occurred and is continuing and
the Lessee (or its successors) has moved to reject the Leases under Section
365 of the Bankruptcy Code or has attempted to characterize the Leases as
financing leases and not as leases in a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceeding, then the foregoing restriction under paragraph (i) need not be
complied with by the Owner Participant for so long as such condition
continues.

Notwithstanding anything in this Article VIII to the contrary,
the transfer restriction set forth in this Article VIII shall not apply to
any transfer of stock by the Owner Participant's stockholders or any
Affiliate of the Owner Participant or to or to any transfer to the
Connecticut Trustee of the Owner Participant's beneficial interest in the
Trust in accordance with Section __ hereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Article VII to the
contrary, the Owner Participant shall not authorize, instruct or otherwise
permit the Connecticut Trustee to, and the Connecticut Trustee shall not
directly or indirectly, assign, convey or otherwise transfer (whether by
consolidation, merger, sale of assets or otherwise) any of its right, title
or interest in and to the Properties, the Trust Estate, this Agreement, the
Trust Agreement, the Tax Indemnification Agreement or any other Transaction
Document and (so long as any Notes are Outstanding) the Indenture Estate
without the prior written consent of the Lessee; provided, however, that,
after the Notes shall no longer be Outstanding, the Owner Participant shall
have the right to terminate the Connecticut Trust and direct the
Connecticut Trustee to transfer the Connecticut Trustee's right, title or
interest in and to the Properties, the Trust Estate, this Agreement, the
Trust Agreement, the Tax Indemnification Agreement or any other Transaction
Document to the Owner Participant and to amend, supplement or modify any of
the Transaction Documents or to enter into such other agreements as the
Owner Participant deems reasonably necessary to evidence such transactions,
in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee.

Section 8.2 Right of First Offer.

(a) Grant of Right of First Offer. Subject to Section 5.5 of
the Indenture and Section 8.1 and so long as no Event of Default or Special
Default has occurred and is continuing, if at any time during the Lease
Term (unless the Lease Termination Date results from a termination of the
Lease pursuant to Section 14 or 16) the Lessor desires to sell or assign
all or part of its rights in any of the Lessor Interests or if Owner
Participant desires to sell or assign all or part of its beneficial
interest in the Trust or the Connecticut Trust, as the case may be (as
applicable, the "Selling Party") or the Selling Party receives an
unsolicited offer to purchase its interest, the Selling Party shall, as a
condition to such sale or assignment, first offer the Lessor Interests or
the beneficial interest in the Trust or the Connecticut Trust, as the case
may be (as applicable, the "Offered Interest") to the Lessee at a purchase
price and on such other terms and conditions as the Selling Party would
accept from another Person; provided, that such right of first offer shall
apply solely with respect to the beneficial interest in the Trust or the
Connecticut Trust, as the case may be, only during the period commencing on
the date occurring five (5) years prior to the scheduled expiration of the
Basic Term and ending on the date occurring one (1) year after the
expiration of the Lease Term (including any Renewal Terms) and shall apply
with respect to the Lessor Interests at any time during the Lease Term.
The Lessee may within thirty (30) days of receipt of such offer, elect to
purchase the Offered Interest, whereupon the Lessee shall be bound to
purchase from the Selling Party, and the Selling Party shall be bound to
sell to the Lessee, the Offered Interest on such terms and conditions, plus
any unpaid Rent then owing. If the Lessee does not accept such offer, the
Selling Party, subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2, may sell or
assign its rights in the Offered Interest to another Person for a period of
up to eighteen (18) months from the end of such thirty (30) day period on
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Selling Party than
the terms and conditions offered to the Lessee (it being understood that a
"no less favorable" purchase price for the Offered Interest is any purchase
price that exceeds 96% of the purchase price originally offered to the
Lessee). If the Lessee does not accept such offer and the Selling Party
during such eighteen (18) month period desires to sell or assign its rights
in the Offered Interest to another Person on terms and conditions less
favorable (as defined in the preceding sentence) to the Selling Party than
those offered to the Lessee, then the Lessee shall have the right within
twenty (20) days of receipt of notice from the Selling Party of such
proposed sale or assignment to purchase the Selling Party's rights in the
Offered Interest on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Selling
Party than the terms and conditions offered to such other Person (it being
understood that a "no less favorable" purchase price for the Offered
Interest is any purchase price that exceeds 96% of the purchase price
originally offered to the Lessee). If the Lessee does not notify the
Selling Party of its election to purchase the Offered Interest within such
twenty (20) days the Selling Party may thereafter complete the proposed
sale or assignment of its rights in the Offered Interest to such other
Person without any further obligation to the Lessee under this Section 8.2.

Any transfer of a beneficial interest in the Trust to a Person
other than the Lessee must also meet the conditions set forth in this
Section 8.2.

(b) Purchase and Transfer. If the Lessee shall have exercised
any of its purchase rights in Section 8.2(a), the Lessee shall pay for and
purchase the Offered Interest on the terms and conditions required by
Section 8.2(a) and the Selling Party shall transfer to the Lessee, without
recourse or warranty, but free and clear of all Lessor's Liens all the
Selling Party's right, title and interest in the Offered Interest.

(c) Applicability of Right of First Refusal to Certain Leases.
So long as no Event of Default or Special Default has occurred and is
continuing, if the Lessor desires to lease any Lessor Interest or a portion
thereof during the Lease Term and for one year thereafter (i) for a period
that would equal or extend beyond the earlier of the estimated economic
useful life of the Leased Property (as determined by an Appraisal Procedure
conducted at the time the lease is entered into and subject to the rights
of the Remainderman contained in the Option Agreement), (ii) with an option
in the proposed lease to purchase the Leased Property or the specified
portion at a fixed and determinable price that is less than 50% of the
anticipated Fair Market Sales Value of the Leased Property or the specified
portion thereof (as determined by an Appraisal Procedure conducted at the
time the lease is entered into) at the time that the option may be first
exercised or (iii) with an option in the proposed lease to purchase the
Leased Property or the specified portion and on such terms and conditions
(including the relationship of such option price to the anticipated sale
value of the Leased Property at the time of exercise) that, in the
aggregate, make it highly probable that the lessee will exercise such
option, then such transaction shall be subject to the right of first offer
granted in Section 8.2(a) (from and after the Lease Termination Date and
for one year thereafter unless the Lease Termination Date results from a
termination pursuant to Section 14 or Section 16). For the purposes of
Section 8.2(a), the consideration shall be the terms and conditions of the
proposed lease (including the purchase option). A right to purchase the
Leased Property or a portion thereof in a prospective lease shall be valued
as if the prospective lessee has a right to purchase the Leased Property or
a specified portion thereof on the last possible date for the exercise
thereof calculated as of the date of the giving of the notice of the
proposed sale or transfer pursuant to Section 8.2(a). For the purposes of
determining the present value of the purchase price to be paid by the
prospective lessees, a discount rate equal to the yield on United States
Treasury obligations having a maturity (extrapolated, if necessary) co-
terminous with the future payment date plus 75 basis points shall be used.
For the purpose of calculating the present value of the prospective
lessee's rental obligations, a discount rate (applied to the aggregate
amount of all rents due under the prospective lease) equal to the yield on
United States Treasury obligations having a maturity (extrapolated, if
necessary) co-terminous with the date which is the middle of the
prospective lease term plus 75 basis points shall be used.

(d) Savings Clause. Unless terminated sooner by the agreement
of the parties, the right of first refusal granted pursuant to Sections
8.2(a) and 8.2(c) and any other future unvested interest in real property
created under the terms of any Lease shall terminate upon the first
anniversary of the Lease Termination Date in respect of such Lease.

(e) Access to Leased Property. After the Lease Termination
Date, if the Selling Party shall have given the Lessee notice of a right of
first offer pursuant to this Section 8.2, then the Lessor shall afford the
Lessee with reasonable access to each Leased Property upon reasonable
notice (but subject to reasonable restrictions) for the purpose of
inspection and valuation of each such Leased Property.

Section 8.3 No Transfer by Owner Trustee. For so long as the
Lessee is the lessee under each Lease and no Special Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Owner Trustee shall only
directly or indirectly assign, convey, sell, dispose of or otherwise
transfer any of its right, title or interest in and to the Lessor Interests
(other than the grant of security pursuant to the Indenture) in a manner
that complies with Section 8.2. No such transfer shall under any
circumstance be to (A) any Person engaged, or whose Affiliate is engaged,
except in the case of a transfer to an Affiliate of the original Owner
Participant, in the Lessee's Business or (B) otherwise be a Person with
whom the Lessee is involved in an Adverse Relationship; provided, however,
that, no such transferee which is engaged in the Lessee's Business shall
have any right to inspect Lessee's books and records or have any access to
information about the Lessee which is not generally available to the
public. For the purpose of this Section 8.3, a transferee and any of its
Affiliates shall not be deemed to be engaged in the Lessee's Business
solely by reason of their ownership of securities or other interests of any
entity engaged in any of the Lessee's Business either (x) in the case of a
transferee that is a bank, insurance company, finance subsidiary (similar
to the Owner Participant Parent) or other financial institution, (i) such
securities are held as portfolio investments and (ii) either (A) the
consolidated sales of such entity for its latest fiscal year were less than
$100,000,000, (B) such transferee and its Affiliates do not beneficially
own in the aggregate more than a 25% equity interest in such entity on a
fully diluted basis and such entity is not an Affiliate of such transferee
or any of its Affiliates (other than by virtue of the rights and powers
that arise solely from the ownership of such equity interest) or (C) the
book value of the interest of the transferee and its Affiliates in such
entity does not exceed 1% of the consolidated assets of the transferee and
its Affiliates determined at the end of its latest fiscal year or (y) in
all other cases, (i) such entity is not an Affiliate of such transferee or
any of its Affiliates and (ii) the transferee and its Affiliates do not
beneficially own in the aggregate more than a 5% equity interest in such
entity on a fully diluted basis.

Trustee, the Owner Participant, the Remainderman, the Remainderman
Participant, the Indenture Trustee, the Initial Noteholder and the Pass
Through Trustee agrees that if any Lease is terminated pursuant to Section
14 thereof, the Lessee may elect to exchange new unsecured or secured, as
the case may be, full recourse securities of the Lessee for the Related
Notes by giving notice of such exchange to each such party and each such
party will execute and deliver appropriate documentation (i) releasing the
Owner Trustee, the Connecticut Trustee and the Owner Participant from all

under such Notes and the Related Supplemental Indentures; (ii) to the
extent provided in the Indenture, releasing the security interest in the

Section 9.2. Funding of the Costs of Modifications.

(a) At the request of the Lessee, the Owner Participant may
finance any Modifications pursuant to Section 8(f)(i) of any Lease through
an Approved Equity Financing.

(b) If the Lessor finances the cost of any Modification pursuant
to Section 8(f)(iii) of a Lease exclusively by the issuance of one or more
series of Additional Notes under the Indenture, such Supplemental Financing
shall be subject to fulfillment of the following conditions:

(i) the Additional Notes shall have a final maturity date no
later than the final maturity date of all Outstanding Related
Notes, and the weighted average life-to-maturity applicable to
all Outstanding Related Notes after the issuance of the
Additional Notes shall not vary from the remaining weighted
average life-to-maturity reflected in the debt amortization
schedule for the Outstanding Related Notes (immediately prior to
the issuance of such Additional Notes) by more than six months;

(ii) appropriate adjustments to Property Cost and the
percentages for Basic Rent, Casualty Value and Termination Value

Additional Notes issued in respect of such Supplemental
Financing;

equal to all out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred
by the Lessor and the Owner Participant not financed as a part of
such Supplemental Financing;

(iv) such Supplemental Financing shall be permitted by
the Indenture;

(v) no Indenture Event of Default, Event of Default or
Special Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(vi) the Additional Notes shall not constitute recourse
indebtedness to the Owner Participant as defined under then-

transaction effected pursuant to such Lease to be classified by
the Owner Participant as other than a leveraged lease, under then-
current GAAP for leveraged leases;

(viii) all consents and approvals related to the Lessor,
the Lessee or the Lessor Interests required to effect the
issuance of the Additional Notes shall have been obtained;

(ix) after giving effect to such Supplemental Financing,
no Lien (other than Permitted Liens) shall exist upon the Lessor
Interest and the Owner Participant, the Connecticut Trustee, the
Lessor, the Remainderman and the Indenture Trustee shall have
received an endorsement to the title insurance policy for the
Related Property redating such policy as of the date funds are
advanced pursuant to such Supplemental Financing and increasing
the amount of such policy by the amount of Supplemental Financing
and showing no additional exceptions other than Permitted
Exceptions;

(x) the Owner Participant shall have received such
information and copies of such other documents as the Owner
Participant may reasonably request in connection with such

the Supplemental Financing as the Owner Participant or the Lessor
may reasonably request;

(xii) the Owner Participant shall have received a
favorable opinion from the Owner Participant's Tax Counsel to the

adverse tax consequences to the Owner Participant (other than
consequences for which the Owner Participant would be indemnified
by the Lessee pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Documents
or of another written undertaking by the Lessee to indemnify the
Owner Participant if the Lessee is Investment Grade (and if the
Lessee is not Investment Grade, in an amount and in a manner
satisfactory to the Owner Participant in its sole discretion);

(xiii) the representations and warranties of the Lessee
set forth in Section 5.1(a) and, assuming they were made in
reference to the Supplemental Financing or to documents required
to be executed or prepared (including amendments to the
Transaction Documents) in connection with the Supplemental
Financing, the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 5.1(b), (c), (d), (e), (h), (k), (l), (m), (n), (p) and
(q) shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as
of the date of such Supplemental Financing with the same effect
as though made on and as of the date of such Supplemental
Financing and each of the Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the
Owner Participant shall have received an Officer's Certificate of
the Lessee, dated as of the date of such Supplemental Financing,
as the case may be, to such effect and to the effect that no
Default or Event of Default is in existence or will exist after

(xiv) the ratio of (A) the aggregate principal amount of
all Outstanding Related Notes, including all Additional Notes
being issued in connection with the Modification, to (B) the sum
of the Fair Market Sales Value of the Related Lessor Interest
(determined prior to such modification) and the cost of the
Modification being financed, is not greater than the higher of

such Additional Notes;

(xv) the aggregate principal amount of the Additional
Notes being issued in connection with the Modification shall not

the rating of any Outstanding Notes immediately prior to the
issuance of such Additional Notes shall be confirmed as
Investment Grade; and

(xvii) the payment of Basic Rent under such Lease shall be
adjusted as provided in such Lease.

If the recording or filing of a supplement to the Related Supplemental
Indenture shall be required or, in the reasonable opinion of either the
Owner Participant or the Indenture Trustee or their respective counsel,
advisable to subject to the Lien of the Related Supplemental Indenture any
Modification, the cost of which was financed in whole or in part with
Additional Notes, then, prior to the advance of funds with respect to such
Modification, the Lessee shall prepare and, after the execution and
delivery thereof by the Lessor and the Indenture Trustee, record or file
such supplement to the Related Supplemental Indenture and such other
instruments as may be necessary to confirm that such Modification or

performance of its duties under the Transaction Documents and (b) all
reasonable fees and out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
legal and other professional fees and expenses) incurred by the Owner

the extent not included in the principal amount of the Refinancing Notes)

Initial Noteholder, the Remainderman, the Remainderman Participant, the
Remainderman Trustee, the Pass Through Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and
the Owner Trustee and the Connecticut Trustee in respect of all Transaction

breach by any party (other than the Lessee) of its obligations under the
Transaction Documents or the failure of such party to negotiate in good
faith, then the Lessee shall not be required to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless such party for such Transaction Expenses incurred by it and such

capacity (a) for its own willful misconduct or gross negligence, and to the

Participant in respect of the Trust Agreement and the Trust, (b) for
liabilities that may result from the incorrectness of any representation or
warranty expressly made by it in its individual capacity in Section 5.3, or

individual capacity as set forth in Section 6.3 hereof, or (c) for any Tax
based on or measured by any fees, commission or compensation received by it
for acting as trustee in connection with any of the transactions

having recourse to and seeking enforcement against the Trust Estate for
performance and observance of covenants, agreements and conditions required
to be performed or observed by the Owner Trustee in this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents.

3.1(t) and (VII) covering such other matters as the Owner Participant may

GRANTING CLAUSE

Section 2.01. Grant. In consideration of the obligation of the
Ground Lessee to pay Ground Lease Rent, and upon and in consideration of
the other terms, covenants and conditions set forth in this Ground Lease,
the Ground Lessor does hereby lease, demise and let unto the Ground Lessee,
and the Ground Lessee does hereby take and lease from the Ground Lessor,

Premises and all such easements and rights that are appurtenant to the fee
interest in the Demised Premises, for the Ground Lease Term, subject to

hereinafter set forth. It is the express intention of the Ground Lessor
and the Ground Lessee that: (x) this Ground Lease and the Demised Premises,
which is the subject of this Ground Lease, does not include the
Improvements, inasmuch as at all times during the Ground Lease Term, the
Improvements, which are owned by the Ground Lessee, are and shall be the
property of the Ground Lessee and shall not be conveyed, transferred or
assigned unless such conveyance, transfer or assignment shall be to a
person, corporation or other entity to whom this Ground Lease is being
transferred or assigned simultaneously therewith in compliance with the
provisions of Article X (Assignment; Subletting) hereof, and at all such
times the holder of the leasehold interest of the Ground Lessee under this
Ground Lease shall be the owner of said Improvements. Any attempted
conveyance, transfer, or assignment of the Improvements, whether
voluntarily or by operation of law or otherwise, to any person, corporation
or other entity shall be void and of no effect whatever unless such
conveyance, transfer or assignment shall be to a person, corporation or
other entity to whom this Ground Lease is being transferred or assigned
simultaneously therewith in compliance with the provisions of said Article
X. Similarly, so long as the Improvements or any part thereof shall remain
on the Demised Premises, any attempted transfer or assignment of the
leasehold interest of the Ground Lessee under this Ground Lease shall be
void and of no effect whatever unless such transfer or assignment shall be
to a person, corporation or other entity to whom the Improvements are being
conveyed, transferred or assigned simultaneously therewith.

Premises is described in Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof.

notice from the Ground Lessee to the Ground Lessor, the Ground Lessee may
terminate this Ground Lease and surrender the Demised Premises in
accordance with the provisions of this Ground Lease to the Ground Lessor,
whereupon all of the Ground Lessee's obligations in respect of this Ground
Lease shall terminate, except to the extent that such obligations are
expressly set forth herein to survive the expiration or termination of the
Ground Lease and except that the Ground Lessee shall pay a pro rata portion
of the Basic Ground Lease Rent for the period from the last Rent Payment
Date to the termination date of this Ground Lease.

ARTICLE III

RENTAL PAYMENTS

Section 3.01. Basic Ground Lease RentDuring the Ground Lease
Term, Basic Ground Lease Rent shall be payable by the Ground Lessee to the
Ground Lessor in equal semi-annual installments, which semi-annual
installments shall be payable in arrears on the second (2nd) day of each
January and July (each a "Rent Payment Date") during the Ground Lease Term.

Section 3.02. Interest. Upon the occurrence of a Ground Lessee's
Default under Section 1.09 (except for nonpayment of Additional Rental),
the Ground Lessor shall be entitled to collect from the Ground Lessee
interest on the unpaid Ground Lease Rent from the date when due until the
date paid at a rate per annum equal to the Overdue Interest Rate (the
"Default Rate"). In the event that any Additional Rental is not paid when
due and remains unpaid for a period of ten (10) Business Days after written
notice of such failure to pay is delivered to the Ground Lessee, the Ground
Lessor shall be entitled to collect from the Ground Lessee interest thereon
from the date such written notice is delivered to Ground Lessee until the
date paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.

Section 3.03. Method of Payment. Each payment of Ground Lease
Rent shall be made in immediately available funds no later than 12:00 noon
local time at the place of receipt and shall be paid to the Ground Lessor
at its address specified in Schedule I to the Participation Agreement, or
at any other address in the continental United States so given to the
Ground Lessee in the manner provided in Section 17.04 of this Ground Lease.
Nonetheless, the Ground Lessee shall be accorded a one (1) day grace period
should it fail to cause Ground Lease Rent to be received as described in
the immediately preceding sentence if such failure could not have been
reasonably anticipated and corrected. Any payment that is due on either a
day that is not a Business Day or a day on which banks in the place of
receipt are not generally open for business may instead be made on the next
succeeding day that is both a Business Day and a day on which banks in the
place of receipt are generally open for business; and, notwithstanding
Section 3.02, no interest shall accrue for the intervening period, nor in
respect of any payments made in compliance with the above described one (1)
day grace period.

Section 3.04. Intentionally Deleted.

Section 3.05. Intentionally Deleted.

ARTICLE IV

TAXES

Section 4.01. Real Estate Taxes. In addition to Basic Ground
Lease Rent, the Ground Lessee shall pay as Additional Rental during the
Ground Lease Term, all Real Estate Taxes, which amount shall be remitted to
the collecting agency(ies), before the date on which such Real Estate Taxes
become delinquent and the Ground Lessee shall promptly supply the Ground
Lessor with tax bills for such Real Estate Taxes paid. The Ground Lessor
and the Ground Lessee agree to take such steps as may be required to cause
statements or bills for Real Estate Taxes to be sent directly to the Ground
Lessee or as the Ground Lessee directs. Should any Real Estate Tax be
payable in installments, rather than as a lump-sum payment, the Ground
Lessee may, at its option, pay such Real Estate Tax in installments
provided that (i) such installment payments be permitted under Applicable
Law or Governmental Action, (ii) the Lien for such unpaid Real Estate Tax
not be susceptible of foreclosure by the collecting agency so long as the
installments are timely made and (iii) any such installments becoming due
before the end of the Ground Lease Term shall be paid prior to the end of
the Ground Lease Term. If less than a full twelve (12) month period of a
tax year is included within the Ground Lease Term, the Ground Lessee's
liability for payment of Real Estate Taxes shall be prorated on a per diem
basis for such partial tax year.

Section 4.02. Failure to Make Payment. If the Ground Lessee does
not pay Real Estate Taxes in accordance with the terms of this Ground
Lease, on or before the date the same becomes delinquent, or fails to
notify the Ground Lessor of its intention to contest the same prior to such
delinquency or, in the event of such contest, fails to pay such contested
item in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.03, the Ground Lessor
may (but shall not be obligated to), at its election, pay such item
together with any interest, fees or penalties due thereon, and the amount
so paid by the Ground Lessor shall be repayable to it by the Ground Lessee
on written demand therefore delivered to the Ground Lessee.

Section 4.03. The Ground Lessee's Right to Contest. At any time
after the Lease Termination Date, the Ground Lessee (or its sublessee) may
in good faith and at its sole cost and expense (in its own name or in the
name of the Ground Lessor, or both, as the Ground Lessee (or its sublessee)
may determine appropriate) contest the validity or amount of the Real
Estate Taxes, in which event, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
the payment thereof may be deferred during the pendency of such contest.
If a deferral of any Real Estate Taxes is not permitted in connection with
a protest, appeal or other challenge, then the Ground Lessee shall pay all
Real Estate Taxes in accordance with the terms of this Ground Lease as if a
protest, appeal or other challenge had not been initiated while preserving
its protest rights. If requested by the Ground Lessee, the Ground Lessor
will join the Ground Lessee (or its sublessee) as a party to any such
contest; provided, however, that the Ground Lessor shall not be obligated
to incur any expense in connection therewith. Nothing herein contained
shall be construed to authorize the Ground Lessee to allow or to permit a
Lien for Real Estate Taxes that (x) involves any danger of the foreclosure,
forfeiture or loss of the Improvements or the Demised Premises or any part
thereof or interest therein or any substantial danger of the sale of the
Improvements or any parts thereof or interest therein, (y) interferes with
the use, possession or disposition of the Improvements or the Demised
Premises or any part thereof or interest therein, or (z) interferes with
the payment of Ground Lease Rent. The Ground Lessee shall indemnify and
hold the Ground Lessor harmless from and against any loss, cost, expense
(including court costs and reasonable attorney's fees) or liability
resulting from or as a result of the Ground Lessee's instituting or
pursuing any such contest.

(a) If, during the Ground Lease Term and when the Sublease
is in effect, the Ground Lessee has received written notice from the
Sublessee that the Sublessee has declared an Event of Loss and the Ground

intends to terminate this Ground Lease, this Ground Lease shall terminate
on the Lease Termination Date, and all the obligations of Ground Lessee
hereunder, including its obligation to pay Ground Lease Rent, arising after
the occurrence of such Event of Loss shall terminate.

(b) If, during the Ground Lease Term and following the Lease

If, during the Ground Lease Term, only a part of the Demised Premises is
taken for any public or quasi-public use or purpose by virtue of eminent
domain or by private sale in lieu thereof (which taking does not constitute
an Event of Loss) and the remainder is suitable for use by the Ground
Lessee for the Ground Lessee's purposes, this Ground Lease shall remain in
full force and effect as to that portion of the Demised Premises not taken,
but the Basic Ground Lease Rent payable to the Ground Lessor hereunder
shall be reduced during the unexpired portion of the Ground Lease Term
proportionately. Any amount received at any time by the Ground Lessor or
the Ground Lessee from any Governmental Authority or other Person as a
result of the occurrence of any such event shall be applied (i) in
accordance with the terms of the Sublease and the other Transaction
Documents (and shall be paid over by the recipient to the Persons entitled
thereto under the Sublease and the other Transaction Documents) if such
event occurs on or prior to the Lease Termination Date, or (ii) if such
event occurs after the Lease Termination Date, in the same manner as is

effect and the Basic Ground Lease Rent payable to the Ground Lessor
hereunder shall not be reduced. Any amount received at any time by the
Ground Lessor or the Ground Lessee from any Governmental Authority or other
Person as a result of the occurrence of any such event shall be applied (i)

Documents (and shall be paid over by the recipient to the Persons entitled
thereto under the Sublease and the other Transaction Documents) if such
event occurs on or prior to the Lease Termination Date, or (ii) as follows
if such event occurs after the Lease Termination Date (and shall be paid
over by the recipient to the Persons entitled thereto):

shall have no obligation to) notify the Ground Lessee of such failure, and
if the Ground Lessee does not deliver to the Ground Lessor within ten (10)
days after delivery of such notice, certificates showing all such insurance
to be in full force and effect, the Ground Lessor may, at the Ground
Lessor's option, procure the necessary insurance to comply with the
provisions hereof and pay the premiums therefor, in which event the Ground
Lessee will, upon written demand therefore delivered to the Ground Lessee,
immediately reimburse and pay the Ground Lessor any amount so paid or
expended in the payment of the insurance premiums required herein and
specified in such notice.

employees, nor shall the Ground Lessor be liable for any loss, cost,
expense or claim arising out of the ownership of the Demised Premises or
operation of the Improvements, except to the extent such claims are based
upon the willful acts or gross negligence of the Ground Lessor, and the
Ground Lessee agrees to indemnify and hold the Ground Lessor harmless from
any such claims or liabilities. The Ground Lessee shall not be liable to
the Ground Lessor or to the Ground Lessor's agents, servants, employees,

the Ground Lease Term or upon any termination of this Ground Lease at any
other time, deliver up and surrender the Demised Premises to the Ground
Lessor free and clear of any Permitted Liens and as follows:

(a) In the event that the termination of the Ground Lease
occurs within twenty-four (24) months following the Lease Termination Date,
then the Ground Lessee may surrender the Demised Premises and the
Improvements remaining thereon in no worse a condition than that in which
the Sublessee surrendered the Demised Premises and Improvements to the

(b) In all other events, the Ground Lessee shall surrender
the Demised Premises and the Improvements remaining thereon on such date in
compliance with all material Applicable Laws; provided, however, that the
Ground Lessee shall have no obligation to comply with any Applicable Law
that pertains to a condition of the Demised Premises or Improvements
remaining thereon which existed on the Lease Termination Date (unless (i)
the Demised Premises and the Improvements thereon in the absence of such
compliance and assuming such improvements remain unused and unoccupied,
would constitute a clear and present danger to health or safety, or (ii)
any removal by the Ground Lessee of building systems or other portions of
the Improvements shall have caused material structural damage to the

occurs as a result of a Casualty Event, then the delivery to the Ground
Lessor of insurance proceeds under Section 8.05 hereof shall satisfy the
Ground Lessee's obligations under this Section 9.01(b)). The Demised
Premises and the Improvements shall be so surrendered without any payment
or allowance whatsoever by the Ground Lessor on account of or for the
Improvements at the time of the surrender, or for the contents thereof or
appurtenances hereto.

the state of its incorporation or formation and is qualified to
do business in the State of California and (ii) this Ground Lease

shall deliver to the Ground Lessee an agreement of the mortgagee under such
mortgage (in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Ground Lessee) to the

transfer in lieu thereof), such mortgagee will not, so long as no Ground
Lessee's Default exists and is continuing, disturb the Ground Lessee's (or
its sublessee's) use or possession of the Demised Premises or the
Improvements on Demised Premises and will assume all the obligations of the
Ground Lessor under this Ground Lease, and (ii) such mortgage encumbers and

Subject to Section 11.02 below, the Ground Lessee shall have the right,
without the Ground Lessee's prior consent, to mortgage or further encumber
its leasehold estate hereunder (any such mortgage being a "Leasehold
Mortgage"), provided that any such mortgage or encumbrance is not
prohibited under the Transaction Documents.

Section 11.02. Limitations on Financing. The Ground Lessee's
rights to obtain such financing and refinancing shall be subject to the
following conditions:

(a) No Ground Lessee's Default under this Ground Lease
shall have occurred and be continuing.

(b) Any instrument evidencing such financing or refinancing
shall provide that the Ground Lessor shall not be liable for the
payment of such indebtedness or the performance of any of the
covenants contained in the documents securing payment thereof,
and that in the event of default in payment or performance
thereof, the holder of such indebtedness will not look to the
Ground Lessor's interest in the Demised Premises for satisfaction
of the indebtedness thereby secured.

(c) No mortgage now or hereafter a lien upon this Ground
Lease shall extend to or affect the reversionary interest and
estate of the Ground Lessor in and to the Demised Premises and
the Improvements, or in any manner attach to or affect the Ground
Lessor's interest in the Demised Premises and the Improvements.

Section 11.03. Certificates. The Ground Lessor shall, from time
to time during the Ground Lease Term, upon request of the Ground Lessee and
on not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice, deliver to the
Ground Lessee and any Leasehold Mortgagee so requesting, a statement in
writing confirming that the mortgage held by said Leasehold Mortgagee
constitutes a "Leasehold Mortgage" pursuant to the terms of this Article
XI.

Section 11.04. Notification of the Ground Lessor. If the Ground
Lessee shall grant a Leasehold Mortgage and shall provide the Ground Lessor
with notice thereof specifying the name and address of the holder of such
Leasehold Mortgage (a "Leasehold Mortgagee"), then the Ground Lessor, upon
giving the Ground Lessee a notice of (i) default, (ii) termination or
proposed termination, (iii) a matter on which the Ground Lessor may claim
or base a default, (iv) consent to an assignment or subletting or (v) any
other matter which could materially and adversely affect the rights or
obligations of the Ground Lessor or the Ground Lessee, shall at the same
time also give such notice to the Leasehold Mortgagee or the notice given
shall be deemed ineffective as to the Leasehold Mortgagee and the Ground
Lessee. In the case of a default notice, such notice shall set forth with
particularity those defaults being claimed at that time.

Section 11.05. Rights of a Leasehold Mortgagee.

(a) A Leasehold Mortgagee shall have the right, but
not any obligation, to perform any term, covenant, condition or agreement
of this Ground Lease and to remedy any default by the Ground Lessee
hereunder within the time limits set forth in this Ground Lease (and such
additional time (x) as is reasonably required to cure any non-monetary
Ground Lessee' s Default which is capable of cure, proceeding with
diligence, and (y) if possession of the Premises is required to cure such
default, as is reasonably required to obtain possession of the Premises and
to cure such default) and the Ground Lessor will accept such performance.

(b) If a Ground Lessee's Default shall occur which would
otherwise entitle the Ground Lessor to terminate this Ground Lease, the
Ground Lessor shall have no right to terminate this Ground Lease unless,
following the expiration of the period of time given the Ground Lessee to
cure such default, the Ground Lessor shall give the Leasehold Mortgagee
additional written notice of the Ground Lessee's Default and the Leasehold
Mortgagee shall have sixty (60) days following its receipt of such notice
to remedy any such default (and such additional time (x) as is reasonably
required to cure any non-monetary Ground Lessee's Default which is capable
of cure, proceeding with diligence, and (y) if possession of the Demised
Premises is required to cure such default, as is reasonably required to
obtain possession of the Demised Premises and to cure such default) and the
Ground Lessor will accept such performance. In the event that the
Leasehold Mortgagee fails to cure any Ground Lessee's Default in the manner
or within the time period herein provided, the Ground Lessor shall provide
the Leasehold Mortgagee with written notice of the Ground Lessor's intent
to terminate this Ground Lease at least sixty (60) days in advance of the
proposed effective date of such termination. The Leasehold Mortgagee, in
addition to its right as described above to cure defaults by the Ground
Lessee, shall have the right to postpone the date on which this Ground
Lease would terminate as a result of the Ground Lessee's default in
accordance with said notice by (a) giving Ground Lessor written notice
within such sixty (60) day period of the Leasehold Mortgagee's election to
postpone the date on which this Ground Lease would terminate, and (b)
proceeding with due diligence (i) to cure all defaults, if any, from the
date of the Ground Lessee's Default then existing which may be cured by the
payment of a sum of money, (ii) to initiate and pursue steps to acquire the
Demised Premises by foreclosure of its Leasehold Mortgage or otherwise and
(iii) after obtaining possession of the Demised Premises, to cure any other
then existing default of the Ground Lessee susceptible of being cured by
the Leasehold Mortgagee from the date of the Ground Lessee's Default. In
the case of a default which is personal to the Ground Lessee and which
cannot be cured by the Leasehold Mortgagee, the Ground Lessor's right to
terminate this Ground Lease on account thereof shall be deemed to be waived
so long as all other defaults are cured by the Leasehold Mortgagee as
provided in this Ground Lease.

Section 11.06. New Lease. If within sixty (60) days (as such
period may be extended while diligent efforts to cure are proceeding)
following Leasehold Mortgagee's receipt of notice pursuant to Section
11.05(b) above of the Ground Lessor's intention to terminate this Ground
Lease, the Leasehold Mortgagee shall deliver to the Ground Lessor a written
request for a new ground lease of the Demised Premises, then the Ground
Lessor shall promptly enter into a new ground lease of the Demised Premises
with such Leasehold Mortgagee or its designee effective as of the date of
actual termination of Ground Lessee's rights under this Ground Lease on the
same terms as this Ground Lease, provided, that (i) the Ground Lessor
receives, at or prior to the execution of such new ground lease, payment of
any Ground Lease Rent due from the date of the Ground Lessee's Default to
the date of the delivery of the new ground lease (to the extent any such
Ground Lease Rent would be due if this Ground Lease were not terminated)
and (ii) the Ground Lessor receives an undertaking in writing that,
promptly following the delivery of the new ground lease, such Leasehold
Mortgagee or its designee will perform or cause to be performed all of the
other covenants and agreements contained in this Ground Lease on the Ground
Lessee's part to be performed from the date of the Ground Lessee's Default
(except to the extent (i) the Ground Lessee shall have performed the same
prior to the date of delivery of such new ground lease, (ii) performance is
not required pursuant to Section 11.05 hereof or (iii) such covenants and
agreements cannot reasonably, with the exercise of due diligence, be
performed by such Leasehold Mortgage or its designee). A new ground lease
shall (a) be effective as of the date of the termination of the Ground
Lessee's rights under this Ground Lease as such remainder existed
immediately prior to termination, (b) require the same Ground Lease Rent
and other charges to be paid as were payable under this Ground Lease, (c)
include the same terms, covenants, conditions and agreements as are
contained in this Ground Lease (as modified hereby), (d) have the same
priority as this Ground Lease, and (e) provide that the ground lessee under
such any ground lease shall be liable to perform the obligations imposed on
the ground lessee by such new ground lease only during the time period that
such party is the ground lessee of the Demised Premises. In the event that
the Leasehold Mortgagee fails to provide a written response to the Ground
Lessor's notice of intent to terminate this Ground Lease or sign and
deliver the new ground lease tendered by the Ground Lessor as provided for
in this Section 11.06 within the applicable sixty (60) day period, this
Ground Lease shall terminate on the date provided for in the Ground
Lessor's notice of intent to terminate.

If in any instance more than one Leasehold Mortgagee exercise its
right to obtain a new lease pursuant to this Section 11.06, then only the
Leasehold Mortgagee holding the lien of the highest priority shall be
entitled to the new lease free and clear of the rights of all other
lienors.

Section 11.07. Consent to Modification. The Ground Lessor will
not accept any surrender, agree to the cancellation, or enter into any
modification, of this Ground Lease without the prior written consent
thereto of any Leasehold Mortgagee of which the Ground Lessor has been
given notice by the Ground Lessee. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no termination under Section 365(h) of the Bankruptcy Code shall
be effective against the Leasehold Mortgagee without the prior written
consent of the Leasehold Mortgagee.

Section 11.08. Intentionally Deleted.

agreed that if the curing of any Ground Lessor's Default or any Ground

of God, governmental restrictions or regulations, fire or other casualty,
strikes, shortages of labor or material, or any circumstances beyond the
control of the party obligated or permitted under the terms hereof to do or
perform the same, regardless of whether or not any such circumstance is
similar to any of those enumerated above, the Ground Lessee and the Ground
Lessor shall be excused from doing or performing the same during such
period of delay.

estoppel certificates to lenders, partners investors or others with a bona
fide business purpose requesting the same.

Section 17.03. Headings. The division of this Ground Lease into
sections, the provision of table of contents and the insertion of headings
are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction
or interpretation of this Ground Lease.

Section 17.04. Notice. All communications, declarations,
demands and notices provided for in this Ground Lease shall be in writing
and shall be given in the manner and addressed as set forth in the
Participation Agreement. So long as the Sublease remains in effect, a copy

Sublessee, and a copy of any notice received by any party hereto from
Sublessee shall be given to the other party hereto, and a copy of any
notice required to be given by the Ground Lessee to Sublessee under the
Sublease shall be given to the Ground Lessor.

Section 17.05. Governing Law. This Ground Lease shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
California without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

Section 17.06. Memorandum of Lease and Recordation. Each of the
parties hereto will, promptly upon request of the other, execute a notice
or memorandum of this Ground Lease. A memorandum of this Ground Lease may
be recorded by either party hereto. The party causing or requiring the
recordation of such memorandum shall pay all recordation, transfer or other
tax or fee incident to such recordation.

Section 17.07. Severability of Provisions. Any provision of
this Ground Lease that may be determined by competent authority to be
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Ground Lessee and the Ground Lessor
hereby waive any provision of law that renders any provision hereof
prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

Section 17.08. Amendment. The provisions of this Ground Lease
may not be waived, altered, modified, amended, supplemented or terminated
in any manner whatsoever except by written instrument signed by the Ground
Lessor and the Ground Lessee.

Section 17.09. Multiple Counterparts. This Ground Lease may be
executed in a number of identical counterparts, each of which constitutes
an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
agreement; provided, however, that in making proof of this Ground Lease, it
shall not be necessary for any party hereto to produce or account for more
than one such counterpart.

Section 17.10. Successors and Assigns. This Ground Lease shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Ground Lessor and the
Ground Lessee, and their respective permitted administrations, successors
and assigns, except as otherwise limited or specifically qualified in this
Ground Lease.

proceeding brought by either party under this Ground Lease against the
other party, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be
entitled to recover from the other party all costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by reason of such action or
proceeding.

Section 17.12. Attornment and Non-Disturbance. From time to
time at the request of the Ground Lessee, the Ground Lessor shall execute
and deliver to the Ground Lessee for the benefit of any tenant in the
Improvements attornment and non-disturbance agreements in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Ground Lessor, under which the
Ground Lessor, as applicable, shall agree to recognize the lease of any
such tenant and to permit such tenant to remain in occupancy of its
premises within the Improvements notwithstanding any default hereunder by
the Ground Lessee, so long as such tenant is not in default under the lease
covering its premises within the Improvements and the tenancy of such
tenant does not extend beyond the Ground Lease Term (calculated without
regard to terminations resulting from a Ground Lessee's Default). Any such
agreement shall provide that such tenant is obligated to attorn to the
Ground Lessor if this Ground Lease is terminated under the terms hereof and
to recognize the Ground Lessor as the landlord under the lease with such
tenant covering its premises within the Improvements. The issuance of any
such agreement shall in no way release or diminish the Ground Lessee's
duties and obligations under this Ground Lease.

Section 17.13. Non-Merger. There shall be no merger of this
Ground Lease, the Demised Premises or the Improvements with the fee estate
in and to the Demised Premises, by reason of the fact that this Ground
Lease, or the Improvements, or any interest in any of them, may at any time
be held directly or indirectly by or for the account of any Person who
shall own the fee estate in and to the Demised Premises, or any portion
thereof, and no such merger shall occur unless and until all persons at the
time having any interest in the fee estate and all persons having any
interest in this Ground Lease, the leasehold estate, or the Improvements,
including the holder of any mortgage upon the fee estate in and to the
Demised Premises, shall join in a written instrument effecting such merger.

Section 17.14. Inspection. Upon not less than five (5) Business
Days' notice to the Ground Lessee, the Ground Lessor and its authorized
representatives shall have the right, at its own expense (and subject, in
each event, to Applicable Law, then existing leases as to the Improvements,
and the Ground Lessee's reasonable procedures), to inspect the Demised
Premises and the books and records of the Ground Lessee relating to the
Demised Premises and the Improvements and the operation thereof, and to
make copies of and extracts therefrom (other than copies of and extracts
from proprietary data and information).

Section 17.15. Further Assurances and Cooperation. The Ground
Lessor and the Ground Lessee each agree to cause to be promptly and duly
taken, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further acts,
documents and assurances as the other party from time to time may
reasonably request in order to carry out more effectively the intent and
purposes of this Ground Lease. Upon request of the Ground Lessee, the
Ground Lessor shall cooperate with the Ground Lessee in obtaining the valid
and effective issuance or transfer or amendment, as the case may be, of all
Governmental Actions necessary, or in the reasonable opinion of the Ground
Lessee desirable, for the ownership, operation and possession of the
Demised Premises (or any property purported to be covered by this Ground
Lease) by the Ground Lessee or any transferee, lessee or assignee thereof.

Section 17.16 Perpetuities Savings Clause. If any option or
other provision under this Ground Lease would, in the absence of the
limitation imposed by this Section 17.16, be invalid or unenforceable as
being in violation of the rule against perpetuities or any other rule of
law relating to the vesting of an interest in property or the suspension of
the power of alienation of property, then such option or other provision
shall be exercisable only during the period which shall end twenty (20)
years and six (6) months after the date of death of the last survivor of
the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy (deceased father of the late
President, John F. Kennedy) alive on the date of the execution and delivery
of this Ground Lease.

ARTICLE XVIII

THE SUBLEASE

Section 18.01 The Sublease. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Ground Lease to the contrary, as long as the Sublease is in effect
and has not expired or been terminated, to the extent that any term,
condition or covenant contained in this Ground Lease is inconsistent with
any term, condition or covenant contained in the Sublease, the terms,
conditions and covenants contained in the Sublease shall govern as though
such terms, conditions and covenants were contained herein, and compliance
with the terms, covenants and conditions of the Sublease by Sublessee shall
be deemed to constitute full compliance with the terms, conditions and
covenants contained in this Ground Lease, so that no default of the Ground
Lessee shall exist hereunder so long as the Sublease has not been
terminated.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused this
Ground Lease to be duly executed by an officer thereunto duly authorized as
of the date and year first above written.

retained by the Owner Trustee and forthwith remitted to State Street; and,
second, the balance, if any, of such payment or amount remaining thereafter
shall be distributed to the Owner Participant; provided, however, that in
the event that the Indenture shall have been discharged, the Owner Trustee
shall in all events pay any amounts due and payable under the Lease prior
to making any distribution to the Owner Participant; provided, however,
that during the occurrence and continuance of a Lease Event of Default, any
such payment which would be required to be made to the Lessee pursuant to
the terms of the Lease shall be held and invested by the Owner Trustee
pursuant to Section 9(h) of the Lease as further security for the
obligations of the Lessee under the Lease, and at such time as there shall
not be continuing any Lease Event of Default, such payment shall be made to
the Lessee.

Anything in this Article IV or elsewhere in this Trust Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, any Excepted Payment received at any time

DUTIES OF THE OWNER TRUSTEE

SECTION 5.01. Notice of Certain Events. In the event the Owner
Trustee shall have knowledge of any Default, Event of Default, Indenture
Default, Indenture Event of Default or Event of Loss, the Owner Trustee
shall give prompt telephonic notice thereof followed by written
confirmation to the Owner Participant, the Lessee, the Remainderman Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee unless such Default, Event of Default, Indenture
Default, Indenture Event of Default or Event of Loss no longer exists
before the giving of such notice. Subject to the provisions of Section
5.03, the Owner Trustee shall take or refrain from taking such action, not
inconsistent with the provisions of the Transaction Documents, with respect
thereto as the Owner Participant shall direct by written instructions to
the Owner Trustee. If the Owner Trustee shall have given the Owner
Participant notice of any event and shall not have received written
instructions as above provided within 30 days after mailing notice of such
event to the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee may, but shall be under
no duty to, and shall have no liability for its failure or refusal to, take
or refrain from taking any action with respect thereto, not inconsistent
with the provisions of the Transaction Documents, as the Owner Trustee
shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Owner Participant.
For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, in the absence of actual
knowledge of an officer in the Corporate Trust Administration Department of
State Street, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed not to have knowledge of
any Default, Event of Default, Indenture Default, Indenture Event of
Default or Event of Loss unless such officer of the Owner Trustee receives
notice thereof given by or on behalf of the Owner Participant, the Lessee,
the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder.

SECTION 5.02. Action upon Instructions. Subject to the
provisions of Sections 5.01 and 5.03, upon the written instructions of the
Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee will take or refrain from taking such
action or actions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Transaction
Documents, as may be specified in such instructions.

SECTION 5.03. Indemnification. The Owner Trustee shall not be
required to take or refrain from taking any action under this Trust
Agreement or any other Transaction Document (other than the actions
specified in the first sentence of Section 5.01 and in the last sentence of
Section 5.04) unless
State Street shall have been indemnified by the Lessee or, if State Street
reasonably believes such indemnity to be inadequate, by the Owner
Participant, in manner and form reasonably satisfactory to State Street,
against any liability, fee, cost or expense (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) that may be incurred or charged in connection
therewith, other than such as may result from the willful misconduct or
gross negligence of the Owner Trustee; and, if the Owner Participant shall
have directed the Owner Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action
under any Transaction Document, the Owner Participant agrees to furnish
such indemnity by a written undertaking of indemnification and, in
addition, to pay the reasonable compensation of State Street for the
services performed or to be performed by the Owner Trustee pursuant to such
direction. The Owner Trustee shall not be required to take any action
under any Transaction Document if State Street shall reasonably determine,
or shall have been advised by counsel, that such action is likely to result
in personal liability for which State Street has not been and will not be
adequately indemnified or is contrary to the terms hereof or of any
Transaction Document to which the Owner Trustee is a party or is otherwise
contrary to law.

SECTION 5.04. No Duties Except as Specified in Trust Agreement
or Instructions. The Owner Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation
to manage, control, use, make any payment in respect of, register, record,
insure, inspect, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with the Lessor
Interest in respect of each of the Properties or any other part of the
Trust Estate, or to otherwise take or refrain from taking any action under
or in connection with any Transaction Document to which the Owner Trustee
is a party, except as expressly provided by the terms of this Trust
Agreement or in written instructions from the Owner Participant received
pursuant to Section 5.01, 5.02 or 6.07; and no implied duties or
obligations shall be read into this Trust Agreement against the Owner
Trustee. State Street nevertheless agrees that it will, at its own cost
and expense, promptly take all action as may be necessary to discharge any
Lessor's Liens arising by, through or under it on any part of the Trust
Estate.

SECTION 5.05. No Action Except Under Specified Documents or
Instructions. State Street agrees that it will not manage, control, use,
sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with the Lessor Interest in respect of
each of the Properties or any other part of the Trust Estate except (i) as
required by the terms of the Transaction Documents, (ii) in accordance with
the powers granted to, or the authority conferred upon, it pursuant to this
Trust Agreement or (iii) in accordance with the express terms hereof or
with written instructions from the Owner Participant pursuant to
Section 5.01, 5.02 or 6.07.

SECTION 5.06. Absence of Duties. Except in accordance with
written instructions furnished pursuant to Section 5.01, 5.02 or 6.07, and
without limitation of the generality of Section 5.04, the Owner Trustee
shall not have any duty to (i) file, record or deposit any Transaction
Document or any other document, or to maintain any such filing, recording
or deposit or to refile, rerecord or redeposit any such document,
(ii) obtain insurance on the Lessor Interest in respect of each of the
Properties or effect or maintain any such insurance, other than to receive
and forward to the Owner Participant any notices, policies, certificates or
binders furnished to the Owner Trustee pursuant to the Lease,
(iii) maintain the Lessor Interest in respect of each of the Properties,
(iv) pay or discharge any Tax or any Lien owing with respect to or assessed
or levied against any part of the Trust Estate, except as provided in the
last sentence of Section 5.04, other than to forward notice of such Tax or
Lien received by the Owner Trustee to the Owner Participant, (v) confirm,
verify, investigate or inquire into the failure to receive any reports or
financial statements of the Lessee, (vi) inspect the Lessor Interest in
respect of each of the Properties at any time or ascertain or inquire as to
the performance or observance of any of the covenants of the Lessee or any
other Person under any Transaction Document with respect to the Lessor
Interest in respect of each of the Properties, or (vii) manage, control,
use, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with the Lessor Interest in respect
of each of the Properties or any part thereof or any other part of the
Trust Estate, except as provided in Section 5.05.

furnish to the Owner Participant, promptly upon receipt thereof, duplicates

SECTION 6.03. No Representations or Warranties as to the Lessor
Interest in Respect of Any of the Properties or Transaction Documents.
State Street makes (i) NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AS TO THE TITLE, VALUE, CONDITION, DESIGN, OPERATION,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR USE OF THE LESSOR INTEREST IN RESPECT OF ANY

Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents to which the Owner
Trustee is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of
State Street, enforceable against it in accordance with their terms, except
as such terms may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors and by
general principles of equity.

SECTION 6.04. No Segregation of Moneys; No Interest. Except as
otherwise provided herein or in any of the Transaction Documents, moneys
received by the Owner Trustee hereunder need not be segregated in any
manner, except to the extent required by law, and may be deposited under
such general conditions as may be prescribed by law, and neither State
Street nor the Owner Trustee shall be liable for any interest thereon,
except as may be agreed to by State Street or the Owner Trustee.

SECTION 6.05. Reliance; Advice of Counsel.
State Street shall not incur any liability to any Person in acting upon any
signature, instrument, notice, resolution, request, consent, order,
certificate, report, opinion, bond or other document or paper believed by
it to be genuine and believed by it in good faith to be signed by the
proper party or parties. State Street may accept and rely upon a certified
copy of a resolution of the board of directors or other governing body of
any corporate party as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been
duly adopted by such body and that the same is in full force and effect.
As to any fact or matter the manner of ascertainment of which is not
specifically prescribed herein,
State Street may for all purposes hereof rely on an Officers' Certificate
of the relevant party, as to such fact or matter, and such certificate
shall constitute full protection to State Street for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith in reliance thereon. In the
administration of the trusts hereunder, State Street may execute any of the
trusts or powers hereof and perform its powers and duties hereunder
directly or through agents or attorneys and may consult with counsel,
accountants and other skilled Persons to be selected and employed by it,
and State Street shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted
in good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such
counsel, accountants or other skilled Persons and not contrary to this
Trust Agreement.

SECTION 6.06. Not Acting in Individual Capacity. All Persons
having any claim against State Street or the Owner Trustee by reason of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents shall look only to
the Trust Estate (or a part thereof, as the case may be) for payment or
satisfaction thereof, except as specifically provided in this Article VI
and except to the extent that State Street shall otherwise expressly agree
in any Transaction Document to which it is a party.

SECTION 6.07. Books and Records; Tax Returns. The Owner Trustee
shall be responsible for the keeping of all appropriate books and records
relating to the receipt and disbursement of all moneys that it may receive
or be entitled to hereunder or under any other Transaction Document. At
the request and expense of the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee shall
file an application with the Internal Revenue Service for a taxpayer
identification number with respect to the trust created hereby and prepare
or cause to be prepared and sign and/or file the Federal fiduciary tax
return with respect to Taxes due and payable by the trust created hereby in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or by any other
Transaction Document; provided, however, that the Owner Trustee shall send
a copy of the completed return to the Owner Participant not more than 60
nor less than 10 days prior to the due date of the return. The Owner
Participant, upon request by the Owner Trustee, shall furnish the Owner
Trustee with all such information as may be reasonably required from the
Owner Participant in connection with the preparation of such tax returns.
The Owner Trustee shall keep copies of all returns delivered to or filed by
it.

pocket costs, expenses and disbursements (including legal and consultants'
fees and expenses) of any kind and nature whatsoever (collectively, the
"Expenses") which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted at any time
against State Street or the Owner Trustee (but only if and to the extent
State Street is not indemnified for such Expenses by the Lessee or any
other Person within a reasonable time after demand therefor) in any way
relating to or arising out of the Trust Estate, any of the properties
included therein, the administration of the Trust Estate or any action or
inaction of the Owner Trustee hereunder or under the Transaction Documents,
except only that the Owner Participant shall not be required to indemnify
State Street for Expenses arising or resulting from any of the matters
described in the last sentences of Sections 5.04 and 6.01. The indemnities
contained in this Section 7.01 shall survive the termination of this Trust
Agreement.

SECTION 7.02. Compensation and Expenses. State Street shall
receive as compensation for its services hereunder such ordinary fees as
are fair, reasonable and customary for the performance of such services and
as may heretofore and from time to time hereafter be agreed upon between
the Owner Participant and State Street. State Street shall be entitled to
be reimbursed for its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) incurred in the performance of its duties as Owner Trustee hereunder
and to be compensated reasonably for any extraordinary services rendered
hereunder. The Owner Participant agrees promptly to compensate or
reimburse State Street for any fees and expenses not otherwise paid or
reimbursed by the Lessee pursuant to Section 10.2 or 10.3 of the
Participation Agreement.

TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT

SECTION 8.01. Termination of Trust Agreement. This Trust
Agreement and the trusts created hereby shall terminate and the Trust
Estate shall, subject to the provisions of the Participation Agreement, the
Indenture and Article IV, be distributed to the Owner Participant, and this
Trust Agreement shall be of no further force or effect, upon the earlier of
(i) the written request of the Owner Participant following both the final
discharge of the Indenture pursuant to Section 3.1 thereof and the sale or
other final disposition by the Owner Trustee of all property constituting
part of the Trust Estate and the final distribution by the Owner Trustee of
all moneys or other property or proceeds constituting part of the Trust
Estate in accordance with the terms of Article IV hereof and (ii) 21 years
after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of the late King
George V of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland who
were living on the date hereof, but if any such rights, privileges or
options shall be or become valid under Applicable Law for a period
subsequent to the 21st anniversary of the death of such last survivor (or,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if legislation shall
become effective providing for the validity or permitting the effective
grant of such rights, privileges and options for a period in gross
exceeding the period for which such rights, privileges and options are
hereinabove stated to extend and be valid), then such rights, privileges or
options shall not terminate as aforesaid but shall extend to and continue
in effect, but only if such nontermination and extension shall then be
valid under Applicable Law, until such time as the same shall, under
Applicable Law, cease to be valid.

SECTION 8.02. Termination at Option of the Owner Participant.
Notwithstanding Section 8.01, this Trust Agreement and the trusts created
hereby shall terminate and the Trust Estate shall be distributed to the
Owner Participant, and this Trust Agreement shall be of no further force
and effect, upon the election of the Owner Participant by notice to the
Owner Trustee, if such notice shall be accompanied by the written agreement
of the Owner Participant assuming all the obligations of the Owner Trustee
under or contemplated by the Transaction Documents and all other
obligations of the Owner Trustee incurred by it as trustee hereunder;
provided, however, that the Owner Participant agrees for the express
benefit of the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders that no such election
shall be effective until the lien and security interest of the Indenture on
the Indenture Estate shall have been released and until full payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and all other sums
due to the Noteholders shall have been made. Such written agreement shall
be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Owner Trustee and
shall release the Owner Trustee from all further obligations of the Owner
Trustee hereunder and under the agreements and other instruments mentioned
in the preceding sentence.

SECTION 8.03. Actions by the Owner Trustee upon Termination.
Upon termination of this Trust Agreement and the trusts created hereby
pursuant to Section 8.01 or Section 8.02, the Owner Trustee shall take such
action as may be requested by the Owner Participant to transfer the Trust
Estate to the Owner Participant, including, without limitation, the
execution of instruments of transfer or assignment with respect to any of
the Transaction Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party.

SECTION 8.04. Bankruptcy of the Owner Participant. The
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar incapacity of the Owner Participant
shall not (i) operate to terminate this Trust Agreement, (ii) entitle the
Owner Participant's legal representatives to claim an accounting or to take
any action in any court for a partition or winding up of the Trust Estate
or (iii) otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the
parties hereto. Without the prior written consent of the Indenture
Trustee, the Owner Participant may not withdraw from the Trust or obtain
possession of, or otherwise exercise remedies with respect to, the Trust
Estate or any portion thereof prior to the satisfaction and discharge of
the lien and security interest of the Indenture on the Indenture Estate or
prior to the payment in full of the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on the Notes and all other sums due to the Noteholders; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 8.04 shall prevent the transfer of
the Owner Participant's beneficial interest in the Trust Estate with
respect to any Property pursuant to Section 11.01 of this Trust Agreement
and Article VIII of the Participation Agreement.

SUCCESSOR OWNER TRUSTEES, CO-OWNER
TRUSTEES
AND SEPARATE OWNER TRUSTEES

The Owner Trustee may resign at any time without cause by
giving at least 30 days' prior written notice to the Owner Participant and
the Indenture Trustee, such resignation to be effective on the acceptance
of appointment by a successor Owner Trustee under Section 9.01(b). The
Owner Trustee may be removed with or without cause at any time by the Owner
Participant with 60 days prior written notice and a copy of which shall be
concurrently delivered by the Owner Participant to the Indenture Trustee.
Any such removal shall be effective upon the acceptance of appointment by a
successor Owner Trustee under Section 9.01(b). In case of the resignation
or removal of the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant may appoint a
successor Owner Trustee by an instrument signed by the Owner Participant.
If a successor Owner Trustee shall not have been appointed within 30 days
after the giving of written notice of such resignation or the delivery of
the written instrument with respect to such removal, the Owner Trustee or
the Owner Participant may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint a successor Owner Trustee to act until such time, if any, as a
successor shall have been appointed and shall have accepted its appointment
as above provided. Any successor Owner Trustee so appointed by such court
shall immediately and without further act be superseded by any successor
Owner Trustee appointed as above provided within one year from the date of
the appointment by such court.

Any successor Owner Trustee, however appointed, shall
execute and deliver to the predecessor Owner Trustee an instrument
accepting such appointment, and thereupon such successor Owner Trustee,
without further act shall become vested with all the estates, properties,
rights, powers, duties and trusts of the predecessor Owner Trustee in the
trusts hereunder with like effect as if originally named an Owner Trustee
herein; but nevertheless, upon the written request of such successor Owner
Trustee such predecessor Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver an
instrument transferring to such successor Owner Trustee, upon the trusts
herein expressed, all the estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and
trusts of such predecessor Owner Trustee, and such predecessor Owner
Trustee shall duly assign, transfer, deliver and pay over to successor
Owner Trustee all moneys or other property then held by such predecessor
Owner Trustee upon the trusts herein expressed.

Any successor Owner Trustee, however appointed, shall be a
bank or trust company incorporated and doing business within the United
States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$100,000,000, if there be such an institution willing, able and legally
qualified to perform the duties of Owner Trustee hereunder upon reasonable
or customary terms.

Any corporation into which the Owner Trustee may be merged
or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Owner
Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the
corporate trust business of the Owner Trustee may be transferred, shall,
subject to the terms of Section 9.01(c), be the Owner Trustee under this
Trust Agreement without further act.

SECTION 9.02. Co-Trustees and Separate Trustees. Whenever the
Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant shall deem it necessary or prudent
in order to conform to any law of any jurisdiction in which all or any part
of the Trust Estate shall be situated or to make any claim or bring any
suit with respect to the Trust Estate, the Notes or any Transaction
Document or the Declaration, or the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant
shall be advised by counsel satisfactory to it that it is so necessary or
prudent, the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant shall execute and
deliver an agreement supplemental hereto and all other instruments and
agreements, and shall take all other action, necessary or proper to
constitute one or more Persons, who need not meet the requirements of
Section 9.01(c) (and the Owner Trustee may appoint one or more of its
officers), either as co-trustee or co-trustees jointly with the Owner
Trustee of all or any part of the Trust Estate, or as separate trustee or
separate trustees of all or any part of the Trust Estate, and to vest in
such Persons, in such capacity, such title to the Trust Estate or any part
thereof and such rights or duties as may be necessary or desirable, all for
such period and under such terms and conditions as are satisfactory to the
Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant. In case any co-trustee or
separate trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be
removed, the title to the Trust Estate and all rights and duties of such co-
trustee or separate trustee shall, so far as permitted by law, vest in and
be exercised by the Owner Trustee, without the appointment of a successor
to such co-trustee or separate trustee.

SECTION 9.03. Notice. At all times that a successor Owner
Trustee is appointed pursuant to Section 9.01, an Owner Trustee resigns
pursuant to Section 9.01 or a co-trustee or separate trustee is appointed
pursuant to Section 9.02, the Owner Participant shall give notice of such
fact within 30 days of its occurrence to (y) the Lessee, if the Lease is
then in effect and (z) the Indenture Trustee, if the Indenture has not been
discharged.

SUPPLEMENTS AND AMENDMENTS

Participation Agreement, at the written request of the Owner Participant,

State Street and the Owner Participant, but if in the opinion of State
Street any instrument required to be so executed adversely affects any
right, duty or liability of, or immunity or indemnity in favor of, it or
the Owner Trustee under this Trust Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents to which it or the Owner Trustee is a party, or would cause or
result in any conflict with or breach of any terms, conditions or
provisions of, or default under, its charter documents or by-laws or any
document contemplated hereby to which it or the Owner Trustee is a party,
State Street may in its sole discretion decline to execute such instrument,
unless it shall have been provided an indemnity satisfactory to it by the
Owner Participant.

SECTION 10.02. Limitation on Amendments. Notwithstanding
Section 10.01, State Street shall not, without the consent of the Indenture
Trustee, execute any amendment that might result in the trusts created

interest on the Notes.

such transfer date. No such assignment, conveyance or transfer shall
violate any provision of Applicable Law or create a relationship which

thereof, shall control.

declares that it will hold the Remainderman Trust Estate in trust upon and

would a trustor of a common law express trust under Delaware law with terms
and conditions similar to those of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, Article V and Section 7.01 hereof, and therefore that for
purposes of determining the personal liability of the Remainderman

treated as a stockholder of a private corporation for profit within meaning
of Section 3803 of the Business Trust Statute. No later than the Business

of the Remainderman Trust Estate shall be deemed to be vested in the
Remainderman Trustee or any co-trustee or separate trustee, as the case may

and in the performance of its duties and obligations under any of the
Related Remainderman Agreements, the Remainderman Trustee (i) may act
directly or, at the expense of the Trust, through agents or attorneys

appointment by a successor remainderman trustee under Section 8.01(b)
below. In addition, the Remainderman Participant may at any time remove
the Remainderman Trustee without cause by an instrument in writing
delivered to the Remainderman Trustee, such removal to be effective upon

of any successor to the Remainderman Trustee, the Remainderman Participant
will consult with the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee and consider
in good faith their suggestions, (ii) any such successor shall be qualified
to be the trustee of a Delaware business trust under the Business Trust
Statute and (iii) at all times there shall be at least one trustee which
satisfies the requirements of Section 3807 of the Business Trust Statute.
If a successor remainderman trustee shall not have been appointed within 30
days after the giving of written notice of such resignation or the delivery
of the written instrument with respect to such removal, the Remainderman
Trustee or the Remainderman Participant may apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint a successor remainderman trustee to act until such
time, if any, as a successor remainderman trustee shall have been appointed
as provided above. Any successor remainderman trustee so appointed by such
court shall immediately and without further act be superseded by any
successor remainderman trustee appointed as above provided within one year
from the date of the appointment by such court.
(b) Any successor remainderman trustee, however appointed,
shall execute and deliver to the Remainderman Participant and the
predecessor Remainderman Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment,
and thereupon such successor remainderman trustee, without further act,
shall become vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers,
duties and trust of the predecessor Remainderman Trustee in the trusts
hereunder with like effect as if originally named the Remainderman Trustee
herein; but nevertheless, upon the written request of such successor
remainderman trustee, such predecessor Remainderman Trustee shall execute
and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor remainderman
trustee, upon the trusts herein expressed, all the estates, properties,
rights, powers, duties and trusts of such predecessor Remainderman Trustee,
and such Predecessor Remainderman trustee shall duly assign, transfer,
deliver and pay over to such successor remainderman trustee all moneys or
other property then held or subsequently received by such predecessor
Remainderman Trustee upon the trusts herein expressed.
(c) Any successor remainderman trustee, however appointed,
shall be a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning of Section
101(16) of the Securities Act and shall also be a bank or trust company
incorporated and doing business within the United States of America and
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, if there by
such an institution willing, able and legally qualified to perform the
duties of the Remainderman Trustee hereunder upon reasonable or customary
terms.
(d) Any corporation into which the Remainderman Trustee may be
merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which
the Remainderman Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation to which
substantially all the corporate trust business of the Remainderman Trustee
may be transferred, shall, subject to the terms of Section 8.01(c), be the
Remainderman Trustee under this Agreement without further act.
(e) Upon the happening of any of the events described in this
Section 8.01, the successor remainderman trustee shall cause an amendment
to the Certificate of Trust to be filed with the Secretary of State, in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3810 of the Business Trust
Statute, indicating the change with respect to the Remainderman Trustee's
identity.
8.02 Co-Trustees and Separate Trustees. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, neither Wilmington nor the
Remainderman Trustee shall be required to take any action in any
jurisdiction other than in the State of Delaware if the taking of such
action will (i) require the consent or approval or authorization or order
of or the giving of notice to, or the registration with or taking of any
action in respect of, any state or other Governmental Authority or agency
of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware; (ii) result in any
fee, tax or other governmental charge under the laws of any jurisdiction or
any political subdivisions thereof in existence on the date hereof other
than the State of Delaware becoming payable by Wilmington; or (iii) subject
Wilmington to personal jurisdiction in any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware for causes of action arising from acts unrelated to the
consummation of the transactions by Wilmington or the Remainderman Trustee,
as the case may be, contemplated hereby. In addition, as a condition
precedent to the foreclosure or other acquisition of title to any
Remainderman Interest pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, the
Remainderman Trustee shall be entitled to obtain advice of counsel (which
advice will be an expense to the Remainderman Participant) to determine
whether such foreclosure results in the consequences described in clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence. In the event that such
counsel advises the Remainderman Trustee that such foreclosure or other
acquisition of title will result in such consequences, the Remainderman
Trustee will appoint an additional trustee pursuant to this Section 8.02 to
proceed with such foreclosure or acquisition.
Whenever the Remainderman Trustee or the Remainderman
Participant, pursuant to this Section 8.02 or otherwise, shall deem it
necessary or prudent in order to conform to any law of any jurisdiction in
which all or any part of the Remainderman Trust Estate shall be situated or
to make any claim or bring any suit with respect to the Remainderman Trust
Estate, or any Transaction Document, or the Remainderman Trustee or the
Remainderman Participant shall be advised by counsel satisfactory to it
that it is so necessary or prudent, the Remainderman Trustee and the
Remainderman Participant shall execute and deliver an agreement
supplemental hereto and all other instruments and agreements, and shall
take all other action, necessary or proper to constitute one or more
Persons who need not meet the requirements of Section 9.01(c) (and the
Remainderman Trustee may appoint one or more of its officers) either as co-
trustee or co-trustees jointly with the Remainderman Trustee of all or any
part of the Remainderman Trust Estate, or as separate trustee or separate
trustees of all or any part of the Remainderman Trust Estate, and to vest
in such Persons, in such capacity, such title to the Remainderman Trust
Estate or any part thereof and such rights or duties as may be necessary or
desirable, all for such period and under such terms and conditions as are
satisfactory to the Remainderman Trustee and the Remainderman Participant.
In case any co-trustee or separate trustee shall die, become incapable of
acting, resign or be removed, the title to any part of the Remainderman
Trust Estate vested in such co-trustee or separate trustee shall vest in
the Trust and all rights and duties of such co-trustee or separate trustee
shall vest in the Trust and all rights and duties of such co-trustee or
separate trustee shall, so far as permitted by law, be exercised by the
remaining Remainderman Trustee, without appointment of a successor to the
Remainderman Trustee or such co-trustee or separate trustee.
ARTICLE IX
MISCELLANEOUS
9.01. Supplements and Amendments. This Agreement may be amended
only by a written instrument signed by the Remainderman Trustee and the
Remainderman Participant at the time of such amendment; provided, however,
that if, in the opinion of the Remainderman Trustee, any instrument
required to be so executed adversely affects any right, duty or liability
of, or immunity or indemnity in favor of, the Remainderman Trustee under
this Agreement or any of the documents contemplated hereby to which the
Remainderman Trustee is a party, or would cause or result in any conflict
with or breach of any terms, conditions or provisions of, or default under,
the charter documents or by-laws of the Remainderman Trustee or any
documents contemplated hereby to which the Remainderman Trustee is a party,
the Remainderman Trustee may in its sole discretion decline to execute such
instrument. Notwithstanding the first sentence hereof, Wilmington shall
not, without the consent of the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee
and the Owner Trustee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
execute any amendment that might result in the trusts created hereunder
being terminated prior to the termination of the Ground Lease.
9.02. No Legal Title to Remainderman Trust Estate in the
Remainderman Participant. The Remainderman Participant shall not have
legal title to any part of the Remainderman Trust Estate and shall only
have an undivided beneficial interest therein. No transfer, by operation
of law or otherwise, of any right, title and interest of the Remainderman
Participant in and to its undivided beneficial interest in the Remainderman
Trust Estate hereunder shall operate to terminate this Agreement or the

the Owner Trustee may not, without the prior written consent of the
Indenture Trustee given with the consent of a Majority in Interest of

shall (apart from Excepted Payments) be received by the Owner Trustee, for
the benefit of, and immediately paid over to, the Indenture Trustee.

(cc) Subject to subparagraph (aa) above, but otherwise
without the consent of any of the Noteholders, at any time and from time to
time, the respective parties to the Transaction Documents may modify, amend
or supplement any of such Transaction Documents (other than this First
Supplemental Indenture or the Original Indenture) for the purpose of adding
any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the
provisions thereof or modifying in any manner the rights of the respective
parties thereunder or may give any consent or waiver thereunder; provided,
however, that no such modification, amendment, supplement, consent or
waiver shall without the consent of each Noteholder affected thereby,
modify, amend or supplement, or give any consent in respect of or waive any
provision of, Lease B in such manner (i) as to reduce the amounts payable
by the Lessee under Lease B assigned to the Indenture Trustee, or change
the time for the payment thereof, so that such payments are less than the
amounts necessary to pay the principal of, Premium, if any, and interest on
the Outstanding J-2 Notes when due (whether at maturity, upon acceleration
or otherwise) or (ii) as would release the Lessee from its obligation in
respect of payment of Basic Rent, Casualty Value, Termination Value or any
other amount payable under Lease B and intended to be used to pay the
principal of, Premium, if any, or interest on the J-2 Notes, in any manner
inconsistent with clause (i) above.

To the extent any portion of the Indenture Estate [Series B]
constitutes personal property under Applicable Law, the Owner Trustee
hereby grants to the Indenture Trustee a security interest in such property
and the proceeds thereof and the Indenture Trustee shall have, in addition
to all rights and remedies provided herein and in the Original Indenture,
all rights and remedies of a "secured party" under the Uniform Commercial

First Supplemental Indenture, in addition to constituting a security
agreement covering any personal property that is part of the Indenture
Estate [Series B], constitutes (i) a deed of trust, and an absolute
assignment of rents with respect to all estates in land, fixtures,
leaseholds, easements or other interests in real property that are part of
the Indenture Estate [Series B] and the rents, issues and profits thereof
and (ii) a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under Section

subject to such other terms not inconsistent with the terms of this First
Supplemental Indenture as are set forth in the Original Indenture.

SECTION 1.13 No Other Notes. So long as any Series J Notes are
outstanding, no other series of Notes may be issued and Outstanding, except
as contemplated by Sections 6.7 and 7.2 of the Original Indenture.

SECTION 1.14 Auxiliary Payments.

(a) Increased Costs. If due to either (i) the introduction of
or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of
reserve requirements included in the Reserve Percentage referred to in
Section 1.14(b) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or
(ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law),
there shall be any increase in the cost (other than with respect to income,
franchise or withholding taxes or other taxes of a similar nature) to any
Noteholder of a J-2 Note of agreeing to make or making, funding or
maintaining the loan to the Owner Trustee, then (x) such Noteholder of a J-
2 shall, as soon as such Noteholder of a J-2 Note becomes aware of such
increased cost, but in any event not later than sixty (60) days after such
increased cost was incurred for which such Noteholder intends to seek
reimbursement, deliver to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the
Lessee a certificate as described below in paragraph (f) stating the actual
amount of such increased cost incurred by such Noteholder of a J-2 Note and
(y) the Owner Trustee shall, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of
such certificate pay to the Noteholder of a J-2 Note amounts sufficient to
compensate such Noteholder of a J-2 Note for the increased cost incurred by
it as set forth in the certificate referred to above. In determining the
amount set forth in such certificate such Noteholder of a J-2 Note may use
reasonable averaging and attribution methods. If the Owner Trustee so
notifies the Noteholder of a J-2 Note within five Business Days after
receipt of any certificate delivered to the Owner Trustee pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 1.14(a), the Owner Trustee may prepay in full
all the Notes then outstanding held by such Noteholder of a J-2 Note, plus
Premium, if any, and, additionally, reimburse such Noteholder of a J-2 Note
for such increased cost in accordance with this Section 1.14(a).

(b) Reserve Requirement Amount. If any Noteholder of a J-2 Note
shall be required under Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, as in effect from time to time ("Regulation D"), to
maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or
including Eurocurrency liabilities, as defined in Regulation D, then such
Noteholder of a J-2 Note shall within 60 days after the end of any
applicable interest period during which such Noteholder of a J-2 Note was
required to maintain such reserves give notice to the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee and the Lessee, together with a certificate as described
below in paragraph (c) stating that such Noteholder of a J-2 Note was
required to maintain reserves and as a result incurred additional costs in
connection with making the loan to the Owner Trustee represented by its J-2
Note and that it is such Noteholder of a J-2 Note's customary practice,
from and after the date of this Indenture, to charge its borrowers for
reserves so maintained by it, and, promptly following receipt of such
certificate, the Owner Trustee shall pay to such Noteholder of a J-2 Note
additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each such loan,
represented by a J-2 Note, payable on the same day or days on which
interest is payable on such loan represented by a J-2 Note, at an interest
rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such loan
to the excess of (i) the rate obtained by dividing the LIBOR for such
applicable interest period by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Reserve
Percentage (defined in the next sentence), if any, applicable during such
applicable interest period over (ii) the LIBOR for such applicable interest
period. The "Reserve Percentage" for any such period, with respect to any
loan, means the reserve percentage applicable thereto under Regulation D
for determining the maximum reserve requirement incurred by such Noteholder
of a J-2 Note (including, but not limited to, any emergency, supplemental
or other marginal reserve requirement) with respect to liabilities or
assets consisting of or including eurocurrency liabilities, as defined in
Regulation D, and having a term equal to such period. The provisions of
this Section 1.14(b) shall not be applicable to any Noteholder of a J-2
Note during any period when the provisions of Section 1.14 are applicable.

(c) Capital Adequacy. If the Initial Noteholder shall, at any
time, reasonably determine that (each of the following conditions being
herein referred to as a "Rate of Return Condition") (i) the adoption (x) at
any time, of any other applicable law, government rule, regulation or order
regarding capital adequacy of banks or bank holding companies, (ii) any
change in (x) any of the foregoing or (y) the interpretation or
administration of any of the foregoing by any Governmental Authority,
central bank or comparable agency or (iii) compliance with any policy,
guideline, directive or request regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law and whether or not failure to comply therewith
would be unlawful) of any Governmental Authority, central bank or
comparable agency, would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
the capital of such Noteholder, to a level below that which such Noteholder
could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking
into consideration the policies of such Noteholder with respect to capital
adequacy in effect immediately before such adoption, change or compliance)
and (A) such reduction is as a consequence of the making of a loan
(represented by a Series J-2 Note) to the Owner Trustee hereunder by the
Initial Noteholder, (B) such reduction is reasonably deemed by the Initial
Noteholder to be material, and (C) the Initial Noteholder desires the Owner
Trustee to compensate such Noteholder therefor as provided in this Section
1.14(c), then the Initial Noteholder shall deliver to the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee and the Lessee a certificate as described in
paragraph (d) below stating the reduction in the rate of return the Initial
Noteholder will in the future suffer as a result of its loan hereunder and
the Owner Trustee shall, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of such
certificate pay the Initial Noteholder such amounts as shall be sufficient
to compensate the Initial Noteholder for such reduced return until such
time and thereafter from time to time on the same day on which interest is
payable on the Series J-2 Notes held by it. In determining the amount set
forth in such certificate, the Initial Noteholder may use reasonable
averaging and attribution methods. After receipt by the Owner Trustee of
any certificate delivered pursuant to the provisions of this Section
1.14(c), the Owner Trustee may, upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior
written notice to the Indenture Trustee and the Initial Noteholder, prepay
in full all the Series J-2 Notes then outstanding held by the Initial
Noteholder, together with Premium, if any, accrued interest and any other
amounts then due and owing to the Initial Noteholder under the Transaction
Documents.

(d) A certificate as to the amount of any such increased cost,
increased interest or reduced return under Section 1.14(a); (b) or (c),
submitted to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Lessee, by
such Noteholder of a J-2 Note, shall describe the nature of such increased
cost, increased interest, or reduced return and set forth in reasonable
detail the computations thereof.

(e) Transfer. If the Initial Noteholder shall assign its
interest in the Series J-2 Notes in accordance with Section 2.8 of the
Participation Agreement, any obligation to make auxiliary payments under
Section 1.14(a), (b) or (c) to any such permitted assignee shall not exceed
the corresponding obligations that the Owner Trustee would have had to the
Initial Noteholder if no such assignment had occurred. This Section 1.14
shall under no circumstances apply to any participant in the Initial
Noteholder's interests in the Series J-2 Notes.

SECTION 1.15 Series of Notes. Subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the requirements of Section 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7 of the Participation
Agreement or Section 8(f) of the Related Lease, as the case may be, the
Owner Trustee shall have the right from time to time to issue Notes to
provide (a) sufficient funds to redeem the principal amount of Related
Series J Notes of any series or subseries theretofore authenticated and
delivered hereunder, (b) sufficient funds to refinance any Outstanding
Series J Notes or (c) all or a portion of the amount necessary to finance
any Modification. The terms, conditions, designations and maximum aggregate
principal amount of each series of such Notes (to the extent not
inconsistent with this First Supplemental Indenture) shall be set forth, in
the case of clause (c), in an amendment to this First Supplemental
Indenture executed by the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee; provided
that the Installment Payment Dates or the Series J Interest Payment Dates
and the Record Dates for all Notes shall not differ. The Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver all Notes subject to the conditions of
Section 2.13 of the Original Indenture.

SECTION 1.16 Equally and Ratably Secured Notes. All Series J-2
Notes shall be equally and ratably secured by the Indenture, this First
Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture Estate [Series B], without
preference, priority or distinction on account of the date or dates or the
actual time or times of the issue or Stated Maturity of such Series J-2
Notes, so that all Outstanding Series J-2 Notes shall have the same right,
lien and preference under and by virtue of the Indenture, this First
Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture Estate [Series B].

SECTION 1.17 Indenture Estate. Neither the Owner Participant
nor the Initial Noteholder shall have legal title to any part of the
Indenture Estate [Series B]. No transfer, by operation of law or
otherwise, of any Series J-2 Note or other right, title or interest of the
Owner Participant or of the Initial Noteholder in and to the Indenture
Estate [Series B] or hereunder shall operate to terminate this Indenture or
the trusts hereunder or entitle any successor or transferee of the Owner
Participant or of the Initial Noteholder to any accounting or to the
transfer to it of legal title to any part of the Indenture Estate [Series
B], other than as set forth in the Indenture and this First Supplemental
Indenture, and such restriction shall run with the land and survive any
termination of this and this First Supplemental Indenture in violation
thereof.

SECTION 1.18 Assignment of Rents. The Owner Trustee irrevocably
and absolutely grants, transfers and assigns to the Indenture Trustee, for
so long as any of the Series J-2 Notes remain outstanding, all of the Owner
Trustee's right, title and interest in and to the Rent under Lease B.
Nothing contained in this First Supplemental Indenture, nor the exercise of
the right by the Indenture Trustee to collect the Rent under Lease B, shall
be deemed to make the Indenture Trustee a "mortgagee in possession" or
shall be, or be construed to be, an affirmation by the Indenture Trustee
of, or an assumption of liability by the Indenture Trustee under, or a
subordination of the lien of this First Supplemental Indenture to, any
tenancy, lease or option.

SECTION 1.19 Default; Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any
Indenture Event of Default, but subject to the terms of the Original
Indenture, including, but not limited to, Sections 8.2, 8.3, 8.10 and 8.15
of the Original Indenture: (a) the Owner Trustee shall be in default under
this First Supplemental Indenture, and upon acceleration of the maturity of
any Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Series J-2
Notes and the Original Indenture, all Secured Obligations shall immediately
become due and payable without further notice to the Owner Trustee and (b)
the Indenture Trustee may, without notice to or demand upon the Owner
Trustee, which are expressly waived by the Owner Trustee (except for
notices or demands otherwise required by Applicable Law to the extent not
effectively waived by the Owner Trustee and any notices or demands
specified below), and without releasing the Owner Trustee from any of the
Secured Obligations, exercise any one or more of the following remedies as
the Indenture Trustee may determine:

(i) The Indenture Trustee may, either directly or through an
agent or court-appointed receiver, and without regard to the
adequacy of any security for the Secured Obligations, but subject
to Section 8.3(a) and 8.10 of the Original Indenture, exercise
any or all of the rights and powers and pursue any or all of the
remedies under the Lease affecting Property B (including Section
16 thereof) and, in connection therewith, corresponding remedies
under this Section 1.19, and may take possession of all or part
of the Indenture Estate [Series B] and may exclude the Owner
Trustee and the Lessee and, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, all Persons claiming under either of them wholly or partly
therefrom.

(ii) The Indenture Trustee may execute and deliver to
Trustee written declaration of default and demand for sale and
written notice of default and of election to cause all or any
part of the Indenture Estate [Series B] to be sold, which notice
Trustee shall cause to be filed for record; and after the lapse
of such time as may then be required by law following the
recordation of such notice of default, and notice of sale having
been given as then required by law, Trustee, without demand on
the Owner Trustee, shall sell such property at the time and place
fixed by it in such notice of sale, either as a whole or in
separate parcels and in such order as the Indenture Trustee may
direct (the Owner Trustee waiving any right to direct the order
of sale), at public auction to the highest bidder for cash in
lawful money of the United States (or cash equivalents acceptable
to Trustee to the extent permitted by applicable law), payable at
the time of sale. Trustee may postpone the sale of all or any
part of the Indenture Estate [Series B] by public announcement at
such time and place of sale, and from time to time after any such
postponement may postpone such sale by public announcement at the
time fixed by the preceding postponement. Trustee shall deliver
to the purchaser at such sale its deed conveying the property so
sold, but without any covenant or warranty, express or implied,
and the recitals in such deed of any matters or facts shall be
conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof. Any person,
including Trustee or the Indenture Trustee, may purchase at such
sale, and any bid by the Indenture Trustee may be, in whole or in
part, in the form of cancellation of all or any part of the
Secured Obligations. Any such sale shall be free and clear of
any interest of the Owner Trustee and any lease, encumbrance or
other matter affecting the property so sold which is subject or
subordinate to this First Supplemental Indenture, except that any
such sale shall not result in the termination of any such lease
(A) if and to the extent otherwise provided in any estoppel or
other agreement executed by the tenant and the Indenture Trustee
(or executed by the tenant in favor of, and accepted by, the
Indenture Trustee), or (B) if the purchaser at such sale gives
written notice to the tenant, within 30 days after date of sale,
that the lease will continue in effect.

(iii) With respect to any personal property secured hereby,
the Indenture Trustee shall have in any jurisdiction where
enforcement of this First Supplemental Indenture is sought all
remedies of a secured party under the UCC and may require the
Owner Trustee, on demand, to assemble all personal property
secured hereby and make it available to the Indenture Trustee at
places that the Indenture Trustee may select that are reasonably
convenient for both parties, whether at the premises of the Owner
Trustee or elsewhere.

(iv) The Indenture Trustee may proceed to protect, exercise
and enforce any and all other remedies provided under the Series
J-2 Notes, the Original Indenture or by applicable laws.

Each of the remedies provided in this First Supplemental
Indenture is cumulative and not exclusive of, and shall not prejudice, any
other remedy provided in this First Supplemental Indenture or by applicable
laws or under any other Transaction Document. Each remedy may be exercised
from time to time as often as deemed necessary by Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee, and in such order and manner as the Indenture Trustee may
determine. This First Supplemental Indenture is independent of any other
security for the Secured Obligations, and upon the occurrence of an
Indenture Event of Default, Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may proceed in
the enforcement of this First Supplemental Indenture independently of any
other remedy that Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may at any time hold
with respect to the Indenture Estate [Series B] or the Secured Obligations
or any other security. The Owner Trustee, for itself and for any other
person claiming by or through the Owner Trustee, waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable laws, all rights to require a marshalling of
assets by Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or to require Trustee or the
Indenture Trustee to first resort to any particular portion of the
Indenture Estate [Series B] or any other security (whether such portion
shall have been retained or conveyed by the Owner Trustee) before resorting
to any other portion, and all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal.

Anything to the contrary provided in this First Supplemental
Indenture or the Original Indenture notwithstanding, the Indenture Trustee
shall not exercise any remedy hereunder other than the commencement of an
action for judicial foreclosure of the lien of this First Supplemental
Indenture unless the Indenture Trustee shall either (i) simultaneously and
in conjunction with the exercise of such remedy, commence and pursue an
action for judicial foreclosure of the lien of this First Supplemental
Indenture or (ii) deliver to the Owner Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in
form and from counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Trustee that the
exercise of such remedy in the absence of a concurrent action for judicial
foreclosure will not impair the exercise of any rights or remedies reserved
to the Owner Trustee pursuant to clause (bb) of the Granting Clauses of
this First Supplemental Indenture or Section 8.15 of the Original
Indenture.

Section 1.20 Costs, Fees and Expenses. The Owner Trustee shall
pay, on demand, all costs, fees, expenses, advances, charges, losses and
liabilities of Trustee and the Indenture Trustee under or in connection
with this First Supplemental Indenture or the enforcement of, or the
exercise of any remedy or any other action taken by Trustee or the
Indenture Trustee under, this First Supplemental Indenture or the
collection of the Secured Obligations, in each case including (a)
reconveyance and foreclosure fees of Trustee, (b) costs and expenses of the
Indenture Trustee or Trustee or any receiver appointed under this First
Supplemental Indenture in connection with the operation, maintenance,
management, protection, preservation, collection, sale or other liquidation
of the Indenture Estate [Series B] or foreclosure of this First
Supplemental Indenture, (c) advances made by the Indenture Trustee to
complete or partially construct all or any part of any construction which
may have commenced on the Indenture Estate [Series B] or otherwise to
protect the security of this First Supplemental Indenture, (d) cost of
evidence of title, and (e) the reasonable fees and disbursements of
Trustee's and the Indenture Trustee's legal counsel and other
out-of-pocket expenses, and the reasonable charges of the Indenture
Trustee's internal legal counsel; together with interest on all such
amounts until paid (i) at the Overdue Interest Rate in the case of any such
interest payable to the Indenture Trustee, and (ii) at the rate provided by
law in the case of any such interest payable to Trustee.

Section 1.21 Substitution of Trustee. The Indenture
Trustee may from time to time, by instrument in writing, substitute a
successor or successors to any Trustee named in or acting under this First
Supplemental Indenture, which instrument, when executed by the Indenture
Trustee and duly acknowledged and recorded in the office of the recorder of
the county or counties where the real property secured hereby is situated,
shall be conclusive proof of proper substitution of such successor Trustee
or Trustees who shall, without conveyance from the predecessor Trustee,
succeed to all of its title, estate, rights, powers and duties. Such
instrument must contain the name of the original Owner Trustee, Trustee and
the Indenture Trustee, the book and page where this First Supplemental
Indenture is recorded (or the date of recording and instrument number) and
the name and address of the new Trustee.

SECTION 1.22 Certain Remedies. If, and only if, a Trigger Event
shall have occurred, Section 8.3(a) of the Original Indenture shall be
deemed to be amended such that the following language shall be inserted
after the last word of the last sentence of such Section 8.3(a):

provided, that the Indenture Trustee has taken or is
concurrently taking action under the Related Lease to
dispossess the Lessee, to terminate the Related Lease or to
effect a comparable remedy unless the Indenture Trustee is
stayed or otherwise prevented by Applicable Law from
exercising such remedies under the Related Lease and either
(i) two hundred seventy (270) days shall have elapsed since
the commencement of such stay or imposition of such
prohibition or (ii) the Lessee has rejected the Related
Lease under the Bankruptcy Code.

Such amendment shall only be deemed to be effective from and after the
occurrence of a Trigger Event until such time as the Series J-2 Notes shall
no longer be Outstanding and this First Supplemental Indenture shall have
been superseded by a subsequent Supplemental Indenture.

received by the Indenture Trustee therefrom to the extent available for
distribution to the Noteholder as provided in the Indenture and (b) neither
the Owner Participant nor, except as otherwise expressly provided in the
Indenture and the other Transaction Documents, the Owner Trustee, in its
individual capacity, is liable to the Noteholder for any amounts payable
under this J-2 Notes or the Indenture. Without in any way affecting the
limitations on liability set forth in Sections 1.13 and 2.12 of the
Original Indenture, Article II of the Participation Agreement and Section 4
and 21(i) of Lease B, the Indenture Trustee, and each Noteholder by
accepting this J-2 Note, hereby acknowledges and agrees that none of the
Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant, or any director, officer, employee,
stockholder, agent or Affiliate of the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant (the "Exculpated Persons") shall have any obligation, duty or
liability of any kind whatsoever to the Indenture Trustee or any such
Noteholder in connection with the exercise by any Exculpated Person of any
rights of the Owner Trustee under Section 8 of Lease B, or the taking of
any action or the failure to take any action by any Exculpated Person in
connection with any rights of the Owner Trustee under Section 8 of the
respective Leases, and the Indenture Trustee and each such Noteholder
hereby waives and releases, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each
Exculpated Person of any and all such obligations, duties or liabilities.

The interest or Installment Payment Amount (other than that
payable on the Stated Maturity hereof) so payable, and punctually paid or
duly provided for, on the applicable Series J Interest Payment Date or
Installment Payment Date, as the case may be, will, as provided in the
Indenture, shall be paid to the Person in whose name this J-2 Note is
registered at the close of business on the Record Date for payment of such
interest or Installment Payment Amount, which shall be the fifteenth day
(whether or not a Business Day) next preceding such Series J Interest
Payment Date or Installment Payment Date, as the case may be. Any such
interest or Installment Payment Amount not so punctually paid or duly
provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered
Noteholder on such Record Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name
this J-2 Notes is registered at the close of business on a subsequent
Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest or Defaulted
Installment to be fixed by the Indenture Trustee (which date shall be not
less than 10 Business Days prior to the payment of such Defaulted Interest
or Defaulted Installment), notice of which shall be given to Noteholders
entitled thereto not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent Record
Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not
inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the
J-2 Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such
exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.

The principal of, Premium, if any, and interest on this J-2 Note shall
be payable in immediately available funds at the principal corporate trust
office of the Indenture Trustee or at any office or agency maintained for
such purpose pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Original Indenture, or as
otherwise directed in the manner provided in the Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision herein to the contrary, the
Indenture Trustee will pay, or cause to be paid, if so requested by any
Holder of this J-2 Note by written notice to the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee, all amounts payable by the Owner Trustee hereunder to
such Holder of this J-2 Notes or a nominee therefor either (i) by
transferring by wire in immediately available funds to an account
maintained by such Holder with a bank in the United States the amount to be
distributed to such Holder or (ii) by mailing a check denominated in U.S.
dollars to such Holder at such address as such Holder of this J-2 Note
shall have specified in such notice, in any case without any presentment or
surrender of this J-2 Note except that the Holder shall surrender this J-2
Note to the Indenture Trustee upon payment in full of the principal amount
of and interest on this J-2 Note and such other sums as may then be payable
to such Holder under the Indenture or under this J-2 Note.

Capitalized terms used in this J-2 Note which are not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Appendix A to
the Indenture. Reference is made to the Indenture and all supplements and
amendments thereto (a copy of which is on file with the Indenture Trustee
at its principal corporate trust office) for a more complete statement of
the terms and provisions thereof, including a statement of the properties
thereby conveyed, pledged, mortgaged and assigned, the nature and extent of
the security, the respective rights thereunder of the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders and the terms upon which the J-2
Notes are, and are to be, executed and delivered, as well as a statement of
the terms and conditions of the trust created by the Indenture, to all of
which terms and conditions in the Indenture each Holder agrees by its
acceptance of this J-2 Note.

As more fully provided in the Indenture, the J-2 Notes are
subject to redemption under the circumstances set forth in Article 6 of the
Indenture and under the circumstances set forth in Article 7 of the
Indenture.

If an Indenture Event of Default shall occur and be continuing,
the principal amount remaining unpaid and any interest accrued hereon of
the J-2 Notes may, subject to certain rights of the Owner Trustee or the
Owner Participant (or both) contained or referred to in the Indenture, be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture. If, and only if, such an Indenture Event of Default constitutes
an Event of Default under Lease B by the Lessee, subject to the provisions
of the Indenture, including certain specified limitations, the Indenture
Trustee may declare Lease B to be in default, and may exercise one or more
of the remedies of the Owner Trustee provided in Lease B. Such remedies
include the right to terminate Lease B and repossess and use or relet the
Lessor Interest originally leased under Lease B, to sell such Lessor
Interest or any part thereof free and clear of the Lessee's rights and
retain the proceeds and, so long as the Owner Trustee has not sold such
Lessor Interest, to require the Lessee to pay as liquidated damages for
loss of bargain and not as a penalty (in lieu of Basic Rent due after the
payment date) and, in the case of a payment under clause (d) below, as
consideration for the Owner Trustee's obligation to transfer such Lessor
Interest to the Lessee and to surrender certain unpaid Rent under Lease B.

The Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant may cure any default
by the Lessee under Lease B arising from the failure of the Lessee to make
any payment of Basic Rent under Lease B, provided that such failure of the
Lessee is not the third consecutive such failure, or the sixth cumulative
such failure. In the event of any default by the Lessee of any obligation
under Lease B (other than the obligation to pay Basic Rent), the Owner.
Trustee or the Owner Participant may (but are not obligated to, to the
extent not prohibited by Applicable Law), make any payment or perform or
comply with any such agreement as the Lessee shall be obligated to pay,
perform or comply with under Lease B.

The right of the Holder of this J-2 Note to institute action for
any remedy under the Indenture, including the enforcement of payment of any
amount due hereon, is subject to certain restrictions specified in the
Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of
the entire principal of all the Notes of any or all series (including the
Series J-2 Notes) upon compliance by the Owner Trustee with certain
conditions set forth therein.

Following an Indenture Event of Default, the Owner Trustee may,
subject to the conditions specified in the Indenture, purchase all of the
Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Each Noteholder, by
accepting this J-2 Note, agrees, subject to the provisions of the
Indenture, that, upon payment to the Indenture Trustee of the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, without Premium or
penalty, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon to the date of
such payment (as well as any interest on overdue principal and, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, overdue interest) and any other amounts
due and payable to the Noteholders, and upon satisfaction of all of the
conditions contained in the Indenture pertaining to the purchase of the
Notes by the Owner Trustee, such Holder shall be deemed to have sold this J-
2 Note to the Owner Trustee or its designee.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, this J-2 Note is transferable on the Note Register, upon
surrender of this J-2 Note for registration of transfer at the office or
agency of the Note Registrar to be maintained for that purpose in the
Wilmington, Delaware or at any other office or agency of the Note Registrar
maintained for that purpose, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Note Registrar duly
executed by the Noteholder or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and
thereupon one or more new J-2 Notes of the same series with the same
interest rate and Stated Maturity as the J-2 Notes so to be transferred; of
authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will
be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

The J-2 Notes are issuable only in registered form in
denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof except that one J-2
Notes of each maturity may be in a denomination other than an integral
multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the J-2 Notes are exchangeable at the office
or agency of the Note Registrar maintained for that purpose for an equal
aggregate principal amount of J-2 Notes of the same series with the same
interest rate and Stated Maturity and of a different authorized
denomination or denominations, as requested by the J-2 Noteholder
surrendering the same.

No service charge will be made to any Noteholder for any such
transfer or exchange, but the Note Registrar may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in
connection therewith.

Prior to due presentation of this Note for registration or
transfer, the Person in whose name this J-2 Note is registered shall be
deemed to be the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment
as herein provided and for all other purposes whether or not this J-2 Note
shall be overdue, regardless of any notice to anyone to the contrary.

THE J-2 NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE CHOICE OF
LAW DOCTRINE OF SUCH STATE.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Owner Trustee has caused this instrument
to be duly executed.

ARTICLE II

Guarantee

SECTION 2.01. Guarantee of Obligations under Transaction
Documents. The Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to
each of the Beneficiaries the due (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise), complete and punctual performance and
observance of all payment obligations of PMCC under the Transaction
Documents to which it is or becomes a party (the "OP Transaction

be impaired, affected or in any way conditioned or contingent upon (a) the
making of demand, the institution of suit or the taking of any other action

any Beneficiary, (d) any attempt to collect from PMCC or any other entity
or to perfect or enforce any security or upon any other condition or
contingency or (e) upon any other action, occurrence or circumstance

out of, or by reason of or relating, in any way, to this Guaranty or the
interpretation, breach or enforcement thereof; (g) the right to interpose
any set-off or counterclaim of any nature or description in any action or
proceeding arising hereunder or with respect hereto; (h) any right or claim
of right to cause a marshalling of PMCC's assets or to cause any

transfer or other disposition of any right, title to or interest in any
Transaction Document or (m) other circumstances whatsoever which might

Guarantor. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part
of any Beneficiary, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the
exercise of any other power or right. The rights and remedies herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law.

all payments hereunder shall be made in United States dollars and shall be
paid without regard to or deduction for any set-off, counterclaim,
deduction or defense that the Guarantor may have or assert.

SECTION 2.08. Reinstatement. This Guaranty shall continue to be
effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, in
whole or in part, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise
be restored or returned by any Beneficiary upon the bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition, dissolution,
liquidation, or the like, of PMCC or the Guarantor, or as a result of, the
appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar
powers with respect to PMCC or the Guarantor or any substantial part of
such Person's respective property, or otherwise, all as though such payment
had not been made notwithstanding any termination of this Guaranty or any
Transaction Document.

ARTICLE III

No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies

SECTION 3.01. The failure or delay of any Beneficiary in
exercising any right or remedy granted it hereunder shall not operate as a
waiver of such right or remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any breach
of any of the terms and conditions hereof or to be an acquiescence therein.
Each and every right, power and remedy herein specifically given to each
Beneficiary shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other
right, power and remedy herein specifically given or now or hereafter
existing at law, in equity or by statute and the exercise or the beginning
of the exercise of any right, power or remedy shall not be construed as a
waiver of the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other
right, power or remedy. A waiver by a Beneficiary of any right or remedy
hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right
or remedy that such Beneficiary or any other Beneficiary would otherwise
have.

ARTICLE IV

Notices, etc.

SECTION 4.01. All notices, demands, declarations, consents,
directions, approvals, instructions, requests and other communications

successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Beneficiaries
and their respective successors and assigns. The Guarantor shall not assign
any of its obligations hereunder without the express prior consent of each
Beneficiary; provided, however, the Guarantor shall have the right to
assign such obligations without such consent provided such assignment
either occurs by operation of law or is to a Person who meets the
requirements of Section 8.1(b) of the Participation Agreement.

ARTICLE VI

Severability of this Guaranty

SECTION 6.01. Any provision of or obligation under this Guaranty
that is determined by competent authority to be prohibited and
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions or obligations hereof, and any such
prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Guarantor
hereby waives any provision of law that renders any provision or obligation
hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

ARTICLE VII

Termination

SECTION 7.01. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08 hereof,
this Guaranty and the Guarantor's duties and obligations hereunder shall
remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with its

(iii) when due, or when no due date is specified, within 15 days

Trustee, the Pass Through Trustee or any Indemnitee, under this
Lease or any other Transaction Document;

(iv) on demand and, in any event, not later than the Basic Rent
Payment Date next succeeding the date such amounts shall be due and
payable hereunder, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,

the case of payments other than Excepted Payments, to the Lessor at its
address determined in accordance with Section 17, or at such other address
as the Lessor may specify by notice in writing to the Lessee, or (ii) in
the case of Excepted Payments, to such Person as shall be entitled to
receive such payment at such address as such Person may specify by notice
to the Lessee. If the date on which any payment of Rent is due hereunder
is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made as aforesaid on the next
succeeding Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on the
nominal due date provided for in this Lease. Payments shall in all events
only be made within the continental United States.

(e) Adjustments to Rent. The percentages for Basic Rent, Casualty
Value and Termination Value set forth, respectively, in Schedule 1,
Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 have been calculated, in part, on the basis of
the Pricing Assumptions. If (i) the Notes are refunded or refinanced
pursuant to Section 2.5, Section 2.6 or Section 2.7 of the Participation
Agreement, (ii) the characterization of the portions of the Leased Property
by depreciation category as set forth in the Appraisal delivered pursuant
to Section 3.1(m) of the Participation Agreement is different from that
contained in the Pricing Assumptions, (iii) any of the Pricing Assumptions
with respect to the calendar date corresponding to the Closing Date, the
rate or rates of interest on, or amortization of, the Notes or the amount
of Transaction Expenses proves to have been incorrect or (iv) a Trigger
Event shall have occurred, then, and in each such case, such percentages
for Basic Rent, Casualty Value and Termination Value shall be adjusted
(upward or downward), so as to preserve the Owner Participant's Net
Economic Return (and, if in connection with a Trigger Event, in accordance
with Section 2.7(c) and Annex I of the Participation Agreement) and the
Pricing Assumptions shall be revised accordingly. Any adjustments pursuant
to this Section 3(e) shall (A) to the extent possible and not inconsistent
with the foregoing, minimize the present value cost of the Basic Rent to
the Lessee (subject to the requirements of Section 3(f)), and (B) satisfy
the provisions of Revenue Procedure 75-21, section 467(b) (2) of the Code
(as in effect at the time the adjustment is made), any other applicable
statutes, regulations, revenue procedures, revenue rulings or technical
information releases and any new requirements, if applicable, relating to
the subject matter of such revenue procedure to the same extent and in the
same manner as such provisions are satisfied under the Pricing Assumptions.

(f) Computation of Adjustments.

(i) Upon the occurrence of an event requiring adjustments to
the percentages for Basic Rent, Casualty Value and Termination Value
pursuant to Section 3(e), the Owner Participant shall make the
necessary computations on a basis consistent with that used by the
Owner Participant in the computation of the percentages for Basic
Rent, Casualty Value and Termination Value set forth, respectively,
in Schedule 1, Schedule 2, and Schedule 3, taking into account only
the event giving rise to the adjustments and the provisions of
Section 3(e) (if applicable). Subject to paragraph (ii) of this
Section 3(f), such adjustments shall be effective from and including
the date the Owner Participant shall have furnished to the Lessee a
certificate signed on behalf of the Owner Participant by a
Responsible Officer confirming that such adjustments have been
properly computed in accordance with the provisions of this Lease,
and shall remain effective until changed in consequence of any
inaccuracy discovered in the course of any verification procedure
conducted pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this Section 3(f) or in
consequence of any event occurring thereafter requiring further
adjustment pursuant to Section 3(e).

(ii) Within 60 days after the Owner Participant shall have
provided the Lessee with a certificate pursuant to paragraph (i) of
this Section 3(f), the Lessee may request that the Owner Participant
promptly furnish all information necessary to permit the
confirmation of the accuracy of the Owner Participant's computation
of the adjustments described in such certificate by an independent
accounting firm selected by the Owner Participant and reasonably
satisfactory to the Lessee (the "Qualified Accounting Firm").
Within 30 days after its receipt of such information, such Qualified
Accounting Firm either shall confirm the accuracy of such
computation or shall notify the Owner Participant and the Lessee
that such computation and the resulting adjustments proposed by the
Owner Participant are inaccurate. In the latter event, the Owner
Participant shall consult with the Lessee and such Qualified
Accounting Firm as to the proper computation of the adjustments,
whereupon the Owner Participant shall recompute the adjustments in
such a manner as shall enable such Qualified Accounting Firm to
confirm their accuracy. If such Qualified Accounting Firm is unable
to confirm the accuracy of such adjustments, then the Owner
Participant and the Lessee agree to submit the matter to a second
Qualified Accounting Firm or other independent Person acceptable to
each of them and the conclusion of such firm or other Person as to
the proper adjustments shall be conclusive and binding on the
Lessee, the Owner Participant and the Lessor. All expenses incurred
by the Owner Participant and the Lessee in connection with the
verification procedures described in this paragraph (ii) (including
the fees and expenses of the Qualified Accounting Firm, such second
Qualified Accounting Firm or such other independent Person, as the
case may be) shall be paid by the Lessee unless the verification
results in a readjustment from the original adjustment of more than
5%, provided, that the present value (calculated at 7.9% per annum)
of the Basic Rent for the remaining Interim Term and the Basic Term
proposed by the Owner Participant as of the date of the adjustment
shall also be more than 2 basis points greater than the present
value (calculated at 7.9% per annum) of the Basic Rent for the
remaining Interim Term and the Basic Term as determined by such
Qualified Accounting Firm or other independent Person, in which case
all such expenses shall be paid by the Owner Participant. Each
adjustment of the percentages for Basic Rent, Casualty Value and
Termination Value may, but need not (unless requested by the Lessee,
the Lessor or the Owner Participant), be evidenced by the execution
and delivery of a supplement to this Lease in form and substance
satisfactory to the Lessee and the Owner Participant, and shall be
effective as provided herein without regard to the date on which
such supplement to this Lease is so executed and delivered. The
Lessee, the Lessor and the Owner Participant agree that the sole
responsibility of the verifier shall be to verify the calculation of
the amount of a rent adjustment under this Section 3 and that
matters of interpretation of this Agreement are not within the scope
of the verifier's responsibilities. Any Qualified Accounting Firm
or other independent Person which takes part in the verification
procedure must agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality of
all information provided during the verification procedure, and in
no event will the Lessor be required to provide such Qualified
Accounting Firm or other independent Person with copies of any of
its tax returns.

(g) Sufficiency of Interim Rent, Basic Rent and Supplemental Rent.
The Lessee agrees that (i) the amount of the installments of Interim Rent
and Basic Rent payable on the Interim Rent Payment Date and on each Basic
Rent Payment Date, as the case may be, shall at all times be at least equal
to the aggregate amount of scheduled principal payments (other than
principal due by reason of prepayment or acceleration) and accrued interest
due and payable on such Interim Rent Payment Date, if any, or on such Basic
Rent Payment Date in respect of all Related Notes Outstanding on and as of
the date of such payment and (ii) each payment of Casualty Value or
Termination Value (when added to all other amounts required to be paid by
the Lessee under this Lease in respect of any Event of Loss or termination
of this Lease, respectively) shall at all times be at least equal to an
amount sufficient, as of the date of payment, to pay in full the principal
of and interest on all Related Notes then scheduled to be Outstanding on
and as of such date of payment.

(h) Returned Amounts. Following the receipt by the Lessor of an
indemnification agreement from the Lessee, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Lessor, the Lessor shall rebate to the Lessee any
amounts received by the Lessor from the Indenture Trustee pursuant to
Section 5.2 of the Indenture.

SECTION 4. Net Lease.

This Lease is a net lease and the Lessee hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the Lessee's obligation to pay all Rent hereunder, and the
rights of the Lessor in and to such Rent, shall be absolute, unconditional
and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance of any
character, including, without limitation: (i) any setoff, abatement,
counterclaim, suspension, recoupment, reduction, rescission, defense or
other right or claim that the Lessee may have against the Lessor, the Owner
Participant, the Remainderman, the Indenture Trustee, any Noteholder, any
vendor or manufacturer of or contractor or subcontractor for the Leased
Property or any part of any thereof, or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever; (ii) any defect in or failure of the title, merchantability,
habitability, condition, design, compliance with specifications, operation
or fitness for use of all or any part of the Leased Property; (iii) any
damage to, or removal, abandonment, dismantling, requisition, taking,
condemnation, loss, theft or destruction of all or any part of the Leased
Property or any interference, interruption or cessation in the use,
possession or quiet enjoyment of the Leased Property by the Lessee or by
any other Person for any reason whatsoever or of whatever duration; (iv)
any restriction, prevention or curtailment of or interference with any use
of all or any part of the Leased Property; (v) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding by or against the Lessee, the Lessor,
the Remainderman, the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee or any other
Person; (vi) the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of this Lease,
any other Transaction Document or any other instrument referred to herein
or therein or any other infirmity herein or therein or any lack of right,
power or authority of the Lessor, the Remainderman, the Lessee, the Owner
Participant, the Indenture Trustee, any Noteholder, the Pass Through
Trustee, or any other Person to enter into this Lease, any other
Transaction Document or to perform the obligations hereunder or thereunder
or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
doctrine of force majeure, impossibility, frustration or failure of
consideration; (vii) the breach or failure of any warranty or
representation made in this Lease or any other Transaction Document by any
Lessee, the Lessor, the Remainderman, the Owner Participant, the Indenture
Trustee, or any other Person; or (viii) any other circumstance or happening
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. The Lessee
hereby waives, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, any and all
rights that it may now have or that at any time hereafter may be conferred
upon it, by statute or otherwise, to modify, terminate, cancel, quit or
surrender this Lease or to effect or claim any diminution or reduction of
Rent payable by the Lessee hereunder, except in accordance with the express
terms hereof. The Lessee agrees that, if for any reason whatsoever this
Lease shall be terminated in whole or in part by operation of law or
otherwise, then, except as otherwise provided herein (including, without
limitation, Section 16 hereof ), the Lessee shall pay, to the maximum
extent permitted by Applicable Law, to the Lessor or any other Person
entitled thereto, an amount equal to Interim Rent, each installment of
Basic Rent and all Supplemental Rent at the time such payment would have
become due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof had this Lease
not been terminated in whole or in part. Each payment of Rent made by the
Lessee hereunder shall be final and the Lessee shall not seek or have any
right to recover all or any part of such payment from the Lessor or any
Person for any reason whatsoever except payments made in error. All
covenants, agreements and undertakings of the Lessee herein shall be
performed at its cost, expense and risk unless expressly otherwise stated.
Nothing in this Section 4 or elsewhere shall be construed as a guaranty by
the Lessee of any residual value in the Leased Property or as a guaranty of
the Notes or the Pass Through Certificates. The Lessee's absolute and
irrevocable covenant to pay Rent, as provided in this Section 4, shall not
affect the Lessee's rights, at law or in equity, otherwise to enforce the
Lessor's obligations under this Lease or any other Transaction Documents,
or to bring an action at law or in equity against the Lessor or the Owner
Participant based on such party's gross negligence (or, with respect to
claims which arise while the Lessor or the Owner Participant is present on
the Leased Property, negligence), willful misconduct, misrepresentation or
breach of contract.

SECTION 5. Use of the Premises; Relinquishment of Possession.

(a) Use. The Lessee shall use and occupy the Leased Property for any
use permitted by Applicable Law. The Lessee shall not permit any use that
constitutes a public or private nuisance or any unlawful use upon or in the
Leased Property or any portion thereof. In addition, Lessee at its option,
so long as it is in compliance with each of its obligations hereunder and
under the other Transaction Documents, may elect to not use the Leased
Property and leave it vacant, provided that (a) if Lessee is Investment
Grade, the Leased Property may not be left vacant for more than six (6)
years and (b) if Lessee is not Investment Grade, the Leased Property may
not be left vacant for more than three (3) years.

(b) Termination. Unless the Lessee has theretofore acquired the
Leased Property as provided herein, on the Lease Termination Date the
Lessee shall surrender possession of the Leased Property to the Lessor (or
to a Person specified by the Lessor to the Lessee in writing not less than
30 days prior to the Lease Termination Date unless such Lease Termination
Date results from a termination pursuant to Section 16, in which event
without prior notice). At the time of such surrender, the Leased Property
shall be free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens described
in clauses (a), (b) (c), (h) and (j) of the definition of Permitted Liens)
and in the condition and state of repair required by Section 8(a)(i), as
evidenced in part by, at the Lessor's request, (1) the delivery by the
Lessee of the Environmental Report set forth in Section 9.3 of the
Participation Agreement, and (2) an inspection by the Lessor of the Leased
Property pursuant to the terms of Section 8(b) of the Lease.

SECTION 6. Warranty of the Lessor.

(a) Title; Quiet Enjoyment. The Lessor warrants, covenants and
agrees that, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing the Lessee's peaceable possession, use and enjoyment of the
Leased Property in accordance with this Lease shall not be interfered with,
interrupted or disturbed by the Lessor or any other Person claiming by or
through the Lessor or acting at the direction of the Lessor (exclusive of
the Indenture Trustee).

(b) Disclaimer of Other Warranties. As among the Owner Participant,
the Indenture Trustee, the Remainderman, the Lessor and the Lessee,
execution by the Lessee of this Lease shall be conclusive proof of the
compliance of the Leased Property with all requirements of this Lease.
Except as provided in Section 6(a), the Leased Property is leased in its
present condition without representation or warranty by the Lessor and
subject to the existing state of title, to all Applicable Laws now or
hereafter in effect and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
to all present and future Liens (exclusive, however, of Lessor's Liens).
The Lessee has examined the Leased Property and title thereto and has found
all of the same satisfactory for all purposes. The Lessor has not made an
inspection of the Leased Property or of any fixture or other item
constituting a portion thereof, and, except as provided in Section 6(a),
the Lessor makes no warranty or representation, express or implied or
otherwise, with respect to the same or the location, use, description,
design, merchantability, habitability, fitness for use for any particular
purpose, condition or durability thereof, or as to the title thereto or
ownership thereof or otherwise, it being agreed that all risks incident
thereto are to be borne by the Lessee. In the event of any defect or
deficiency of any nature in the Leased Property or any fixture or other
item constituting a portion thereof, whether patent or latent, the Lessor
shall have no responsibility or liability with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lessor, in its individual capacity,
warrants and represents that on the Closing Date it shall have received
whatever title to the Leased Property that was conveyed to it pursuant to
the Transaction Documents, free of Lessor's Liens attributable to it (in
its individual capacity). Nothing in this Section 6(b) shall be construed
to constitute a waiver of or operate as an estoppel of the Lessor's or the
Lessee's right to enforce any claim or right either of them may have
against any third party in connection with the acquisition, design,
structure, erection, assembly, installation, inspection, testing, start-up,
operation and maintenance of the Leased Property or any Part thereof, or as
to the quality or the material, equipment or workmanship in or of the
Leased Property or any Part thereof, nor shall anything in this Section
6(b) operate to create any rights in any third party. THE LESSOR HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (OTHER THAN AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN OR AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 6(a)), INCLUDING ANY
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR OF
HABITABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE LEASED PROPERTY OR ANY FIXTURE OR OTHER
ITEM CONSTITUTING A PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER ARISING PURSUANT TO THE
UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE OR ANOTHER LAW NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT OR
OTHERWISE, EXCEPT THAT THE LESSOR HEREBY REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT THE
LEASED PROPERTY IS AND SHALL BE FREE OF LESSOR'S LIENS ATTRIBUTABLE TO IT.

(c) Enforcement of Certain Warranties. (i) Subject to clause (ii)
below, the Lessee hereby assigns and sets over to, and the Lessor hereby
accepts the assignment of, all of the Lessee's right, title and interest,
and estate in, to and under, any and all warranties of and other claims
against dealers, manufacturers, vendors, contractors and subcontractors
relating to the construction, use and maintenance of the Leased Property or
any portion thereof now existing or hereafter acquired (excluding from such
assignment any such warranties and claims in respect of any property title
to which is vested in the Lessee and warranties and claims which by their
terms are not assignable by Lessee without loss of any of the benefits of
such warranties or claims); provided, however, that the Lessor shall have
no obligations under, or liabilities with respect to, any such warranties
and claims.

(ii) Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing (i) the Lessor authorizes the Lessee (directly or through
agents), at the Lessee's expense, to assert diligently for the
Lessor's account, during the Lease Term, all of the Lessor's rights
(if any) under any applicable warranty and any other claim that the
Lessee or the Lessor may have against any vendor, manufacturer,
contractor or subcontractor with respect to the Leased Property or
any portion thereof; and (ii) any amount recovered by the Lessee
under any such warranty or other claim against any vendor,
manufacturer, contractor or subcontractor shall be applied in
accordance with Sections 9(f), (g) and (h).

(iii) Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Lessor agrees, at the Lessee's expense, to cooperate
with the Lessee and take all action reasonably necessary as
specifically requested by the Lessee to enable the Lessee to enforce
all of the Lessee's rights (if any) under this Section 6, such
rights of enforcement to be exclusive to the Lessee and further
agrees that (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing) it will not, during the Lease Term, amend, modify or
waive, or take any action under, any applicable warranty and any
other claim that the Lessee may have under this Section 6 without
the Lessee's prior written consent. The Lessee agrees, at its
expense, to diligently assert all of their rights under such
warranties and any other claims that the Lessee may have against
such vendor, manufacturer, contractor or subcontractor with respect
to the Leased Property or any portion thereof. Any amount recovered
by the Lessee under any such warranty or other claim against such
vendor, manufacturer, contractor or subcontractor shall be applied
in accordance with Sections 9(f), (g) and (h) of this Lease.

SECTION 7. Liens.

The Lessee shall not directly or indirectly create, incur or suffer
to exist any Lien on or with respect to the Leased Property or the Lessor's
or Remainderman's title thereto or interest therein except Permitted Liens.
The Lessee, at its expense, shall promptly take and diligently pursue such
action as may be necessary to discharge any Lien (other than Permitted
Liens) that may arise.

SECTION 8. Operation and Maintenance; Modifications.

(i) The Lessee shall (aa) keep and maintain all portions of
the Leased Property in good condition and will make all repairs and
replacements necessary to keep all portions of the Leased Property
in good repair and condition consistent with the standard of
maintenance employed by the Lessee as of the Closing Date with
respect to similar properties located in the general geographic area
where the Leased Property is located, provided that nothing
contained in this Lease shall be deemed to prevent Lessee from
changing the interior configuration of the Leased Property so long
as the Leased Property continues to be maintained as specified
above; (bb) use, possess, occupy, maintain and repair the Leased
Property and make Modifications (if any) in compliance with all
Applicable Laws (including without limitation Environmental Laws)
and applicable Governmental Actions, other than any Applicable Law
or Governmental Action (x) being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings in accordance with the provisions of Section
8(i) or (y) prior to the last day of the Lease Term the failure to
comply with which would not have an adverse effect on the value,
utility or remaining useful life of the Leased Property except to an
insignificant extent; (cc) use, possess, service, maintain or repair
the Leased Property in all material respects as may be required to
comply in all material respects with the conditions of all insurance

possess, occupy, maintain and repair the Leased Property and make
modifications in compliance in all material respects with the
obligations of Lessor relating to the Leased Property under all
Permitted Exceptions; and (ee) use, possess, service, maintain and
repair the Leased Property so as to keep the Leased Property
maintained in a manner at least equal to the care and diligence used
by the Lessee with respect to similar buildings or property owned or
leased by it and utilized in the operation of the Lessee's Business
in the general geographic area where the Leased Property is located,
provided, that with respect to the structural components of the
Leased Property, such structural components shall be maintained in a
manner at least equal to the care and diligence used by Lessee with
respect to similar property owned or leased by it wherever located.

(ii) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

(iii) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

(iv) The Lessee shall deliver a notice to the Lessor promptly
upon the Lessee's becoming aware of or receiving notice of the
intent by a Governmental Authority to (x) take an action that would
constitute a Condemnation, (y) investigate the Leased Property for a
material violation of Applicable Law under which liability may be
imposed on the Owner Participant or the Lessor, or (z) investigate
the Leased Property for any violation of Applicable Law under which
criminal liability may be imposed upon the Owner Participant or the
Lessor.

(b) Inspection. Upon not less than 15 days' notice to the Lessee or
immediately if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
any of the Lessor, the Remainderman, the Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee and their authorized representatives shall have the right
to inspect the Leased Property (subject, in each event, to Applicable Law
and applicable confidentiality undertakings and reasonable restrictions to
access and procedures as may be established by the Lessee) at their
expense, during normal business hours and at reasonable intervals
accompanied by representatives of the Lessee designated by the Lessee;
provided, that, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, any inspection hereunder shall not unreasonably interfere with,
interrupt or disturb the normal conduct of the Lessee's Business. Upon not

expense, to inspect the books and records of the Lessee as relating to the
Leased Property and, with the reasonable consent of the Lessee, to make

proprietary data and information), and may, at their expense and upon 15
days' notice to the Lessee discuss the Lessee's affairs, finances and
accounts with Lessee's executive officers, all during normal business hours
at reasonable intervals; provided, that, unless an Event of Default shall

interfere with, interrupt or disturb the normal conduct of the Lessee's
Business. None of the Lessor, the Owner Participant, the Remainderman or
the Indenture Trustee shall have any duty whatsoever to make any inspection
referred to in this Section 8(b) or shall incur any liability or obligation
by reason of not making any such inspection.

(c) Modifications. The Lessee, at its expense (unless financed by
the Lessor as provided in Section 8(f)) and subject to Section 8(i), shall
make any Modification required by any Applicable Law or Governmental
Action. So long as no Event of Default or Special Default has occurred and
is continuing, the Lessee may also make any Modifications that the Lessor
agrees to finance pursuant to Section 8(f) below. So long as no Event of
Default or Special Default has occurred and is continuing, the Lessee, at
its expense (unless financed by the Lessor as provided in Section 8(f)),
from time to time may make any other Modification that the Lessee, in its
sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable; provided, however, that
the Lessee shall not have the right to make any Modification (other than
Modifications referred to in the first sentence of this Section 8(c)) if
such Modification would diminish the value, utility or remaining useful
life of the Leased Property (other than to an insignificant extent) or
cause the Leased Property to be characterized as limited use property (as
described in Section 4.09 of Revenue Procedure 75-28 or Revenue Procedure
76-30). The Lessor shall not make any Modification prior to the Lease
Termination Date without the prior written consent of the Lessee.

(d) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

(e) Title to Modifications. Title to each Modification and shall
vest as follows:

(i) in the case of each Nonseverable Modification, the Lessor
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, without further
act, effective on the date such Nonseverable Modification shall have
been completed, acquire title to such Nonseverable Modification and
the Lessee agrees to execute such deeds or other instruments
required by Applicable Law to confirm or effect such passage of
title;

(ii) in the case of each Severable Modification for which the
Lessor shall have provided or arranged financing (in whole or in
part) of the cost of such Modification by a Supplemental Financing
or an Approved Equity Financing, the Lessor shall, without further
act, effective on the date such Supplemental Financing or Approved
Equity Financing shall have been provided, acquire title to such
Modification and the Lessee agrees to execute such deeds or other
instruments required by Applicable Law to confirm or effect such
passage of title; and

(iii) in the case of each Severable Modification for which the
Lessor shall not have provided or arranged financing (in whole or in
part) of the cost of such Modification by Supplemental Financing or
an Approved Equity Financing, the Lessee shall retain title to such
Modification.

Immediately upon title to a Modification vesting in the Lessor
pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this Section 8(e), such
Modification shall, without further act, become subject to this Lease and
be deemed part of the Leased Property for all purposes hereof. Upon
request by the Lessor or the Lessee, the Lessor and the Lessee shall
execute, acknowledge, and deliver a supplement to this Lease confirming the
addition of any Modification which, pursuant to this Section 8(e) shall
become part of the Leased Property.

Modifications title to which remains in the Lessee pursuant to
subparagraph (iii) of this Section 8(e) shall not be deemed a part of the
Leased Property and in case of a Casualty, the Lessee shall have the right
to recover the value thereof as its own loss from any insurance company
with which it has insured the same, or to claim an award in the event of
Condemnation, notwithstanding that any such Modifications might be
considered a part of the Leased Property, subject to Section 9(f).

(f) Funding of the Costs of Modifications.

(i) Based upon a request from the Lessee, the Owner
Participant may in its sole discretion make an equity investment in
any Modification, but shall have no obligation to do so, in
accordance with the procedures of this subparagraph (f). If the
Owner Participant agrees to make such an equity investment, the
Owner Participant shall finance through an equity investment in the
Lessor the costs of such Modifications referred to in any such
notice (an "Approved Equity Financing"). In connection with any
such financing, the parties shall enter into an amendment to this
Lease pursuant to which the Lessee agrees to lease the Modifications
financed by the Owner Participant pursuant to this subparagraph (i)
for a term equal to the remainder of the Basic Term and any
exercised Renewal Terms and for the Basic Rent determined in
accordance with this subparagraph (i) and otherwise on the same
terms and conditions as set forth in the Lease. Basic Rent,
Termination Value and Casualty Value shall be adjusted so that the
Basic Rent payable by the Lessee with respect to any Modifications
will provide the Owner Participant with a net economic return
comparable to the net economic return on comparable transactions
with comparable credits at the time being financed by the Owner
Participant Parent or its Affiliates as may be determined by the
Owner Participant in its sole judgment.

(ii) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

(iii) If the Owner Participant does not, pursuant to this
Section 8(f), finance the entire cost of any Modification through an
equity investment in the Lessor, the Lessee may request the Lessor
to issue, and upon such request the Lessor shall execute, such
documents and instruments, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Lessor, as shall have been provided to it by the
Lessee in order to effect the issuance to one or more Persons (other
than the Lessee, Affiliates or any other Person affiliated with the
Lessee within the meaning of Section 318 of the Code or any agent
thereof) of one or more series of Additional Notes under the
Indenture, and shall use the proceeds thereof to pay the cost of
such Modification (to the extent not financed by an Approved Equity
Financing) subject to Section 9.2 of the Participation Agreement and
Section 2.13 of the Indenture (a "Supplemental Financing").

(g) Removal of Property. Subject to compliance with Applicable Law
and so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Lessee at any time during the Lease Term may remove any Severable
Modification or any other property to which the Lessee shall have title;
provided that the Lessee, at its expense and prior to the Lease Termination
Date, shall repair any damage to the Leased Property caused by such removal
and (in the case of any removal of property not constituting a Severable
Modification) shall restore any diminishment (except to an insignificant
extent) in the value, utility or remaining useful life of the Leased
Property caused by such removal. In addition, if at any time during the
Lease Term the Lessee shall conclude that any property included in the
Leased Property in respect of which the Lessor shall have title is
unnecessary and can be removed without diminishment of the value, utility
or remaining useful life of the Leased Property, the Lessee may remove such
property and, upon such removal, without further act, title thereto shall
vest in the Lessee or in such Person as shall be designated by the Lessee,
free of the Lien of the Indenture; provided, that, at any time after the
Lessee shall have removed an aggregate of such property having an aggregate
original cost of more than $200,000, the Lessee shall give the Lessor, the
Owner Participant, the Remainderman and the Indenture Trustee written
notice that such property has been removed and pay the net proceeds of sale
of such removed property to Lessor. If any component is removed from the
Leased Property for the purpose of replacement thereof with another
component, title to such removed component shall remain in the Lessor, no
matter where such removed component is located, until such time as the
component constituting a replacement thereof shall have been incorporated
into the Leased Property, at which time, without further act, title to such
removed component shall vest in the Lessee or in such Person as shall be
designated by the Lessee, free of the Lien of the Indenture. Each such
replacement component shall be free and clear of all Liens (except
Permitted Liens), shall upon installation become a part of the Leased
Property (with title thereto vesting in the Lessor), shall be in good
operating condition as, and shall have a value, utility and remaining
useful life at least equal to, that of the component removed and the
removal thereof shall not diminish the value, utility and remaining useful
life of the Leased Property, it being assumed for purposes of this sentence
that such removed component was in the condition and state of repair
required by Section 8(a).

(h) Trade and Other Fixtures. All trade and other fixtures, personal
property, machinery, equipment and the like in the Leased Property (as
described in Schedule 9 of the Participation Agreement or Section 8(e)(iii)
of this Lease) are acknowledged by the Lessor to be the Lessee's property
and do not constitute part of the Leased Property (all such fixtures,
property, machinery, equipment and the like (other than those expressly
made subject to the Lease pursuant to a Lease Supplement) being referred to
as "Lessee's Property"). Without the Lessor's prior written approval, the
Lessee may alter or improve or substitute or remove any Lessee's Property
as it may desire, at its own expense. The Lessee shall be under no
obligation to maintain, repair or replace any such Lessee's Property in
accordance with this Lease or otherwise and the provisions of this Section
8 (other than this subparagraph (h)) shall not apply to the Lessee's
Property. Any such Lessee's Property now or hereafter made, purchased or
installed by or for the Lessee shall remain the property of the Lessee and
in case of a Casualty, the Lessee shall have the right to recover the value
thereof as its own loss from any insurance company with which it has
insured the same, or to claim an award in the event of Condemnation,
notwithstanding that any Lessee's Property might be considered a part of
the Leased Property. Without the Lessor's consent, the Lessee may remove
all or any of such Lessee's Property at any time during the Lease Term, or,
with Lessor's consent, the Lessee may abandon the same, in whole or in
part, to the Lessor at the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease
Term by vacating the Leased Property without removing the same, in which
case such property shall become part of the Leased Property for the
purposes of Section 5(b); provided that in the case of any such removal,
the Lessee shall repair any damage to the Leased Property caused by such
removal. If an Event of Loss shall have occurred, the Lessee shall be
solely entitled to any condemnation award or insurance proceeds
attributable to the Lessee's Property. The Lessor shall have the option,
exercisable at any time within 60 days prior to the end of the Lease Term,
to purchase all or any part of Lessee's Property for a purchase price equal
to the lower of the cost or the Fair Market Sales Value of such Lessee's
Property.

(i) Contest of Requirements of Law. If, with respect to any
requirement of Applicable Law or any Governmental Action relating to the
use, operation, maintenance or repair of the Leased Property or the
construction or installation of any Modification, (i) the Lessee is
contesting diligently and in good faith by appropriate proceedings such
requirement or Governmental Action, or (ii) compliance with such
requirement or Governmental Action shall have been excused or exempted by a
valid nonconforming use permit, waiver, variance, extension or forbearance
exempting the Lessee from such requirement or Governmental Action or (iii)
the Lessee shall be making a good faith effort and shall be diligently
taking appropriate steps to comply with such requirement or Governmental
Action (and if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, unless
the Lessee shall have posted security of a type acceptable to the Lessor in
an amount sufficient to compensate the Lessor if such Event of Default is
not cured, remedied or waived or otherwise ceases to exist), then the
failure by the Lessee to comply with such requirement or Governmental
Action shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default hereunder;
provided that such contest or noncompliance does not extend beyond the last
day of the Lease Term and does not involve (1) any danger of foreclosure,
forfeiture or loss of the Leased Property or any part thereof, (2) criminal
liability being imposed on the Lessor, the Trust, the Owner Participant,
the Remainderman, the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder, (3) any
substantial danger of the sale of, or the creation of any Lien (other than
a Permitted Lien) on, the Leased Property, (4) material civil liability
being imposed on the Lessor, the Trust Estate, the Owner Participant, the
Remainderman, the Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder or (5) with respect
to the conditions noted in clause (ii) above, the extension of the ultimate
imposition of such Applicable Law beyond the last day of the Lease Term if
the exemption in question shall not be available to the Lessor, any
subsequent lessee or any purchaser of the Leased Property after the end of
the Lease Term. The Lessee shall provide the Lessor with notice of any
contest of the type described in clause (i) above in detail sufficient to
enable the Lessor to ascertain whether such contest would be reasonably
likely to have any adverse effect of the type described in the above
proviso.

(j) Investment Credit Pass-Through. The Lessor agrees that, upon the
reasonable request of the Lessee, it will cooperate in good faith with the
Lessee to pass through or make available to the Lessee any credit that
might be allowable for Federal income tax purposes in connection with the
acquisition, installation or use of any Modification or any repair,
construction or reconstruction of the Leased Property, in each case that is
financed by the Lessee; provided, however, in no event shall the Lessor or
the Owner Participant be required hereunder to take any action that in the
good faith judgment of the Owner Participant could adversely affect the
Lessor or the Owner Participant.

SECTION 9. Event of Loss.

(a) Notice of Condemnation, Casualty or Event of Loss.

(i) If any substantial part of the Leased Property shall
suffer a Condemnation or a Casualty the Lessee shall promptly, and
in any case within 10 Business Days after such event, so notify the
Lessor.

(ii) If an Event of Loss shall occur, then the Lessee may, at
its sole election and by written notice to the Lessor, within 180
days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, determine whether
or not the Lessee desires to reconstruct the Leased Property
pursuant to Section 9(b); provided, however, that the Lessee may not
elect to reconstruct the Leased Property pursuant to Section 9(b)
unless an independent architect selected by the Lessee and
reasonably acceptable to the Lessor shall have determined that the
Leased Property is reasonably expected to be substantially completed
in accordance with Section 9(b) within the period ending on the
earlier of (a) the second anniversary of the date of the Event of
Loss or (b) the scheduled Lease Termination Date.

(b) Repair. If the Leased Property or any part thereof shall suffer a
Condemnation or Casualty which does not constitute an Event of Loss, or if
an Event of Loss occurs and the Lessee does not elect to terminate this
Lease pursuant to Section 9(c), the Lessee shall make or cause to be made
such repairs as are necessary to ensure that the Leased Property is
maintained in the condition and state of repair required under Section
8(a)(i) and all insurance proceeds or condemnation awards payable with
respect to such event shall be made available to Lessee to effect such
repair in accordance with Section 9(g). In such event, the Lessee shall,
within one year of the occurrence of such Condemnation or Casualty,
commence the reconstruction of the Leased Property so that the
reconstruction is completed by the earlier of (i) the second anniversary of
the Casualty and (ii) the Lease Termination Date and the resulting Leased
Property shall have a value, utility and remaining useful life at least
equal to that which the Leased Property had immediately prior to its
destruction or damage. No Rent shall be abated hereunder during the time
in which the Lessee undertakes its repairs.

(c) Event of Loss; Payment of Casualty Value. If an Event of Loss
shall occur and the Lessee does not elect to repair the Leased Property
pursuant to Section 9(b), the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor and the
Remainderman on the applicable Casualty Value Date specified below, the
Casualty Value determined as of the aforesaid Casualty Value Date to the
extent not previously paid to the Lessor or Indenture Trustee as insurance
proceeds or condemnation awards. From the date of the Event of Loss to and
including the Casualty Value Date specified below, all Rent shall continue
to accrue and be paid by the Lessee when due. Such Casualty Value shall be
paid by the Lessee on the Casualty Value Date occurring next after the 90th
day after the date of Lessee's notice pursuant to Section 9(a)(ii),
(provided, that if insurance or other proceeds have been received by the
Lessee for such Event of Loss prior to such date, such proceeds shall be
paid to the Lessor by the 30th day after receipt of such proceeds),
together with all unpaid Rent due on or before such Casualty Value Date
plus an amount equal to the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of
the Owner Participant, the Remainderman, the Lessor and the Indenture
Trustee related to such Event of Loss. The Lessee, at its own cost, shall
take all appropriate action in connection with any claim relating to an
Event of Loss and the payment of Casualty Value; however, the Lessor, the
Remainderman and the Indenture Trustee may participate in any such action
at their own cost. Upon the payment of the Casualty Value and the other
amounts payable by the Lessee specified above, the Lessor shall effect a
Transfer to the Lessee. In the event that the Lessor shall effect a
Transfer to the Lessee, neither the Lessee nor its Affiliate shall use the
Leased Property in Lessee's Business for a period of at least five (5)
years following the date of termination of this Lease, nor shall the Lessee
rebuild the Improvements to a size (measured by total rentable square feet)
which is within five percent (5%) of the size of the Improvements prior to
the Event of Loss or to the same configuration as the Improvements prior to
the Event of Loss.

(d) Other Condemnation or Casualty. In the case of a Condemnation or
Casualty not constituting an Event of Loss or with respect to which the
Lessee does not elect to terminate this Lease pursuant to Section 9(c),
this Lease shall continue, and each and every obligation of the Lessee
hereunder and under each Transaction Document shall remain in full force
and effect.

(e) Termination of Lease Term. Upon a Transfer by the Lessor to the
Lessee pursuant to Section 9(c) and the payment of the amounts specified in
the Indenture, the Notes and this Lease to the Persons entitled thereto,
the Lease Term shall end without further act on the part of the Lessor or
the Lessee and all of the obligations of the Lessee hereunder (other than
any obligation expressed herein as surviving termination of this Lease)
shall cease. In all other cases set forth in this Section 9, the Lease Term
shall continue and this Lease shall remain in full force and effect.

(f) Application of Payments on an Event of Loss and Lease
Termination. Payments received by the Lessor (other than proceeds of
insurance carried by the Lessor or the Owner Participant pursuant to
Section 10(b)) or the Lessee (other than proceeds of insurance carried by
or on behalf of the Lessee pursuant to Section 8(h) or Section 10(b)) from
any Governmental Authority, insurer or other Person, plus the amount of any
payments that would have been due from an insurer but for the Lessee's self-
insurance or policy deductibles, as a result of an Event of Loss to which
Section 9(c) applies shall be applied as follows:

(i) all such payments shall be promptly paid to the Lessor for
application pursuant to the following provisions of this Section
9(f), except that the Lessee may retain any amounts that at the time
are payable to the Lessee under the provisions of clauses (ii) or
(iii) below;

(ii) so much of such payments (applying any payments from
insurers (including payments attributable to any Lessee's self-
insurance) before any payments from other Persons (including
Governmental Authorities)) as shall not exceed the amount of
Casualty Value and other amounts required to be paid by the Lessee
pursuant to Section 9(c) shall be applied in reduction of the
Lessee's obligation to pay such amount if the same has not already
been paid by the Lessee or, if the same has already been fully paid
by the Lessee, shall be applied to reimburse the Lessee for its
payment of such amount; and

(iii) the balance, if any, of such payments representing
proceeds of insurance carried by the Lessee and amounts attributable
to self-insurance by the Lessee shall be paid over to, or retained
by, the Lessee; and

(iv) the balance, if any, of such payments representing
payments received from any Governmental Authority, insurer or other
Persons shall be paid as follows: (A) to the Lessee, an amount equal
to such balance multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the number of days remaining in the Basic Term and all
Fixed-Rate Renewal Terms (or if the Lessee has exercised its option
under Section 12(b), the number of days remaining in the current
Fair Market Renewal Term) as of the date of the occurrence of the
Event of Loss and the denominator of which shall be the number of
days equal to the remaining useful life of the Leased Property as of
such date, and (B) to the Lessor and the Remainderman, an amount
equal to the remainder of such balance, as their interests may
appear.

(g) Application of Payments Not Relating to a Lease Termination.
Payments received by the Lessor (other than proceeds of insurance carried
by the Lessor or the Owner Participant pursuant to Section 10(b)) or by the
Lessee (other than proceeds of insurance carried by or on behalf of the
Lessee pursuant to Section 8(h) or Section 10(b)) from any Governmental
Authority, insurer or other Person, plus the amount of any payments that
would have been due from an insurer but for Lessee's self-insurance or
policy deductibles, with respect to any Condemnation or Casualty not
constituting an Event of Loss, or with respect to which the Lessee does not
elect to terminate this Lease pursuant to Section 9(c), shall be applied as
follows:

(i) an amount of such payments from insurers or from other
Persons including Governmental Authorities, but excluding payments
attributable to any Lessee's self-insurance, equal to the Cost
Threshold shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Lessee, which
the Lessee agrees to use for repair or replacement of the Leased
Property pursuant to Section 9(b) or, in the case of a Condemnation,
at the Lessee's option, to restore the affected property as nearly
as reasonably possible to its condition, function and use existing
immediately prior to such Condemnation;

(ii) the balance of such payments from insurers or from other
Persons including Governmental Authorities, but excluding payments
attributable to the Lessee's self-insurance, shall be held by the
Lessor or (so long as the Indenture shall be in effect) the
Indenture Trustee as security for the obligations of the Lessee
under this Lease, but any amounts so held shall be released and paid
over to the Lessee from time to time so long as no Special Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, in each case upon
presentation to the Lessor or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may
be, of a Lessee Request specifying the amount so to be released, and
annexing invoices (not previously paid using funds referred to in
subparagraph (i) of this Section 9 or previously used as a basis for
any release of funds pursuant to this Section 9(g)) demonstrating
expenditures made or to be made by the Lessee upon receipt of such
funds, in either case, as required by Section 9(b) for repair of the
Leased Property in excess of amounts attributable to the Lessee's
self-insurance or policy deductibles or, in the case of a
Condemnation, at the Lessee's option, to restore the Leased Property
as nearly as reasonably possible to its condition, function and use
existing immediately prior to such Condemnation;

(iii) the balance, if any, of such payments representing
proceeds of insurance carried by the Lessee shall be paid over to,
or retained by, the Lessee; and

(iv) the balance, if any, of such payments from any
Governmental Authority or other source shall be paid to the Lessor,
the Remainderman and the Lessee in proportion to the loss suffered
by each.

(h) Application During Event of Default. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 9 or the provisions of Section 10, if
an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any amount that
otherwise would be payable to or for the account of, or that otherwise
would be retained by, the Lessee pursuant to Section 10 or this Section 9
(except as otherwise provided in Section 8(h)) shall be paid to the Lessor
or, so long as the Indenture shall be in effect, to the Indenture Trustee,
as security for the obligations of the Lessee under this Lease; provided,
however, that if such Event of Default shall be cured, remedied or waived
or otherwise cease to exist, any such amounts held by the Lessor or the
Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, shall be promptly released and paid
over to the Lessee.

(i) Temporary Condemnation. Notwithstanding any other provision to
the contrary contained in this Section 9, in the event of a temporary
condemnation, this Lease will remain in full force and effect and Lessee
will be entitled to the proceeds allowable to such temporary condemnation
and Lessor will pay over to Lessee any amounts received by Lessor with
respect thereto; except that such portion of the proceeds allocable to the
time period after the Termination Date will be paid to Lessor or the
Remainderman in accordance with their interests.

(j) Substitution Right. In the event that Lessee has the right to
terminate this Lease following an Event of Loss, in lieu of paying to the
Lessor the Casualty Value pursuant to Section 9(c), Lessee may utilize its
right of substitution pursuant to Section 14.

SECTION 10. Insurance.

(a) Required Insurance.

(i) Subject to the provisions of Sections 10(c) and (d), the
Lessee shall carry and maintain, or cause to be carried and
maintained, the following insurance coverage, in each case with
insurers having an A.M. Best Company ("Best's") rating of at least
"B+" (or a comparable rating from Best's) or such other insurers
selected by the Lessee and reasonably acceptable to the Lessor:

(A) special form property insurance (all risk type),
with respect to the Leased Property, including, without
limitation, fire, theft, flood, water damage, collapse,
earthquake, windstorm, hail, boiler and machinery (if objects
exist), lightning, explosion, falling objects (i.e., aircraft),
back-up and seepage of sewers and drains, and business
interruption, and with coverage limits at least equal to full
(100%) replacement cost of the Leased Property, exclusive of
architectural and engineering fees, excavation footings and
foundations, and with such other terms as are comparable to such
special form property insurance (all risk type) maintained
generally by entities engaged in the Lessee's Business with
respect to buildings and property similar in size and use to the
Leased Property occupied by entities engaged in the Lessee's
Business in the same geographic area ("Similar Buildings"),
endorsed to provide that (l) losses shall be adjusted as
provided in Section 10(a) (iii), (2) the Lessor (in its
individual and trust capacity), the Remainderman, the Owner
Participant, and, so long as any Notes are Outstanding, the
Indenture Trustee (in its individual and trust capacity)
(collectively, the "Additional Insureds") are included as the
additional insureds, as their interests may appear, but shall
not be liable for the payment of premiums, (3) any payment
thereunder shall be made to the Indenture Trustee so long as the
Indenture is in effect, and otherwise to the Lessor, except,
provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, that payments of less than the Cost Threshold shall
be paid solely to any Lessee, (4) if available in the commercial
insurance market without imposing unduly burdensome terms and
conditions on the Lessee, the insurer thereunder waives all
rights to subrogation against the Additional Insureds with
respect to their respective interests in the Leased Property,
and (5) such insurance shall be primary without right of
contribution of any other insurance carried by or on behalf of
any Additional Insured with respect to its interest in the
Leased Property; and

(B) commercial general liability insurance covering
claims arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance,
condition or use of the Leased Property in such amounts not less
than $50 million (provided that this provision shall not be
implied to bind any subtenant to maintain such insurance in
excess of $1 million) combined single limit per occurrence and
with such other terms as are comparable to the commercial
general liability insurance that is maintained generally by
entities engaged in the Lessee's Business with respect to
Similar Buildings, endorsed as provided in clauses (2), (4) and
(5) of Section 10 (a) (i) (A).

(ii) Prior to the expiration of such insurance, the Lessee
shall renew such insurance and within 10 days after such renewal,
the Lessee shall furnish the Lessor a report that includes: (A) a
copy of the certificate of insurance signed by an independent
insurance broker or the insurer, describing in detail the insurance
then maintained pursuant to this Section 10; and (B) a certificate
signed by a Responsible Officer of the Lessee stating that such
insurance and any self-insurance maintained by the Lessee is in
accordance with this Section 10.

(iii) All losses shall be adjusted with the insurance companies
and all insurance proceeds shall be collected, including by the
filing of appropriate proceedings, by or on behalf of the Lessee,
and all insurance proceeds paid in respect of insurance maintained
pursuant to Section 10(a) (i) (A) shall be paid as provided in
Section 10(a) (i) (A) (3) and be applied as provided in Section
9(f), (g), (h) or (i), as the case may be, subject, however, to any
priority allocations of such proceeds as set forth in the insurance
policies or as required under Applicable Law.

(iv) Provided that such endorsements are available in the
commercial insurance market, the Lessee shall obtain endorsements to
the insurance policies carried pursuant to Section 10(a) (i)
providing that (w) the insurers waive any right of set-off or
counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by attachment or
otherwise, in respect of any liability of any Lessee or any
Additional Insured (unless obtaining this endorsement in the
commercial insurance market would impose unduly burdensome terms and
conditions on the Lessee), (x) the respective interests of the
Additional Insureds shall not be invalidated by any act or neglect
by any Lessee, including breach of any warranty contained in such
policies, (y) no lapse, cancellation or material change with respect
to such policies shall be effective as to an Additional Insured
until at least 30 days after receipt by such Additional Insured of
written notice thereof and (z) the coverage afforded by such
policies shall not be affected by the performance of any work in or
about any Modification.

(b) Other Insurance. Nothing in this Section 10 shall prohibit the
Lessee from maintaining at its expense insurance on or with respect to the
Leased Property, naming the Lessee as insured and/or loss payee for an
amount greater than the insurance required to be maintained under this
section 10, unless such insurance would conflict with or otherwise limit
the availability of or coverage afforded by insurance required to be
maintained under Section 10(a). Nothing in this Section 10 shall prohibit
the Lessor or the Owner Participant from maintaining at its expense other
insurance on or with respect to the Leased Property or the operation, use
and occupancy of the Leased Property, naming the Lessor or the Owner
Participant as insured and/or loss payee, unless such insurance would
conflict with or otherwise limit the insurance required to be maintained
under Section 10(a).

(c) Self-Insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Lease, the Lessee may satisfy all or a portion of the insurance
requirements set forth in Section 10 through self-insurance by the Lessee
(by means of deductibles, self-insured retentions or otherwise), provided,
that the amount of such self-insurance with respect to the Leased Property
per occurrence may not exceed the lesser of (i) one percent (1%) of the net
worth of the Lessee and (ii) $5 million.

(d) Insurance to be Commercially Available. If any insurance required
to be maintained by the Lessee pursuant to this Section 10 is not
maintained by the Lessee or any Affiliate of the Lessee because such
insurance is not available in the commercial insurance markets or, with
respect to the insurance required under Section 10 and any related terms
required by Section 10, cannot be purchased at commercially reasonable
rates (including without limitation flood and earthquake insurance), then
the Lessee shall be required only to maintain such coverage or insurance at
such levels as is maintained generally by the Lessee with respect to
Similar Buildings, the provisions of this Section 10 to the contrary
notwithstanding.

SECTION 11. Rights To Assign or Sublease; Assignment as Security;
Subordination and Attornment.

(a) Assignment by the Lessee.

(i) Upon 30 days prior written notice to the Lessor, without
the consent of the Lessor or the Indenture Trustee, the Lessee may
assign its right, title and interest in, to and under this Lease,
the Leased Property or any portion thereof to any Person, provided,
that such assignment shall include an assumption of all of the
Lessee's obligations under this Lease and that concurrently with an
assignment, the Lessee unconditionally agrees to waive any and all
suretyship defenses (pursuant to a waiver in substantially the form
of Exhibit B) and (A) the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Participant shall have received from Lessee's Counsel a favorable
opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant as to the due
authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of such
assignment and waiver, as appropriate, and to such other matters as
the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Participant may reasonably
request regarding such assignment, (B) no Event of Default or
Special Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (C) such
assignment shall not cause any adverse tax consequences to the Owner
Participant, the Remainderman, the Indenture Trustee, the Pass
Through Trustee, the holders of the Pass Through Certificates, or
the Noteholders (other than, in the case of the Owner Participant,
consequences for which the Owner Participant would be indemnified in
a manner acceptable to the Owner Participant), (D) upon giving
effect to the proposed assignment, the assignee will not be in
breach of any covenant, agreement or condition required to be
performed or observed by the assignor in the Lease, (E) the Lessee
shall have duly authorized, executed and delivered to the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Participant the assignment, (F) such
assignment, as appropriate, shall not violate any provisions of
Applicable Law and (G) such assignment shall not release the Lessee
from or impair the primary liability of the Lessee in respect of any
of obligations as Lessee hereunder or in respect of any of its
obligations under any of the other Transaction Documents.

(ii) The Lessee may assign its right, title and interest in, to
and under this Lease to any Person and be thereupon released from
its obligations under this Lease if the Lessor shall have given its
prior written consent to such assignment to such Person, which
consent may be conditional; provided that no release under this
Section 11(a)(ii) shall occur so long as any Notes are Outstanding.

(b) Sublease by the Lessee.

(i) Upon 30 days prior written notice to the Lessor, but
without the consent of the Lessor, provided that no Event of Default
or Special Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee
may at any time sublease less than 50% of the rentable square
footage of the Leased Property to any Person for a term not to
extend beyond the expiration date of the Basic Term or the
expiration date of any then exercised Renewal Terms; provided, that
such subletting shall be subject and subordinate to this Lease and
shall not release the Lessee from or impair the primary liability of
the Lessee in respect of any of its obligations as Lessee hereunder
or in respect of any of its obligations under any of the other
Transaction Documents. The Lessee may grant the applicable
sublessee(s) the right to extend the term of its/their sublease(s)
to the extent the Lessee exercises its right to renew this Lease
under Section 12 hereof. As a condition to the foregoing, no such
sublease shall cause any adverse tax consequences to the Owner
Participant (other than consequences for which the Owner Participant
would be indemnified by the Lessee pursuant to the terms of the
Transaction Documents or another written undertaking by the Lessee
to indemnify the Owner Participant if the Lessee is Investment Grade
(or if the Lessee is not Investment Grade, in a manner and amount
acceptable to the Owner Participant in its sole discretion)).

(ii) The Lessee, provided that no Event of Default or Special
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, may at any time
sublease more than 50% of the rentable square footage of the Leased
Property to any Person for a term not to extend beyond the
expiration date of the Basic Term or the expiration date of any then
exercised Renewal Terms without the consent of the Lessor; provided,
that (A) the Lessee shall be Investment Grade at the time such
sublease is executed or (B) the proposed subtenant is Investment
Grade at the time such sublease is executed. In all other cases,
the Lessee may sublease more than 50% of the rentable square footage
of the Leased Property only with the prior written consent of the
Lessor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
No sublease entered into pursuant to this Section 11(b) shall
release the Lessee from or impair the primary liability of the
Lessee in respect of any of its obligations as Lessee hereunder or
in respect of any of its obligations under any of the other
Transaction Documents. Any such sublease shall be subject and
subordinate to this Lease. The Lessee may grant the applicable
sublessee the right to extend the term of its sublease to the extent
the Lessee exercises its right to renew this Lease under Section 12
hereof. As a condition to the foregoing, no such sublease shall
cause any adverse tax consequences to the Owner Participant (other

Lessee is not Investment Grade, in a manner and amount acceptable to
the Owner Participant in its sole discretion).

With respect to any sublease described in Section 11(b)(ii)
above, the Lessee must assign such sublease to the Lessor, which may
further assign such sublease to the Indenture Trustee, and the
sublessee shall consent in writing to such assignments and
acknowledge and be bound by Section 11(c) as if the sublessee were
the Lessee under this Lease Agreement.

(c) Assignment by Lessor as Security for Lessor's Obligations. To
secure the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes, the Lessor will assign to,
and create a security interest in favor of, the Indenture Trustee of (i)
its right, title and interest (excluding any Excepted Rights) in and to
this Lease, including the right to receive payments of Rent (excluding any
Excepted Payments), to the extent provided in the Indenture, and (ii) its
right, title and interest in and to the Leased Property. The Lessee hereby
(x) consents to such assignment and such security interest and to the terms
of the Indenture, (y) agrees that the Lessee shall pay directly to the
Indenture Trustee at the Indenture Trustee's Office (until the Lien of the
Indenture and the Related Supplemental Indenture shall have been
discharged) all amounts of Rent (other than Excepted Payments) due or to
become due to the Lessor, and (z) agrees that, to the extent provided in
the Indenture (until the Lien of the Indenture shall have been discharged),
the Indenture Trustee shall have or shall share with the Lessor such rights
of the Lessor hereunder (other than Excepted Rights and the right to
receive Excepted Payments) as are specified in the Indenture.

(d) Other Assignments by the Lessor. During the Lease Term, the
Lessor may transfer, sell or convey the Leased Property or assign its
rights and obligations under this Lease only in accordance with the
Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, the limitations
contained in Section 5.5 of the Indenture and Article VIII of the
Participation Agreement.

(e) Attornment. Subject to the terms of Sections 6.4(b), 6.5(b) and
6.8(b) of the Participation Agreement, this Lease and the Lessee's interest
hereunder shall be subject and subordinate to the Indenture, the Related
Supplemental Indenture and any amendments, modifications, extensions or
renewals thereof. The provision of this subsection shall be self-operative
and no further instrument of subordination shall be required. In the event
of (i) the foreclosure of any mortgage made by the Lessor covering the
Leased Property (including, without limitation, the Indenture), (ii) the
giving of a deed in lieu of foreclosure by the Lessor with respect to the
Leased Property, (iii) a transfer of the Leased Property resulting from the
filing of a petition in bankruptcy or other similar insolvency proceeding
by or against the Lessor, or (iv) any other transfer by the Lessor of title
to the Leased Property permitted by the terms of the Transaction Documents,
then the Lessee shall, at the request of the purchaser or transferee, as
the case may be, attorn to the purchaser or other transferee, including the
Indenture Trustee, upon any such foreclosure, sale or transfer, and
recognize such purchaser or other transferee as the Lessor under this
Lease. The purchaser or other transferee (i) shall not be liable for prior
acts or omissions of the Lessor (but in no event shall such purchaser or
other transferee be relieved from its obligation to comply with this Lease
from and after the date such purchaser or other transferee acquires its
interest), (ii) shall not be subject to any claims, offsets, defenses or
counterclaims, which the Lessee may have against the Lessor, (iii) shall
not be bound by any payment of Basic Rent that the Lessee might have paid
for more than one six month period to the Lessor and (iv) shall not be
bound by any amendment, modification or termination of the Lease entered
into other than in accordance with the terms of this Lease.

SECTION 12. Lease Renewal.

(a) Option for Fixed-Rate Renewal. Subject to the notice requirement
set forth in Section 13(a) or 13(b), as the case may be, and to the
provisions of Section 13(c), provided that no Event of Default or Special
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee shall have the
option to renew the term of this Lease at the end of the Basic Term and at
the end of any Fixed-Rate Renewal Term (as hereinafter defined) for up to
five (5) periods of five (5) years each (or such shorter period required to
comply with the next proviso of this sentence) (each such period being
called a "Fixed-Rate Renewal Term"); provided, that in order for Lessee to
extend the Lease Term with respect to the Leased Property for the first
Fixed-Rate Renewal Term, Lessee must also have extended the Related Leases
for their first Fixed-Rate Renewal Terms (such requirement is not
applicable to any Renewal Term after the first Renewal Term). On each
Basic Rent Payment Date during a Fixed-Rate Renewal Term, the Lessee shall
pay to the Lessor Fixed-Rate Renewal Basic Rent in semi annual installments
in arrears on each Basic Rent Payment Date during such Fixed-Rate Renewal
Term.

(b) Fair Market Renewal Options. Subject to the notice requirement
set forth in Section 13(a) or 13 (b), as the case may be, and to the
provisions of Section 13(c), provided that no Event of Default or Special
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee shall have the
option to renew the term of this Lease at the end of any Renewal Term for
one or more periods of not less than two (2) years, as determined by the
Lessee in its sole discretion and specified in its notice of renewal (each
such period being herein called a "Fair Market Renewal Term"), provided
that with respect to any period after December 31, 2043, the Lessee may not
renew the Lease Term for a Fair Market Renewal Term (i) if as a result
thereof the Lease Term would extend beyond 80% of the estimated economic
useful life of the Improvements (measured from the beginning of such
Renewal Term) as determined by an Appraisal Procedure at the time of such
renewal or (ii) if the Appraisal Procedure shall have determined that at
the end of such Fair Market Renewal Term there remains less than 20% of the
Fair Market Sales Value of the Improvements as of the beginning of such
Fair Market Renewal Term (determined without regard to inflation or
deflation during such Fair Market Renewal Term); and provided further that
at any time that the foregoing limitations shall cause the Fair Market
Renewal Term to be less than two years, the Lessee shall have the option to
renew this Lease for a Fair Market Renewal Term equal to such shorter
period. On each Basic Rent Payment Date during each Fair Market Renewal
Term, the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor the Fair Market Rental Value of
the Leased Property in semiannual installments in arrears on each Basic
Rent Payment Date during such Fair Market Renewal Term.

SECTION 13. Notices for Renewal; Determination of Fair Market Rental
Value.

(a) Expiration of Basic Term. Not later than 24 months prior to the
expiration date of the Basic Term and provided no Event of Default or
Special Default shall have occurred and be continuing at such time, the
Lessee may give to the Lessor notice of the Lessee's election (i) to return
the Leased Property to the Lessor pursuant to Section 5 or (ii) to exercise
an option to renew this Lease for a Fixed-Rate Renewal Term pursuant to
Section 12(a). Failure of the Lessee to give any such notice shall mean
that the Lessee shall have made the election provided in clause (i).

(b) Expiration of Renewal Terms. Not later than 270 days prior to
the expiration date of any Renewal Term and provided no Event of Default or
Special Default shall have occurred and be continuing at such time, the
Lessee may give to the Lessor notice of the Lessee's election (i) to return
the Leased Property to the Lessor pursuant to Section 5, (ii) provided that
such Renewal Term does not extend beyond twenty-five (25) years following
expiration of the Basic Term, to exercise an option to renew this Lease for
a Fixed-Rate Renewal Term pursuant to Section 12(a) or (iii) to exercise
the option to renew this Lease for a Fair Market Renewal Term pursuant to
Section 12(b). Failure of the Lessee to give any such notice shall mean
that the Lessee shall have made the election provided in clause (i). In
the event that the Lessee elects to extend the Lease Term for a Fixed-Rate
Renewal Term which extends beyond the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
expiration of the Basic Term, the period of such Fixed-Rate Renewal Term up
to and including such twenty-fifth anniversary shall constitute a Fixed-
Rate Renewal Term, and the period after such date shall constitute a Fair
Market Renewal Term.

(c) Elections. Any election made by the Lessee pursuant to Section
13(a) shall be irrevocable by the Lessee, and such election shall be
binding on the Lessor. If Lessee has made the election under Section
13(b), if the Lessee does not wish to accept the Fair Market Rental Value,
Lessee, upon notice to the Lessor delivered not more than thirty (30) days
after the determination of Fair Market Rental Value, shall elect to renew
this Lease for a Fixed-Rate Renewal Term (if the time period for electing
Fixed-Rate Renewal Terms has not expired) rather than a Fair Market Renewal
Term.

(d) Determination of Fair Market Rental Value. If the Lessee shall
give to the Lessor notice of the Lessee's election to renew this Lease for
a Fair Market Renewal Term pursuant to Section 12(b) then, within 30 days
of Lessor's receipt of such notice, the Lessee and the Lessor shall use
reasonable efforts to agree upon the Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased
Property during such Renewal Term. If the Lessee and the Lessor are unable
to agree upon such Fair Market Rental Value, such value shall be determined
by the Appraisal Procedure.

(e) Maximum Term of Lease. In no event shall any Renewal Term extend
beyond December 31, 2070.

SECTION 14. Obsolescence Or Uneconomic Usefulness Termination;
Substitution.

(a) Termination Notices. If, at any time after the first anniversary
of the Basic Term Commencement Date, the Lessee shall have determined in
good faith (such determination to be conclusively evidenced by a
certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Lessee evidencing such
determination) that the Leased Property is obsolete or uneconomic for use
(including, without limitation, by reason of the amount of expenditures
required to comply with Section 8), or surplus to the Lessee's needs the
Lessee shall have the option to terminate this Lease on any Termination
Value Date that is specified by the Lessee (a "Termination Date") in a
notice to the Lessor and the Remainderman (a "Termination Notice") given
not later than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the proposed
Termination Date; provided that no Event of Default or Special Default
shall have occurred and be continuing on the date that the Lessee gives
such Termination Notice; and provided further the Lessee shall be entitled
to rescind any such Termination Notice at any time prior to the date that
is thirty (30) days before the proposed Termination Date, but may not
rescind more than one Termination Notice or any Termination Notice later
than thirty (30) days prior to the proposed Termination Date.

(b) Events Prior to Termination Date. No later than thirty (30) days
following receipt by the Lessor and the Remainderman of the Termination
Notice, the Lessor shall elect, by written notice to the Lessee, (i) to
sell the Lessor's right, title and interest in respect of the Leased
Property to the Lessee free and clear of all Lessor's Liens against payment
by the Lessee of the Termination Value together with all other amounts
payable by the Lessee as set forth below, (ii) to retain ownership of the
Leased Property in lieu of its right to receive payment by the Lessee of
the Termination Value, in which case it shall, as a condition to its right
to retain the Leased Property, deposit with the Indenture Trustee, on or
prior to the third Business Day prior to the Obsolescence Redemption Date,
cash in an amount (or Permitted Investments maturing prior to the
Obsolescence Redemption Date in a principal amount) equal to the unpaid
principal amount of the Related Outstanding Notes, on such Obsolescence
Redemption Date, or (iii) to have the Leased Property sold (by the Lessee
as non-exclusive agent if the Lessor so elects), in which case the Lessee
shall be obligated to pay the excess, if any, of the Termination Value over
the Sales Proceeds retained by the Lessor pursuant to Section 14(c) (iii)
together with all other amounts payable by the Lessee as set forth below.
Should the Lessor elect under clause (i) above, the Lessee shall purchase
the Lessor's right, title and interest in respect of the Leased Property
and the Remainderman's Interest free and clear of all Lessor's Liens and
Remainderman's Liens and the Lien of the Indenture for the amounts
specified in clause (i). Should the Lessor elect under clause (iii) above
the Lessee, as the Lessor's non-exclusive agent, shall use its reasonable
efforts to obtain cash bids for the purchase of the Leased Property. The
Lessor and the Remainderman also shall have the right to obtain such cash
bids, either directly or through agents other than the Lessee. The Lessee
shall certify to the Lessor the amount and terms of each bid received by
the Lessee and the name and address of the Person (who shall not be the
Lessee or any Affiliate or Tax Affiliate of the Lessee) that submitted such
bid within 10 days of receipt of any bid. The Lessor and the Remainderman
shall be under no duty to solicit bids, to inquire into the efforts of the
Lessee to obtain bids or otherwise to take any action in connection with
any such proposed termination of the Lease other than to effect a Transfer
to the Person named in the highest bid among the aggregate of the bids
certified by the Lessee to the Lessor and those obtained by the Lessor
against receipt of the payments provided for in such bid.

(c) Events on Termination Date.

(i) If the Lessor has elected to sell the Lessor's right,
title and interest in respect of the Leased Property to the Lessee
free and clear of all Lessor's Liens and the Lien of the Indenture,
the Lease Term shall, subject to the payment by the Lessee of the
amounts specified in clauses (A) or (B) below, end on the
Termination Date and, subject as aforesaid, all of the Lessee's
obligations hereunder (other than any obligation expressed herein as

Participation Agreement, the amount payable to the Lessor pursuant
to clause (A)(v) above shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
unpaid principal balance of the Related Outstanding Notes.

(ii) If the Lessor has elected to retain ownership of the
Leased Property pursuant to and has otherwise complied with Section
14(b)(ii), the Lease Term shall, subject to the payment by the
Lessee of the amounts specified in clauses (w) through (z) below,
end on the Termination Date and, subject as aforesaid, all of the
Lessee's obligations hereunder (other than any obligation expressed
herein as surviving termination of this Lease) shall thereupon cease

Through Trustee related to such election and the redemption of the
Related Notes, and the amount deposited by the Lessor pursuant to
Section 14(b)(ii) shall, at the Lessee's election, be (A) applied to
the redemption of the Related Outstanding Notes or (B) paid to the
Lessee if the Lessee elects to assume the Related Outstanding Notes
pursuant to Section 9.1 of the Participation Agreement.

(iii) If the Leased Property is to be sold on the Termination
Date to a bidder pursuant to Section 14(b)(iii), the Lessor shall,
on the Termination Date (but only upon receipt of the sale price and
all additional payments specified in the next sentence) effect a
Transfer for cash to the Person that submitted the highest bid prior
to such date (should such a Person exist). The Sale Proceeds shall
be retained by the Lessor and, if applicable, the Remainderman
(subject, however, to the provisions of the Indenture, including the
requirement that on such Termination Date there shall have been paid

unpaid principal amount of the Related Outstanding Notes on the
Obsolescence Redemption Date and all Premiums, if any, and interest
accrued and unpaid on the Related Outstanding Notes as of such
Termination Date and to accrue on the Related Outstanding Notes from
such date to the Obsolescence Redemption Date); provided that if the
Related Outstanding Notes have been exchanged for unsecured, full

exceed the unpaid principal amount of the Related Outstanding Notes
on the Termination Date and the Lessee shall be entitled to the
balance of such Sales Proceeds upon payment of the amounts set forth
in clauses (v), (w), (y) and (z) of the following sentence. In
addition, on such Termination Date, the Lessee shall pay to the
Lessor (or, in the case of Supplemental Rent, to the Person or
Persons entitled thereto) (v) an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of the Termination Value, determined as of such Termination Date,
over the Sale Proceeds allocable to Lessor (except that if the
Related Outstanding Notes have been exchanged for unsecured, full
recourse securities of the Lessee on the Termination Date pursuant
to Section 9.1 of the Participation Agreement and the amount of the
Related Outstanding Notes exceeds the Sales Proceeds allocable to
Lessor, then the Lessee shall only be obligated to pay the Lessor

amount of the Related Outstanding Notes), (w) any accrued but unpaid
Basic Rent due on or prior to such Termination Date, (x) if the

Property in accordance with Section 14(b)(ii) above, to require the
Lessee to purchase the Leased Property under Section 14(b)(i) and
the provisions of Section 14(c)(i) shall become applicable, or to
extend the time during which the Leased Property may be sold
pursuant to Section 14(c)(iii) for an additional one (1) year period

(v) In the event that the Lessee elects to terminate this
Lease pursuant to Section 14(a) and the Lessee purchases the Leased
Property pursuant to Section 14(c)(i), the Lessee covenants that it
will not use the Leased Property in Lessee's Business for a period
of at least five (5) years following the Termination Date.

(d) Substitution. At any time during the Lease Term, provided that
no Event of Default or Special Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, if the Lessee determines in good faith that the Leased Property
shall have become obsolete or uneconomic for use in Lessee's Business or
surplus to the Lessee's needs, or following an Event of Loss as provided in
Section 9(j), the Lessee may give written notice that it intends to provide
to the Lessor and the Remainderman a substitute parcel of real property
consisting of a fee estate, which must be split into an estate for years
and a remainder interest (or, following the Estate for Years Expiration
Date, an interest in land, subject to a ground lease, and an interest in
improvements) (the "Substitute Parcel"), having a fair market value,
utility and useful life at least equal to the fair market value, utility

the Lessor and the Remainderman at the time of the substitution, which will
be substituted for the Property in accordance with the requirements set
forth below.

SECTION 15. Events of Default.

The term "Event of Default," wherever used herein, shall mean any of
the following events (whatever the reason for such event and whether it
shall be voluntary or involuntary, or come about or be effected by
operation of law, or be pursuant to or in compliance with any Applicable
Law or Governmental Action), and any such event shall continue to be an
Event of Default if and for so long as it shall not have been remedied,
cured or waived:

(a) the Lessee shall fail to make, or cause to be made, any payment
of Basic Rent within ten (10) days after the same has become due, or any
payment of Casualty Value or Termination Value within ten (10) days after
the same shall become due;

(b) the Lessee shall fail to make, or cause to be made, any payment

not effective as to the Additional Insureds named therein;

(d) the Lessee shall fail to perform or observe any material covenant
or agreement (other than those referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c)
above) to be performed or observed by it under any Transaction Document
(other than the Tax Indemnification Agreement) to which it is a party, and
such failure shall continue, after the Lessee shall have been given a
written notice by the Lessor or the Indenture Trustee specifying such
failure and requiring it to be remedied, for a period of 60 days (or, if
the same is susceptible of cure but cannot reasonably be cured within such
60 day period, within 360 days of receipt of such notice) so long as any
Lessee is diligently proceeding to remedy such failure;

(e) any representation or warranty made by the Lessee in any
Transaction Document (other than the Tax Indemnification Agreement) to
which it is a party shall prove to have been incorrect in any material
respect when such representation or warranty was made and shall remain
material and materially incorrect at the time in question, unless the fact,
circumstance or condition that is the subject of such representation or
warranty is made true within 60 days after notice thereof shall have been
given by the Lessor or the Indenture Trustee to the Lessee;

(f) the Lessee shall commence a voluntary case or other proceeding
seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to itself
or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or
hereafter in effect, or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver,

(g) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under any of
the Other Leases; and

(h) the Lessee shall have assigned, subleased or otherwise
transferred its right, title and interest in and to this Lease in violation
of Section 11.

SECTION 16. Remedies.

(a) Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and at any
time thereafter so long as the same shall be continuing, the Lessor at its
option may, by notice to the Lessee, declare this Lease to be in default,
and at any time thereafter (unless all Events of Default shall have been
remedied, cured or waived), or if there shall exist an Event of Default
described in Section 15(f), the Lessor may, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, exercise one or more of the following remedies, except as
hereinbelow expressly otherwise set forth, as the Lessor in its sole
discretion shall elect:

(i) The Lessor may terminate the Lessee's right to possession
of the Leased Property by any lawful means, in which case this Lease
and the Lease Term shall terminate and the Lessee shall immediately
surrender possession of the Leased Property to the Lessor. In
addition, and regardless of whether the Lessor shall elect to
terminate the Lessee's right to possession, the Lessor shall be
entitled to recover from the Lessee: (A) the worth at the time of
the award of the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of
termination; (B) the worth at the time of award of the amount of
interest on such unpaid Rent which would have been earned from the
date such unpaid Rent was due and payable until the time of the
award; (C) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the
unpaid Rent for the balance of the term after the time of award
exceeds the portion of such Rental loss that the Lessee proves could
be reasonably avoided; and (D) any other amount necessary to
compensate the Lessor for all the detriment proximately caused by
the Lessee's failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or
which would be likely to result therefrom. The worth at the time of
the award of the amounts referred to in clauses (A) and (B) shall be
computed by allowing interest as specified in the Lease. The worth
at the time of award of the amount referred to in clause (C) shall
be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one
percent (1%). Efforts by the Lessor to mitigate damages caused by
the Lessee's Default or breach of this Lease shall not waive the
Lessor's right to recover damages under this paragraph. If
termination of this Lease is obtained through the provisional remedy
of unlawful detainer, the Lessor shall have the right to recover in
such proceeding the unpaid Interim Rent, Basic Rent and Supplemental
Rent, together with such damages as are recoverable therein, or the
Lessor may reserve therein the right to recover all or any part
thereof in a separate suit for such Rent and/or damages.

(ii) The Lessor may sell the Leased Property or any part
thereof, together with any interest of the Lessor under the Deed
(subject to the rights of the Remainderman contained in the Option
Agreement and subject to any sublease entered into under Section
11(b)(iv) of this Lease), at public or private sale, conducted in
accordance with Applicable Law, as the Lessor may determine, free
and clear of any rights of the Lessee therein and without any duty
to account to the Lessee with respect to such sale or for the
proceeds thereof (except to the extent required by clause (v) below
if the Lessor shall elect to exercise its rights thereunder), in
which event the Lessee's obligation to pay Basic Rent with respect
to the Leased Property or the part thereof that has been sold, as
the case may be, for periods commencing after the date of such sale
shall terminate (except to the extent that Basic Rent is to be
included in computations under clause (v) below if the Lessor shall
elect to exercise its rights thereunder);

(iii) The Lessor may continue the Lease and the Lessee's right
to possession in effect (under California Civil Code Section 1951.4)
after the Lessee's breach and abandonment and recover the Rent as it
becomes due, provided the Lessee has the right to sublet or assign,
subject only to reasonable limitations. Sections 11(a) and (b)
hereof set forth the limitations of the Lessee's right to sublet or
assign, which limitations the Lessee and the Lessor agree are
reasonable. Acts of maintenance or preservation, efforts to relet
the Leased Property or the appointment of a receiver to protect the
Lessor's interest under the Lease, shall not constitute a
termination of the Lessee's right to possession.

(iv) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

(v) Unless the Lessor shall have sold the Leased Property
pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Lessor may, whether or not the
Lessor shall have exercised or shall thereafter at any time exercise
its rights under clause (i), (iii) or (vii) of this Section 16(a) by
notice to the Lessee specifying a payment date, which shall be a
Casualty Value Date that is not sooner than the 30th day after the
date of such notice, demand that the Lessee pay to the Lessor, and
the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor, on the payment date specified in
such notice, (A) as liquidated damages for loss of bargain and not
as a penalty (in lieu of the Basic Rent due after the payment date
specified in such notice) and (B) in the case of a payment pursuant
to Section 16(a) (v) (D), as consideration for the obligation to
Transfer the Leased Property to the Lessee and to surrender the
Leased Property, any unpaid Rent due as of the payment date
specified in the notice and, in the case of a payment pursuant to
Section 16(a)(v)(D), if the Fair Market Sales Value is greater than
Casualty Value, a pro rata portion of Basic Rent accruing from the
last Basic Rent Payment Date to the payment date specified in the
notice (in each case other than Basic Rent to be paid in advance
payable on or before such payment date relating to any period after
such payment date if the Lessor shall have received an amount equal
to Fair Market Sales Value of the Leased Property pursuant to
Section 16(a) (v) (D)), plus whichever of the following amounts the
Lessor, in its sole discretion, shall specify in such notice
(together with interest on such amount at the Overdue Interest Rate
from the payment date specified in such notice to the date of actual
payment):

(A) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1)
Casualty Value, computed as of the payment date specified in
such notice, over (2) the Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased
Property (determined in an Appraisal Procedure on the basis of
the then actual condition of the Leased Property) for the
remainder of the Lease Term after discounting such Fair Market
Rental Value semiannually to present value as of the payment
date specified in such notice at 7.9%;

(B) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) such
Casualty Value over (2) the Fair Market Sales Value of the
Leased Property (determined in an Appraisal Procedure on the
basis of the then actual condition of the Leased Property) as of
the payment date specified in such notice;

(C) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the
present value as of the payment date specified in such notice of
all installments of Basic Rent until the end of the Basic Term
or the then current Renewal Term, as the case may be, discounted
semiannually at 7.9%, over (2) the present value as of such
payment date of the Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased
Property (determined in an Appraisal Procedure on the basis of
the then actual condition of the Leased Property) until the end
of the Basic Term or such Renewal Term, as the case may be,
discounted semiannually at 7.9%; or

(D) an amount equal to the higher of such Casualty
Value or Fair Market Sales Value of the Leased Property
(determined in an Appraisal Procedure on the basis of the actual
condition of the Leased Property) as of the payment date
specified in such notice;

Upon payment by any Lessee of all amounts payable by it under
Section 16(a)(v) (D) and under the other Transaction Documents, the
Lessor shall effect a Transfer to the Lessee and the Lease Term
shall end and all the Lessee's obligations hereunder (other than any
obligation expressed herein as surviving termination of this Lease)
shall cease;

(vi) If the Lessor shall have sold the Leased Property or any
part thereof pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Lessor, if it shall
so elect by notice to the Lessee, may demand that the Lessee pay to
the Lessor, and the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor, on the date of
such sale, as liquidated damages for loss of bargain and not as a
penalty (in lieu of Basic Rent due for periods commencing after the
next Casualty Value Date following the date of such sale), any
unpaid Rent due as of the next Casualty Value Date following the
date of such sale, plus the amount of any deficiency between the
Sale Proceeds and Casualty Value, computed as of such Casualty Value
Date, together with interest at the Overdue Interest Rate on the
amount of such Rent and such deficiency from the date of such sale
until the date of actual payment;

(vii) In the event the Lessor rescinds or terminates this Lease,
(A) no reletting, reentry or taking of possession of the Leased
Property by the Lessor will be construed as an election on the
Lessor's part to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of
such intention is given to the Lessee, (B) notwithstanding any
reletting, reentry or taking of possession, the Lessor may at any
time thereafter elect to terminate this Lease for a continuing Event
of Default and (C) no act or thing done by the Lessor or any of its
agents, representatives or employees shall be deemed an acceptance
of a surrender of the Leased Property, and no agreement accepting a
surrender of the Leased Property shall be valid unless the same be
made in writing and be executed by the Lessor;

(viii) The Lessor may, as a matter of right and without notice
to Lessee or anyone claiming under the Lessee, apply to any court
having jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or receivers of the Leased
Property, and the Lessee hereby irrevocably consents to such
appointment and waives notice of any application therefor. Any such
receiver or receivers shall have all the usual powers and duties of
receivers in like or similar cases, including, without limitation,
the right to collect rents, and the right to perform any acts which
it deems necessary or desirable to preserve the value, marketability
or rentability of the Leased Property, or part thereof or interest
therein;

(ix) The Lessor may exercise any other right or remedy that may
be available to it under Applicable Law or proceed by appropriate
court action to enforce the terms hereof or to recover damages for
the breach hereof; and

(x) The Lessee hereby acknowledges that an Event of Default
hereunder will cause Lessor to suffer damages not contemplated by
this Lease or the parties hereto, the exact amount of which will be
impracticable or extremely difficult to ascertain. Such damages
include, but are not limited to, the loss of profit occasioned as a
result of the unique nature of this Lease, and the consequences of
default under the Indenture. Accordingly, upon the occurrence of
any Event of Default, the parties hereby agree that the payment of
liquidated damages under Sections 16(a)(v) and (vi) represent a fair
and reasonable estimate of the damages the Lessor will suffer by
reason of the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder.

(b) No Release. Except as otherwise provided in Section 16(a), no
rescission or termination of this Lease, in whole or in part, or
repossession of the Leased Property or exercise of any remedy under Section
16(a) shall relieve the Lessee of any of its obligations under this Lease.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 16(a), the Lessee shall be liable
for any and all unpaid Rent due hereunder before, after or during the
exercise of any of the foregoing remedies, including all reasonable legal
fees and other reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Lessor by
reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default or the exercise of the
Lessor's remedies with respect thereto. At any sale of the Leased Property
or any part thereof pursuant to this Section, the Indenture Trustee may bid
for and purchase such property.

(c) Remedies Cumulative. Except as expressly set forth therein, no
remedy under Section 16(a) is intended to be exclusive, but each shall be
cumulative and in addition to any other remedy provided thereunder or
otherwise available to the Lessor at law or in equity. No express or
implied waiver by the Lessor of any Default or Event of Default hereunder
shall in any way be, or be construed to be, a waiver of any future or
subsequent Default or Event of Default. The failure or delay of the Lessor
in exercising any right granted it hereunder upon any occurrence of any of
the contingencies set forth herein shall not constitute a waiver of any
such right upon the continuation or recurrence of any such contingency or
similar contingencies and any single or partial exercise of any particular
right by the Lessor shall not exhaust the same or constitute a waiver of
any other right provided herein. To the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the Lessee hereby waives any right now or hereafter conferred by
statute or otherwise that may limit or modify any of the Lessor's rights
and remedies provided in this Section 16.

(d) Allocation of Basic Rent. If, for the purpose of Section 16(a)
(ii), it shall become necessary to allocate a portion of the Basic Rent
payable hereunder to any part of the Leased Property, such allocation shall
be in the same proportion as the original cost of such part bears to
Lessor's Cost.

SECTION 17. Notices.

Except as otherwise provided herein, all communications,
declarations, demands and notices provided for in this Lease shall be given
or made in the manner set forth in Section 13.1 of the Participation
Agreement. So long as any Notes remain Outstanding, the Lessee shall give
the Indenture Trustee copies of any notices required to be given to the
Lessor.

SECTION 18. Successors and Assigns.

This Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Lessor and the Lessee and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

SECTION 19. Right To Perform for Lessee.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, if an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Owner Participant or the Lessor
may, but shall not be obligated to, to the extent not prohibited by
Applicable Law, itself make any such payment or perform or comply with any
such agreement as the Lessee shall be obligated to pay, perform or comply
with under this Lease, and the amount of such payment and the amount of the
reasonable expenses of the Owner Participant or the Lessor incurred in
connection with such payment or the performance or compliance with such
agreement, as the case may be, together with interest thereon at the Equity
Interest Rate, shall be deemed Supplemental Rent, payable by the Lessee
upon demand. The Owner Participant or the Lessor shall give the Lessee at
least two Business Days' notice before taking any action in accordance with
the preceding sentence, provided that the failure to give such notice shall
have no effect upon any of the rights of the Owner Participant or the
Lessor thereunder.

SECTION 20. Granting of Easements.

If no Event of Default hereunder has occurred and is continuing,
subject to the limitation set forth in Article 12 of the Indenture, the
Lessor will join with the Lessee, from time to time at the request of the
Lessee (and at the Lessee's sole cost and expense), with respect to their
interests in the Leased Property to (i) grant, in the ordinary course of
the Lessee's business or in furtherance of the Development Plan (as
hereafter defined), easements, restrictions, covenants, licenses, rights of
way and other rights and privileges in the nature of the foregoing, (ii)
amend or release, in the ordinary course of the Lessee's business or in
furtherance of the Development Plan, existing easements and appurtenances
which benefit or burden the Leased Property, (iii) dedicate or transfer
portions of the Leased Property for road, highway or other public purposes,
(iv) execute, amend, release and deliver restrictive covenants and
restrictions and any amendments thereto in the ordinary course the Lessee's
business or in furtherance of the Development Plan for the benefit of the
Lessee's business as operated on the Leased Property which establish
certain exclusive use rights burdening adjacent properties and which burden
the Leased Property and/or establish common area rights and obligations
benefiting and burdening the Leased Property, or (v) execute and deliver
any instrument, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Lessor,
necessary or appropriate to make or confirm such grants easements,
restrictions, releases, dedications, transfers or amendments to any person,
with or without consideration; provided, however, that the Lessor shall not
be required to take any such action, or grant, release, dedication,
transfer or amendment, unless the Lessor shall have received a certificate
of an authorized officer of the Lessee (and said certificate shall be true)
stating that (x) such grant or release was granted in the ordinary course
of the Lessee's business or in furtherance of the Development Plan does not
interfere with and is not detrimental to the conduct of the Lessee's
business on the Leased Property as contemplated and permitted hereby and
does not impair the usefulness of the Leased Property for the purposes
contemplated and permitted hereby or reduce the Fair Market Sales Value,
utility or remaining useful life of the Leased Property or impair Lessor's,
Indenture Trustee's or any other Indemnitee's interest in the Leased
Property (except in the case of a grant or release in furtherance of the
Development Plan, to an immaterial extent; and otherwise in each case, to
an insignificant extent) or cause the Leased Property to be characterized
as limited use property (as described in Section 4.09 of the Revenue
Procedure 75-28 or Revenue Procedure 76-30), (y) the consideration, if any,
being paid for said grant, release, dedication, transfer or amendment or
other such instruments described in this Section 20, is paid to the Lessee,
and (z) a duly authorized and binding undertaking is provided by the
Lessee, in form and substance satisfactory to the Lessor, to remain
obligated under this Lease and under any instrument executed by the Lessee
consenting to the assignment of the Lessor's interest in this Lease as
security for indebtedness, as though such grant, release, dedication,
transfer or amendment had not occurred and to perform all obligations of
the grantor or party effecting the release under such instrument of grant
or release during the Lease Term.

In connection with this Section 20, if applicable, the Lessee and the
Lessor have attached to this Lease Exhibit C, which sets forth the Lessee's
proposed development plan for certain portions of the Leased Property (the
"Development Plan"). The Lessor agrees that the Lessor and the
Remainderman shall not be entitled to any compensation relating to their
review, consent, execution and delivery of any instruments described in
this Section 20, which relate to the Development Plan.

SECTION 21. Amendments and Miscellaneous.

(a) Amendments in Writing. The provisions of this Lease may not be
waived, altered, modified, amended, supplemented or terminated in any
manner whatsoever except by written instrument signed by the Lessor and the
Lessee or, in the case of a waiver, the party against whom enforcement of
the waiver is sought. It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto
that any waiver, alteration, modification, amendment, supplement or
termination of this Lease that requires the consent of the Indenture
Trustee, all the Noteholders or a Majority in Interest of Noteholders (in
each case as provided in the Indenture) shall not be effective unless and

(c) Severability of Provisions. Any provision of this Lease that may
be determined by competent authority to be prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction, as to such jurisdiction, shall not be effective to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability
in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

(d) True Lease. This Lease is intended as, and shall constitute, an

Default caused by an Event of Default under the Related Lease, the Owner
Trustee at all times shall be entitled on a non-exclusive basis with the
Indenture Trustee to (i) enforce any covenant or obligation (including
obligations in respect of the payment of Rent) of the Lessee under the
Related Lease; provided, that in so enforcing any such covenant, the Owner

without the consent of any of the Noteholders, at any time and from time to
time, the respective parties to the Transaction Documents may modify, amend

or the Related Supplemental Indenture) for the purpose of adding any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the
provisions thereof or modifying in any manner the rights of the respective
parties thereunder or may give any consent or waiver thereunder; provided,
however, that no such modification, amendment, supplement, consent or
waiver shall without the consent of each Noteholder affected thereby,
modify, amend or supplement, or give any consent in respect of or waive any
provision of, the Related Lease in such manner (i) as to reduce the amounts
payable by the Lessee under the Related Lease assigned to the Indenture
Trustee, or change the time for the payment thereof, so that such payments
are less than the amounts necessary to pay the principal of, Premium, if
any, and interest on the Outstanding Related Notes when due (whether at
maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise) or (ii) as would release the
Lessee from its obligation in respect of payment of Basic Rent, Casualty
Value, Termination Value or any other amount payable under the Related
Lease and intended to be used to pay the principal of, Premium, if any, or
interest on the Related Notes, in any manner inconsistent with clause (i)

In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or
covered by, an opinion of any specified Person, it is not necessary that
all such matters be certified by, or covered by, only one document, but one
such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and
one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may
certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.

Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Owner Trustee may
be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or
opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer actually
knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to
the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous.
Any such certificate or opinion may be based, insofar as it relates to
factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by,
an officer or officers of the Owner Trustee stating that the information
with respect to such factual matters is in possession of the Owner Trustee,
unless such counsel actually knows. that the certificate or opinion or
representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.

Any Opinion of Counsel stated to be based on the opinion of other
counsel shall be accompanied by a copy of such other opinion.

Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more
applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or
other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be
consolidated and form one instrument.

SECTION 1.4 Acts of Noteholders; Record Dates.

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or
taken by Noteholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more
instruments of substantially similar tenor, signed by such Noteholders in
person or by an agent duly appointed in writing and, except as herein
otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such
instrument or instruments are delivered to the Indenture Trustee and, where
it is hereby expressly required, to the Owner Trustee and the Lessee. Such
instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced
thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Noteholders
signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such
instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient
for any purpose of this Indenture, and subject to Section 9.1, conclusive
in favor of the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, if made in the
manner provided in this Section 1.4.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any
such instrument or writing may be proved (1) by the certificate of any
notary public or other officer of any jurisdiction authorized to take
acknowledgments of deeds or administer oaths that the Person executing such
instrument acknowledged to him the execution thereof; (2) by a notarized
affidavit of a witness to such execution; or (3) by having the signature
guaranteed by an "eligible guarantor institution", as that term is defined
in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Securities Exchange Act. The fact and date of
the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the
Person executing the same, may also be proved in any such manner which the
Indenture Trustee deems sufficient,and where such execution is by an
officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership on
behalf of such corporation, association or partnership, such certificate or
affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.

(c) The ownership of Notes shall be proved by the Note
Register.

(d) The Owner Trustee may fix any date as the record date
for the purpose of determining the Noteholders entitled to give or take any
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
action, or to vote on any action, authorized or permitted to be given or
taken by Noteholders, which date shall be no more than 60 days before the
first solicitation of a Noteholder made by any Person with respect to any
such action. If not set by the Owner Trustee prior to the first
solicitation of a Noteholder made by any Person with respect to any such
action or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, the record
date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day (or, if later, the
date of the most recent list of Noteholders required to be provided
pursuant to Section 10.1) prior to the first solicitation or vote, as the
case may be. With regard to any record date, only the Noteholders on such
date (or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give or take,
or vote on, the relevant action.

(e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other action by any Noteholder shall bind every other
holder of a Note issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange therefor
or in lieu thereof, whether or not notation of such action is made upon
such Note.

(f) Without limiting the foregoing, a Noteholder entitled
hereunder to give or take any such action with regard to any particular
Note may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of
such Note or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so
pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any different part of
such principal amount.

SECTION 1.5 Requests etc. to Indenture Trustee, Lessee, Owner
Trustee and Owner Participant. Any request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Noteholders or other document
provided for or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or

in writing and delivered in person or by courier or mailed, first-class
postage prepaid (in the absence of a mail strike or other disruption of the
mail) or transmitted by means of telecopy or other wire transmission (with
request for assurance of receipt in a manner typical with respect to
communications of that type) to:

the originator thereof has already done so), and whenever the Indenture
Trustee shall send any notice, report, certificate, opinion or other

send copies thereof to each of the other parties named above.

SECTION 1.6 Notices to Noteholders; Waiver. Where this
Indenture provides for notice to Noteholders of any event, such notice
shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if
in writing and mailed first-class postage prepaid, to each Noteholder, at
such Person's address as it appears in the Note Register, not later than
the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the
giving of such notice. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any
manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to
receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver
shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Noteholders
shall be filed with the Indenture Trustee, but such filing shall not be a
condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon
such waiver.

In any case where notice to Noteholders is given by mail, neither
the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to
any particular Noteholder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with
respect to other Noteholders, and any notice which is mailed in the manner
herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given.

SECTION 1.7 Effect of Headings and Table of Contents. The
Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

SECTION 1.8 Successors and Assigns. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties in this Indenture by the Indenture Trustee
and the Owner Trustee shall bind and, to the extent permitted hereby, shall
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by their respective successors
and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

SECTION 1.9 Separability Clause. In case any provision in this
Indenture or in the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

SECTION 1.10 Benefits of Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture or
in the Notes, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the
parties hereto and their successors and assigns hereunder, the Owner
Participant and its successors and permitted assigns and the Noteholders,
any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under this Indenture.

AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT
REFERENCE TO THE CHOICE OF LAW DOCTRINE OF SUCH STATE.

SECTION 1.12 Legal Holidays. Unless otherwise provided with
respect to a specific series of Notes, in any case where any Installment
Payment Date, Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date or the Stated
Maturity of any Note, or any date on which any Defaulted Installment or
Defaulted Interest is proposed to be paid, shall not be a Business Day,
then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture) payment of
interest or principal, and Premium, if any, need not be made on such date,
and if not made on such date shall instead be made on the next succeeding
Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Installment
Payment Date, Interest Payment Date, or Redemption Date or at the Stated
Maturity of such Note, or on the date on which the Defaulted Interest is
proposed to be paid, and, provided that such payment is so made on such
next succeeding Business Day, no interest shall accrue for the period from
and after such Installment Payment Date, Interest Payment Date, Redemption
Date or Stated Maturity, or date for the payment of any Defaulted
Installment or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, to and including
such next succeeding Business Day.

SECTION 1.13 No Recourse Against Others. No director, officer,
employee or stockholder, as such, of the Remainderman Participant, the

any obligations of the Owner Trustee under this Indenture or for any claim
based on, or in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their

ARTICLE 2

THE NOTES

SECTION 2.1 Issuable in Series; Designations. The Notes shall
be issuable hereunder in one or more series and with such designations as
are specified in a Supplemental Indenture, including as contemplated by
Section 2.13 and Article 7. Subject to Section 2.13 and Article 7, the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be authenticated and
delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.

SECTION 2.2 Form and Denomination. The form of the Notes of any
series shall be established by or pursuant to the authority granted in the
Supplemental Indenture creating such series. The Notes of any series shall
be numbered, lettered or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in
accordance with such plans as the officers of the Owner Trustee executing
the same may determine with the approval of the Indenture Trustee.

Any Notes of any series may be issued with appropriate
insertions, omissions, substitutions or variations, and may have imprinted
or otherwise reproduced thereon such legend or legends, not inconsistent
with the provisions of this Indenture, as may be required to comply with
any law or with any rules or regulations pursuant thereto, or with the
rules of any securities market in which the Notes of such series are
admitted to trading, or to conform to general usage.

The Notes of each series shall be issued only in registered form
in the denomination of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof, unless
otherwise provided in the Supplemental Indenture creating such series.

SECTION 2.3 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

SECTION 2.4 Execution of Notes. The Notes shall be executed on
behalf of the Owner Trustee by any of its authorized officers and attested
by any of its authorized officers but the same officer shall not execute
and attest the same Note. The signature of any of such authorized officers
on the Notes may be manual or facsimile. The Owner Trustee's seal shall be
reproduced on the Notes.

Notes bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals
who were at any time the proper officers of the Owner Trustee shall bind
the Owner Trustee, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them
have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery
of such Notes or did not hold such offices at the date of execution of this
Indenture.

SECTION 2.5 Temporary Notes. Pending the preparation of
definitive Notes, the Owner Trustee may execute, and upon the written order
of the Owner Trustee signed by a Responsible Officer, the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Notes which are printed,
lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any
denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Notes in lieu of
which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions,
substitutions and other variations as may be appropriate for temporary
Notes, all as may be determined by the officers executing such Notes with
the concurrence of the Indenture Trustee.

If temporary Notes of any series are issued, definitive Notes of
such series will be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the
preparation of definitive Notes, the temporary Notes held by any Noteholder
shall be exchangeable for definitive Notes upon surrender of the temporary
Notes at any office or agency to be maintained for such purpose pursuant to
Section 5.3, without charge to such Noteholder. Upon surrender or
cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Owner Trustee shall
execute and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in
exchange there for a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes of
the same series with the same interest rate and Stated Maturity in
authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Notes shall in
all respects be entitled to the same security and benefits under this
Indenture as definitive Notes.

SECTION 2.6 Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
The Owner Trustee shall cause to be kept at the designated office of the
Note Registrar a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations
as the Indenture Trustee may prescribe, the Owner Trustee shall provide for
the registration of Notes and of transfers and exchanges of Notes. This
register is herein sometimes referred to as the "Note Register."

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note at the
designated office of the Note Registrar, or at any office or agency
maintained for such purpose pursuant to a Section 5.3, the Owner Trustee
shall execute and register, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one
or more new Notes of the same series with the same interest rate and Stated
Maturity as the Notes so to be transferred for a like aggregate principal
amount, in any authorized denominations and bearing numbers not
contemporaneously outstanding.

At the option of any Noteholder, Notes may be exchanged for an
equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of the same series with the same
interest rate and Stated Maturity as the Notes so to be exchanged and in
any authorized denominations, upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged
at such designated office, or at any other office or agency maintained for
such purpose pursuant to Section 5.3. Whenever any Notes are so
surrendered for exchange, the Owner Trustee shall execute, and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Notes which the
Noteholder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

All Notes issued upon registration of transfer or exchange of
Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Owner Trustee, evidencing the
same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered
upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer
or exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Note Registrar duly
executed by the Noteholder thereof or his attorney thereunto duly
authorized in writing.

Unless otherwise provided as a term of a series of Notes, no
service charge shall be required of any Noteholder with respect to any
transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Note Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of
Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to any of Section 2.5, 6.7 or 11.5 not
involving any transfer.

The Owner Trustee shall not be required to issue and the Note
Registrar shall not be required (i) to register the transfer of or exchange
any Note of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business
15 days before the date of the first mailing of a notice of redemption of
Notes of such series and ending at the close of business on the day of
first mailing of such notice or (ii) to register the transfer of or
exchange any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part except the
unredeemed portion of any Note selected for redemption in part.

SECTION 2.7 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Notes. Upon
receipt by the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee of evidence
satisfactory to them of the theft, loss, destruction or mutilation of any
Outstanding Note, and (in the case of any such theft, loss or destruction)
of indemnity satisfactory to them, and upon payment, if the Owner Trustee
or the Indenture Trustee shall require it, of a reasonable charge and upon
reimbursement to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee of all
reasonable expenses incident thereto, and upon surrender and cancellation
of such Note, if mutilated, the Owner Trustee may execute, and the
Indenture Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Note of
like tenor and of the same series with the same interest rate and Stated
Maturity in lieu of such stolen, lost, destroyed or mutilated Note, or if
any such Note shall have matured or be about to mature, instead of issuing
a substituted Note the Owner Trustee may pay the same without surrender
thereof. Any indemnity bond shall name as obligees the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee, and if requested by the Owner Trustee, any Paying Agent.

SECTION 2.8 Payment of Interest and Principal. The Person in
whose name any Note is registered at the close of business on any Record
Date with respect to the immediately succeeding Installment Payment Date of
such Note shall be entitled to receive the Installment Payment Amount, if
any, or interest payable on such Installment Payment Date notwithstanding
any registration of transfer or exchange of such Note subsequent to such
Record Date and on or prior to such Installment Payment Date, except if and
to the extent the Owner Trustee shall default in the payment of such
Installment Payment Amount or the interest due on such Installment Payment
Date, in which case such defaulted installment ("Defaulted Installment") or
defaulted interest (the "Defaulted Interest") shall be paid to the Persons
in whose names Outstanding Notes of the applicable series are registered at
the close of business on a subsequent Record Date (which shall be not less
than 10 Business Days prior to the date of payment of such Defaulted
Installment or Defaulted Interest) established by notice given by mail by
the Indenture Trustee to the Noteholders of such series not less than 15
days preceding such subsequent Record Date after receipt of an amount of
money at least equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect
of such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest or arrangements
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee have been made for such payment. The
term "Record Date" as used with respect to any Installment Payment Date or
Series J Interest Payment Date, as the case may be, except a date for
payment of Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest, shall mean the date
specified as such in the Supplemental Indenture providing for the creation
of such series.

Unless otherwise provided with respect to a particular series of
Notes, interest on the Notes shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year consisting of 12 30-day months.

Subject to Articles 6 and 7, the principal of any particular
series of Notes may be payable either in full at Stated Maturity or in
installments on such dates and in such amounts as provided by the Related
Supplemental Indenture. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable
Supplemental Indenture with respect to a series of Notes, principal of and
Premium, if any, on the Notes payable at Stated Maturity shall be payable
to the Noteholders of such Notes upon presentation and surrender of such
Notes at the office or agency for the payment of Notes maintained for such
purpose pursuant to Section 5.3. Except as otherwise provided in the
applicable Supplemental Indenture with respect to a series of Notes,
interest or installments of principal other than installments due at
maturity on the Notes shall be paid on the applicable Installment Payment
Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Paying Agent
and mailed to the registered addresses of the Noteholders as they shall
appear on the Note Register as of the Record Date preceding such Interest
Payment Date. Payment as aforesaid shall be made in such coin or currency
of the United States of America as, at the respective times of payment,
shall be legal tender for the payment of public and a private debts.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.8, the
Owner Trustee may make, or cause to be made, payment of any Defaulted
Installment or Defaulted
Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements
of any securities exchange on which the Notes in respect of which
installments of principal or interest is in default may be listed, and upon
such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by
the Owner Trustee to the Indenture Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant
to this paragraph, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by
the Indenture Trustee.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.8, each
Note delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in
exchange for or in replacement of any other Note shall carry the rights to
interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue interest, which were carried by
such other Note, and each such Note shall bear interest from whatever date
shall be necessary so that neither gain nor loss in interest shall result
from such registration of transfer, exchange or replacement.

SECTION 2.9 Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment for
registration of transfer, the Person in whose name any Note is registered
on the Note Register shall be deemed to be the absolute owner of such Note
for the purpose of receiving payment of principal (including, subject to
the provisions of Section 2.8 regarding the applicable record dates,
Installment Payment Amounts) of, Premium, if any, and (subject to Section
2.8) interest on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether
or not such Note be overdue, regardless of any notice to anyone to the
contrary.

SECTION 2.10 Cancellation. All Notes surrendered for payment,
redemption, or registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered
to any Person other than the Indenture Trustee, be delivered to the
Indenture Trustee for cancellation. The Owner Trustee may at any time
deliver to the Indenture Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Owner Trustee may have
acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall be
promptly canceled by the Indenture Trustee. No Notes shall be authenticated
in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes canceled as provided in this
Section 2.10, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All
canceled Notes held by the Indenture Trustee shall be destroyed and
certification of their destruction delivered to the Owner Trustee unless,
by Owner Trustee Request, the Owner Trustee otherwise directs.

SECTION 2.11 Authentication, Execution Delivery, and Dating of
Notes. From time to time after the execution and delivery of this
Indenture, series of Notes may be issued pursuant to Section 2.13. Unless
otherwise specifically provided with respect to a series of Notes, Notes
shall be dated as of the date of their authentication. No Note shall be
entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for
any purpose unless there appears on such Note a certificate of
authentication in the form provided for in the Supplemental Indenture
creating the Notes of such series, executed by the Indenture Trustee by the
manual or facsimile signature of one of its authorized officers or
signatories, and such certificate upon any Note shall be conclusive
evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note has been duly authenticated
and delivered hereunder.

SECTION 2.12 Source of Payments; Rights and Liabilities of Owner
Trustee; Owner Participant Not Liable. All payments of principal of,
Premium, if any, and interest on a particular series of Notes, and any
other amounts due with respect to such series of Notes, shall be made only
from assets subject to or intended to be subject to the lien of the Related
Supplemental Indenture, the income and proceeds received by the Indenture
Trustee therefrom and all payments of principal, Premium, if any, and
interest, and any other amounts due with respect to such series of Notes,
shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section 2.8 and Article 4.
The Indenture Trustee agrees, and each Noteholder, by its acceptance of a
Note, shall be deemed to agree (a) that they will look solely to the assets
subject to or intended to be subject to the lien of the Related
Supplemental Indenture, the income and proceeds received by the Indenture
Trustee therefrom to the extent a available for distribution to such
Noteholder as herein provided and (b) that neither the Owner Participant
nor, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Owner Trustee in
its individual capacity is liable to any Noteholder or to the Indenture
Trustee for any amounts payable under any Note or this Indenture.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, except as set
forth in the following proviso: (i) all and each of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein made on the part of the Owner
Trustee are made and intended not as personal representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements by the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity or
for the purpose or with the intention of binding it personally but are made
and intended for the purpose of binding only the Related Indenture Estate,
and this Indenture and the Notes are executed and delivered by the Owner
Trustee solely in the exercise of the powers expressly conferred upon it as
trustee under the Trust Agreement; and (ii) no personal liability or
responsibility is assumed hereunder or under the Notes by or shall at any
time be enforceable against the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity or
the Owner Participant on account of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement hereunder of the Owner Trustee, either express or implied, all
such personal liability, if any, being expressly waived by the Indenture
Trustee and (by its acceptance of a Note) deemed to have been waived by
each Noteholder and by all Persons claiming by, through or under such
Noteholder; provided, however, that the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity shall be liable hereunder (a) for the performance of its
agreements made in such capacity under Section 6.3 of the Participation
Agreement, (b) in the case of the inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty on the part of the Owner Trustee made in its individual capacity
contained in Section 5.3 of the Participation Agreement and (c) for its own
willful misconduct or gross negligence. If a successor Owner Trustee is
appointed in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, such
successor Owner Trustee shall, without any further act, succeed to all the
rights, duties, immunities and obligations hereunder, and its predecessor
Owner Trustee in its individual capacity and as the Owner Trustee shall be
released from all further duties and obligations hereunder and under each
other Transaction Document, without prejudice to any claims against such
predecessor Owner Trustee in its individual capacity or as the Owner
Trustee for any default by such predecessor Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity or as the Owner Trustee, respectively, in the performance of its
obligations hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents to which it
is a party prior to such appointment or for any inaccuracies in warranties,
willful misconduct or gross negligence during the term of such predecessor
Owner Trustee.

SECTION 2.13 Series of Notes. Subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the requirements of Section 2.4, 2.5 or 2.6 of the Participation
Agreement or Section 8(f) of the Related Lease, as the case may be, the
Owner Trustee shall have the right from time to time to issue Notes to
provide (a) a portion of the Lessor Purchase Price for the Related Lessor
Interest, (b) sufficient funds to redeem the principal amount of Related
Notes of any series theretofore authenticated and delivered hereunder, (c)
sufficient funds to redeem any Outstanding Series J Notes or (d) all or a
portion of the amount necessary to finance any Modification. The terms,
conditions, designations and maximum aggregate principal amount of each
series of such Notes (to the extent not inconsistent with this Indenture)
shall be set forth in the case of clause (a), (b) or (c), in a Supplemental
Indenture and, in the case of clause (d), in an amendment to the Related
Supplemental Indenture, in each case executed by the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee; provided that (i) no Premium or penalty shall be payable
as a result of (a) the redemption of such Notes occurring as a result of an
Event of Loss, (b) the payment of such Notes after the declaration of
acceleration of such Notes or in connection with the occurrence of an
Indenture Event of Default or (c) the refinancing of any Notes pursuant to
Section 2.6 of the Participation Agreement and (ii) the Installment Payment
Dates or Series J Interest Payment Dates, as the case may be, and the
Record Dates for all Notes shall not differ. The Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver all Notes in accordance with the provisions of the
Related Supplemental Indenture upon receipt by the Indenture Trustee of the
following documents:

(i) a copy of such Supplemental Indenture and the
certificates representing such Notes together with an Owner
Trustee Request that the Indenture Trustee execute such
Supplemental Indenture and authenticate such Notes;

(ii) an Officers' Certificate of each of the Owner
Trustee and the Owner Participant stating that no Indenture Event
of Default attributable to it has occurred and is continuing;

(iii) an Officers' Certificate of the Owner Trustee
stating that the requirements of the Participation Agreement and
the Related Lease, as appropriate, for the issuance of such Notes
have been met or waived;

(iv) an Officers' Certificate of the Lessee stating that
no Event of Default or Special Default has occurred and is
continuing;

(v) an Officers' Certificate of each of the Lessee and
the Owner Trustee and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all
requirements for, and conditions precedent to, the issuance of
such Notes under this Indenture and the related Supplemental
Indenture have been complied with;

(vi) so long as the Pass Through Trust holds any Notes,
if such Supplemental Indenture provides for the issuance of
Additional Notes, an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Pass Through Trustee to the effect that the issuance of
such Additional Notes does not cause, nor can it be reasonably
foreseen to cause, any Pass Through Trust to become an
"investment company," as defined in the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended; and

(vii) such additional information, documents,
certificates and opinions as shall be reasonably requested by the
Indenture Trustee.

SECTION 2.14 Legends. Unless sold pursuant to an effective
Registration Statement under the Securities Act, all Notes issued hereunder
shall bear the following
legend:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD
OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR
AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM UNDER SAID ACT.

Prior to any transfer of any Note bearing such legend, in whole
or in part (other than pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act, or a sale or other disposition made pursuant to
Rule 144 or 144A (or any successor rules) of such Act), the Noteholder
thereof shall furnish, at the expense of such Noteholder, to the Owner
Trustee, the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel, which
shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such parties, to
the effect that such transfer is exempt from registration under the
Securities Act.

if any, and interest on all Outstanding Notes on the date of such deposit
and if all other sums payable hereunder, under the Related Supplemental
Indentures and under such Notes to the Noteholders shall have been paid (or
held by the Indenture Trustee for payment in the case of unsurrendered
Notes or interest checks not cashed), then the terms and conditions set
forth in this Indenture shall no longer apply to such Notes of the
applicable Noteholders (except, in the case of clause (c), as to (i) rights
of registration of transfer and exchange, (ii) substitution of mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, (iii) rights of Noteholders to receive
payments of principal of, Premium, if any, and interest on the Outstanding

Concurrently with the deposit specified in clause (c) in the first sentence
of this Section 3.1, there shall be delivered to the Indenture Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel furnished by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the

so long as any Pass Through Certificates remain outstanding, the holders of
such Pass Through Certificates) will not recognize income, gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and such defeasance
and will be subject to federal income tax of the same amounts and in the
same manner and at the same times, as a would have been the case if such
deposit and defeasance had not occurred and (ii) such defeasance will not
result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

last addresses as they shall appear upon the Note Register, stating that
the deposit required by this Section 3.1 has been made with the Indenture
Trustee and that such Notes are no longer entitled to the benefits of this
Indenture or the Related Supplemental Indenture except with respect to the

of this Indenture, to the payment to the Noteholders of the particular
Notes for the payment or redemption of which such moneys and obligations
have been deposited with the Indenture Trustee of all sums due or to become
due thereon for principal and Premium, if any, and interest; provided,
however, that, in the case of Notes for which a Redemption Date was not

Trustee. The Indenture Trustee and any Paying Agent shall promptly pay or
return to the Owner Trustee upon request of the Owner Trustee any cash or
direct obligations of the United States of America held by them at any time

Section 4.3 or 4.7, each installment of Basic Rent and any payment of
Supplemental Rent representing interest on overdue installments of Basic
Rent or in respect of interest due under Section 2.8 shall be promptly
distributed by the Indenture Trustee on the date such payment is due under
such Lease (or as soon thereafter as such payment shall be received by the

of priority:

first, so much of such aggregate amount as shall be required
to pay in full the principal of, Premium, if any, and interest
then due on all Related Outstanding Notes shall be distributed to
the Persons entitled thereto and in case such aggregate amount

ratably according to the aggregate amount then due for principal
and interest at the date of payment; and

second, the balance, if any, of such installment or payment
remaining thereafter shall be distributed to the Owner Trustee or
as the Owner Trustee may direct.

With respect to each Lease and the Related Notes, subject to Sections 4.2,
4.3 and 4.7, if, as a result of any failure by the Lessee to pay in full
any installment of Basic Rent when due (or within any applicable period of
grace) or for any other reason, there shall not have been distributed
pursuant to this Section 4.1 on any date (or within any applicable period
of grace) the full amount then distributable pursuant to clause "first" of
this Section 4.1, the Indenture Trustee shall distribute other payments of
the character referred to in Section 4.4 (other than payments representing
Supplemental Rent made pursuant to Section 3(c)(ii) of such Lease) or 4.5
then held by it or thereafter received by it, except as otherwise provided
in Section 4.3, to the Related Noteholders to the extent necessary to make
all the distributions then due pursuant to clause "first" of this Section
4.1(a); provided, however, that, to the extent any distribution is made
from such amounts held pursuant to Section 4.4 or 4.5 and the payment of
Basic Rent or Supplemental Rent in respect of which such distribution was
made, is subsequently made, such payment of Basic Rent or Supplemental
Rent, unless an Indenture Event of Default under the Related Supplemental
Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing, shall be applied to the
purpose for which such amount held pursuant to Section 4.4 or 4.5 had been
held, subject, in all cases, to the provisions of Sections 4.4 and 4.5.
The portion of each such installment or payment made to the Indenture
Trustee that is to be distributed by the Indenture Trustee in payment of
the Related Notes shall be applied in accordance with this Section 4.1(a).

Trustee of any installment of Basic Rent (whether or not then overdue) or
Supplemental Rent of the kind described in Section 3(c) (iv) of such Lease,
there shall have occurred and be continuing an Indenture Event of Default
under the Related Supplemental Indenture, then the Indenture Trustee shall

required to distribute such amount pursuant to clause "first" of Section
4.1(a)) as part of the Related Indenture Estate and shall not distribute
any such payments pursuant to clause "second" of Section 4.1(a) until the

8.1(a), the date of the occurrence of such Indenture Event of Default
(after giving effect to the grace period set forth in Section 8.1(a)) and
(b) in the case of any other Indenture Event of Default, the date on which
the Indenture Trustee shall have received notice of such Indenture Event of
Default (after giving effect to any applicable grace period), in which case
such retained payment shall be distributed pursuant to clause "second" of
section 4.1(a), (ii) such time as the Related Notes shall have been
declared, or shall have become, due and payable pursuant to Section 8.2, in
which case such retained payment shall be distributed pursuant to Section
4.3 and (iii) such time as such Indenture Event of Default shall no longer
be continuing or shall have been cured or waived, in which case such
retained payment shall be distributed pursuant to clause "second" of
Section 4.1(a); provided, however, that following an Indenture Event of
Default and the lapse of 180 days during which period the Indenture Trustee
failed to accelerate the Related Notes, such Indenture Event of Default
shall not thereafter be the basis of a retention of any Basic Rent or
Supplemental Rent payment hereunder.

distributed on the date of receipt as provided in Section 4.3 in respect of
the Related Notes (except that payments and other amounts shall be
distributed under clause "second" thereof first and under clause "first"
thereof second).

(b) If the Lessee shall exercise its option to terminate a
Lease pursuant to Section 14 thereof and the Lessee shall not have
exchanged the Related Notes pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2, then (to the
extent that there shall have been paid or provision made for payment of the
amounts due on the Related Notes on the Obsolescence Redemption Date) there
shall be redeemed on the Obsolescence Redemption Date the unpaid principal
amount of all Related Notes, together with the Premium, if any, and all

Indenture Event of Default. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.7,
all payments received and amounts held or realized by the Indenture Trustee
in respect of a particular Indenture Estate (including any amounts realized
by the Indenture Trustee from the exercise of any remedies pursuant to the
Related Lease or pursuant to Article 8) after an Indenture Event of Default

thereof is made in a Transaction Document shall be applied forthwith to the

such Transaction Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payments
received by the Indenture Trustee from insurers (other than with respect to
self-insurance or policy deductibles) with respect to a Casualty Event
under the Related Lease shall, until the requirements of Section 9(b) of
the Related Lease have been satisfied, be held by the Indenture Trustee as
a part of the Related Indenture Estate, as security for the obligations of

each such condition, the Notes or portions thereof to be redeemed shall
cease to bear interest, and

of the Redemption Price.

Notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed shall be given by
the Indenture Trustee in the name of the Owner Trustee.

Surrender of Notes.

Indenture with respect to a series of Notes, any redemption notice with
respect to an optional redemption of Notes or with respect to a redemption
of Notes pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(ii) and to which moneys sufficient to
pay the principal of, Premium, if any, and interest on such Notes on the
Redemption Date of such Notes shall not have been deposited with the
Indenture Trustee, shall state, and it shall be the case that, unless, upon
the giving of such notice, such Notes shall be deemed to have been paid
pursuant to Section 3.1, such redemption shall be conditional upon the
receipt by the Indenture Trustee (on or prior to the Redemption Date) of
moneys in immediately available funds sufficient to pay the principal of,
Premium, if any, and interest on such Notes to be redeemed, and that if
such moneys shall not have been so received, such notice of redemption
shall be of no force and effect, and the Owner Trustee shall not be
required to redeem such Notes. In the event that such notice of redemption
contains such a condition and such moneys are not so received, the

date fixed for such redemption, give notice, in the manner in which the
notice of redemption was given, that such moneys were not so received.

redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Notes so to be redeemed
shall, on the Redemption Date, except as provided in Section 6.5(c), become
due and payable at the designated corporate trust office of the Paying
Agent at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such
date (unless there shall be a default in the payment of the Redemption
Price), such Notes shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such
Notes for redemption in accordance with such notice, such Notes shall be
paid at the Redemption Price, exclusive, however, of installments of
interest maturing on or prior to the Redemption Date payment of which shall
have been made or duly provided for to the Noteholders registered as such

6.5 an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price for such
Note, the principal and Premium, if any, and (to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law) any accrued interest thereon shall, until paid, continue to
bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate borne by the Note in
respect of overdue payments.

INDENTURE EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES

SECTION 8.1 Indenture Events of Default. With respect to any
Supplemental Indenture, the term "Indenture Event of Default" shall mean
any of the following events, and any such event shall continue to be an
Indenture Event of Default if and for so long as it shall not have been
cured, remedied or waived:

(a) the failure of the Owner Trustee to pay when due any payment
of principal of, Premium, if any, or interest on any Related Note, and such
failure shall have continued unremedied for 10 days; or

arising by reason of nonpayment of, or failure to perform with respect to,
any Excepted Payment when due) under the Related Lease; provided that any
such Event of Default shall be deemed to exist and continue so long as, but
only so long as, it shall not be remedied, cured or waived; and provided,
further, that the Indenture Trustee or a Majority in Interest of
Noteholders have given to the Owner Trustee, by registered or certified
mail, a written notice stating the Indenture Trustee's or Noteholders'
intention, as the case may be, to terminate the Related Lease, commence
action to foreclose on any of the Related Lessor Interests or to exercise
any other comparable remedies under the Related Lease; or

(c) the Trust shall commence a voluntary case or other
proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect
to itself or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
law now or hereafter in effect, or seeking the appointment of a trustee,
receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of it or any
substantial part of its property, or it shall consent to any such relief or
to the appointment of or taking of possession by any such official in any
involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it, or it shall make
a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or

(d) a decree or order for relief shall be entered by a court
having jurisdiction over the Trust in any involuntary case under any
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or
appointing a trustee, receiver liquidator, custodian or other similar
official of the Trust, its interest in the Indenture Estate or any
substantial part of the Trust's property, or ordering the winding-up or
liquidation of the Trust or its affairs, and such decree or order shall
remain undismissed or unstayed for a period of 60 consecutive days; or

(e) any failure by the Owner Trustee, in its individual capacity
or as Owner Trustee, to comply with any covenant contained in Section
6.3(a) or 6.3(j) of the Participation Agreement subparagraph (aa), (bb) or
(cc) of the Granting Clause of the Related Supplemental Indenture or
Section 5.5 or 5.7 of this Agreement, which failure is not remedied within
a period of 60 days after there has been a given to the Owner Trustee, by
registered or certified mail, a written notice specifying such failure and
requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of
Default", by the Indenture Trustee or by a Majority in Interest of
Noteholders; provided, however, that if such a, failure to comply cannot be
cured by the payment of money within such 60-day period or, with respect to
other breaches, cannot be cured by diligent efforts within such 60-day
period but efforts to cure shall have been properly commenced within such
period, the cure period, as long as the Owner Trustee or Owner Participant
is diligently pursuing a cure, shall be extended for an additional period
of time as may be necessary to cure, but not to exceed 360 days; or

(f) any representation or warranty affecting the rights or
interests of the Indenture Trustee or the Related Noteholders made by the

continue unremedied for a period of 60 days after there has been given to
the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant by registered or certified mail,
a written notice specifying such incorrectness and requiring it to be
remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" by the
Indenture Trustee or by a Majority in Interest of Noteholders.

SECTION 8.2 Acceleration upon Notice; Rescission.

(a) With respect to any Supplemental Indenture, during the
continuance of any Indenture Event of Default and subject to the provisions
of Section 8.10, the Indenture Trustee, in its discretion may (or when so
directed by a Majority in Interest of Noteholders shall) or a Majority in
Interest of Noteholders may, in any such case, by notice in writing to the
Lessee and the Owner Trustee (and to the Indenture Trustee if given by
Noteholders), declare the principal of all the Outstanding Related Notes
and the interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, and
thereupon the same shall become immediately due and payable without Premium
(except with respect to any Series J Notes). Upon any exercise of remedies
by the Owner Trustee under the circumstances and as permitted by
subparagraph (bb) of the Granting Clause that result in the termination of
the Related Lease, acceleration of Rent due thereunder or a demand under
Section 16(a) (v) (D) of such Lease, then, in such case, the Indenture
Trustee shall be deemed to have declared the principal of all Outstanding
Related Notes to be due and payable without Premium upon the receipt by the
Indenture Trustee of any payments pursuant to such provisions.

(b) At any time after such acceleration and before any sale of
the Indenture Estate as relating to any series of Notes, or any part
thereof, shall have been made pursuant to any sale as hereinafter in this
Article 8 provided, a Majority in Interest of Noteholders by Directive
delivered to the Lessee, the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its
consequences if (l) there shall have been paid to or deposited with the
Indenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue installments of
interest on all Related Notes, (B) the principal of and Premium, if any, on
any Notes which have become due otherwise than by such acceleration and
interest thereon at the respective rates provided in the Notes for late
payments of principal or Premium and (C) to the extent that payment of such
interest is lawful, interest upon overdue installments of interest at the
respective rates provided in the Related Notes for late payments of
interest; and (2) all Indenture Events of Default, other than the non-
payment of the principal of Notes which have become due solely by such
acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 8.9. No
such rescission shall affect any subsequent Indenture Event of Default or
impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 8.3 Enforcement of Remedies.

(a) With respect to any Supplemental Indenture, subject to
Section 8.10 and the limitations set forth in this Section 8.3(a), if an
Indenture Event of Default that arises out of an Event of Default under the
Related Lease shall have occurred and be continuing, then in every such
case the Indenture Trustee, as assignee and grantee or secured party
hereunder or otherwise, may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
exercise any or all of the rights and powers and pursue any or all of the
remedies under the Related Lease (including Section 16 thereof) and, in
connection therewith, corresponding remedies under this Article 8 and the
Related Supplemental Indenture may take possession of all or part of the
Related Indenture Estate and may exclude the Owner Trustee and the Lessee
and, to the extent provided in the Related Lease and as permitted by
Applicable Law, all Persons claiming under either of them wholly or partly
therefrom; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any provision herein to
the contrary the Indenture Trustee shall not exercise any remedies against
the Related Indenture Estate seeking to deprive the Owner Trustee of its
interests therein unless a declaration of acceleration has been made
pursuant to Section 8.2. Any provision of the Related Lease, this
Indenture or any other Transaction Document to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Indenture Trustee shall not foreclose the Lien of such
Supplemental Indenture or otherwise exercise remedies which would result in
the exclusion of the Owner Trustee from the Indenture Estate or any
substantial part thereof demised under the Related Lease as a result of any
Indenture Event of Default that arises solely by reason of one or more
events or circumstances that constitute an Event of Default unless the
Indenture Trustee has taken or is currently taking action under the Related
Lease to dispossess the Lessee, to terminate the Related Lease, or effect a
comparable remedy under the Related Lease.

(b) Any provision of any Lease, this Indenture or any
Supplemental Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if the Lessee shall
fail to pay any Excepted Payment to any Person entitled thereto as and when
due, such Person shall have the right at all times, to the exclusion of the
Indenture Trustee, to demand, collect, sue for, enforce performance of
obligations relating to or otherwise obtain all amounts due in respect of
such Excepted Payment; provided, however, that such Person shall not be
entitled to collect such payment from or execute any judgment against or
otherwise cause the placing of a Lien upon any asset constituting a portion
of the Related Indenture Estate.

(c) With respect to any Lease, except as expressly provided in
Article VIII of the Participation Agreement, and for so long as the Lessee
is the lessee under such Lease, the Lessor Interest may not be sold or
otherwise transferred to any Person.

SECTION 8.4 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

SECTION 8.5 Actions for Ratable Benefit of Noteholders. All
proofs of claim, rights of action and rights to assert claims under this
Indenture or under any of the Notes may be enforced by the Indenture
Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes or the production
thereof in any trial or other proceedings relative thereto, and any such
action or proceedings instituted by the Indenture Trustee shall be brought
in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of
judgment shall, after provision for the payment or reimbursement of the
proper charges, expenses or advances of the Indenture Trustee, be for the
ratable benefit of the Noteholders in respect of which such judgment has
been recovered.

SECTION 8.6 Noteholders May Demand Enforcement of Rights by
Indenture Trustee. Subject to Sections 8.3, 8.9 and 8.10, if an Indenture
Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be continuing with respect
to any Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture Trustee shall, upon the
receipt of a Directive from a Majority in Interest of Noteholders and upon
the offering of indemnity as provided in Section 9.1(e), proceed to
institute one or more suits, actions or proceedings at law, in equity or
otherwise, or take any other appropriate remedy, to enforce payment of the
principal of, or Premium, if any, or interest on, the Related Notes or to
foreclose the lien of such Related Supplemental Indenture or to sell or to
cause to be sold the Indenture Estate under a judgment or decree of a court
or courts of competent jurisdiction or under the power of sale herein
granted, or take such other appropriate legal, equitable or other remedy,
as the Indenture Trustee, being advised by counsel, shall deem most
effectual to protect and enforce any of the rights or powers of the
Indenture Trustee or the Related Noteholders, or, in case such Noteholders
shall have requested a specific method of enforcement permitted hereunder,
in the manner requested, provided that such action shall be in accordance
with law and the provisions of such Related Supplemental Indenture and this
Indenture, and the Indenture Trustee, subject to such indemnity provisions,
shall have the right to decline to follow any such request if the Indenture
Trustee in good faith shall determine that the suit, proceeding or exercise
of the other remedy so requested would involve the Indenture Trustee in
personal liability or expense.

SECTION 8.7 Control by Noteholders. A Majority in Interest of
Noteholders of Outstanding Notes issued pursuant to any Related
Supplemental Indenture shall have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Indenture Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to such Related Supplemental Indenture or this
Indenture with respect to the Related Indenture Estate, provided that:

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of
law or with the rights of the Owner Trustee under this Indenture
or such Supplemental Indenture, and

(2) the Indenture Trustee may take any other action deemed
proper by the Indenture Trustee which is not inconsistent with
such direction.

SECTION 8.8 Noteholder May Not Bring Suit Except under Certain
Conditions. Subject to Sections 8.3, 8.9 and 8.10, a Noteholder shall not
have the right to institute any suit, action or proceeding at law or in
equity or otherwise for the foreclosure of this Indenture or for the
enforcement of any other remedy under or upon this Indenture, unless:

(1) such Noteholder previously shall have given
written notice to the Indenture Trustee of a continuing
Indenture Event of Default;

(2) the Indenture Trustee shall have received a
Directive from not less than a Majority in Interest of
Noteholders requesting that it institute such action,
suit or proceeding and shall have been offered
indemnity as provided in Section 9.1(e);

(3) the Indenture Trustee shall have refused or
neglected to institute any such action, suit or
proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice,
request and offer of indemnity; and

(4) no subsequent Directive from not less than a
Majority in Interest of Noteholders inconsistent with
the first such Directive has been given to the
Indenture Trustee during such 60-day period.

It is understood and intended that no one or more of the
Noteholders of a series shall have any right in any manner whatever
hereunder or under the Related Notes to (i) surrender, impair, waive,
affect, disturb or prejudice the lien of the Related Supplemental Indenture
on any property subject thereto or the rights of the Noteholders of any
other Related Notes, (ii) obtain or seek to obtain priority over or
preference to any other such Related Noteholder or (iii) enforce any right
under this Indenture or such Related Supplemental Indenture, except in the
manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all
the Related Noteholders, subject to the provisions of this Indenture.

SECTION 8.9 Waiver of Past Defaults. Upon receipt of a
Directive from the Noteholders of not less than a majority in principal
amount of Outstanding Notes issued pursuant to any Supplemental Indenture
the Indenture Trustee shall waive any past Indenture Default and its
consequences and upon any such waiver such Indenture Default shall cease to
exist, and any Indenture Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed
to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture and such
Supplemental Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent
or other Indenture Default or impair any right consequent thereon;
provided, however, that, in the absence of written instructions from the
Noteholders of all Related Notes then Outstanding, the Indenture Trustee
shall not waive any Indenture Default in the payment of the principal of,
Premium, if any, or interest on, or other amounts due under, any Related
Note then Outstanding, or in respect of a covenant or provision hereof
that, under Article 11, cannot be modified or amended without the consent
of each Related Noteholder.

SECTION 8.10 Right of Owner Trustee to Pay Interest, Principal,
etc.; Note Purchase.

(a)(1) In the event of any default by the Lessee in the payment
of any installment of Basic Rent due under any Lease, the Owner Trustee or
the Owner Participant, without the consent of the Indenture Trustee or any
Noteholder, may pay to the Indenture Trustee for application in accordance
with Section 4.1, a sum equal to the amount of all (but not less than all)
principal and interest as shall then be due and payable on the Related
Notes, together with any interest on account of such payment being overdue
as provided in Article 4.

(2) In the event of any default by the Lessee in the
performance of any obligation under any Lease (other than the obligation to
pay Basic Rent) or any other Transaction Document, the Owner Trustee or the
Owner Participant, without the consent of the Indenture Trustee or any
Noteholder, may exercise the Lessor's rights under Section 19 of such Lease
to perform such obligation on behalf of the Lessee.

(3) Solely for the purpose of determining whether there
exists an Indenture Event of Default, (i) any payment by the Owner Trustee
or the Owner Participant pursuant to, and in compliance with, Section
8.10(a) (l) shall, for the purposes of this Indenture and the Related
Supplemental Indenture, be deemed to remedy any default by the Lessee in
the payment of installments of Basic Rent theretofore due and payable under
the applicable Lease and to remedy any default by the Owner Trustee in the
payment of any amount due and payable under the Related Notes and (ii) any
performance by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant of any obligation
of the Lessee under any Lease pursuant to, and in compliance with, Section
8.10(a) (2) shall, for the purposes of this Indenture and the Related
Supplemental Indenture, be deemed to remedy any default by the Lessee in
the performance of such obligation under the applicable Lease and to remedy
any related default by the Owner Trustee under this Indenture and the
Related Supplemental Indenture.

(4) Until 15 Business Days after the Owner Trustee and the
Owner Participant shall have been given notice by the Indenture Trustee of
the occurrence of an Indenture Event of Default that may be cured under
this Section 8.10(a), the Indenture Trustee shall not exercise any rights
as assignee of the Owner Trustee's rights under the applicable Lease or
declare the Related Notes to be due and payable pursuant to Section 8.2 as
a result of such Indenture Event of Default.

(5) This Section 8.10(a) shall not apply to any default by
the Lessee in the payment of any installment of Basic Rent due under any
Lease, if default by the Lessee in the payment of three or more consecutive
installments of Basic Rent, or in the payment of a total of six or more
installments of Basic Rent under such Lease, shall have been cured by the
Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant pursuant to the foregoing provisions
of this Section 8.10(a).

(6) Upon the exercise of any cure right under this Section
8.10(a), neither the Owner Trustee nor the Owner Participant shall obtain
any Lien on any part of the Related Indenture Estate on account of any
payment made or the costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith nor
shall any claim of the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant against the
Lessee or any other Person for the repayment thereof impair the prior right
and security interest of the Indenture Trustee in and to the Related
Indenture Estate under Section 8.10(a) (1).

(b) (1) Upon the exercise of any cure right the Owner
Participant or the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, shall be subrogated
to the rights of the Related Noteholders to receive from the Indenture
Trustee the installment of Basic Rent with respect to which the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant effected such a cure (including interest
on account of such installment being overdue) in the manner set forth in
Section 8.10(b) (2).

(2) If the Indenture Trustee shall thereafter receive such
installment of Basic Rent, then, notwithstanding the requirements of
Section 4.1, the Indenture Trustee forthwith shall remit such installment
of Basic Rent to the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant, as the case
may be, in reimbursement for the funds so advanced by either of them;
provided, however, that, if any Indenture Event of Default pursuant to the
Related Supplemental Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing, such
installment of Basic Rent shall not be remitted to the Owner Trustee or the
Owner Participant but shall be held by the Indenture Trustee as security
for the obligations secured hereby with respect to the Related Notes and by
such Related Supplemental Indenture and distributed in accordance with
Section 4.1(b), as appropriate; and provided further, that, if the
principal of and interest on the Related Notes shall have become due and
payable pursuant to Section 8.2, such installment of Basic Rent shall be
distributed by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with Section 4.3.

(c) The Indenture Trustee agrees that if, after the occurrence
and continuation of an Indenture Event of Default with respect to any
Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture Trustee intends either to declare the
Related Notes to be accelerated or to exercise other substantial rights or
remedies under this Indenture, under the Related Supplemental Indenture or
under the Related Lease, the Indenture Trustee shall give notice of such
intention to the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant at least 10 (but
not more than 30) Business Days prior to the making of such declaration or
the exercising of such right or remedy. No declaration of acceleration by
Noteholders holding Notes issued under the Related Supplemental Indenture
pursuant to Section 8.2 shall be effective unless the Owner Trustee and the
Owner Participant are given at least 10 (but not more than 30) Business
Days' prior written notice of their intention to make such declaration of
acceleration. Each Noteholder shall be deemed to agree by its acceptance
of its Note that if, after the giving of any such notice of intention by
the Indenture Trustee or such Noteholders, as the case may be, the Owner
Trustee shall give notice to the Indenture Trustee of the Owner Trustee's
intention to purchase all of the Outstanding Related Notes in accordance
with this Section 8.10(c), accompanied by assurances reasonably
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee of the Owner Trustee's ability to
purchase the Related Notes, then neither the Indenture Trustee nor such
Noteholders shall thereafter accelerate the Related Notes or exercise other
substantial rights or remedies under the Indenture with respect to the
Related Notes, under the Related Supplemental Indenture or under the
Related Lease unless the Indenture Trustee shall not receive within 10
Business Days of the giving of such notice by the Indenture Trustee or such
Noteholders, as the case may be, an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of any unpaid Related Notes then Outstanding, without
Premium or penalty, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon to
the date of such receipt (as well as any interest on overdue principal and,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, overdue interest as provided in
Article 4) and any other amounts then due and payable to each Related
Noteholder hereunder. Upon payment to the Indenture Trustee of such
amount, each Related Noteholder will be deemed to sell, assign, transfer
and convey to the Owner Trustee (without recourse or warranty of any kind
other than of title to the Notes so conveyed) all of the right, title and
interest of such Noteholder in and to the Related Indenture Estate, this
Indenture, the Related Indenture Supplement, and all Related Notes held by
such Noteholder. On and after the date of payment of such amount to the
Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee shall no longer treat the former
Noteholders as the "Noteholders," except for purposes of the Noteholders'
right to receive their respective portions of the amounts paid to the
Indenture Trustee as aforesaid, and on such date the Note Registrar shall
register the transfer of ownership of the Related Notes into the name of
the Owner Trustee.

SECTION 8.11 Right of Noteholders to Receive Payment Not To Be
Impaired. Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the
right of any Noteholder to receive payment of the principal of, Premium, if
any, and interest on, such Note, on or after the respective due dates
expressed in such Note (or, in case of redemption, on the Redemption Date
fixed for such Note subject, however, in the case of an optional redemption
or redemption pursuant to Section 6.1(b) (ii), to Section 6.5(c)), or to
institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such
respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of
such Noteholder; provided, however, that such Noteholder shall not have the
right to institute any such suit, if and to the extent that the institution
or prosecution thereof or the entry of judgment therein would, under
Applicable Law result in the surrender, impairment, waiver or loss of the
Lien of the Related Supplemental Indenture upon the Related Indenture
Estate or any part thereof.

SECTION 8.12 No Action Contrary to Lessee's Rights Under the
Leases. Notwithstanding the granting clause or any other provision of this
Indenture or any Supplemental Indenture or any provision of any other
Transaction Document, the Indenture Trustee warrants, covenants and agrees
that, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
under any Lease, the Indenture Trustee shall not (i) name the Lessee as a
party in any action or procedures to foreclose the lien of the Related
Supplemental Indenture, unless such joinder shall be required under
Applicable Law, and in which case Indenture Trustee shall not seek
affirmative relief from the Lessee in such action nor shall the Related
Lease be cut or terminated nor the Lessee's possession thereunder be
disturbed in any such action or proceeding, and (ii) subject to the next
succeeding sentence of this Section 8.12, the Indenture Trustee will
recognize the Related Lease and the Lessee's rights thereunder. Without in
any way limiting the requirements of Section 8.14, upon any acquisition by
the Indenture Trustee or any purchaser at foreclosure or transferee
pursuant to a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code (collectively, a "Successor Landlord") of the Owner Trustee's interest
in any Lease, such Lease shall continue as a direct Lease between the
Successor Landlord and the Lessee upon all terms, covenants and conditions
set forth in such Lease, except that the Successor Landlord shall not be
(A) liable for any previous act or omission of the Lessor under such Lease,
(B) subject to any offsets, claims, defenses or counterclaims the Lessee
may have against the Owner Trustee, (C) be bound by any prepayment of Rent
not actually received by the Successor Landlord or (D) bound by any
amendment to such Lease requiring Indenture Trustee's consent unless such
consent was obtained.

SECTION 8.13 Waiver of Stay. To the extent it may lawfully do
so, the Owner Trustee, for itself and for any Person who may claim through
or under it, hereby:

(a) agrees that neither it nor any such Person will set up,
plead, claim or in any manner whatsoever take advantage of, any statute or
rule of law now or hereafter in force providing for any stay, moratorium,
extension, appraisement, valuation or redemption or any statute of
limitations or any rights to require a marshalling of
assets which may delay, prevent or otherwise hinder (i) the performance or
enforcement or foreclosure of this Indenture or any Supplemental Indenture,
(ii) the sale of any of the Indenture Estate, or (iii) the putting of the
purchaser or purchasers thereof into possession of such property
immediately after the sale thereof;

(b) waives and releases all benefit or advantage of such
laws; and

(c) consents and agrees that all the Indenture Estate may at
any such sale be sold by the Indenture Trustee in parcels or as an
entirety.

SECTION 8.14 Right of Indenture Trustee to Perform Covenants
etc. If the Owner Trustee shall fail to make any payment required to be
made or to perform any act required to be performed by it hereunder or
under any Lease, the Indenture Trustee, without notice to or demand upon
the Owner Trustee and without waiving or releasing any obligation or
default, may (but shall be under no obligation to) at any time thereafter
make such payment or perform such act for the account and at the expense of
the Related Indenture Estate. All sums so paid by the Indenture Trustee and
all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and
expenses of legal counsel and other professionals) so incurred together
with interest thereon from the date of payment or occurrence, shall
constitute additional indebtedness secured by this Indenture and shall be
paid from the Related Indenture Estate to the Indenture Trustee on demand.
The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any damages resulting from
any such payment or action unless such damages shall be a consequence of
willful misconduct or negligence on the part of the Indenture Trustee.

SECTION 8.15 Certain Other Rights of Owner Trustee. The
Indenture Trustee shall not modify, waive, amend or supplement any Granting
Clause Document (other than the Indenture) or deliver any notices,
consents, determinations, demands, approvals, requests, directions or
releases in respect of any such other Granting Clause Document so as to
release the Lessee from any of its obligations in respect of the payment of
Basic Rent, Supplemental Rent, Casualty Value, Termination Value or any
other payments in respect of the Properties as set forth in any Lease, or
reduce the amount of, or change the time or manner of payment of or the
absolute and unconditional character of, such payment obligations of the
Lessee as set forth in any Granting Clause Document or impose or create any
obligation on the part of the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant under
any Lease or extend or shorten the duration of the Basic Term or any
Renewal Term of any Lease; provided, that adjustments to amounts payable in
respect of the Lessor Interests under any Lease may be made in accordance
with Section 3(e) or 8(f) of such Lease at any time this Agreement is in
effect, at the times and in the manner contemplated by such Lease. Nothing
in this Section 8.15 shall prevent the Indenture Trustee from exercising
remedies in accordance with such Lease and this Indenture so long as such
exercise does not involve a modification to a Granting Clause Document that
has the effect outlined above prior to such time as the Indenture Trustee
shall be entitled pursuant to Section 8.3 hereof to exercise remedies that
would result in the exclusion of the Owner Trustee from all or any
substantial part of the Related Indenture Estate.

SECTION 8.16 Restoration of Rights and Remedies. In case the
Indenture Trustee shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any
right, power or remedy under this Indenture or any Supplemental Indenture
by foreclosure, entry or otherwise, and such proceedings shall have been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been determined
adversely to the Indenture Trustee, then and in every such case the Owner
Trustee, the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee, the Related
Noteholders and the Lessee shall be restored to their former positions and
rights hereunder with respect to the Related Indenture Estate, and all
rights, powers and remedies of the Indenture Trustee shall continue as if
no such proceedings had been taken.

SECTION 8.17 Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Each and every
right, power and remedy herein specifically given to the Indenture Trustee
under this Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures shall be cumulative
and shall be in addition to every other right, power and remedy herein
specifically given or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by
statute, and each and every right, power and remedy whether specifically
herein given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time and
as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the Indenture
Trustee and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise of any right,
power and remedy shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right to
exercise at the same time or thereafter any other right, power or remedy.
No delay or omission by the Indenture Trustee in the exercise of any right,
power or remedy or in the pursuance of any remedy shall impair any such
right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default on the
part of the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant or to be an acquiescence
therein.

and opinions to determine whether or not they substantially conform to the
requirements of this Indenture.

(k) If an Indenture Event of Default in respect of any
Supplemental Indenture has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture

believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity

it or (C) to execute any document or take any action that it
shall reasonably determine, or shall have been advised by
counsel, is likely to result in personal liability on the
part of Indenture Trustee, unless it shall be indemnified to
its satisfaction.

other agent of the Indenture Trustee, in its individual or any other
capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal

If such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant
to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining
authority, then for the purposes of this Section 9.6, the combined capital

surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.
The Owner Trustee may not, nor may any Person directly or indirectly

Section 9.6, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
hereinafter specified in this Article.

SECTION 9.7 Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
(a) No resignation or removal of the Indenture Trustee and no appointment
of a successor Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become
effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Indenture
Trustee under Section 9.8.

(b) The Indenture Trustee may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Owner Trustee and the Lessee. If an
instrument of acceptance by a successor Indenture Trustee shall not have
been delivered to the Owner Trustee, the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee
within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the
resigning Indenture Trustee may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee or any
Noteholder who has been a Noteholder for at least six months may, subject
to the provisions of Sections 8.8 and 8.11, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a

acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or a insolvent, or a
receiver of the Indenture Trustee or of its property shall be
appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of
the Indenture Trustee or of its property or affairs for the
purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, (i) the Owner Trustee, acting after consultation
with the Lessee, may remove the Indenture Trustee or (ii) subject to
Sections 8.8 and 8.11, unless the Indenture Trustee's duty to resign is
stayed as provided in the Trust Indenture Act, any Noteholder who has been
a bona fide Noteholder for at least six months may, on behalf of himself
and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the removal of the Indenture Trustee and the appointment
of a successor Indenture Trustee. Such court may thereupon after such
notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Indenture
Trustee and appoint a successor Indenture Trustee.

(e) If the Indenture Trustee shall resign, be removed or
become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of
Indenture Trustee for any cause, the Owner Trustee, acting after
consultation with the Lessee, shall promptly appoint a successor Indenture
Trustee. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or
incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Indenture
Trustee shall be appointed pursuant to a Directive of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Notes delivered to the Owner Trustee,
the Lessee and the retiring Indenture Trustee, the successor Indenture
Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such
appointment, become the successor Indenture Trustee and supersede the
successor Indenture Trustee appointed by the Owner Trustee. If no
successor Indenture Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Owner
Trustee (acting after consultation with the Lessee) or the Noteholders and
accepted appointment in the manner provided in Section 9.8, any Noteholder
who has been a bona fide Noteholder for at least six months may, subject to
the provisions of Sections 8.8 and 8.11, on behalf of himself and all other
similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee. Such court may thereupon
after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper or prescribe, appoint a
successor Indenture Trustee.

(f) The Owner Trustee shall give notice of each resignation
and each removal of the Indenture Trustee and each appointment of a
successor Indenture Trustee by mailing written notice of such event by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Noteholders as their names and
addresses appear in the Note Register. Each notice shall include the name
of the successor Indenture Trustee and the address of its Indenture Trustee
Office.

SECTION 9.8 Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. Every
successor Indenture Trustee appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge
and deliver to the Owner Trustee, the Lessee and to the retiring Indenture
Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the
resignation or removal of the retiring Indenture Trustee shall become
effective and such successor Indenture Trustee, without any further act,
deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts
and duties of the retiring Indenture Trustee; but on request of the Owner
Trustee or the successor Indenture Trustee, such retiring Indenture Trustee
shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument
transferring to such successor Indenture Trustee all the rights, powers and
trusts of the retiring Indenture Trustee, and he shall duly assign,
transfer and deliver to such successor Indenture Trustee all property and
money held by such retiring Indenture Trustee hereunder, subject
nevertheless to its lien, if any, provided for in Section 9.5. Upon
request of any such successor Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee shall
execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor Indenture Trustee all such rights, powers and
trusts.

No successor Indenture Trustee shall accept its appointment
unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Indenture Trustee
shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.

Business. Any corporation into which the Indenture Trustee may be merged
or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Indenture Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or
substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Indenture Trustee,
shall be the successor of the Indenture Trustee hereunder, provided such
corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part
of any of the parties hereto. In case any Notes shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Indenture Trustee then in office,
any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating
Indenture Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Notes so
authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Indenture Trustee
had itself authenticated such Notes.

SECTION 9.10 Maintenance of Agencies.

(a) Any Paying Agent (other than the Indenture Trustee) from
time to time appointed hereunder shall execute and deliver to the Indenture
Trustee an instrument in which said Paying Agent shall agree with the
Indenture Trustee, subject to the provisions of this section, that such
Paying Agent will:

(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of
principal of, Premium, if any, and interest on Notes in trust for
the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall
be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein
provided;

(2) give the Indenture Trustee within five days
thereafter notice of any default in the making of any payment of
principal, Premium, if any, or interest on the Notes; and

(3) at any time during the continuance of any such
default, upon the written request of the Indenture Trustee,
forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums so held in trust
by such Paying Agent.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, any payment required
to be made to or received or held by the Indenture Trustee may, to the
extent authorized by written instructions of the Indenture Trustee, be made
to or received or held by a Paying Agent for the account of the Indenture
Trustee.

(b) From time to time the Indenture Trustee for the Notes of
any series may, subject to its sole discretion, appoint one or more
Authenticating Agents with respect to the Notes of such series, with power
to act on the Indenture Trustee's behalf and subject to its discretion in
the authentication and delivery of the Notes of such
series in connection with transfers and exchanges under Sections 2.5, 2.6,
2.11 and 6.7 as fully to all intents and purposes as though such
Authenticating Agent had been expressly authorized by those Sections of the
Indenture to authenticate and deliver the Notes of such series. For all
purposes of the Indenture, the authentication and delivery of Notes of such
series by an Authenticating Agent for such Notes pursuant to this Section
9.10 shall be deemed to be authentication and delivery of such Notes "by
the Indenture Trustee." Any such Authenticating Agent shall at all times
be a Person that is eligible to act as an Indenture Trustee hereunder
pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.6. If at any time an
Authenticating Agent for any the provisions of Section 9.6, such
Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the
effect specified in this Section 9.10.

(c) If an appointment of an Authenticating Agent with
respect to one or more series of Notes is made pursuant to this Section
9.10, the Notes may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Indenture
Trustee's certification of authentication, an alternate certificate of
authentication in the following form:

(d) Any corporation into which any Authorized Agent may be
merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, consolidation or conversion to which
any Authorized a Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to
the corporate trust business of any Authorized Agent shall be the successor
of such Authorized Agent hereunder, if such successor corporation is
otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of
any paper or any further act on the part of the parties hereto or such
Authorized Agent or such successor corporation.

(e) Any Authorized Agent may at any time resign by giving
written notice of resignation to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Trustee. The Owner Trustee, may, and at the request of the Indenture
Trustee shall, at any time, terminate the agency of any Authorized Agent by
giving written notice of termination to such Authorized Agent and to the
Indenture Trustee. Upon the resignation or termination of an Authorized
Agent or in case at any time any such Authorized Agent shall cease to be
eligible under this Section (which, in either case, no other Authorized
Agent performing the functions of such Authorized Agent shall have been
appointed), the Owner Trustee shall promptly appoint one or more qualified
successor Authorized Agents approved by the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Trustee to perform the functions of the Authorized Agent who has resigned
or whose agency has been terminated or who shall have ceased to be eligible
under this Section. The Indenture Trustee shall give written notice of any
such appointment to all Noteholders as their names and addresses appear on
the Note Register.

SECTION 9.11 Co-Indenture Trustee or Separate Trustee. (a) If
at any time or times it shall be necessary or prudent in order to conform
to any law of any jurisdiction in which property shall be held subject to
the lien of any Supplemental Indenture, or the Indenture Trustee shall be
advised by counsel, satisfactory to it, that it is necessary, prudent or
convenient in the interest of the Noteholders, or upon receipt of a
Directive, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner trustee shall execute and
deliver all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to constitute
another bank or trust company or one or more Persons approved by the
Indenture Trustee either to act as co-trustee or co-trustees of all or any
part of the Indenture Estate jointly with the Indenture Trustee originally
named herein or any successor or successors, or to act as separate trustee
or trustees of all or any such property. In the event the Owner Trustee
shall have not joined in the execution of such instruments and agreements
within 10 days after the receipt of a written request from the Indenture
Trustee to do so, or in case an Indenture Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee may act under the
foregoing provisions of this Section without the concurrence of the Owner
Trustee upon giving written notice to the Owner Trustee of the name and
address of such proposed additional trustee; and the Owner Trustee hereby
appoints the Indenture Trustee its agent and attorney to act for it under
the foregoing provisions of this Section in either of such contingencies;
provided, however, that within 90 days following any appointment of an
additional trustee without the concurrence of the Owner Trustee, the Owner
Trustee may, after consultation with the Lessee, if there shall not have
occurred and be continuing an Indenture Event of Default, remove such
additional trustee by written notice to the Indenture Trustee, the
additional trustee and the Lessee.

(b) Every additional trustee hereunder shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be appointed and act, and such additional trustee and its
successors shall act, subject to the following provisions and conditions,
namely:

(1) the Notes shall be authenticated and delivered,
and all powers, duties, obligations and rights conferred upon the
Indenture Trustee in respect of the custody, control and
management of moneys, papers or securities, shall be exercised,
solely by the Indenture Trustee;

(2) all rights, powers, duties and obligations
conferred or imposed upon the Indenture Trustee shall be
conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the
Indenture Trustee and such additional trustee or trustees
jointly, except to the extent that under any law of any
jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be
performed, the Indenture Trustee shall be incompetent or
unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such
rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and
performed by such additional trustee or trustees;

(3) no power given hereby to, or which it is provided
hereby may be exercised by, any such additional trustee or
trustees, shall be exercised hereunder by such additional trustee
or trustees, except jointly with, or with the consent in writing
of, the Indenture Trustee, anything herein contained to the
contrary notwithstanding;

(4) no trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by
reason of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder; and

(5) after consultation with the Lessee, the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, at any time by an instrument
in writing, executed by them jointly, may remove any such
additional trustee, and in that case, by an instrument in writing
executed by them jointly, may appoint a successor or successors
to such additional trustee or trustees, as the case may be,
anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding. In
the event that the Owner Trustee shall not have joined in the
execution of any such instrument within 10 days after the receipt
of a written request from the Indenture Trustee to do so, the
Indenture Trustee shall have the power to remove any such
additional trustee and to appoint a successor additional trustee
without the concurrence of the Owner Trustee; and the Owner
Trustee hereby appoints the Indenture Trustee, its agent and
attorney to act for it in such connection in such contingency;
provided, however, that, if there shall not have occurred and be
continuing an Indenture Event of Default, within 90 days
following any appointment of a successor additional trustee
without the concurrence of the Owner Trustee, the Owner Trustee
may, after consultation with the Lessee, remove such successor
additional trustee by written notice to the Indenture Trustee and
the successor additional trustee. In the event that the
Indenture Trustee alone shall have appointed an additional
trustee or trustees as above provided, it may at any time, by an
instrument in writing, remove any such additional trustee, the
successor to any such additional trustee so removed to be
appointed by the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, or by
the Indenture Trustee alone, as hereinbefore in this Section
provided, subject to the aforesaid right of Owner Trustee, if
there shall not have occurred and be continuing an Indenture
Event of Default, to remove, after consultation with the Lessee,
such additional trustee within 90 days after such appointment.

SECTION 9.12. Withholding Taxes. The Indenture Trustee, as
agent for the Owner Trustee, shall exclude and withhold from each payment
of principal, premium, if any, and interest and other amounts due hereunder
or under the Notes any and all withholding taxes applicable thereto as
required by law. The Indenture Trustee agrees to act as such withholding
agent and, in connection therewith, whenever any present or future taxes or
similar charges are required to be withheld with respect to any amounts
payable in respect of the Notes, to withhold such amounts and timely pay
the same to the appropriate authority in the name and on behalf of the
Holders of the Notes, that it will file any necessary withholding tax
returns or statements when due, and that, as promptly as possible after the
payment thereof, it will deliver to each holder of a Note appropriate
documentation showing the payment thereof, together with such additional
documentary evidence as such holders may reasonably request from time to
time.

ARTICLE 10

NOTEHOLDERS' LISTS

SECTION 10.1 List of Names and Addresses of Noteholders. The
Indenture Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably
practicable the most recent list delivered to it pursuant to this Section
10.1, as the case may be, of the names and addresses of the Noteholders.
If the Indenture Trustee is not the Note Registrar, the Note Registrar will
furnish or cause to be furnished to the Indenture Trustee semiannually, on
a date not more than 15 days after each regular Record Date with respect to
an Interest Payment Date, in each year, and at such other times as the
Indenture Trustee may request in, writing, within 30 days after receipt by
the Note Registrar of any such request, a list, in such form as the
Indenture Trustee may reasonably require, containing all of the information
in the possession or control of the Note Registrar as to the names and
addresses of the Noteholders, in each case as of a date not more than 15
days prior to the time such list is furnished. The Indenture Trustee may
destroy any list furnished to it as provided in this Section 10.1, as the
case may be, upon receipt of a new list so furnished.

hereunder or add a co-trustee or separate trustee and to make provisions as

to matters or questions arising under this Indenture, provided such action

14(d) of any Lease, to subject the Substitute Parcel and Related Lessor
Interest to the Liens and security interests contemplated by this Indenture
and release the Related Indenture Estate subject to such original
Supplemental Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Supplemental Indenture shall
become effective except with the consent of the Noteholders of all Related
Notes then Outstanding if as a result thereof the amounts payable to the
Owner Trustee under a Lease (other than Excepted Payments) and assigned to
the Indenture Trustee hereunder shall not be sufficient to pay when due the
principal of, Premium, if any, and interest on all Outstanding Related
Notes. In the case of clause (l) above, all provisions of this Indenture
shall apply with respect to such Substitute Parcel and Related Indenture
Estate as if they had constituted a part of the original Related Indenture
Estate.

SECTION 11.2 Amendments with Consent of Noteholders. With

Interest of Noteholders, by Directive delivered to the Owner Trustee and

Indenture for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any
manner the rights and obligations of such Noteholders and of the Owner

each Outstanding Related Note affected thereby,

any installment of interest on, or the dates or circumstances of
payment of Premium, if any, on, any Related Note, or reduce the
principal amount thereof or the interest thereon or any amount
payable upon the redemption thereof, or change the circumstances
for redemption or change the place of payment where, or the coin

the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute
suit for the enforcement of any such payment of principal or
interest on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case
of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date subject, however,
to Section 6.5(c)) or such payment of Premium, if any, on or
after the date such Premium becomes due and payable or change the
dates or the amounts of payments to be made through installment

the Related Supplemental Indenture on any of the Related
Indenture Estate or deprive any Related Noteholder of the
security afforded by the lien of the Related Supplemental
Indenture except as may be required to effectuate Article 12,

(3) terminate the Related Lease, reduce the amounts
payable under the Related Lease assigned to the Indenture Trustee

Notes,

(4) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the
Outstanding Related Notes, the consent of whose holders is
required for any such amendment, or the consent of whose holders

other provisions of this Indenture or the Related Supplemental
Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of
each Noteholder affected thereby.

of the Owner Trustee and such other documentation as the Indenture Trustee
may reasonably require and upon the filing with the Indenture Trustee of
evidence of the Act of such Noteholders, the Indenture Trustee shall join
in the execution of such amendment or other instrument, as the case may be,
subject to the provisions of Section 11.3.

It shall not be necessary for any Act of Noteholders under this
Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it
shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.

Indenture Trustee of any amendment pursuant to the provisions of this

EXCHANGE AND ASSUMPTION OF NOTES

SECTION 13.1 Exchange of Obligations of Owner Trustee for
Unsecured Obligations of the Lessee. Upon the termination of any Lease
pursuant to Section 14 thereof and the sale of the Leased Property pursuant
to Section 14(c)(iii) thereof, the Lessee may, pursuant to Section 9.1 of
the Participation Agreement and subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in (a) through (g) below, satisfy all of the rights
and obligations of the Owner Trustee under this Indenture in respect of the
Related Notes as contemplated in Section 14(c)(i)(B) of such Lease. In
such event, the Related Notes shall be exchanged for unsecured, full
recourse securities of the Lessee to be issued under a new indenture, as
described below. Such new securities will be issued on the Termination
Date (such date being referred to hereinafter as the "Exchange Date"). The
following shall be conditions to the issuance of any new securities in
exchange for the Related Notes:

(a) The Lessee shall have paid all amounts of accrued Rent
then due and owing and any other amounts due to the Owner Participant and
the Owner Trustee under the Related Lease and the other Related Transaction
Documents through the Exchange Date;

(b) The securities issued in exchange for the Notes shall be
issued in the same aggregate principal amount as the Related Notes then
Outstanding after giving effect to all payments of Rent being made in
connection with such exchange, bear the same interest rate, be payable in
installments in the same manner, if applicable, have the same Stated
Maturity and otherwise have substantially the same terms as the Related
Notes, except that in the case of such new securities shall not contain any
provisions relating to any security interest or deed of trust in respect of
the Related Lessor Interests;

(c) The new securities shall be issued under an indenture
reasonably satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the Lessee;

required to be paid to the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant pursuant
to the Transaction Documents in connection with such exchange;

(e) The exchange shall comply in all material respects with
applicable securities laws;

(f) The Indenture Trustee shall have received, on or prior
to the Exchange Date, evidence of all corporate action referred to in the
Opinion or Opinions of Counsel referred to below;

(g) The Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee shall have
received an Opinion or Opinions of Counsel for the Lessee, dated the
Exchange Date, which, subject to customary qualifications, shall be to the
effect that, after giving effect to the new indenture:

binding obligation of the Lessee, enforceable against the Lessee
in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
by general principles of equity, and except as limited by
applicable laws which may affect the remedies provided for in
this Indenture;

(ii) if any Pass Through Trust holds any Related Notes,
the exchange will not cause, nor can it be reasonably foreseen to
cause, any such Pass Through Trust to become an "investment
company," as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended;

(iii) (A) no Related Noteholder will be required to
recognize income, gain or loss for tax purposes in connection
with such exchange; and (B) such exchange will not cause any
adverse tax consequences to the holders of the Related Notes (or,
so long as any Pass Through Certificates remain outstanding, to
the holders of such Pass Through Certificates); and

(iv) to such other effect as shall be customary in
opinions delivered to such persons in connection with the
issuance of similar unsecured debt securities.

If all of the foregoing conditions are satisfied, then, automatically and
without the requirement of further action by any Person, effective as of
the Exchange Date, the Owner Trustee shall be released from all of its
obligations under this Indenture in respect of the exchanged Notes or
otherwise (other than any obligations or liabilities of the Owner Trustee
in its individual capacity incurred on or prior to the Exchange Date or
arising out of or based upon events occurring on or prior to the Exchange
Date, which obligations and liabilities shall remain the sole
responsibility of the Owner Trustee). Any Related Notes that are not
actually surrendered and cancelled shall be deemed to have been so
surrendered and cancelled and exchanged for the new securities issued in
accordance with this Section 13.1.

SECTION 13.2 Exchange of Obligations of Owner Trustee for
Secured Obligations of the Lessee. Upon the termination of any Lease
pursuant to Section 14 thereof and the Lessee and the Lessor have failed to
sell the Related Leased Property and the Lessor shall be deemed to have
elected to sell the Related Leased Property to the Lessee pursuant to
Section 14(c)(i) thereof, the Lessee may, pursuant to Section 9.1 of the
Participation Agreement and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in (a) through (g) below, satisfy all of the rights and
obligations of the Owner Trustee under this Indenture in respect of the
Related Notes. In such event, the Related Notes shall be exchanged for
secured, full recourse securities of the Lessee to be issued under a new
indenture, as described below. Such new securities will be issued on the
Termination Date (such date being referred to hereinafter as the "Exchange
Date"). The following shall be conditions to the issuance of any new
securities in exchange for the Related Notes:

then due and owing and any other amounts due to the Owner Participant and

Documents through the Exchange Date;

Maturity and otherwise have substantially the same terms as the Related
Notes;

reasonably satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the Lessee;

(d) The Lessee shall have delivered to the Indenture Trustee
an Officers' Certificate, dated the Exchange Date, stating that the Lessee

required to be paid to the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant pursuant
to the Related Transaction Documents in connection with such exchange;

(e) The exchange shall comply in all material respects with
applicable securities laws;

(f) The Indenture Trustee shall have received, on or prior
to the Exchange Date, evidence of all corporate action referred to in the
Opinion or Opinions of Counsel referred to below;

(g) The Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee shall have
received an Opinion or Opinions of Counsel for the Lessee, dated the
Exchange Date, which, subject to customary qualifications, shall be to the
effect that, after giving effect to the new indenture:

(i) such indenture constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Lessee, enforceable against the Lessee
in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
by general principles of equity, and except as limited by
applicable laws which may affect the remedies provided for in
this Indenture;

(ii) if any Pass Through Trust holds any Related Notes,
the exchange will not cause, nor can it be reasonably foreseen to
cause, any such Pass Through Trust to become an "investment
company," as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended;

(iii) (A) no Related Noteholder will be required to
recognize income, gain or loss for tax purposes in connection
with such exchange; and (B) such exchange will not cause any
adverse tax consequences to the holders of the Related Notes (or,
so long as any Pass Through Certificates remain outstanding, to
the holders of such Pass Through Certificates);

(iv) to such other effect as shall be customary in
opinions delivered to such persons in connection with the
issuance of similar unsecured debt securities; and

(h) No Lien other than Permitted Liens shall exist upon any
of the Related Leased Properties subject to Section 14(c)(i) of such Lease
and the Indenture Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee shall have received
a supplemental title insurance policy or endorsement to the then existing
policy, in either case, evidencing that the condition of the first clause
of this Section 13.2(h) has been met.

If all of the foregoing conditions are satisfied, then, automatically and
without the requirement of further action by any Person, effective as of
the Exchange Date, the Owner Trustee shall be released from all of its
obligations under this Indenture in respect of the exchanged Notes or
otherwise (other than any obligations or liabilities of the Owner Trustee
in its individual capacity incurred on or prior to the Exchange Date or
arising out of or based upon events occurring on or prior to the Exchange
Date, which obligations and liabilities shall remain the sole
responsibility of the Owner Trustee). Any Related Notes that are not
actually surrendered and cancelled shall be deemed to have been so
surrendered and cancelled and exchanged for the new securities issued in
accordance with this Section 13.2.

(whether at maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise) or (B) as would
release the Lessee from its obligation in respect of payment of Basic Rent,
Casualty Value, Termination Value or any other amount payable under the

shall (apart from Excepted Payments) be received by the Owner Trustee, for
the benefit of, and immediately paid over to, the Indenture Trustee.

(cc) Subject to subparagraph (aa) above, but otherwise
without the consent of any of the Noteholders, at any time and from time to
time, the respective parties to the Transaction Documents may modify, amend

Supplemental Indenture or the Original Indenture) for the purpose of adding
any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the
provisions thereof or modifying in any manner the rights of the respective
parties thereunder or may give any consent or waiver thereunder; provided,
however, that no such modification, amendment, supplement, consent or
waiver shall without the consent of each Noteholder affected thereby,
modify, amend or supplement, or give any consent in respect of or waive any
provision of, Lease __ in such manner (i) as to reduce the amounts payable

hereby grants to the Indenture Trustee a security interest in such property
and the proceeds thereof and the Indenture Trustee shall have, in addition
to all rights and remedies provided herein and in the Original Indenture,

right, title and interest in and to the Rent under Lease __. Nothing
contained in this Second Supplemental Indenture, nor the exercise of the
right by Indenture Trustee to collect the Rent under Lease __, shall be
deemed to make Indenture Trustee a "mortgagee in possession" or shall be,
or be construed to be, an affirmation by Indenture Trustee of, or an
assumption of liability by Indenture Trustee under, or a subordination of
the lien of this Second Supplemental Indenture to, any tenancy, lease or
option.

SECTION 1.17 Default; Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any
Indenture Event of Default, but subject to the terms of the Original
Indenture, including, but not limited to, Sections 8.2, 8.3, 8.10 and 8.15
of the Original Indenture: (a) the Owner Trustee shall be in default under
this Second Supplemental Indenture, and upon acceleration of the maturity
of any Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Series __
Notes and the Original Indenture, all Secured Obligations shall immediately
become due and payable without further notice to the Owner Trustee and (b)
the Indenture Trustee may, without notice to or demand upon the Owner
Trustee, which are expressly waived by the Owner Trustee (except for
notices or demands otherwise required by Applicable Law to the extent not
effectively waived by the Owner Trustee and any notices or demands
specified below), and without releasing the Owner Trustee from any of the
Secured Obligations, exercise any one or more of the following remedies as
Indenture Trustee may determine:

(i) the Indenture Trustee may, either directly or through an
agent or court-appointed receiver, and without regard to the
adequacy of any security for the Secured Obligations, but subject
to Sections 8.3(a) and 8.10 of the Original Indenture, exercise
any or all of the rights and powers and pursue any or all of the
remedies under the Lease affecting Property (including
Section 16 thereof) and, in connection therewith, corresponding
remedies under this Section 1.19 and may take possession of all
or any part of the Indenture Estate [Series ___] and may exclude
the Owner Trustee and the Lessee and, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, all persons claiming under either of them wholly
or partly therefrom;

(ii) the Indenture Trustee may execute and deliver to
Trustee written declaration of default and demand for sale and
written notice of default and of election to cause all or any
part of the Indenture Estate [Series __] to be sold, which notice
Trustee shall cause to be filed for record; and after the lapse
of such time as may then be required by law following the
recordation of such notice of default, and notice of sale having
been given as then required by law, Trustee, without demand on
the Owner Trustee, shall sell such property at the time and place
fixed by it in such notice of sale, either as a whole or in
separate parcels and in such order as the Indenture Trustee may
direct (the Owner Trustee waiving any right to direct the order
of sale), at public auction to the highest bidder for cash in
lawful money of the United States (or cash equivalents acceptable
to Trustee to the extent permitted by applicable law), payable at
the time of sale. Trustee may postpone the sale of all or any
part of the Indenture Estate [Series __] by public announcement
at such time and place of sale, and from time to time after any
such postponement may postpone such sale by public announcement
at the time fixed by the preceding postponement. Trustee shall
deliver to the purchaser at such sale its deed conveying the
property so sold, but without any covenant or warranty, express
or implied, and the recitals in such deed of any matters or facts
shall be conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof. Any
person, including Trustee or the Indenture Trustee, may purchase
at such sale, and any bid by the Indenture Trustee may be, in
whole or in part, in the form of cancellation of all or any part
of the Secured Obligations. Any such sale shall be free and
clear of any interest of the Owner Trustee and any lease,
encumbrance or other matter affecting the property so sold which
is subject or subordinate to this Second Supplemental Indenture,
except that any such sale shall not result in the termination of
any such lease (A) if and to the extent otherwise provided in any
estoppel or other agreement executed by the tenant and the
Indenture Trustee (or executed by the tenant in favor of, and
accepted by, the Indenture Trustee), or (B) if the purchaser at
such sale gives written notice to the tenant, within 30 days
after date of sale, that the lease will continue in effect;

(iii) with respect to any personal property secured hereby,
the Indenture Trustee shall have in any jurisdiction where
enforcement of this Second Supplemental Indenture is sought all
remedies of a secured party under the UCC and may require the
Owner Trustee, on demand, to assemble all personal property
secured hereby and make it available to the Indenture Trustee at
places that the Indenture Trustee may select that are reasonably
convenient for both parties, whether at the premises of the Owner
Trustee or elsewhere; and

(iv) the Indenture Trustee may proceed to protect, exercise
and enforce any and all other remedies provided under the Series
___ Notes, the Original Indenture or by applicable laws.

Each of the remedies provided in this Second Supplemental
Indenture is cumulative and not exclusive of, and shall not prejudice, any
other remedy provided in this Second Supplemental Indenture or by
applicable laws or under any other Transaction Document. Each remedy may
be exercised from time to time as often as deemed necessary by Trustee and
the Indenture Trustee, and in such order and manner as the Indenture
Trustee may determine. This Second Supplemental Indenture is independent
of any other security for the Secured Obligations, and upon the occurrence
of an Indenture Event of Default, Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may
proceed in the enforcement of this Second Supplemental Indenture
independently of any other remedy that Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may
at any time hold with respect to the Indenture Estate [Series __] or the
Secured Obligations or any other security. The Owner Trustee, for itself
and for any other person claiming by or through the Owner Trustee, waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, all rights to require a
marshalling of assets by Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or to require
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee to first resort to any particular portion
of the Indenture Estate [Series __] or any other security (whether such
portion shall have been retained or conveyed by the Owner Trustee) before
resorting to any other portion, and all rights of redemption, stay and
appraisal.

Anything to the contrary provided in this Second Supplemental
Indenture or the Original Indenture notwithstanding, the Indenture Trustee
shall not exercise any remedy hereunder other than the commencement of an
action for judicial foreclosure of the lien of this Second Supplemental
Indenture unless the Indenture Trustee shall either (i) simultaneously and
in conjunction with the exercise of such remedy, commence and pursue an
action for judicial foreclosure of the lien of this Second Supplemental

promises to pay to the Registered Noteholder named above, or registered

Amount as set forth herein below due and payable at Stated Maturity
specified above (provided, however, that if the obligations evidenced by
this Series __ Note shall become due and payable (upon redemption or
acceleration or otherwise) during the Pre-Commencement Period, the
principal amount thereof to be paid shall be the Accreted Value of such
date of redemption, acceleration or payment of this Series __ Note) and to
pay interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months) at the interest rate per annum specified above on the principal
amount from time to time Outstanding in respect of the period commencing on

that, if the Accreted Value of this Series __ Note is not paid when due
(upon redemption or acceleration or otherwise) during the Pre-Commencement
Date Period, interest on the Accreted Value of this Series __ Note as at
the date such Accreted Value was not paid shall accrue (and be payable on
demand) at the interest rate per annum specified above from such date until
such Accreted Value shall have been paid in full. Original Issue Discount
(the difference between Original Issue Price and Relevant Principal Amount
of this Series __ Note) shall accrue on this Series __ Note at the interest
rate specified above, on a semi-annual bond equivalent basis using a 360-
day year composed of twelve 30-day months, during the Pre-Commencement Date
Period. The principal amount evidenced by this Series __ Note at the date

All amounts payable by the Owner Trustee hereunder and under the Trust
Indenture and Security Agreement, dated as of December 21, 1993, between
the Owner Trustee and Wilmington Trust Company, as Indenture Trustee
(herein called the "Indenture Trustee", which term includes any successor
Indenture Trustee under the Indenture (as defined below)), as supplemented
by the First Supplemental Indenture [Series __], dated as of December 21,
1993, which was recorded in the Official Records of _______ County,
California, and by the Second Supplemental Indenture [Series __], dated as
of April 1, 1994, which Second Supplemental Indenture [Series __] is
intended to be recorded forthwith in such Official Records (the Trust
Indenture and Security Agreement (the "Original Indenture"), together with
all indentures supplemental thereto, herein called the "Indenture"), shall
be made only from assets subject to, or intended to be subject to the lien
of the Indenture, the income and all payments of principal and interest
shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Each
Noteholder, by its acceptance of this Series __ Note, agrees that (a)
except as otherwise expressly provided in the Indenture, it will look
solely to the assets subject to or intended to be subject to the lien of
the Indenture or the income and proceeds received by the Indenture Trustee
therefrom to the extent available for distribution to the Noteholder as
provided in the Indenture and (b) neither the Owner Participant nor, except
as otherwise expressly provided in the Indenture and the other Transaction
Documents, the Owner Trustee, in its individual capacity, is liable to the
Noteholder for any amounts payable under this Series __ Note or the
Indenture. Without in any way affecting the limitations on liability set
forth in Sections 1.13 and 2.12 of the Original Indenture, Article II of
the Participation Agreement and Sections 4 and 21(i) of Lease __, the
Indenture Trustee, and each Noteholder by accepting this Series __ Note,
hereby acknowledge and agree that none of the Owner Trustee, the Owner
Participant, or any director, officer, employee, stockholder, agent or
Affiliate of the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant (the "Exculpated
Persons") shall have any obligation, duty or liability of any kind
whatsoever to the Indenture Trustee or any such Noteholder in connection
with the exercise by any Exculpated Person of any rights of the Owner
Trustee under Section 8 of Lease __, or the taking of any action or the
failure to take any action by any Exculpated Person in connection with any
rights of the Owner Trustee under Section 8 of Lease __, and the Indenture
Trustee and each such Noteholder hereby waives and releases, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, each Exculpated Person of any and all such
obligations, duties or liabilities.

The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on
the applicable Interest Payment Date, as provided in the Indenture, shall
be paid to the Person in whose name this Series __ Note is registered at
the close of business on the Record Date for such Interest Payment Date,
which shall be the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) next
preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually
paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
registered Noteholder on such Record Date and may be paid to the Person in
whose name this Series __ Note is registered at the close of business on a
subsequent Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be
fixed by the Indenture Trustee (which date shall be not less than 10
Business Days prior to the payment of such Defaulted Interest), notice of
which shall be given to Noteholders entitled thereto not less than 15 days
preceding such subsequent Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any
other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any
securities exchange on which the Series __ Notes may be listed, and upon
such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided
in the Indenture.

The principal of, Premium, if any, and interest on this Series __ Note
shall be payable in immediately available funds at the principal corporate
trust office of the Indenture Trustee or at any office or agency maintained
for such purpose pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Original Indenture, or as
otherwise directed in the manner provided in the Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision herein to the contrary, the
Indenture Trustee will pay, or cause to be paid, if so requested by any
Holder of this Series __ Note by written notice to the Owner Trustee and
the Indenture Trustee, all amounts payable by the Owner Trustee hereunder
to such Holder of this Series __ Note or a nominee therefor either (i) by
transferring by wire in immediately available funds to an account
maintained by such Holder with a bank in the United States the amount to be
distributed to such Holder or (ii) by mailing a check denominated in U.S.
dollars to such Holder at such address as such Holder of this Series __
Note shall have specified in such notice, in any case without any
presentment or surrender of this Series __ Note except that the Holder
shall surrender this Series __ Note to the Indenture Trustee upon payment
in full of the principal amount of and interest on this Series __ Note and
such other sums as may then be payable to such Holder under the Indenture
or under this Series __ Note.

Capitalized terms used in this Series __ Note which are not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Appendix A to
the Original Indenture, as amended. Reference is made to the Indenture and
all supplements and amendments thereto (a copy of which is on file with the
Indenture Trustee at its principal corporate trust office) for a more
complete statement of the terms and provisions thereof, including a
statement of the properties thereby conveyed, pledged, mortgaged and
assigned, the nature and extent of the security, the respective rights
thereunder of the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders
and the terms upon which the Series __ Notes are, and are to be, executed
and delivered, as well as a statement of the terms and conditions of the
trust created by the Indenture, to all of which terms and conditions in the
Indenture each Holder agrees by its acceptance of this Series __ Note.
Except as provided in the Indenture, the Series __ Notes are limited in
aggregate Relevant Principal Amount Outstanding to [ ] and all of
which will have a Stated Maturity on [ ].

All of the Relevant Principal Amount of this Series Note will be due
and payable at the Stated Maturity set forth above.

As more fully provided in the Indenture, the Series __ Notes are
subject to redemption under the circumstances set forth in Article 6 of
the Original Indenture.

If an Indenture Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the
Accreted Value (at any date prior to the Commencement Date) on the Relevant
Principal Amount (at any date thereafter), as the case may be, and any
interest accrued hereon of the Series __ Notes may, subject to certain
rights of the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant (or both) contained or
referred to in the Indenture, be declared due and payable in the manner and
with the effect provided in the Indenture. If, and only if, such an
Indenture Event of Default constitutes an Event of Default by the Lessee
under Lease __, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, including
certain specified limitations, the Indenture Trustee may declare Lease __
to be in default, and may exercise one or more of the remedies of the Owner
Trustee provided in Lease __. Such remedies include the right to
terminate Lease __ and repossess and use or relet the Lessor Interest
originally leased under Lease __, to sell such Lessor Interest or any part
thereof free and clear of the Lessee's rights and retain the proceeds and,
so long as the Owner Trustee has not sold such Lessor Interest, to require
the Lessee to pay as liquidated damages for loss of bargain and not as a
penalty (in lieu of Basic Rent due after the payment date) and, in the case
of a payment under clause (d) below, as consideration for the Owner
Trustee's obligation to transfer such Lessor Interest to the Lessee and to
surrender certain unpaid Rent under Lease __.

The Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant may cure any default by the
Lessee under Lease __ arising from the failure of the Lessee to make any
payment of Basic Rent under Lease __, provided that such failure of the
Lessee is not the third consecutive such failure, or the sixth cumulative
such failure. In the event of any default by the Lessee of any obligation
under Lease __ (other than the obligation to pay Basic Rent), the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant may (but are not obligated to, to the
extent not prohibited by Applicable Law), make any payment or perform or
comply with any such agreement as the Lessee shall be obligated to pay,
perform or comply with under Lease __.

The right of the Holder of this Series __ Note to institute action for
any remedy under the Indenture, including the enforcement of payment of any
amount due hereon, is subject to certain restrictions specified in the
Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the
entire principal of all the Series__ Notes upon compliance by the Owner
Trustee with certain conditions set forth therein.

Following an Indenture Event of Default, the Owner Trustee may,
subject to the conditions specified in the Indenture, purchase all of the
Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Each Noteholder, by
accepting this Series __ Note, agrees, subject to the provisions of the
Indenture, that, upon payment to the Indenture Trustee of the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, without premium or
penalty, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon to the date of
such payment (as well as any interest on overdue principal and, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, overdue interest) and any other amounts
due and payable to the Noteholders, and upon satisfaction of all of the
conditions contained in the Indenture pertaining to the purchase of the
Notes by the Owner Trustee, such Holder shall be deemed to have sold this
Series __ Note to the Owner Trustee or its designee.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, this Series __ Note is transferable on the Note
Register, upon surrender of this Series __ Note for registration of
transfer at the office or agency of the Note Registrar to be maintained for
that purpose in Wilmington, Delaware or at any other office or agency of
the Note Registrar maintained for that purpose, duly endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Note Registrar duly executed by the Noteholder or his attorney duly
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Series __ Notes of the
same series with the same interest rate and Stated Maturity as the Series
__ Notes so to be transferred; of authorized denominations and for the same
aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

The Series __ Notes are issuable only in registered form in
denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. As provided in the
Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Series
__ Notes are exchangeable at the office or agency of the Note Registrar
maintained for that purpose for an equal aggregate principal amount of
Series __ Notes of the same series with the same interest rate and Stated
Maturity and of a different authorized denomination or denominations, as
requested by the Series __ Noteholder surrendering the same.

No service charge will be made to any Noteholder for any such transfer
or exchange, but the Note Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection
therewith.

Prior to due presentation of this Note for registration or transfer,
the Person in whose name this Series __ Note is registered shall be deemed
to be the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment as
herein provided and for all other purposes whether or not this Series __
Note shall be overdue, regardless of any notice to anyone to the contrary.

THE SERIES __ NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE CHOICE OF
LAW DOCTRINE OF SUCH STATE.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Owner Trustee has caused this instrument to be
duly executed.

As more fully provided in the Indenture, the Series __ Notes are
subject to redemption under the circumstances set forth in Article 6 of
the Original Indenture.

If an Indenture Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the
principal amount remaining unpaid and any interest accrued hereon of the
Series __ Notes may, subject to certain rights of the Owner Trustee or the
Owner Participant (or both) contained or referred to in the Indenture, be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture. If, and only if, such an Indenture Event of Default constitutes
an Event of Default by the Lessee under Lease __, subject to the provisions
of the Indenture, including certain specified limitations, the Indenture
Trustee may declare Lease __ to be in default, and may exercise one or more
of the remedies of the Owner Trustee provided in Lease __. Such remedies
include the right to terminate Lease __ and repossess and use or relet the
Lessor Interest originally leased under Lease __, to sell such Lessor
Interest or any part thereof free and clear of the Lessee's rights and
retain the proceeds and, so long as the Owner Trustee has not sold such
Lessor Interest, to require the Lessee to pay as liquidated damages for
loss of bargain and not as a penalty (in lieu of Basic Rent due after the
payment date) and, in the case of a payment under clause (d) below, as
consideration for the Owner Trustee's obligation to transfer such Lessor
Interest to the Lessee and to surrender certain unpaid Rent under Lease __.

The Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant may cure any default
by the Lessee under Lease __ arising from the failure of the Lessee to make
any payment of Basic Rent under Lease __, provided that such failure of the
Lessee is not the third consecutive such failure, or the sixth cumulative
such failure. In the event of any default by the Lessee of any obligation
under Lease __ (other than the obligation to pay Basic Rent), the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant may (but are not obligated to, to the
extent not prohibited by Applicable Law), make any payment or perform or
comply with any such agreement as the Lessee shall be obligated to pay,
perform or comply with under Lease __.

The right of the Holder of this Series __ Note to institute
action for any remedy under the Indenture, including the enforcement of
payment of any amount due hereon, is subject to certain restrictions
specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of
the entire principal of all the Series__ Notes upon compliance by the Owner
Trustee with certain conditions set forth therein.

Following an Indenture Event of Default, the Owner Trustee may,
subject to the conditions specified in the Indenture, purchase all of the
Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Each Noteholder, by
accepting this Series __ Note, agrees, subject to the provisions of the
Indenture, that, upon payment to the Indenture Trustee of the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, without premium or
penalty, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon to the date of
such payment (as well as any interest on overdue principal and, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, overdue interest) and any other amounts
due and payable to the Noteholders, and upon satisfaction of all of the
conditions contained in the Indenture pertaining to the purchase of the
Notes by the Owner Trustee, such Holder shall be deemed to have sold this
Series __ Note to the Owner Trustee or its designee.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, this Series __ Note is transferable on the Note
Register, upon surrender of this Series __ Note for registration of
transfer at the office or agency of the Note Registrar to be maintained for
that purpose in Wilmington, Delaware or at any other office or agency of
the Note Registrar maintained for that purpose, duly endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Note Registrar duly executed by the Noteholder or his attorney duly
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Series __ Notes of the
same series with the same interest rate and Stated Maturity as the Series
__ Notes so to be transferred; of authorized denominations and for the same
aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

The Series __ Notes are issuable only in registered form in
denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. As provided in the
Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Series
__ Notes are exchangeable at the office or agency of the Note Registrar
maintained for that purpose for an equal aggregate principal amount of
Series __ Notes of the same series with the same interest rate and Stated
Maturity and of a different authorized denomination or denominations, as
requested by the Series __ Noteholder surrendering the same.

No service charge will be made to any Noteholder for any such
transfer or exchange, but the Note Registrar may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in
connection therewith.

Prior to due presentation of this Note for registration or
transfer, the Person in whose name this Series __ Note is registered shall
be deemed to be the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of receiving
payment as herein provided and for all other purposes whether or not this
Series __ Note shall be overdue, regardless of any notice to anyone to the
contrary.

THE SERIES __ NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE
CHOICE OF LAW DOCTRINE OF SUCH STATE.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Owner Trustee has caused this instrument

REGISTERED NOTEHOLDER:

STATE STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA, NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION, a national banking association, not in its individual
capacity, but solely as Owner Trustee (hereinafter called the "Owner
Trustee," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture
referred to herein) under the Trust Agreement dated as of [December 21,
1993,] with the Owner Participant named therein (together with its
permitted successors and assigns, hereinafter called the "Owner
Participant"), for value received and intending to be legally bound, hereby
promises to pay to the Registered Noteholder named above or registered
assigns, the principal sum in Dollars equal to $_____________ in
installments on each Installment Payment Date as set forth in Annex A
hereto with the final installment due and payable at Stated Maturity
Specified above and to pay interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day
year of twelve 30-day months) at the interest rate per annum specified in
Annex A hereto on the principal amount from time to time Outstanding in
respect of the period commencing on and including the date hereof and
ending on and excluding the date when the principal amount hereof shall
have been paid in full, payable on each Series __ Interest Payment Date as
set forth in Annex A hereto.

All amounts payable by the Owner Trustee hereunder and under the
Indenture and Security Agreement dated as of _________________ (the
"Original Indenture"), between the Owner Trustee and Wilmington Trust
Company, as Indenture Trustee (herein called the "Indenture Trustee," which
term includes any successor Indenture Trustee under the Indenture (as
defined below)), which Original Indenture, as supplemented by the Deed of
Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture
Filing (containing a supplemental indenture) [Series __-1], dated as of
________________ (the "Second Supplemental Indenture [Series __-1]), which
Second Supplemental Indenture [Series __-1] is intended to be recorded
forthwith in the Official Records (the Original Indenture together with the
Second Supplemental Indenture [Series __-1] and all other indentures
supplemental thereto, herein called the "Indenture"), shall be made only
from assets subject to, or intended to be subject to the Lien of the
Indenture, the income and all payments of principal and interest shall be
made in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Each Noteholder, by
its acceptance of this __-1 Note, agrees that (a) except as otherwise
expressly provided in the Indenture, it will look solely to the assets
subject to or intended to be subject to the Lien of the Indenture in
respect of the Indenture Estate [Series __-1] or the income and proceeds
received by the Indenture Trustee therefrom to the extent available for
distribution to the Noteholder as provided in the Indenture and (b) neither
the Owner Participant nor, except as otherwise expressly provided in the
Indenture and the other Transaction Documents, the Owner Trustee, in its
individual capacity, is liable to the Noteholder for any amounts payable
under this __-1 Note or the Indenture. Without in any way affecting the
limitations on liability set forth in Sections 1.13 and 2.12 of the
Original Indenture, Article II of the Participation Agreement and Sections
4 and 21(i) of Lease __, the Indenture Trustee, and each Noteholder by
accepting this __-1 Note, hereby acknowledges and agrees that none of the
Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant, or any director, officer, employee,
stockholder, agent or Affiliate of the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant (the "Exculpated Persons") shall have any obligation, duty or
liability of any kind whatsoever to the Indenture Trustee or any such
Noteholder in connection with the exercise by any Exculpated Person of any
rights of the Owner Trustee under Section 8 of Lease __, or the taking of
any action or the failure to take any action by any Exculpated Person in
connection with any rights of the Owner Trustee under Section 8 of the
Leases, and the Indenture Trustee and each such Noteholder hereby waives
and releases, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Exculpated
Person of any and all such obligations, duties or liabilities.

The interest or Installment Payment Amount (other than that
payable on the Stated Maturity hereof) so payable, and punctually paid or
duly provided for, on the applicable Series __ Interest Payment Date or
Installment Payment Date, as the case may be, as provided in the Indenture,
shall be paid to the Person in whose name this __-1 Note is registered at
the close of business on the Record Date for payment of such interest or
Installment Payment Amount, which shall be the fifteenth day (whether or
not a Business Day) next preceding such Series __ Interest Payment Date or
Installment Payment Date, as the case may be. Any such interest or
Installment Payment Amount not so punctually paid or duly provided for
shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Noteholder on such
Record Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this __-1 Note is
registered at the close of business on a subsequent Record Date for the
payment of such Defaulted Interest or Defaulted Installment to be fixed by
the Indenture Trustee (which date shall be not less than 10 Business Days
prior to the payment of such Defaulted Interest or Defaulted Installment),
notice of which shall be given to Noteholders entitled thereto not less
than 15 days preceding such subsequent Record Date, or may be paid at any
time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of
any securities exchange on which the __-1 Note may be listed, and upon such
notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in
the Indenture.

The principal of, Premium, if any, and interest on this __-1 Note
shall be payable in immediately available funds at the principal corporate
trust office of the Indenture Trustee or at any office or agency maintained
for such purpose pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Original Indenture, or as
otherwise directed in the manner provided in the Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision herein to the contrary, the
Indenture Trustee will pay, or cause to be paid, if so requested by any
Holder of this __-1 Note by written notice to the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee, all amounts payable by the Owner Trustee hereunder to
such Holder of this __-1 Note or a nominee therefor either (i) by
transferring by wire in immediately available funds to an account
maintained by such Holder with a bank in the United States the amount to be
distributed to such Holder or (ii) by mailing a check denominated in U.S.
dollars to such Holder at such address as such Holder of this __-1 Note
shall have specified in such notice, in any case without any presentment or
surrender of this __-1 Note except that the Holder shall surrender this __-
1 Note to the Indenture Trustee upon payment in full of the principal
amount of and interest on this __-1 Note and such other sums as may then be
payable to such Holder under the Indenture or under this __-1 Note.

defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Appendix A to
the Original Indenture. Reference is made to the Original Indenture and all
amendments thereto (a copy of which is on file with the Indenture Trustee

the terms and provisions thereof, including a statement of the properties
thereby conveyed, pledged, mortgaged and assigned, the nature and extent of
the security, the respective rights thereunder of the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders and the terms upon which the __-1
Notes are, and are to be, executed and delivered, as well as a statement of

As more fully provided in the Indenture, the __-1 Notes are
subject to redemption under the circumstances set forth in Article 6 of the
Original Indenture and under the circumstances set forth in Article 7 of
the Original Indenture.

If an Indenture Event of Default shall occur and be continuing,
the principal amount remaining unpaid and any interest accrued hereon of
the __-1 Notes may, subject to certain rights of the Owner Trustee or the
Owner Participant (or both) contained or referred to in the Indenture, be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture. If, and only if, such an Indenture Event of Default constitutes
an Event of Default under Lease __ by the Lessee, subject to the provisions
of the Indenture, including certain specified limitations, the Indenture
Trustee may declare Lease __ to be in default, and may exercise one or more
of the remedies of the Owner Trustee provided in Lease __. Such remedies
include the right to terminate Lease __ and repossess and use or relet the
Lessor Interest originally leased under Lease __, to sell such Lessor
Interest or any part thereof free and clear of the Lessee's rights and
retain the proceeds and, so long as the Owner Trustee has not sold such
Lessor Interest, to require the Lessee to pay as liquidated damages for
loss of bargain and not as a penalty (in lieu of Basic Rent due after the
payment date) and, in the case of a payment under clause (d) below, as
consideration for the Owner Trustee's obligation to transfer such Lessor
Interest to the Lessee and to surrender certain unpaid Rent under Lease __.

The Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant may cure any default
by the Lessee under Lease __ arising from the failure of the Lessee to make
any payment of Basic Rent under Lease __, provided that such failure of the
Lessee is not the third consecutive such failure, or the sixth cumulative
such failure. In the event of any default by the Lessee of any obligation
under Lease __ (other than the obligation to pay Basic Rent), the Owner.
Trustee or the Owner Participant may (but are not obligated to, to the
extent not prohibited by Applicable Law), make any payment or perform or
comply with any such agreement as the Lessee shall be obligated to pay,
perform or comply with under Lease __.

The right of the Holder of this __-1 Note to institute action for
any remedy under the Indenture, including the enforcement of payment of any
amount due hereon, is subject to certain restrictions specified in the
Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of
the entire principal of all the Notes of any or all series (including the
Series __ Notes) upon compliance by the Owner Trustee with certain
conditions set forth therein.

Following an Indenture Event of Default, the Owner Trustee may,
subject to the conditions specified in the Indenture, purchase all of the
Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Each Noteholder, by
accepting this __-1 Note, agrees, subject to the provisions of the
Indenture, that, upon payment to the Indenture Trustee of the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, without Premium or
penalty, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon to the date of
such payment (as well as any interest on overdue principal and, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, overdue interest) and any other amounts
due and payable to the Noteholders, and upon satisfaction of all of the
conditions contained in the Indenture pertaining to the purchase of the
Notes by the Owner Trustee, such Holder shall be deemed to have sold this
__-1 Note to the Owner Trustee or its designee.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, this __-1 Note is transferable on the Note Register,
upon surrender of this __-1 Note for registration of transfer at the office
or agency of the Note Registrar to be maintained for that purpose in the
Wilmington, Delaware or at any other office or agency of the Note Registrar
maintained for that purpose, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Note Registrar duly
executed by the Noteholder or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and
thereupon one or more new __-1 Notes of the same series with the same
interest rate and Stated Maturity as the __-1 Notes so to be transferred;
of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount,
will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

The __-1 Notes are issuable only in registered form in
denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof except that one __-1
Note of each maturity may be in a denomination other than an integral
multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the __-1 Notes are exchangeable at the
office or agency of the Note Registrar maintained for that purpose for an
equal aggregate principal amount of __-1 Notes of the same series with the
same interest rate and Stated Maturity and of a different authorized
denomination or denominations, as requested by the __-1 Noteholder
surrendering the same.

No service charge will be made to any Noteholder for any such
transfer or exchange, but the Note Registrar may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in
connection therewith.

Prior to due presentation of this Note for registration or
transfer, the Person in whose name this __-1 Note is registered shall be
deemed to be the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment
as herein provided and for all other purposes whether or not this __-1 Note
shall be overdue, regardless of any notice to anyone to the contrary.

This Agreement, dated as of December 21, 1993 by and between
CALIFORNIA-RELCO LIMITED PARTNERSHIP TRUST (the "Optionor"), and STATE
STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, not in
its individual capacity but solely as Owner Trustee (the "Optionee") for
PMCC Leasing Corporation under the Trust Agreement dated as of December 21,
1993.

R E C I T A L S :

WHEREAS, reference is made to that certain Participation Agreement
dated as of the date hereof (the "Participation Agreement") among Smith's
Food & Drug Centers, Inc., as Lessee, PMCC Leasing Corporation, as Owner
Participant, Philip Morris Capital Corporation, as Owner Participant
Parent, the Optionee, the Optionor, Wilmington Trust Company, not in its
individual capacity, except as expressly stated in the Participation
Agreement, but solely as Indenture Trustee, Pass Through Trustee and
Remainderman Trustee under the Remainderman Trust Agreement, California-
Relco Limited Partnership, as Remainderman Participant, and Bank of
America, National Trust and Savings Association, as Initial Noteholder.
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in Appendix A to the Participation Agreement.

WHEREAS, Optionor is the owner of fee simple estates in those certain
parcels of Land (such parcels of Land are more particularly described in
Exhibit A annexed hereto) subject to the Estates for Years (collectively,
the "Remainderman Interests") expiring January 2, 2019; and

WHEREAS, Optionee is (i) the owner of the Estates for Years and (ii)
the owner in fee simple of the Improvements on the Properties
(collectively, the "Optionee Interests"); and

WHEREAS, the Properties are comprised solely of the Optionee Interests
and the Remainderman Interests and are subject to the Leases, under which
Optionee is the lessor; and

WHEREAS, Optionee may wish to lease from Optionor all or a portion of
the Land upon the Estate for Years Expiration Date and Optionor is willing
to lease all or a portion of its right, title and interest therein to
Optionee and has agreed to grant to Optionee an option to lease the Land at
such times and upon the conditions as hereinafter set forth; and

WHEREAS, Optionee may wish to purchase from Optionor all or a portion
of the Land and Optionor is willing to grant to Optionee an option to
purchase the Land at the times and upon the conditions as hereinafter set
forth.

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, it is hereby mutually
covenanted and agreed by and between Optionor and Optionee as follows:

1. Grant of Option.

Optionor hereby grants to Optionee the exclusive and irrevocable
options (the "Option") (a) to lease from Optionor one or more parcels of
the Land in each case pursuant to a ground lease (the "Ground Lease")
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B to the Participation
Agreement, the term of which will commence on the Estate for Years
Expiration Date, and shall expire as provided for herein, and (b) to
purchase one or more parcels of the Land on the terms set forth herein.
The purchase price for the Option shall be the Option Amount.

2. Exercise.

(a) If Lessee extends the Lease Term of the Leases for the first
Fixed-Rate Renewal Term as set forth in Section 12(a) of each Lease, and
unless Optionee has exercised the Purchase Option set forth in Section 6
hereof, the Option to enter into the Ground Lease with respect to the
Related Property will be deemed to have been exercised, without the need
for any action on the part of Optionee or Optionor. Optionee agrees to
give Optionor notice of the extension for the first Fixed-Rate Renewal Term
of the Leases by Lessee promptly after Optionee receives any notice of
extension from Lessee, and to deliver promptly two (2) counterparts of the
Ground Lease with respect to each parcel of the Land executed and
acknowledged by Optionee to Optionor, provided, that failure by Optionee to
give such notice will not affect the rights of Optionee hereunder.

(b) If Optionee desires to exercise the Option to enter into the
Ground Lease as to any parcel of Land and Section 2(a) is not applicable,
Optionee must exercise such Option by sending written notice to Optionor no
later than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Estate for Years
Expiration Date (the "Option Expiration Date") accompanied by two (2)
counterparts of the Ground Lease pertaining to such Land executed by
Optionee. Subject to the following sentence, failure of the Optionee to
give such notice on or prior to the Option Expiration Date shall cause the
Option to expire. Optionor shall give Optionee a reminder notice (the
"Reminder Notice") of the Option Expiration Date not more than twelve (12)
months prior to the Option Expiration Date; provided, however, that if
Optionor fails to give such Reminder Notice by the date which is sixty (60)
days prior to the Option Expiration Date, the Option Expiration Date shall
be extended to the date which is sixty (60) days after the date Optionee
receives the Reminder Notice; and further, provided, however, that if,
pursuant to the terms of this sentence, the Option, as so extended, expires
without being exercised, then Optionor may require Optionee to lease the
Property from Optionor pursuant to the terms of the Ground Lease for a
period of time (the "Remainder Term") commencing immediately upon
expiration of the Estate for Years and ending upon the earlier to occur of
(i) Optionee's written waiver of its right to exercise the Option and (ii)
11:59 p.m. on the date the Option, as so extended, expires. During the
Remainder Term, Optionee will pay rent, if any, monthly in arrears at the
rate set forth in the Ground Lease, pro rated for the number of days in the
Remainder Term (and payable on the last day of a month), and
notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Ground Lease, Optionee
will not be permitted to renew the Ground Lease at the expiration of the
Remainder Term.

(c) As to each parcel of the Land, in the event that the Option to
enter into the Ground Lease is not deemed to be exercised pursuant to
Section 2(a) or Optionee fails to exercise either the Option to enter into
the Ground Lease or the Option to purchase the Remainderman Interests
pursuant to Article 6 hereof, all of Optionee's right, title and interest
in and to the Optionee Interests in respect of such Land shall terminate
and automatically and without further consideration vest on the Estate for
Years Expiration Date in Optionor. Optionee agrees, upon request of
Optionor, to execute and deliver to Optionor such documents in recordable
form as Optionor may reasonably require to confirm the foregoing.

3. Title.

The Optionor covenants to cause title to the Land on the commencement
of the term of the Ground Lease to be subject only to Permitted Liens.

4. The Ground Lease Terms.

Upon the exercise by Optionee of the Option to enter into the Ground
Lease with respect to the Land and receipt by Optionor of the executed and
acknowledged counterparts of the Ground Lease for each of the Properties,
Optionor agrees to execute and acknowledge and promptly return a
counterpart copy of the Ground Lease to Optionee. Failure to execute and
acknowledge the Ground Lease prior to the Estate for Years Expiration Date
shall not affect Optionee's right to obtain the leasehold estate in the
Land on said date under the terms set forth herein and in the Ground Lease
and to continued possession of the Land and the Improvements.

The basic terms of the Ground Lease shall be as follows:

Term: The Term will commence on the Estate for Years Expiration Date
and will terminate on the seventy-fifth (75) anniversary of the Estate for
Years Expiration Date, provided, that the Optionee may elect to terminate
the Term at any time after the termination of the Lease Term upon not less
than six (6) months prior written notice to Optionor.

Ground Rent: Ground Rent will be payable semi-annually in arrears on
January 2 and July 2 of each year in an amount equal to the amounts set
forth on Schedule 1 hereto.

5. Recordation of Ground Lease.

The Ground Lease or a memorandum thereof may be recorded by either
Optionor or Optionee in the appropriate public office or offices in the
county where the Land is located so as to constitute notice to third
parties of the contents of the Ground Lease. The party causing or
requiring the Ground Lease, any memorandum thereof, any sublease or
assignment or memorandum thereof to be recorded shall pay any recordation,
transfer, or other tax or fee whatsoever incident to such recordation.

6. Purchase Option.

Optionor hereby grants to Optionee an irrevocable option to purchase
on the Estate for Years Expiration Date (or at any time, in the event of
the bankruptcy of Optionor or if Optionor is in default under any
Transaction Document), the Related Remainderman Interest, subject to the
Related Lease if such Lease remains in effect at such time, with six (6)
months written notice to Optionor of Optionee's intention to do so (or on
five (5) days notice in the event of a bankruptcy of Optionor or a default
by Optionor under any Transaction Document). The purchase price to be paid
on exercise of this option shall be the Fair Market Sales Value of the
Related Remainderman Interest. In the event Optionor and Optionee are
unable to agree upon such Fair Market Sales Value, the same shall be
determined by the Appraisal Procedure, provided, that the terms "Optionor"
and "Optionee" shall replace the terms "Lessee" and "Owner Participant",
respectively, set forth in the definition thereof.

In making a determination of such Fair Market Sales Value, the
appraisers shall value the Related Remainderman Interest, considered as
encumbered by the Related Ground Lease, the Tripartite Agreement and this
Option Agreement. If Optionee purchases the Related Remainderman Interest
following a bankruptcy or breach of any Transaction Document by Optionor,
Optionee will pay to Optionor Optionee's estimate of Fair Market Sales
Value, and after Fair Market Sales Value is determined under the preceding
paragraph, the purchase price will be adjusted to reflect such Fair Market
Sales Value.

On the closing date fixed for the purchase of the Related Remainderman
Interest with respect to any Property, Optionee shall pay to Optionor, in
lawful money of the United States, the Fair Market Sales Value of such
Related Remainderman Interest and Optionor shall execute and deliver to
Optionee a good and sufficient grant deed, assignment and/or other
instruments as may be appropriate, in recordable form reasonably acceptable
to Optionee, which shall transfer Optionor's interest in the Related
Remainderman Interest.

Optionor shall pay any and all taxes and fees at that time customarily
paid by the seller in a real estate transaction in the area where the
applicable Property is located and Optionee shall pay all fees at that time
customarily paid by the purchaser.

The Optionor covenants to cause title to the Related Remainderman
Interest to be subject only to Permitted Liens.

7. Default Under Mortgage.

In the event that Optionee defaults under any mortgage or deed of
trust encumbering any of the Properties, Optionor agrees that Optionee's
rights hereunder, including the Related Option, may be exercised by
Optionee's mortgagee or the beneficiary of such deed of trust and their
respective assigns or by any purchaser or transferee of the applicable
Property at a foreclosure sale or in lieu of foreclosure or pursuant to a
plan or reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code in the same manner as if
exercised by Optionee hereunder. Optionor hereby acknowledges that
Optionee's rights hereunder have been assigned to the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to the Indenture and the Supplemental Indentures.

8. Broker.

The parties warrant and represent to each other that no broker or
finder brought about this Agreement.

9. Governing Law.

This Agreement shall be interpreted and governed by the laws of the
State of California.

10. Notices.

All notices and other instruments given or delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall be delivered pursuant to the Participation Agreement, if to
the Optionee, in accordance with notices to be delivered to the Owner
Trustee in Section 13.1 of the Participation Agreement, and if to the
Optionor, in accordance with notice to be delivered to the Remainderman
under Section 13.1 of the Participation Agreement.

11. Amendment.

This Agreement cannot be modified in any way except by written
instrument signed by Optionor and Optionee.

12. Captions.

The captions to the Paragraphs are used for convenience only and
shall not be construed to modify, limit or expand any of the terms hereof
or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties hereto.

13. Successors and Assigns.

Optionor and Optionee shall each have the right to assign its
rights hereunder in connection with any sale or transfer of its interest in
the Properties as permitted by the Transaction Documents. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective heirs, administrators, successors, assigns and grantees.

14. Rule Against Perpetuities, etc.

If any Option under this Agreement would, in the absence of the
limitation imposed by this Article 14, be invalid or unenforceable as being
in violation of the rule against perpetuities or any other rule of law
relating to the vesting of an interest in property or the suspension of the
power of alienation of property, then any option of Optionee hereunder
shall be exercisable by Optionee only during the period which shall end 20
years and 6 months after the date of death of the last survivor of the
descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, deceased father of the late President
John F. Kennedy, alive on the date of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

15. Certificates of Compliance. Upon the request of any party,
not more frequently than annually, each party to this Agreement will
deliver to the other party a certificate signed by an officer or general
partner of such party certifying that such party is in full compliance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

16. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

17. Nature of Obligations. The obligations hereunder are
covenants running with the Land and are superior to any subsequent
encumbrance or transfer of the Land.

18. Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto agrees to
execute, acknowledge, deliver and/or file such further certificates,
instruments, or documents, and to do all such further acts and things, as
may be required by Applicable Law, or as may reasonably be necessary or
advisable to carry out the intents and purposes of and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

19. No Waiver. No waiver or any provision of this Agreement
shall be effective unless it is in writing, signed by the party against
whom it is asserted and any such written waiver shall only be applicable to
the specific instance to which it relates and shall not be deemed to be a
continuing or future waiver.

20. Recordation. The parties hereto agree that, if required or
requested by any of them, this Agreement shall be recorded in the office of
the clerks of the counties in which the Properties are located.

21. Concerning the Trustee. State Street Bank and Trust Company
of California, National Association, is entering into this Option Agreement
not in its individual capacity but solely as Owner Trustee under the Trust
Agreement. Each of the obligations of the Trust herein are made solely for
the purpose of binding the Trust, and State Street Bank and Trust Company
of California, National Association, in its individual capacity shall have
no liability whatsoever with respect thereto.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Option
Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

Interest, the Remainderman will convey its corresponding Remainderman
Interest in the Related Property to the purchaser of the Lessor Interest
upon payment to the Remainderman of a purchase price equal to the Fair
Market Sales Value of the applicable Remainderman Interest. At the closing
of any such transfer as contemplated herein, the Remainderman shall deliver
such other documents, affidavits and certificates as are reasonably
required to effectuate the transfer of title.

(b) Allocation of Sales Proceeds. If both the Lessor

a third party, and if the allocations of the aggregate purchase price among
the respective interests in such Property is not agreed upon or otherwise

applicable purchase agreements, the Fair Market Sales Value shall be deemed

Fair Market Sales Value of the Remainderman Interest in
the Property.

4. Proceeds from Condemnation.

Condemnation is payable to the Lessor pursuant to any Lease, the Fair
Market Sales Value of the portion of the Property taken shall be deemed to
equal such net award and the Fair Market Sales Value of the Lessor Interest
which was taken plus the Fair Market Value of the Remainderman Interest
which was taken shall be deemed to be equal to the net award, and the net
award will be distributed as follows:

(i) to the Indenture Trustee, such amount as is
payable to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the terms of
the Indenture, if any;

(ii) to the Lessor, an amount equal to the then

such Remainderman Interest shall be considered as encumbered by the Ground
Lease, the Option Agreement and this Agreement.

7. Negative Covenants. The Remainderman will not (a) sell,
lease, transfer, convey, assign or otherwise dispose of their respective
interests in the Properties except to an entity which agrees to comply with

Agreement without the prior written consent of the Lessee; or (i) transfer
all or any part of the Remainderman Interests to any entity which is not

8. Non-Disturbance and Attornment. In the event that the Ground
Lease is in effect and terminates for any reason during the term of the

occurred and be continuing and the Lessee shall attorn to and recognize
Remainderman as the lessor under the Related Lease and shall promptly
execute and deliver any instrument that Remainderman may reasonably request
to evidence such attornment, the Lessee's possession of the Property
pursuant to such Lease shall not be disturbed and the Lease shall continue
in full force and effect as a direct lease between the Lessee, as lessee,
and Remainderman, as lessor (and Remainderman shall execute, and deliver to
Lessee any documents reasonably requested by the Lessee to evidence or
confirm such direct lease). In such event the Lessee agrees that
Remainderman shall not be:

(a) liable for any act or omission of any prior
lessor under the Lease; or

(b) subject to any offsets or defenses which the
Lessee might have against any prior lessor; or

(c) bound by any obligation of any prior lessor to
make any payment to the Lessee.

9. Granting of Easements. The Remainderman shall execute any
easement, license, right of way or other document after the execution of
same by the Lessor pursuant to Article 20 of each Lease.

10. Notices. All notices and other instruments given or
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing, and the giving of
such notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been completed
when delivered in accordance with Section 13.1 of the Participation
Agreement.

11. Rule Against Perpetuities, etc. If any option under this
Agreement would, in the absence of the limitation imposed by this Section
11, be invalid or unenforceable as being in violation of the rule against
perpetuities or any other rule of law relating to the vesting of an
interest in property or the suspension of the power of alienation of
property, then any option hereunder shall be exercisable only during the
period which shall end 20 years and 6 months after the date of death of the
last survivor of the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, father of the late
President John F. Kennedy, alive on the date of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement.

12. Successors and Assigns. In connection with a transfer
permitted under the Transaction Documents, the Lessee, the Lessor and the
Remainderman may each assign its rights under this Agreement, provided, any
such transferee shall assume the obligations of the Lessee, the Lessor or
the Remainderman hereunder, as the case may be. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors, assigns and grantees.

13. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.

14. No Amendments to Transaction Documents. The Lessor shall not
enter into any amendment, modification or supplement to the Indenture which
increases the obligations, or so long as no Event of Default has occupied
or is continuing diminishes the rights, of the Lessee under the respective
Leases without the prior written consent of the Lessee, and any such
amendment, modification or supplement executed without the Lessee's prior
written consent shall have no binding effect on the Lessee under the
respective Leases. The rights of the Lessee and the Remainderman under
this Section are subordinate to the Indenture and any Supplemental
Indenture and neither the Remainderman nor the Lessee shall have any rights
against the Indenture Trustee in connection with any amendment to the
Indenture or any Supplemental Indenture, nor shall this Section affect the
validity or enforceability of any such amendment.

15. Equitable Relief. The parties agree that any breach of this
Agreement would cause irreparable damage and that, in the event of such
breach, the aggrieved party shall have, in addition to all remedies at law,
the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
to prevent the violation of the defaulting party's obligations hereunder.

16. Certificates of Compliance. Upon the request of any party,
not more frequently than annually, each party to this Agreement will
deliver to the other parties a certificate signed by an officer or general
partner of such party certifying that such party is in full compliance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Related Lease.

17. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

18. Concerning the Trustees. State Street Bank and Trust Company
of California, National Association, is entering into this Tripartite
Agreement not in its individual capacity but solely as Owner Trustee under
the Trust Agreement. Each of the obligations of the Owner Trustee herein
are made solely for the purpose of binding the Owner Trustee, and State
Street Bank and Trust Company of California, National Association, in its
individual capacity shall have no liability whatsoever with respect
thereto.

19. Nature of Obligations. The obligations hereunder are
covenants running with the Land and are superior to any subsequent
encumbrance or transfer of the Remainderman Interest or the Land.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties, by authority duly given, have
executed this Tripartite Agreement as of the day and year first written
above.
