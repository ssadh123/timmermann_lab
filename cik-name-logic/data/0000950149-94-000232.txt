MANAGEMENT

2.1. Partnership Committee.

(a) The partnership committee of the Partnership (the "Partnership
Committee") shall be composed of three individuals appointed by each General
Partner (collectively the "Members" and individually a "Member"), or such
lesser number of Members as may be determined by a vote of the Members
representing each General Partner; provided that any Affiliate Transferee shall
not be entitled separately to designate Members unless it acquires the entire
General Partner interest of the transferor. The Members shall appoint one
additional individual (the "Independent Member") to serve on the Partnership
Committee as set forth in subsection (b) below.

(b) (i) Within 60 days after the Effective Date, each General Partner
shall nominate two individuals to serve as the initial Independent Member. If
the General Partners are unable to agree on the appointment of an Independent
Member from among the four nominees within 15 days after the nomination of such
individuals, the selection of the initial Independent Member shall be
determined in accordance with Section 2.6.

(ii) The Independent Member will serve for an initial term to be
mutually agreed upon by the General Partners, not to exceed three years. Any
subsequent term of an Independent Member shall be mutually agreed upon by the
General Partners, but shall not exceed three years. The General Partners will
agree on five individuals (the "Replacement Pool"), one of whom would replace
the Independent Member (A) upon expiration of his term (unless the Independent
Member is reappointed for another term), (B) his death or resignation, or (C)
his removal by unanimous vote of the General Partners. In any such event, the
General Partners will select an individual from the Replacement Pool to replace
the incumbent Independent Member. If the General Partners are unable to agree
on a replacement, the Independent Member will name his replacement from one of
the five individuals. If the General Partners are unable to agree and if the
Independent Member is unable to name his replacement or has been removed, each
of the General Partners will eliminate two of the five individuals from the
Replacement Pool, with the remaining individual becoming the Independent
Member. If an individual in the Replacement Pool is selected to become the 

- 13 -
<PAGE> 18
Independent Member, or dies, resigns, is removed from the Replacement Pool by 
unanimous vote of the Representative Partners or otherwise becomes incapable of
serving as an Independent Member, the General Partners will agree on an 
individual to replace such individual in the Replacement Pool. If the Partners 
are unable to agree on a replacement, the individuals in the Replacement Pool 
will name such replacement.

(c) Effective upon the giving of notice thereof to the other Partners,
any General Partner may, at any time, in its sole discretion, replace any or
all of its appointed Members with other individuals and may designate one or
more alternates for any or all of its Members. Each Member shall serve on the
Partnership Committee until his successor is appointed, or until his earlier
death, resignation or removal. Each Member shall be an officer or employee or
former employee of a Partner or an Affiliate thereof. Effective upon a General
Partner ceasing to be a general partner of the Partnership, the Members
representing such General Partner on the Partnership Committee shall cease to
be Members.

(d) Except as otherwise required by the Act, no vote or approval by any
Limited Partner shall be required under this Agreement for the taking of an
action, including without limitation the amendment of this Agreement, and the
Percentage Interest of any Limited Partner who is not also a General Partner
shall not be included in any calculation of a Partner's Percentage Interest
entitled to vote on any matter.

Partnership's obligations under this Agreement, and to enforce all rights of
the Partnership under this Agreement.

2.2. Partnership Committee Meetings.

of the Partnership Committee may be called at any time by any General Partner
by delivering a notice of meeting in accordance with Section 2.2(g) hereof.
Each General Partner shall be limited to calling two special meetings per year.

(b) The initial Chairman of the Partnership Committee shall be appointed
by the Partnership Committee within 90 days after the Effective Date and shall

shall be appointed by the General Partner who was not represented by the 
initial Chairman. The Chairman shall be subject to removal by the

must include on such agendas matters requested by any General Partner in
writing received at least five business days in advance of any meeting.

(c) Members may participate in a meeting of the Partnership Committee by
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such
participation shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

(d) Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the
Partnership Committee may be taken without a meeting upon the unanimous written
consent of the Members representing each General Partner.

(e) The Partnership Committee shall appoint a Secretary from time to
time. The Secretary shall keep written minutes of all Partnership Committee
meetings. A duplicate copy of such minutes shall be provided to the Chairman
of the Partnership Committee and to each Member.

(f) A Member shall have the right to designate an alternate to attend
meetings of the Partnership Committee, in stead and in place of such Member,
and to exercise all of the functions of such Member. Any such alternate shall

thereof. Any such alternate shall be deemed to be a Member for all purposes
hereunder until such designation is revoked.

Partnership Committee shall be given to each Member at least five business days

in reasonable detail, of the items of business to be conducted at such meeting

representing each of the General Partners whose Members are entitled to vote 
thereon) may be conducted at such special meeting. The notice provisions of

thereof or attendance at a meeting by Members representing each General Partner.

require the affirmative vote of Members representing each of the General
Partners entitled to vote thereon; provided that in the event that all Members
representing any General Partner shall abstain from the vote on any matter
(because of a conflict of interest or for any other reason), the outcome of such
vote shall be determined by the affirmative vote of Members representing the
other General Partners entitled to vote on such matter, and such vote shall
constitute the act of the Partnership Committee with respect to such matter. A
quorum of any meeting of the Partnership Committee shall require the presence of
at least one Member representing each General Partner entitled to vote thereon.

2.1, shall be entitled to attend all meetings of the Partnership Committee and

distribute, disseminate or disclose such Confidential Information, and shall
cause its Representatives not to distribute, disseminate or disclose such
Confidential Information, except to (i) the Partnership, (ii) if in connection
with a corporate transaction (including, without limitation, any debt or equity
financing, any merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition of assets, or
formation of any joint venture, partnership or affiliation) relating to the
Partnership or any Partner Parent or Affiliate thereof, any other Person that
agrees in writing to keep in confidence such Confidential Information in
accordance with the terms of this Section 2.10, or (iii) any Partner, or any
Affiliate thereof or other Representatives on a "need to know" basis in
connection with the transactions leading up to and contemplated by this
Agreement and the operation of the Partnership, and such Partner or the
Partnership disclosing Confidential Information pursuant to this Section 2.10
shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates and other Representatives to use,
such Confidential Information only for the benefit of the Partnership in
conducting the Partnership Business or for any other specific purposes referred
to above for which it was disclosed to such party; provided that the disclosure
of financial statements of, or other information relating to, the Partnership
shall not be deemed to be the disclosure of Confidential Information (i) to the
extent that any Partner is required by law or GAAP to disclose such financial
statements or other information or (ii) to the extent that in order to sustain
a position taken for tax purposes, any Partner deems it necessary and
appropriate to disclose such financial statements or other information to any
governmental 

- 20 -
<PAGE> 25
agency or authority. All Confidential Information disclosed in connection with
the Partnership or pursuant to this Agreement shall remain the property of the 
Person whose property it was prior to such disclosure.

conduct of Partnership Business, or otherwise as a result of the existence of
the Partnership, may be used by such unaffiliated Partner or Affiliate thereof
for any purpose other than for the benefit of the Partnership in conducting the
Partnership Business. The Partnership and each Partner shall have the
affirmative obligation to take all necessary steps to prevent the disclosure to
any Partner or Affiliate thereof of information regarding the plans or
operations of such Partner and its Affiliates in markets and areas in which any
other Partner and the unaffiliated Partner and their respective Affiliates
compete in the provision of telecommunications services.

(c) In the event that a Partner or anyone to whom a Partner transmits any
Confidential Information becomes legally compelled (by oral questions,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, investigative
demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information,
such Partner will use its best efforts to provide the other Partners and the
Partnership with prompt written notice prior to disclosure (not less than 24
hours) so that the other Partners and the Partnership may seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions
of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained, or that the Partnership and the other Partners waive compliance
with the provisions of this Section 2.10, the Partner or Person who is
compelled to disclose such Confidential Information will furnish only that
portion of the Confidential Information which (based on the advice of counsel)
it is legally required to disclose and will exercise its best efforts to obtain
reliable assurance that protective treatment will be accorded the Confidential
Information.

(d) Each Partner who ceases to be such will, and will cause its
Affiliates and representatives to, maintain the confidentiality required by
this Section 2.10 and immediately to destroy or return upon request, all
documents and other materials, and all copies thereof, obtained by such Partner
or on its behalf from the Partnership or the other Partners or any of their
Affiliates in connection with the transactions leading up to and contemplated
by this Agreement and the operation of the Partnership that are subject to such
confidentiality obligations. The obligations under this Section 2.10 shall

- 21 -
<PAGE> 26
survive the termination of the Partnership for a period of five years.

(e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, if a Partner or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of,
this Section 2.10, the other Partners and the Partnership shall have the right
and remedy to have this Section 2.10 specifically enforced pursuant to the 
provisions of the Arbitration Agreement referred to in Section 13.11, it 
being acknowledged and agreed that money damages will not provide an adequate 
remedy to such other Partners or the Partnership. Nothing in this Section 
2.10 shall be construed to limit the right of any Partner or the Partnership 
to collect money damages in the event of breach of this Section 2.10.

2.11. Duty of Partners to Cooperate. Each Partner will, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and consistent with this Agreement, furnish such
information, execute such applications and similar documents as are required 
by governmental authorities, and take such other action reasonably requested 
by the Partnership Committee and as may be necessary or reasonably desirable 
in connection with the business of the Partnership.

2.12. Insurance and Risk Management. The property and casualty insurance
program for the Partnership shall be integrated into the insurance program of a
Partner or Partner Parent providing customary business insurance coverage as of

Partnership shall compensate that Partner or Partner Parent for a proportional
allocation to the Partnership for insurance premiums, casualty loss funding
pools, and related expenses.

may enter into and maintain in effect any contract, agreement, transaction or
relationship between such Partner or Affiliate and the Partnership (a "Related
Party Agreement") on terms and conditions approved by the Partnership Committee

derive and retain profits therefrom.

Initial Project Plans shall be developed as follows:

(i) Any Initial Project Plan proposed by a Project Development 
Team shall require the affirmative vote of the members representing each 
Partner.

(ii) However, except as provided in (b) above, if a Project
Development Team is unable to recommend an Initial Project Plan to the
Partnership Committee within 60 days after the authorization by the
Partnership Committee of the preparation of an Initial 

- 23 -
<PAGE> 28
Project Plan (or such longer period as may be unanimously agreed by the 
members of the Project Development Team), the members representing each 
Partner on such Project Development Team, for a period of 30 days, shall 
be entitled to make separate Initial Project Plan recommendations to the 
Partnership Committee.

3.3. Approval of Initial Project Plans. Initial Project Plan 
recommendations by the Project Development Teams shall be subject to the
approval of the Partnership Committee pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(vii).

3.4. Approval of Revised Project Plans. (a) The Senior Manager
responsible for a Project shall submit to the Partnership Committee a revised
Project Plan for such Project, not less frequently than annually, at least 90
days prior to the start of the first fiscal year covered by such Project Plan.
Each such revised Project Plan shall be considered at the first meeting of the
Partnership Committee following its submission and shall be subject to the
approval of the Partnership Committee in accordance with Sections 2.3(c)(viii)
and (ix).

(b) If for any reason, in any fiscal year, no revised Project Plan for a
previously approved Project is agreed upon by the Partnership Committee, then
for such fiscal year the Project shall be managed in a manner consistent with
the forecasts for such fiscal year included in the last approved Project Plan,
as adjusted by the Project Manager to reflect contractual obligations for such
year and other required changes resulting from the passage of time.

3.5. Project Management. A Senior Manager and a Project Manager will be
assigned to execute each Project Plan which has been approved by the Partnership
Committee. The Project Manager shall have general management responsibility for
executing the Project in accordance with the Project Plan and for proposing, 
from time to time, amendments or modifications to the Project Plan. The Project
Manager shall be appointed by, report to, and be subject to removal for 
reasonable cause by, the Senior Manager responsible for the Project.

3.6. Use of Partner Resources. (a) Each Project Manager may utilize the
services and assets of third-party providers, but shall utilize the services
and assets of the Partners and their respective Affiliates in developing and
executing a Project Plan to the extent such services and assets are of quality
and scope comparable to, and available on terms no less favorable than, those
available from third parties.

(b) Each Partner and its Affiliates shall offer such services and assets
to the Partnership on a direct cost basis, unless the provision of such
services or assets would have an 

- 24 -

adverse effect on the business activities of such Partner or its Affiliates.

(c) The personnel of the Partnership shall, to the extent practicable, be
seconded employees of the Partners or their Affiliates.

ARTICLE 4

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS, WITHDRAWALS AND CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

4.1. Capital Accounts.

(a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner a separate capital
account (a "Capital Account") in accordance with the capital accounting rules
of section 704(b) of the Code and the Income Tax Regulations thereunder
(including particularly section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) of the Income Tax
Regulations).

(b) In general, under such capital accounting rules (but subject to any
contrary requirements of the Code and the Income Tax Regulations thereunder), a
Partner's Capital Account shall be (i) increased by the amount of money and the
Fair Market Value (determined in accordance with Section 4.9 hereof) of other
property (net of liabilities secured by such contributed property that the
Partnership is considered to take subject to or assume under section 752 of the
Code) contributed by the Partner to the Partnership (including the amount of
any Organizational Expenses of the Partnership paid or accrued by such Partner)
and allocations to the Partner of Partnership income and gain (or items
thereof), including income and gains exempt from tax, and (ii) decreased by the
amount of money and the Fair Market Value (determined in accordance with
Section 4.9 hereof) of other property distributed (net of liabilities secured
by such distributed property that such Partner is considered to take subject to
or assume under section 752 of the Code) to the Partner by the Partnership and
allocations to the Partner of Partnership loss and deduction (or items
thereof), including Partnership expenditures not deductible in computing its
taxable income and not properly chargeable to capital account. Further
appropriate adjustments shall be made as described in Section 4.3(b)(viii).

(c) Where section 704(c) of the Code applies to Partnership property,
each Partner's Capital Account shall be adjusted in accordance with paragraph
(b)(2)(iv)(g) of section 1.704-1 of the Income Tax Regulations as to
allocations to the Partners of depreciation, depletion, amortization and gain
or loss, as computed for book purposes with respect to such property.

- 25 -
<PAGE> 30
(d) When Partnership property is distributed in kind (whether in
connection with dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership or otherwise),
the Capital Accounts of the Partners first shall be adjusted to reflect the
manner in which the unrealized income, gain, loss or deduction inherent in such
property (that has not previously been charged to Capital Accounts) would be
allocated among the Partners if there were a taxable disposition of such
property for its Fair Market Value (determined in accordance with Section 4.9
hereof and taking into account section 7701(g) of the Code) and such income,
gain, loss or deduction had been recognized for federal income tax purposes
immediately upon such distribution or the event requiring such revaluation.

(e) Upon a revaluation of any Partnership assets pursuant to Section 4.7
hereof, the Capital Accounts of the Partners will be adjusted as provided in
Section 4.7(c).

(f) The Tax Matters Partner shall direct the Partnership's accountant to
make all necessary adjustments in each Partner's Capital Account as required by
the rules of section 704(b) of the Code and the Income Tax Regulations
thereunder.

4.2. Initial Contributions of Capital.

On the Effective Date, each Partner shall make the contributions to the
capital of the Partnership set forth opposite such Partner's name on Schedule 1
hereto.

4.3. Additional Contributions by Partners.

(a) In the event that (i) a capital contribution is required by the terms
of an Approved Business Plan or (ii) the Partnership Committee determines that
an additional capital contribution, payable in cash or other property (or
combination thereof), is necessary or advisable, each Partner will be notified
in writing by the Partnership, at least 60 days prior to the date on which such
capital contribution is payable (the "Due Date"), of the amount of the capital
contribution required from each of them, on a pro rata basis, determined in
ccordance with such Partner's respective Capital Contribution Percentage, and
the Due Date for such capital contribution. Each such capital contribution
shall be payable in cash unless otherwise determined by vote of the Partnership
Committee. Such contributions, when made by a Partner, shall be credited to
such Partner's Capital Account.

(b) In the event that a Partner fails to make a required capital
contribution on or prior to the Due Date thereof (a "Defaulting Partner"), any
one or more of the other Partners, who are not Affiliate Transferees of the
Defaulting Partner (the "Non- Defaulting Partners") may by a vote of the
Members representing General Partners who hold a majority of the 

- 26 -
<PAGE> 31
Percentage Interests of the Non-Defaulting Partners, elect to cause the 
Partnership to (x) allow the Non-Defaulting Partners to withdraw their 
corresponding additional capital contribution, in which event the Partnership 
shall promptly return any such contributions to such Partners and, pending 
such return, the amount of such contribution shall be deemed to be a demand 
loan from such Partners to the Partnership, or (y) invoke the following 
procedure (the "Default Contribution Procedure") to permit the Non-Defaulting 
Partners to contribute up to the entire amount required to be contributed 
pursuant to Section 4.3(a) by the Defaulting Partner (the "Default Amount").

(i) The Default Contribution Procedure shall be invoked by the
Partnership by giving notice (the "Default Contribution Notice") to the
Non-Defaulting Partners, with a copy to the Defaulting Partners. Within 30
days following the mailing of the Default Contribution Notice (the "Default
Contribution Date"), any one or more of the Non-Defaulting Partners may pay
some or all of the Default Amount.

(ii) In the event that more than one Non-Defaulting Partner elects 
to contribute a Default Amount so that the aggregate amount to be contributed 
by the Non-Defaulting Partners would exceed the full Default Amount, each of 
such Non-Defaulting Partners shall be entitled to contribute a portion of the 
Default Amount that is equal to such Non-Defaulting Partner's Percentage 
Interest divided by the Percentage Interests of all Non-Defaulting Partners 
electing to contribute such Default Amount.

(iii) The amount contributed pursuant to this Default Contribution
Procedure (as determined at the date 30 days after the Default Contribution
Date, the "Default Contribution Procedure Termination Date") shall constitute
an amount (the "Preferred Amount") allocated appropriately among the
Non-Defaulting Partners, effective as of the Default Contribution Procedure
Termination Date.

(iv) The Preferred Amount of the Capital Account of each such
Partner shall thereafter be (A) increased on the first day of each quarter by
the Quarterly Preferred Return (as hereinafter defined) and (B) reduced by
all Distributions (as hereinafter defined) made to each such Partner, and by
capital contributions made as contemplated by paragraph (vii) below. On the
first day of each month, each Non-Defaulting Partner having a positive
Preferred Amount in its Capital Account (a "Preferred Partner") shall be
entitled to receive, out of cash distributions which would otherwise be made
to the Defaulting 

- 27 -
<PAGE> 32
Partners pursuant to Article 5 ("Distributions"), an amount equal to the 
balance of such Preferred Amount.

(v) The "Quarterly Preferred Return" shall, for the date of
determination, be equal to the product of (A) five percent, and (B) such
Non-Defaulting Partner's average daily balance in the Preferred Amount for
the quarter preceding the relevant payment date.

(vi) Subject to Section 5.1(b) and the minimum gain provisions of
Section 5.1(c), the Partnership's gross income for any fiscal quarter
otherwise attributable to the Defaulting Partners shall first be allocated to
the Preferred Partners until the cumulative amount allocated to each such
Preferred Partner for all periods under this paragraph is equal to the
cumulative amount of Quarterly Preferred Return of such Preferred Partner for
all periods.

(vii) The Defaulting Partners may, at any time, contribute cash to
the Partnership in an amount equal to all or any part of the aggregate
Preferred Amount, which cash shall be promptly distributed to the Preferred
Partners in full or partial satisfaction of their respective Preferred
Amounts.

(viii) Immediately prior to the date that PCS JV is dissolved in
accordance with Article 10 of the PCS JV Agreement, the balance of the
Preferred Amount of each Partner may at such Partner's option be converted
into capital of PCS JV and such Partner's Preferred Amount shall be reduced
to zero. Such conversion shall be accomplished by increasing the Capital
Accounts of the Preferred Partner in PCS JV and of the Defaulting Partner in
the Partnership; and by decreasing the Capital Accounts of the Preferred
Partner in the Partnership and of the Defaulting Partner in PCS JV, with each
such adjustment being in an amount equal to the Preferred Amount, immediately
before the reduction thereof to zero under the preceding sentence.

(c) If the Defaulting Partner fails to contribute a Default Amount, the
Non-Defaulting Partner or Partners may by a vote of the Members representing a
majority of the Percentage Interests of the Non-Defaulting Partners, elect to
cause the Partnership to initiate and maintain an action against the Defaulting
Partner for such Default Amount (and the amount of any Preferred Returns that
have accrued with respect to Preferred Amounts contributed by the
Non-Defaulting Partners to fund such Default Amount) and to pursue any
available remedy, including but not limited to seeking payment by the
Defaulting 

- 28 -
<PAGE> 33
Partner of such amounts or the unpaid portion thereof and damages incurred by 
the Partnership in connection therewith. The Defaulting Partner's Capital 
Account shall be increased by an amount equal to that portion of the Default 
Amount recovered in any action maintained in accordance with the immediately 
preceding sentence. The costs of any action commenced by the Partnership 
pursuant to this Section 4.3(c) shall be paid by the Partnership and shall 
be reimbursed by the Defaulting Partner to the Partnership and to the extent 
not paid will be deducted from the amounts otherwise distributable to
such Defaulting Partner and any amounts so deducted shall be treated as a
distribution to such Partner.

4.4. Partner Obligations. No Partner shall have any obligation
to restore any portion of any deficit balance in such Partner's Capital
Account, whether upon liquidation of its interest in the Partnership,
liquidation of the Partnership or otherwise.

4.5. Withdrawals of Capital Accounts. No Partner shall be 
entitled to withdraw any amount from its Capital Account prior to dissolution 
of the Partnership.

4.6. Interest on Capital Accounts. No interest or compensation 
shall be paid on or with respect to the Capital Account or capital contributions
of any of the Partners, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

4.7. Revaluation of Partnership Assets.

(a) The assets of the Partnership shall be revalued in 
accordance with Section 4.9 to their then Fair Market Values as of the date of 
and immediately prior to (i) the acquisition of an additional interest in the 
Partnership (including adjustments to Percentage Interests arising as a result 
of a failure of any Partner to make a required capital contribution pursuant to 
Section 4.3 hereof) by any new or existing Partner in exchange for more than a 
de minimis capital contribution to the Partnership, (ii) the distribution by the
Partnership of more than a de minimis amount of property as consideration for
the redemption of a portion (but not all) of a Partner's interest in the
Partnership and (iii) the liquidation of a Partner's entire interest in the
Partnership, or immediately prior to the distribution of Partnership assets in
liquidation of the Partnership within the meaning of Income Tax Regulations
section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g); provided, however, that no revaluation shall
occur solely by reason of a contribution to the Partnership by WMC pursuant to
Section 7.5; and provided further that no revaluation shall occur if the
Partnership Committee reasonably determines that a revaluation would not
materially affect the Capital Accounts of the Partners or that the cost of such
revaluation would be disproportionate to any benefit to be derived by the
Partners from such revaluation.

- 29 -
<PAGE> 34
(b) Immediately prior to the distribution of any asset by the
Partnership, the Partnership Committee shall revalue such asset to its then
Fair Market Value.

(c) Any Revaluation Gain or Revaluation Loss arising from a revaluation of
any Partnership asset pursuant to this Section 4.7 shall be taken into account
as gain or loss to be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 5.1.

4.8. Redetermination of Percentage Interests. The respective Percentage
Interests of each of the Partners shall be redetermined immediately after any
event giving rise to a change in any Partner's Adjusted Capital Contributions.
If a Partner is both a General Partner and a Limited Partner such adjustment
shall be made to both the General Partner and the Limited Partner Percentage
Interests of such Partner as both a General Partner and a Limited Partner pro
rata in proportion to such interests.

4.9. Determination of Fair Market Value. The Fair Market Value, as of
the date of determination, of any asset shall be determined (a) by mutual
agreement of the General Partners or (b) if no such agreement is reached within
ten days of the relevant date of determination, as follows:

(i) Selection of Appraisers. Each General Partner shall designate
by written notice to the Partnership and each other General Partner a firm
of recognized national standing familiar with appraisal techniques
applicable to assets of the type being evaluated to serve as an Appraiser
pursuant to this Section 4.9 (the firms designated by the General Partners
being referred to herein as the "First Appraiser" and the "Second
Appraiser," respectively) within five business days after the failure to
reach agreement in accordance with the terms of clause (a) above. In the
event that either General Partner fails to designate its or their Appraiser
within the foregoing time period, the other shall have the right to
designate such Appraiser by notifying the failing party or parties in
writing of such designation (and the Appraiser so designated shall be the
First Appraiser or the Second Appraiser, as the case may be).

(ii) Evaluation Procedures. Each Appraiser shall be directed to
determine the Fair Market Value of the asset. Each Appraiser will also be
directed to deliver an Appraiser's Certificate to each General Partner on or
before the 30th day after their respective designation (the "Certificate
Date"), upon the conclusion of its evaluation, and each Appraiser's

- 30 -
<PAGE> 35
Certificate once delivered may not be retracted or modified in any respect.
Each Appraiser will keep confidential all information disclosed by the
Partnership in the course of conducting its evaluation, and, to that end,
will execute such customary documentation as the Partnership may reasonably
request with respect to such confidentiality obligation. The General
Partners will cooperate in causing the Partnership to provide each Appraiser
with such information within the Partnership's possession that may be
reasonably requested in writing by the Appraiser for purposes of its
evaluation hereunder. The Appraisers shall consult with each other in the
course of conducting their respective evaluations. Each General Partner
shall have full access to each Appraiser's work papers. Each Appraiser will
be directed to comply with the provisions of this Section 4.9, and to that
end each party will provide to its respective Appraiser a complete and
correct copy of this Section 4.9 (and the definitions of capitalized terms
used in this Section 4.9 that are defined elsewhere in this
Agreement).

(iii) Fair Market Determination. The Fair Market Value of any asset
shall be determined on the basis of the Appraisers' Certificates in
accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph (iii). The higher of
the values set forth on the Appraisers' Certificates is hereinafter
referred to as the "Higher Value" and the lower of such values is
hereinafter referred to as the "Lower Value". If the Higher Value is not
more than 110% of the Lower Value, the Fair Market Value will be the
arithmetic average of such two Values. If the Higher Value is more than
110% of the Lower Value, a third appraiser shall be selected in accordance
with the provisions of subparagraph (iv) below, and the Fair Market Value
will be determined in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (v)
below.

(iv) Selection of and Procedure for Third Appraiser. If the Higher
Value is more than 110% of the Lower Value, within seven days thereafter
the First Appraiser and the Second Appraiser shall agree upon and jointly
designate a third firm of recognized national standing familiar with
appraisal techniques applicable to assets of the type being evaluated to
serve as an appraiser pursuant to this Section 4.9 (the "Third Appraiser"),
by written notice to each General Partner. The General Partners shall
direct the Third Appraiser to determine the Fair Market Value of the asset
(the "Third Value") in accordance with

- 31 -
<PAGE> 36
the provisions of subparagraph (ii) above, and to deliver to the General
Partners an Appraiser's Certificate on or before the 30th day after the
designation of such Appraiser hereunder. The Third Appraiser will be
directed to comply with the provisions of this Section 4.9, and to that
end the parties will provide to the Third Appraiser a complete and correct
copy of this Section 4.9 (and the definitions of capitalized terms used
in this Section 4.9 that are defined elsewhere in this Agreement).

(v) Alternative Determination of Fair Market. Upon the delivery of
the Appraiser's Certificate of the Third Appraiser, the Fair Market Value
will be determined as provided in this subparagraph (v). The Fair Market
Value will be (w) the Lower Value, if the Third Value is less than the
Lower Value, (x) the Higher Value, if the Third Value is greater than the
Higher Value, (y) the arithmetic average of the Third Value and the other
Value (Lower or Higher) that is closer to the Third Value if the Third
Value falls within the range between (and including) the Lower Value and
the Higher Value and (z) the Third Value, if the Lower Value and the Higher
Value are equally close to the Third Value.

(vi) Costs. Each General Partner will bear the cost of the
Appraiser designated by it or on its behalf. If the Higher Value is not
more than 115% of the Lower Value, or if the Higher Value and the Lower
Value are equally close to the Third Value, each General Partner shall bear
50% of the cost of the Third Appraiser, if any; otherwise, the party whose
Appraiser's determination of Fair Market Value is further away from the
Third Value shall bear the entire cost of the Third Appraiser. The General
Partners agree to pay when due the fees and expenses of the Appraisers in
accordance with the foregoing provisions.

(vii) Conclusive Determination. To the fullest extent provided by
law, the determination of the Fair Market Value made pursuant to this
Section 4.9 shall be final and binding on the Partnership and the Partners
hereto, and such determination shall not be appealable to or reviewable by
any court or arbitrator; provided that the foregoing shall not limit a
Partner's rights to seek arbitration of the obligations of the other
Partners and the Partnership hereunder.

ARTICLE 5

ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

5.1. Profits and Losses. A Partner's distributive share of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit (or items thereof) as shown on the annual
federal income tax return prepared by the Partnership's accountants or as
finally determined by the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and as
modified by the capital accounting rules of section 704(b) of the Code and the
Income Tax Regulations thereunder as implemented by Section 4.1 hereof, as
applicable, shall be determined as provided in this Article 5.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.1, profits and losses
of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners proportionately in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

(b) Solely for tax purposes, in determining each Partner's allocable
share of the taxable income or loss of the Partnership, depreciation,
depletion, amortization and gain or loss with respect to any contributed
property, or with respect to revalued property where Partnership property is
revalued pursuant to Section 4.7 hereof, shall be allocated to the Partners
under any method allowable under section 704(c) of the Code and the applicable
Income Tax Regulations thereunder.

(c) Minimum Gain Chargeback. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Article 5, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain or
Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain (as such terms are defined in sections
1.704-2(b) and 1.704- 2(i)(2), respectively, of the Income Tax Regulations)
during a Partnership taxable year, then each Partner shall be allocated items
of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, for subsequent
years), to the extent required by, and in the manner provided in, section
1.704-2 of the Income Tax Regulations.

This provision is intended to be a "minimum gain chargeback" within the
meaning of sections 1.704-2(f) and 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Income Tax Regulations
and shall be interpreted and implemented as therein provided.

(d) Qualified Income Offset. Subject to the provisions of Section
5.1(c), but otherwise notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article
5, if any Partner's capital account has a deficit balance in excess of such
Partner's obligation to restore its capital account balance, computed in
accordance with the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(d) of section 1.704-1 of the
Income Tax Regulations (including such Partner's share of Partnership Minimum
Gain and Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain as provided in section
1.704-2(g) and 2(i)(5) of the Income

- 33 -
<PAGE> 38
Tax Regulations), then sufficient amounts of income and gain (consisting of a
pro rata portion of each item of Partnership income, including gross income,
and gain for such year) shall be allocated to such Partner in an amount and
manner sufficient to eliminate such deficit as quickly as possible. This
provision is intended to be a "qualified income offset" within the meaning
of section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Income Tax Regulations and shall be
interpreted and implemented as therein provided.

(e) Subject to the provisions of section 704(c) of the Code and Sections
5.1(b) through (d) hereof, gain recognized (or deemed recognized under the
provisions hereof) upon the sale or other disposition of Partnership property,
which is treated as depreciation recapture, shall be allocated to the Partner
who was entitled to deduct such depreciation.

(f) Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.1(j), if and to the extent
any Partner is deemed to recognize income as a result of any loans described
herein pursuant to the rules of sections 1272, 1273, 1274, 7872 or 482 of the
Code, or any similar provision now or hereafter in effect, or any other item of
imputed income, any corresponding resulting deduction of the Partnership shall
be allocated to the Partner who is charged with the income. Subject to the
provisions of section 704(c) of the Code and Sections 5.1(b) through (d)
hereof, if and to the extent the Partnership is deemed to recognize income as a
result of any loans described herein pursuant to the rules of sections 1272,
1273, 1274, 7872 or 482 of the Code, or any similar provision now or hereafter
in effect, or any other item of imputed income, such income shall be allocated
to the Partner who is entitled to any corresponding resulting deduction.

(g) The Partnership shall elect to amortize Organizational Expenses over
a 60-month period pursuant to Code section 709. Any such amortization
deductions attributable to Organizational Expenses contributed by a Partner
shall be allocated to such Partner.

(h) Except as otherwise required by law, tax credits shall be allocated
among the Partners pro rata in accordance with the manner in which Partnership
profits are allocated to the Partners under this Article 5, as of the time the
credit property is placed in service or if no property is involved, as of the
time the credit is earned. Recapture of any tax credit required by the Code
shall be allocated to the Partners in the same proportion in which such tax
credit was allocated.

(i) Except as provided in Sections 5.1(e), (f), (g) and (h) hereof or as
otherwise required by law, if the Partnership Interests of the Partners are
changed herein during any taxable year, all items to be allocated to the
Partners for such entire taxable year shall be prorated on the basis of the
portion of such taxable year which precedes each such change and the

- 34 -
<PAGE> 39
portion of such taxable year on and after each such change according to the
number of days in each such portion, and the items so allocated for each such
portion shall be allocated to the Partners in the manner in which such items
are allocated as provided in this Article 5 during each such portion of the
taxable year in question; provided that, if the transferor and the transferee
of an interest in the Partnership (i) shall both have given the Partnership
written notice within 15 days of the end of such taxable year of the
Partnership stating their agreement that such division and allocation shall be
made on some other basis permitted by Code section 706(d) and (ii) shall have
agreed to reimburse the Partnership for any incremental accounting fees and
other expenses incurred by the Partnership in utilizing such other basis for
such division and allocation, then such other basis permitted by Code section
706(d) shall be used.

(j) Any special allocation of income or gain pursuant to Section 5.1(c)
or 5.1(d) hereof shall be taken into account in computing subsequent
allocations of income and gain pursuant to this Article 5 so that the net
amount of all such allocations to each Partner shall, to the extent possible,
be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated to each such Partner
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 5 if such special allocations of
income or gain under Section 5.1(c) or 5.1(d) hereof had not occurred.

(k) Losses.

(i) Items of deduction and loss attributable to Partner nonrecourse
debt within the meaning of section 1.704-2(b)(4) of the Income Tax
Regulations shall be allocated to the Partners bearing the economic risk
of loss with respect to such debt in accordance with section 1.704-2(i)
of the Income Tax Regulations.

(ii) Items of deduction and loss attributable to Partnership
nonrecourse liabilities within the meaning of section 1.704- 2(b)(1) of
the Income Tax Regulations shall be allocated among the Partners
proportionately in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

(iii) All other items of operating net loss ("Net Loss") shall be
allocated among the Partners, proportionately in accordance with their
Percentage Interests, except that Net Loss shall not be allocated to any
Partner to the extent it would create a deficit balance in excess of such
Partner's obligation to restore its Capital Account balance, computed in
accordance with the rules of Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Income
Tax Regulations (including such Partner's share of Partnership Minimum

- 35 -
<PAGE> 40
Gain and Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain as provided in section
1.704-2(g) and 2(i)(5) of the Income Tax Regulations). Any Net Loss
which cannot be allocated to a Partner because of the limitation set
forth in the previous sentence shall be allocated first to the other
Partners to the extent such other Partners would not be subject to
such limitation and second any remaining amount to the Partners in
the manner required by the Code and the Income Tax Regulations.

(l) Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.1(c) through (k), items of
income and gain shall be allocated to the Partners in the following priority:

(i) First, if allocations of Net Loss have been made to the
Partners under the last sentence of Section 5.1(k)(iii), then in the
amount of, and proportionate to, the amount of such Net Loss.

(ii) Second, the balance among the Partners in proportion to their
relative Percentage Interests.

5.2. Distributions.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the end of each fiscal quarter, but
in no event later than the end of the following fiscal quarter, all Net
Operating Available Cash of the Partnership (as determined based on the
Partnership's financial statements for such fiscal quarter) shall be
distributed to the Partners. Other distributions, whether in cash or in kind,
shall be made to the Partners at such times and in such amounts as shall be
determined by the Partnership Committee. The amount of any in-kind
distribution shall be the distributed property's then Fair Market Value.

(b) Except as provided in Sections 4.3(b), 4.3(c), and 5.2(c),
distributions shall be made among the Partners in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests at the time of such distribution.

(c) Upon liquidation of the Partnership, within the meaning of Income Tax
Regulations section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), distributions shall be made among the
Partners as provided in Section 8.3.

(d) Any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
no distribution shall be made by the Partnership, or on behalf of the
Partnership which would violate Section 17-607(a) of the Act, which would
render the Partnership insolvent or which is prohibited by the terms of any
Partnership indebtedness.

- 36 -
<PAGE> 41
(e) All matters not expressly provided for by the terms of Article 5 or
elsewhere in this Agreement concerning the valuation of securities and other
assets of the Partnership, the allocation of profits and losses and items
thereof (including credits) among the Partners and accounting procedures shall
be reasonably determined by the Partnership Committee, whose determination
shall be final and conclusive as to all of the Partners.

6.3. Tax Reports to Current and Former Partners. After the end of each
fiscal year, the Tax Matters Partner shall, in a timely manner, prepare and
mail, or cause its accountants to prepare and mail, to each Partner and, to the
extent necessary, to each former Partner (or its legal representatives), a
report setting forth in sufficient detail such information as is required to be
furnished to partners by law (e.g., section 6031(b) of the Code and the Income

with any Federal, state and local withholding requirement with respect to any
allocation, payment or distribution by the Partnership to any Partner or other
Person. All amounts withheld to satisfy any Federal, state or local
withholding requirement with respect to a Partner shall be treated as
distributions to such Partner. If any such withholding requirement with
respect to any Partner exceeds the amount distributable to such Partner under
this Agreement, or if any such withholding requirement was not satisfied with
respect to any amount previously allocated or distributed to such Partner, such
Partner and any successor or assignee with respect to such Partner's interest
in the Partnership hereby, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnifies
and agrees to hold harmless the Partners and the Partnership for such excess
amount or such withholding requirement, as the case may be.

6.8. Tax Elections. Upon the request of a transferee of a Partnership
Interest or a distributee of a Partnership distribution, the Partnership will
make the election under section 754 of the Code in accordance with applicable
Income Tax Regulations thereunder for the first fiscal year in which such
election could apply, unless the Tax Matters Partner reasonably determines that
such election is not in the best interest of the Partnership. In any case
where responsibility is granted to the Tax Matters Partner to make any election
or determination or to take any other action which in the reasonable judgment
of the Tax Matters Partners could have a material adverse economic impact on
any other Partner, the Tax Matters Partner shall notify such other Partners 
not less than fifteen days preceding the time such action is to be taken. If 
any of the other Partners disagree with the proposed action, responsibility 
for the matter shall be given to the Partnership Committee.

6.9. Prior Tax Information. Each Partner agrees to deliver to the
Partnership all relevant information regarding Taxes that the Partnership will
require in order to comply with its own tax accounting and reporting
requirements, including without limitation schedules setting forth the fair
market value and tax basis of each asset that may from time to time be
contributed by a Partner to the Partnership; provided, however, that no Partner
shall be required to disclose the income tax returns of itself or any of its
Affiliates.

ARTICLE 7

INDEMNIFICATION AND EXCULPATION; CERTAIN AGREEMENTS

7.1. Indemnification of the Partners. The Partnership shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Members, the Partners and their Affiliates, and their
respective partners, shareholders, directors, officers and/or the legal
representatives of any of them, and each other Person who may incur liability
as a Partner or otherwise in connection with the management or ownership of the
Partnership or any entity in which the Partnership has an interest (each, an
"Indemnified Party"), against all liabilities, and against all expenses
(including counsel fees) reasonably incurred by him or it, in connection with
the investigation, defense or disposition of any action, suit or other
proceeding, whether civil or criminal, in which any Indemnified Party may be
involved or with which he or it may be threatened, while a Partner or serving
in such other capacity or thereafter, by reason of its being or having been a
Partner, or by serving in such other capacity, except with respect to any
matter which constitutes willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or
reckless disregard of the duties of his office. The Partnership shall have the
right to approve any counsel (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld) selected by

- 39 -
<PAGE> 44
any Indemnified Party and to approve the terms of any proposed settlement 
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Partnership shall 
advance to any Indemnified Party or Partner reasonable attorneys' fees and 
other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any such 
action or proceeding. Each Partner hereby agrees, and each other Indemnified 
Party shall agree in writing prior to any such advancement, that in the event 
he or it receives any such advance, such Indemnified Party shall reimburse the
Partnership for such fees, costs and expenses to the extent that it shall be
determined that he or it was not entitled to indemnification under this
Section. The rights accruing to a Partner and each other Indemnified Party
under this Section 7.1 shall not exclude any other right to which it or they
may be lawfully entitled; provided that any right of indemnity or
reimbursement granted in this Section 7.1 or to which any Indemnified Party
may be otherwise entitled may only be satisfied out of the assets of the
Partnership, and no Partner and no withdrawn Partner shall be personally
liable with respect to any such claim for indemnity or reimbursement. 
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the provisions of this
Section 7.1 shall not be construed so as to provide for the indemnification of
a Partner or any other Indemnified Party for any liability to the extent (but
only to the extent) that such indemnification would be in violation of
applicable law or such liability may not be waived, modified or limited under 
applicable law, but shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 7.1 to the fullest extent permitted by law.

7.2. Exculpation. Any Member, any Partnership employee, any Partner
and any Affiliate thereof and their respective partners, shareholders,
directors, officers, employees, or agents and/or the legal representatives of
any of them shall not be liable to any Partner or the Partnership for mistakes
of judgment or for action or inaction which such Member, Partner, Affiliate,
partner, shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent or legal
representative (1) reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Partnership unless such action or inaction constitutes willful
misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of his or its
duties and, (2) with respect to any criminal action, such party reasonably
believed his conduct was lawful. Each Partner may (on its own behalf or on the
behalf of any Member designated by such Partner, any Affiliates of such Partner
or their respective partners, shareholders, directors, officers, employees or
agents and/or legal representatives of any of them), consult with counsel,
accountants and other experts in respect of the Partnership affairs and such
Person shall be fully protected and justified in any action or inaction which
is taken in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel, accountants
or other experts; provided that they shall have been selected with reasonable
care. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the provisions of
this Section 7.2 shall not be

- 40 -
<PAGE> 45
construed so as to relieve (or attempt to relieve) a Partner or any other
Person of any liability, to the extent (but only to the extent) that such
liability may not be waived, modified or limited under applicable law, but
shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions of this Section 7.2 to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

7.3. Restrictions on Partners. No Partner may, without the prior written
consent of all of the other Partners:

(i) confess a judgment against the Partnership;

(ii) make any agreement on behalf of any other Partner;

(iii) except to the extent permitted by Article 8 hereof, withdraw
as a Partner, dissolve, terminate, liquidate or wind up the affairs of the
Partnership; or

(iv) use or possess Partnership property except for a Partnership
purpose, except as provided under contractual arrangement.

7.4. Outside Activities.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 7.4, any
Partner or Affiliate thereof may engage in or possess any interest in any other
business venture of any nature independently or with others, and neither the
Partnership nor any other Partner shall have any right by virtue of this
Agreement in or to such venture or in or to any income or profits derived
therefrom.

(b) Except for Systems (or licenses or permits therefor) acquired in
accordance with this Section 7.4:

(i) No Partner or any Affiliate thereof may, directly or indirectly,
acquire an ownership interest in any Person whose principal business is the
provision of nationwide Services in competition with the Partnership's
nationwide Services or the Partnership Business.

(ii) In light of current regulatory and legal concerns arising from
partner-competitor overlaps in the same wireless services geographic markets
and in light of the need to avoid financial conflicts that would impair
productive coordination of the Systems of Partners, and in light of the
numerous potential acquirors of wireless properties, no Partner may, directly 
or indirectly, acquire any ownership Interest in or lease (as lessee) any 
System (or license or permit therefor) the service area of which overlaps, 
in any material respect, the service area of a System (or license or permit 
therefor) which any

- 41 -
<PAGE> 46
Partners or Affiliate thereof, directly or indirectly, has an ownership
interest in, or leases (as lessee). If such an overlap occurs as a result of
a larger acquisition made by a Partner or Affiliate thereof, the acquiring
Partner or Affiliate shall divest the overlapping service area no later than
six months after the consummation of such acquisition.

(iii) No Partner or any Affiliate thereof may, directly or indirectly,
acquire an ownership interest in any System or provide Services in any market
if such acquisition or provision of Services would result in any material
restrictions being imposed on the Partnership Business, or on the System
operations of any other Partner or Affiliate thereof by any court, governmental
agency or regulatory or administrative authority. If such restrictions result
as a consequence of an acquisition, the acquiring Partner shall take prompt
action to cause the removal of the restrictions, and shall indemnify the
Partnership and each other Partner or Affiliate thereof for any financial
detriment suffered by the imposition of the restrictions.

(iv) Until December 31, 1995, except as provided in Section 3.1 of the
PCS JV Agreement, no Partner or any Affiliate thereof may, directly or
indirectly, acquire an ownership interest in any System the service area of
which overlaps, in any material respect, the service area of a Designated
MTA/BTA (as defined in the PCS JV Agreement).

(v) Each Partner will promptly notify the Partnership and each other
Partner upon (A) entering into a definitive purchase agreement with respect to
an ownership interest in any System, and (B) the termination of any such
agreement. For purposes of this Section 7.4, a Partner will be deemed to have
an ownership interest in any System which is the subject of an executed
definitive purchase agreement as of the time notice of execution of such
agreement is delivered to the Partnership and each other Partner and until the
termination of such agreement.

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 7.4 shall prohibit or otherwise
restrict:

(i) the ownership of, and provision by, a Partner or its
Affiliates of Cellular Service through Systems which were owned by, or
subject to a definitive purchase agreement to acquire by, such Partner
or its Affiliates on the Effective Date;

(ii) the ownership of an interest in PCS JV by a Partner or its

(v) the acquisition of an ownership interest by a LEC Affiliate
or a wireline cable television company Affiliate of a Partner, if

of PCS Service by such PCS System, in each case, substantially within
the service territory of such Affiliate;

(vi) the ownership or other participation of ATI or any Affiliate
thereof in the Globalstar satellite communications venture, or the
ownership or other participation of any Partner or its Affiliates in
any satellite communications venture that would not be competitive with
services provided by Systems, or the provision of wireless
communications services (other than Cellular, PCS or ESMR Services) by
Globalstar or such other ventures; provided that, in either case, the
Partnership shall be entitled to purchase wireless communications
services from Globalstar or such other venture at prices and on terms
no less favorable than those offered to any third party (for like
volumes and types of service);

(vii) the acquisition by ATI or any Affiliate thereof of ownership
interests in CCI or New Par, a Delaware general partnership;

(viii) the acquisition by ATI or any Affiliate thereof of ownership
interests in Systems (or licenses or permits therefor) as a result of

stock or assets, or otherwise) of an ownership interest of less than 5%
in a Person, which owns or leases Systems, or provides Cellular, ESMR
or PCS Services (directly or indirectly through an Affiliate that is
controlled by such Person); provided that, if the Partnership Committee
(by vote of the Members representing Partners other than the acquiring
Partner) shall determine that the acquired business would be reasonably
expected to

- 43 -
<PAGE> 48
result in any material restrictions being imposed on such existing or
planned activities or acquisitions by any court, governmental agency or
regulatory or administrative authority, the Partner and its Affiliates
shall promptly, but in any event within 30 days, divest such ownership
interest, or take such other action as is necessary (in the
determination of the Partnership Committee) to remove such
restrictions;

(x) the obtaining of the right to nominate or cause the
election of less than 20% of the members of the Board of Directors of
a corporation and any committee thereof, provided that no employee of
the Partner or its Affiliates serves as an officer of such corporation;

(xi) any activity of a LEC Affiliate or wireline cable television
company Affiliate in its service territory required in accordance with
all applicable laws, regulations or order, or any agreement with a
regulatory authority which agreement is existing as of the date hereof;

tails" or other similar services ancillary to landline communications
within the service territory of such Affiliate;

course of business, of debt obligations or engaging in equipment
financing and sale-leaseback arrangements, provided that such debt
obligations or financing arrangements (A) are not convertible into or
exchangeable for equity securities (or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for equity securities) and (B) entitle the holder or
financier to receive only interest or other returns that are fixed, or
vary by reference to an index or formula that is not based on the
value or results of operations of such entity;

(xiv) the holding of an ownership interest in a Person that has an
ownership interest in a System or provides Services, if the Partner or 
its Affiliate has no responsibility for or control over the conduct of 
such ownership or activities, does not permit its name to be used in
connection with such ownership or activities, and uses all reasonable
efforts, including voting its equity interest, to cause such Person to
cease such ownership or activities;

- 44 -
<PAGE> 49
(xv) the purchase by a LEC Affiliate or a wireline cable
television company Affiliate from any Person of Services and the
resale thereof within the service territory of such Affiliate; and

(xvi) the provision and management by a LEC Affiliate or a wireline
cable television company Affiliate in its service territory of network
infrastructure and associated systems for unaffiliated entities
providing Services.

(d) Each Partner and each Affiliate of a Partner that, directly or
indirectly, has an ownership interest in a System shall use its reasonable
efforts, subject to fiduciary duties to third parties, to cause each of its
Attributed Entities to abide by restrictions contained in this Section 7.4 and
to comply with the terms set forth herein.

(e) This Agreement shall not be deemed to create any duties other than
as expressly provided for herein or imposed by applicable law, nor shall its
existence be deemed to alter the legal duties and obligations that any Partner
or any Affiliate thereof has to the other Partners or their Affiliates as to 
matters outside the scope of the Agreement, including, without limitation, 
those concerning the terms and conditions of interconnection services. Each of 
the Partners and its Affiliates acknowledge their respective right to compete 
vigorously with the other Partners and their Affiliates in markets or areas in 
which they are otherwise competitors in the offering of telecommunications
services.

(f) A Partner shall remain subject to the provisions of this Section 7.4
for a period of one year from earliest of (i) the date of dissolution of the
Partnership, (ii) the withdrawal of such Partner as a General Partner (pursuant
to Section 8.1(a)(iii)), and (iii) the transfer of such Partner's entire
Partnership Interest to a Person other than an Affiliate. If a General Partner
withdraws from the Partnership in violation of Section 8.1, then the Limited
Partner Percentage Interest of such Partner for purposes of this Section 7.4(f)
shall be deemed to be increased by the General Partner Percentage Interest at
the time of such withdrawal.

7.5. Elimination of Conflicts. (a) Cellco and its Affiliates shall
eliminate, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Date, any
ownership or other conflicts with respect to the Systems listed on Schedule
7.5(a) hereto (the "Scheduled Systems") to the extent reasonably necessary to
preclude conflicts that would result in any material restrictions being imposed
on the Partnership Business or the System operations of any other Partner or
Affiliate thereof by any court, governmental agency or regulatory or
administrative authority ("Conflicts").

- 45 -
<PAGE> 50
(b) Cellco and its Affiliates will use their best efforts (consistent
with obtaining value) to accomplish the elimination of such Conflicts in a
manner that would minimize the amount of Section 7.5 Taxes (as defined below)
incurred by Cellco or its Affiliates as a result of the elimination of such
Conflicts in a taxable transaction. For purposes of this Section 7.5 "Section
7.5 Taxes" means federal and state tax liabilities (exclusive of penalties or
interest) resulting from elimination of such Conflicts, determined using an
assumed combined federal and state tax rate of 40% based on the actual taxable
gain recognized upon the disposition of any relevant Scheduled Systems, without
regard to the availability of net operating loss carry forwards or similar tax
offsets or benefits, and without regard to the tax effect of the contribution
or payment of any amount pursuant to this Section 7.5.

(c) Upon Cellco's written notification to WMC setting forth
Cellco's determination of the amount of Section 7.5 Taxes, Cellco and WMC shall
use their best good faith efforts to reach agreement on a form of payment of 50
percent of the Section 7.5 Taxes (the "Section 7.5 Taxes Payment") which (A)
gives Cellco the full benefit of the Section 7.5 Taxes Payment (but without any
gross-up), (B) minimizes the tax liability of Cellco with respect to such
Payment, and (C) improves the ability of WMC to treat such amount as an
investment under its method of accounting. If Cellco and WMC fail to reach
agreement on the form of such Payment within 30 days of Cellco's notification
to WMC of Cellco's determination of the amount of Section 7.5 Taxes, WMC shall
make such Payment in cash to Cellco upon the later of the expiration of such 30
day period or the conclusion of the process described in Section 7.5(d).

(d) In the event that WMC disagrees with Cellco's calculation of the
amount of Section 7.5 Taxes, WMC may challenge that determination by notifying
Cellco in writing of the grounds for such disagreement within ten (10) days of
WMC's receipt of Cellco's notification. Cellco and WMC shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve such disagreements. If WMC and Cellco fail to resolve such
disagreements, then the matter will be referred to arbitration in accordance
with the Arbitration Agreement of the partners of even date hereof for
resolution.

(e) In the event of a determination that Section 7.5 Taxes may be
different than the amount originally used for purposes of this Section 7.5,
Cellco shall consult with WMC concerning the audit, appeal, amended return or
other process potentially leading to such redetermination provided that such
redetermination shall be calculated using the assumed tax rate, disregarding
net operating loss carryforwards and similar tax offsets and benefits, and
disregarding the tax effect of the contribution or payment of any amount, all
as provided in

- 46 -
<PAGE> 51
Section 7.5(b); and upon any such redetermination becoming final, appropriate 
adjustments shall be made among the parties to reflect such redetermination.

7.6. Duties of Partners. The fiduciary duties of Partners or Members of
the Partnership Committee shall not restrict any Partner or Affiliate or any
Member of the Partnership Committee from:

(i) engaging in conduct permitted by Section 7.4;

(ii) taking any action in any capacity other than that of a
Partner or Member of the Partnership Committee, respectively; or

(iii) acting to prevent the Partnership from engaging in an
activity that is outside the scope of the Partnership Business;

whether or not such Partner, Affiliate or Member of the Partnership Committee
is motivated in whole or in part by a desire to further the interests of a
Person other than the Partnership.

General Partner, the filing of a certificate of dissolution, or its equivalent,

required to be wound up in connection with any of the events specified in this

to and does carry on the business of the Partnership without dissolution, or
(B) within 90 days after the occurrence of such event, a majority in interest

to participate in the management of the Partnership Business and affairs of
the Partnership, including the right to designate Members of the Partnership
Committee.

8.2. Bankruptcy of a General Partner.

(a) If the Bankruptcy of a General Partner occurs and at such time there
is at least one other General Partner, such remaining General Partner or
General Partners are hereby authorized to carry on the business of the
Partnership without dissolution, and the Partnership Interests of the General
Partner in Bankruptcy (the "Bankrupt Partner") shall automatically be deemed to
become limited partner interests in the Partnership, and such Bankrupt Partner
shall cease to be a General Partner and continue to be, or become, a Limited
Partner having (i) no right to participate in the management of the Partnership
Business and affairs of the Partnership, including no right to designate
Members to the Partnership Committee, and (ii) the same interest in all items
of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Partnership to the same
extent as if such Bankruptcy had not occurred. The Partnership shall continue
to be governed by the terms of this Agreement, the Partnership Business and the
property of the Partnership shall continue to be owned by the Partnership, and
the Partnership Business shall otherwise continue unaffected by such
Bankruptcy. Upon the occurrence of the Bankruptcy of any General Partner, (i)
the Bankrupt Partner and the other Partners shall execute such documents as may
be necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Section 8.2 and
(ii) the other Partners are, without necessity of any further action or
documentation, hereby appointed attorneys-in-fact of the Bankrupt Partner for
the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Section 8.2 and taking any
action and executing any documents which such Partners may deem necessary or
advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, such appointment being irrevocable

consent in writing to dissolve the Partnership or (ii) within 90 days after
such Bankruptcy occurs, agree in writing to continue the business of the
Partnership and to appoint, effective as of the date of such Bankruptcy, one or

the Bankrupt Partner shall have its general partnership interest in the 
Partnership converted into a limited partner interest in the Partnership and 
continue to be, or become a Limited Partner subject to the provisions of 
Section 8.2. In the event the remaining Partners fail to make any election 
pursuant to this subsection (b), the Partnership shall be dissolved.

(c) In the event any General Partner shall become a "debtor" as defined
in the Bankruptcy Code in any case commenced thereunder and at any time during
the pendency of such case there shall be appointed (i) a trustee with respect
to the Bankrupt Partner under section 701, 702 or 1104 of the Bankruptcy Code
(or any successor provisions thereto), or (ii) an examiner having expanded
powers beyond those specifically enumerated in section 1104(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code, then the other Partners may, at any time thereafter, so long
as such condition exists, elect to dissolve the Partnership, in which event the
affairs of the Partnership shall be wound up as provided in this Article 8.

8.3. Order of Dissolution. In settling accounts upon winding up and
liquidation of the Partnership, the assets of the Partnership shall be applied
and distributed as expeditiously as possible in the following order not later
than the end of the taxable year of the liquidation (i.e., the date upon which
the Partnership ceases to be a going concern as provided in Income Tax
Regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) or if later, within 90 days after the
date of such liquidation):

(a) to pay (or make reasonable provision for the payment of) all

or their Affiliates who are creditors, in satisfaction of liabilities of the
Partnership in the order of priority provided by law, including expenses
relating to the dissolution and winding up of the affairs of the Partnership
(including, without limitation, expenses of selling assets of the Partnership,
discharging the liabilities of the Partnership, distributing the assets of the
Partnership and terminating the Partnership as a limited partnership in

(b) to the Partners in proportion to their respective positive Capital
Account balances, as those balances are determined after all adjustments to
such Capital Accounts as

- 49 -
<PAGE> 54
required by this Agreement for all periods immediately prior to such
distribution.

8.4. Orderly Winding Up. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Sections 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3, but subject to Section 8.5 and the order of priority
in Section 8.3, upon winding up and liquidation, if required to maximize the
proceeds of liquidation, the Partnership Committee may, upon unanimous
approval, transfer the assets of the Partnership to a liquidating trustee or
trustees.

8.5. Dissolution Election. Notwithstanding the terms of any provision
of Section 8.3(b) to the contrary, but subject to Section 17-804(a)(1) of the
Act, any Partner may elect upon the occurrence of any of the events of
dissolution specified in Section 8.1, by written notice to the Partnership any
time prior to actual distribution, to require that the Partnership distribute
the assets of the Partnership upon dissolution and winding up as follows:

(i) First, the Partners shall attempt to reach agreement on the
Fair Market Value and distribution among the Partners of each of the
non-cash assets of the Partnership and liabilities related thereto,
subject always to distributions being made in accordance with Capital
Accounts as provided in Section 8.3(b), with such distributed assets being
valued at their Fair Market Value. To the extent that the Partners are
unable to reach agreement on the Fair Market Value and distribution among
the Partners of certain of such non-cash assets and liabilities, the
Chairman of the Partnership Committee not later than 20 days after an
event of dissolution set forth in Section 8.1 shall implement the
following internal auction procedures. For a period of up to ten days,
the Chairman shall entertain bids by the Partners for such non-cash assets
and related liabilities, either singly (a "Single Bid") or as a whole (an
"Aggregate Bid"). The Chairman will only entertain bids which exceed the
previous Single Bid for any non-cash asset and related liabilities or the
previous Aggregate Bid for all such non-cash assets and related
liabilities by at least one percent (a "Qualifying Bid"). The Chairman
will promptly make each bid submitted by any Partner available to each
other Partner. If during any 24-hour period within the ten-day period
specified above, the Chairman does not receive a Qualifying Single Bid
with respect to any non-cash asset or related liabilities or a Qualifying
Aggregate Bid, the Chairman shall not entertain any further Single Bids
with respect to such non-cash asset or any further Aggregate Bids, as the 
case may be. At the conclusion of such bidding period, the highest Single 
Bid by any

- 50 -
<PAGE> 55

Partner for each non-cash asset and related liabilities or, if an
Aggregate Bid for such non-cash assets and related liabilities, which
exceeds the sum of the Single Bids, is received such Aggregate Bid, shall
constitute the Fair Market Value of such non-cash assets and related
liabilities. The Partnership shall thereafter pay any amounts referred to
in Section 8.3(a) (except to the extent any such liabilities are to be
assumed by any Partner), and the non- cash assets and liabilities valued
pursuant to the previous sentence shall be distributed to the Partner who
specified the highest Fair Market Value therefor (and shall be debited
against its Capital Account balance), and the remaining non-cash assets,
if any, and liabilities shall be distributed in the manner agreed upon by
the Partners; provided that if the distributions pursuant to this sentence
would result in any Partner receiving more than its positive Capital
Account balance (an "Excess Distribution"), assets with a Fair Market
Value equal to the Excess Distribution shall instead be distributed among
the other Partners in accordance with Capital Account balances (such
assets as selected by such other Partners) and immediately thereafter sold
for cash to the Partner who would have otherwise received the Excess
Distribution in the absence of this proviso, which cash shall be paid
simultaneously with the liquidating distributions;

(ii) All other remaining assets shall be distributed to the
Partners in accordance with Section 8.3(b) hereof; and

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Partner shall receive a
right to use, without limitation, any Intellectual Property of the
Partnership on substantially equivalent terms as the other Partners.

8.6. Obligation to Restore Deficit Balance. No Partner shall be liable
for the return of the capital contributions of any other Partner, nor shall any
Partner be required to have any obligation to restore a deficit balance in its
Capital Account on winding up, liquidation and termination of the Partnership
except to the extent required by the Act.

8.7. Termination of Partnership. The Partnership shall terminate when
all of the assets of the Partnership, after payment of or due provision for all
debts, liabilities and obligations of the Partnership, shall have been
distributed to the Partners in the manner provided for in Article 8, and the
Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Partnership shall be canceled in the
manner required by the Act.

ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL PARTNERS

9.1. Admission Procedures. With the approval of the Partnership
Committee, the Partnership may admit additional Persons as both a General

which it (i) shall become a party to this Agreement, (ii) shall make
representations and warranties to the Partnership with respect to itself
relating to such matters as the Partnership Committee may request and (iii)

ARTICLE 10

TRANSFER OR ENCUMBRANCE OF INTEREST

10.1. Restriction on Transfer or Encumbrance. Without the unanimous
consent of the General Partners, no Partner may assign, sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of (any such transaction being referred to in this Article 10
as a "transfer"), pledge, hypothecate, grant a security interest in or
otherwise encumber, its Partnership Interest, except in accordance with the
terms of Section 10.2.

10.2. Permitted Transfers.

(a) Any Partner may, without the consent of the other Partners, transfer
ownership of all or any part of its Partnership Interest to a Wholly Owned
Affiliate of a Partner or to a Partner Parent or a person which is a Wholly
Owned Affiliate of a Partner Parent (any Affiliate to which a transfer is
permitted under this Section 10.2 being referred to herein as an "Affiliate
Transferee"). An Affiliate Transferee shall be admitted as both a Substitute
General Partner and a Substitute Limited Partner at the time such (i) Affiliate
Transferee executes this Agreement or a counterpart to this Agreement, which
evidences such Affiliate Transferee's agreement to be bound to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and (ii) the Partner Parent(s) of such Affiliate
Transferee shall have executed a letter of responsibility in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the other Partner. In the event a transfer that is
permitted under this Section 10.2(a) causes a termination of the Partnership
for tax purposes under Section 708 of the Code, the Affiliate Transferee shall
indemnify and hold harmless the other partners from all costs arising from such
termination.

- 52 -
<PAGE> 57
(b) A transfer of less than all of a Partner's Partnership Interest
pursuant to this Section 10.2 shall be deemed to constitute a transfer of both
the General Partner and Limited Partner Percentage Interests (and the Capital
Contribution Percentage) of such Partner pro rata in proportion to the portion
of such Partner's entire Partnership Interest transferred.

10.3. Invalid Transfers Void. Any purported transfer of any Partnership
Interest or any part thereof not in compliance with this Article 10 shall be
void and of no force or effect and the transferring Partner shall be liable to
the other Partners and the Partnership for all liabilities, obligations,
damages, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
court costs) arising as a result of such noncomplying transfer.

10.4. Change in Ownership.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Ownership" of a Partner
shall be deemed to have occurred when (i) any Person, other than a Partner
Parent of such Partner or a Wholly Owned Affiliate of such Partner Parent (an
"Unaffiliated Entity"), shall acquire (whether by merger, consolidation, sale,
assignment, lease, transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or series of
related transactions), or otherwise beneficially own 50% or more of the
outstanding Voting Stock of any Partner (or any entity, other than a Partner
Parent, which, directly or indirectly, through the ownership of one or more
majority-owned successive subsidiary entities, owns more than 50% of the
outstanding voting interests in such Partner (a "Control Entity")) or (ii) the
Partner Parents of such Partner shall otherwise cease to beneficially own a
majority of the outstanding Voting Stock of such Partner or any Control Entity
of such Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of (i) a broadly
dispersed, underwritten public offering of the equity securities of a Partner
or a Control Entity, (ii) a tax-free spin-off qualifying under Section 355 of
the Code, by a Partner Parent to its shareholders of an entity the assets of
which include all, but not less than all, of such Partner Parent's ownership
interest in the Partnership and WMC or Cellco, as the case may be, or (iii) a
change of control of a Partner Parent shall result in a Change of Ownership of
a Partner hereunder.

(b) Upon any Change in Ownership of a Partner, the Partner not undergoing
the Change in Ownership shall be entitled at any time within a 90-day period
following the Change of Ownership, to elect by notice to the Partner undergoing
a Change of Ownership to purchase all but not less than all of the Partnership
Interest of the Partner undergoing the Change in Ownership at a purchase price
equal to the Fair Market Value of the Partnership Interest determined as
provided in Article 4.9. In the event that a Partnership Interest is not
purchased

- 53 -
<PAGE> 58
pursuant to the preceding sentence, any Person effecting such Change
of Ownership (i) shall, by binding written instrument which shall be
enforceable by the Partnership and the other Partners, assume all obligations
and liabilities hereunder of the Partner which is the subject of such Change in
Ownership and (ii) in the case of a Change of Ownership of the Cellco
Partnership Interest, shall execute a Standstill Agreement, substantially in
the form of Exhibit A hereto.

(c) In the event that a Partnership Interest is purchased pursuant to
Section 10.5(b), the Partner undergoing the Change of Ownership shall (i)
retain all rights under the Enhanced Resale Agreements, (ii) receive a
royalty-free license to use Partnership Intellectual Property for five years
and (iii) be entitled to purchase for a five-year period services from the
Partnership on terms and conditions substantially similar to those under which
such Partner was receiving such services prior to the Change of Ownership.

ARTICLE 11

REGULATORY MATTERS

11.1. MFJ Compliance.

(a) Each of BAC, NYN and USW (the "BOC Participants") and their
respective BOC affiliates in Cellco and WMC agree that they
will pursue, in conjunction with the Regional Bell Operating Companies ("BOCs")
within the meaning of the MFJ, the "Motion of the Bell Companies for a
Modification of Section II of the Decree to Permit Them to Provide Cellular and
Other Wireless Services Across LATA Boundaries," filed with the Decree Court on
June 20, 1994. If the Decree Court were to deny the BOCs' motion or if the
Decree Court or Department of Justice were to take the position that the relief
requested in the motion does not apply to PCS Service, the BOC Participants
will request a waiver for the benefit of the Partnership that would enable the
Partnership to conduct the Partnership Business free of restrictions on BOCs in
the MFJ. In addition, the BOC Participants will request a waiver for the
benefit of the Partnership if the waiver is: (i) to permit the Partnership to
offer the same services as those set forth in any waiver request which such BOC
Participant or an affiliate has pending or which such BOC Participant ,any of
its affiliates, or any BOC has obtained for its cellular or PCS businesses,
including businesses incidental thereto; (ii) based on the same relevant facts
as those set forth in any such waiver such BOC Participant, an affiliate
thereof or a BOC has pending or has obtained, as the case may be, and (iii)
with respect to the Partnership, within the scope of the Partnership Business.
Except as described above, neither any such BOC Participant nor

- 54 -
<PAGE> 59
any affiliate shall be obliged to request any waiver for the benefit of the
Partnership.

(b) Unless and until the (1) Decree Court or (2) the Department of
Justice shall issue a written opinion, or (3) USW, BAC and NYN shall
unanimously agree that the MFJ does not apply to the Partnership, the
Partnership will conform to the requirements and prohibitions of the MFJ. As
long as a BOC Participant holds any ownership interest in the Partnership, the
Partnership will not engage in any MFJ Restricted Activities. ATI or any
Affiliate thereof will have the option to engage in MFJ Restricted Activities,
specifically including the provision of interexchange (interLATA)
telecommunications services (it being understood that such services may be
provided by the Partnership if it is thereafter permitted to do so) and engage
in any business practice and enter into any transaction in which the
Partnership does not engage by reason of the MFJ. ATI shall not be deemed to
be engaged in or possessing any interest in a business venture in violation of
Section 7.4 solely as a result of the nature of the business being an MFJ
Restricted Activity. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the
provisions of this Section 11.1 shall take precedence, in the event of any
conflict, over any other provision of this Agreement.

(c) Unless and until the Decree Court, the Department of Justice, or
USW's CECO Decree Committee shall issue a written opinion that the CECO does
not apply to the Partnership, the Partnership will conform to the requirements
and prohibitions of the CECO. Unless and until the Decree Court, the
Department of Justice, or USW's MFJ Compliance Committee shall issue a written
opinion that the EO does not apply to the Partnership, the Partnership will
conform to the requirements and prohibitions of the EO. In conforming to the
requirements and prohibitions of the CECO and EO, the Partnership will utilize
the procedures established by USW for compliance with them. At the request of
the Partnership, USW will provide training, instruction and assistance to the
Partnership in matters associated with CECO and EO compliance.

(d) If, at any time, a third party raises legitimate concerns regarding
whether as a result of the transactions arising out of this Agreement and the
PCS JV Agreement ATI or Systems in which it has an ownership interest can
lawfully engage in MFJ Restricted Activities, or if a third party or USW's CECO
Decree Committee raises legitimate concerns regarding whether, in light of the
activities of the Partnership and ATI, the BOC Participants are in compliance
with the MFJ (collectively, "MFJ Concerns"), the parties agree:

(i) except in the circumstances set forth in (iii) below, that ATI
and/or the Partnership shall have the right to continue the activities
giving rise to the MFJ Concerns;

- 55 -
<PAGE> 60
(ii) to restructure the relationships among them and their
respective properties to the minimum extent necessary to satisfy the MFJ
Concerns while preserving, to the fullest extent possible, the intent of
the parties regarding the Partnership. The obligation to restructure
shall arise when (A) counsel for any Partner Parent believes that an MFJ
Concern is well founded, (B) USW's CECO Decree Committee or similar
committee representing another BOC Participant determines that an activity
of the Partnership or ATI has or will put USW or such BOC Participant in
violation of the MFJ, or (C) ATI determines that in light of the
activities of the Partnership that the right of ATI or Systems in which it
has an ownership interest to lawfully engage in MFJ Restricted Activities
is subject to a well founded challenge under the MFJ and (in any such
case) outside counsel for any Partner Parent issues a written opinion that
the MFJ Concern cannot be cured without restructuring. In the event the
obligation to restructure arises pursuant to the preceding sentence, the
Partners shall attempt to determine the manner of restructuring which best
gives effect to the first sentence of this clause (ii). If the Partners
reach agreement on a proposal, they will present it to the Partner Parents
and then, if the Partner Parents approve that proposal, to the Partnership
Committee. If the Partner Parents are unable to agree on a restructuring
proposal, each of them will present its proposal to USW's CECO Decree
Committee; the Partner Parents will then present to the Partnership
Committee any of the proposals the CECO Decree Committee has approved. 
The Partners will implement a restructuring proposal only upon the
unanimous vote of the Partnership Committee. If the Partnership Committee
does not unanimously approve any restructuring proposal, the Partner
Parents shall resolve the manner of restructuring by the procedure
described in paragraph 2.6(d)(i) of this Agreement (provided that the
40-day period set forth therein for referral of disputes to the
Independent Member shall be a 30-day period); and

(iii) If despite their best efforts, the Partners fail to reach
agreement on and implement a restructuring proposal pursuant to (ii) above,
and if a Partner Parent has received either:

(A) an opinion from the Decree Court that activities giving
rise to the MFJ Concerns have put a Partner Parent in violation of
the MFJ; or

- 56 -
<PAGE> 61
(B) a written statement from the Department of Justice that
such activities have put a BOC Partner Parent in violation of the
MFJ, and either counsel for any one of the BOC Participants agrees,
or USW's CECO Decree Committee or any committee established by
another BOC Participant for purposes of reviewing MFJ issues has
determined, that there is a reasonable factual and legal basis for
such an opinion from the Department of Justice;

then, ATI, its Cellular and PCS Systems and/or the Partnership will stop the
activities giving rise to the MFJ Concerns until such time as implementation
of a restructuring proposal pursuant to (ii) above permits the resumption of
such activities.

(e) Subject to compliance with the MFJ by the Partnership in connection
therewith, and subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 7.4 hereof, ATI
or any Affiliate thereof will have the option to engage in MFJ Restricted
Activities, specifically including the provision of interexchange (interLATA)
telecommunications services and engage in any business practice and enter into
any transaction in which the Partnership does not engage by reason of the MFJ.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the provisions of this Section
11.1 shall take precedence, in the event of any conflict, over any other
provision of this Agreement.

Principles relating to National Strategy
Promotion for Brand Developed by the Partners

1. Each Partner will support the development and use (as further
described below) of the Partnership's agreed upon national brand.

2. The Partnership will own the rights to the agreed-upon national brand.

3. Promptly following the selection of a national brand for the
Partnership (in accordance with the provisions hereof), each Partner
will use the Partnership's national brand (and no other national

regional brand on a stand alone basis).

4. As soon as practicable following the selection of a national brand for
the Partnership, but in any event within one year from the Effective
Date, each Partner will use the Partnership's brand in its local

conjunction with the use of a Partner's local or regional brand). The
applicable guidelines for such co-branding will be determined by the
Partnership.

5. The Partners agree that the Partnership will license each Partner and

6. Subject to the exceptions in 7.4(c), the Partners further agree that a
Partner or Affiliate shall not use, in the existing Territory (as of

Services if (i) the Partner or Affiliate has the right to use that
other brand or mark in connection with the national brand and (ii) the
Partner or Affiliate has used such other brand or mark in its
Territory.

license area, or (ii) the Partnership has entered a bid or bids
for such License but a third-party bid has been entered which

behalf of one or more Partners or their Affiliates in accordance
with the foregoing and shall be the winning bidder on such
License, then such Partner(s) shall be obligated to fund any
required payment by the Partnership for such License, and the
Partnership shall immediately transfer to such Partner(s) or
their Affiliate(s) such License or the right to receive such
License (and all remaining obligations to make payment therefor)

approvals for such transfer; provided, however, that if, during
the 30-day period immediately following the FCC auctions for such
License, the Partner(s) other than such Partner make an election

Partnership shall retain such License and shall make all required

Partnership that the Partnership make such acquisition, and shall

opportunity and the proposed material terms of the acquisition,
and if the representatives of such Partner voted in favor of
making such acquisition by the Partnership, then such Partner or
any of such Affiliates shall be free to make such acquisition on
terms no more favorable to the Partner or its Affiliates than

respect thereto within 150 days after the Partner gave notice to
the Partnership of the opportunity and (ii) that such Partner
complies with Section 3.1(c).

(c) It shall be a condition to any acquisition by a Partner or its
Affiliate of any PCS License (other than a 10 MHz PCS License) or
an ownership interest in any PCS Business that such PCS Business
shall offer to enter into an affiliation agreement with the
Partnership on terms and conditions comparable to those which the
Partnership offers to other affiliated PCS Businesses in similar
situations (or if no such agreement then exists, such terms and
conditions as are approved by the Executive Committee which terms
and conditions shall include a "most-favored nation" provision),
under which such PCS Business will provide its services to the
public as an affiliate of the Partnership's business (an
AFFILIATION AGREEMENT). The Partnership may waive compliance
with all or any part of this Section 3.1(c) with respect to any
transaction by vote of the Executive Committee.

3.2. 10 MHz PCS Licenses. No Affiliate shall bid on or acquire, in the
FCC auctions for PCS Licenses or otherwise, any PCS License to use a 10 MHz PCS

geographic area and other provisions of Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3
have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated parties and
specifically agree that such time, scope, geographic area, and
other provisions are reasonable under the circumstances. The
Partners agree that if, despite this express agreement of the
Partners, a court should hold any portion of Sections 3.1, 3.2 or
3.3 to be unenforceable for any reason, the maximum restrictions
of time, scope and geographic area reasonable under the
circumstances, as determined by the court, will be substituted
for the restrictions held to be unenforceable.

(b) Each Partner agrees that the Partnership shall be entitled to
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, without the
necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond or other
security, as well as an equitable accounting of all earnings,

3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, which rights shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other rights or remedies to which the Partnership
may be entitled.

3.5. Exceptions to Restrictions. The restrictions set forth in Sections
3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 on the activities described therein shall not be construed to
prohibit the activities of the Partners and their Affiliates of the type
described in Section 7.4(c) of the Tomcom Partnership Agreement.

3.6. Activities of the Partners. Except as expressly restricted by this
Article 3, each Partner and its Affiliates may engage in or hold an interest in
other business ventures and activities of any nature, including, without
limitation, ventures and activities similar to those of the Partnership, and
neither the Partnership nor the other Partners shall, by virtue of this
Agreement, have any interest or rights in or to such other ventures or business
or any liability or obligation with respect thereto.

services for similar volumes of such services.

3.8. Determination of Designated MTAs/BTAs. On or before December 5,
1994, the Partners shall designate the Designated MTAs/BTAs for which the
Partnership will seek to acquire PCS Licenses, and shall determine the Bid
Prices to be bid for, or other acquisition prices to be paid for, such PCS

<PAGE> 18

4.1. Initial Capital Contributions. Contemporaneously with the execution
hereof, each of the Partners have contributed to the capital of the Partnership
the cash amount set forth on Schedule I hereto, receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged. The Partners and the Partnership agree and acknowledge that
immediately after the foregoing contribution, the initial Percentage Interests
of the Partners and the initial ratio of the Specified Account Value of a
Partner to all Partners shall be in the ratios set forth on Schedule I hereto.

4.2. Additional Capital Calls. Not later than November 18, 1994, each of
the Partners shall contribute to the capital of the Partnership in proportion
to their respective Partnership Interests an amount sufficient to pay all
filing and qualification fees to enable the Partnership to bid on the
Designated MTAs/BTAs identified pursuant to Section 3.8. Each Partner may
contribute to the capital of the Partnership, not necessarily in proportion to
their Percentage Interests, an amount sufficient to fund the bids which such
Partner may desire to make pursuant to Section 3.1(a) hereof. In addition,
upon 30 days prior written notice to the Partners, the Partnership may, from
time to time, issue Capital Calls, requiring the Partners to make additional
contributions of capital to the Partnership in proportion to their respective
Percentage Interests. Capital Calls specifically referred to in any annual
budget included in any Business Plan may be made by the chief executive officer
of the Partnership. Any Capital Call not so provided for must be approved by
the Executive Committee.

4.3. Failure to Pay a Capital Call.

(a) If any Partner fails to make payment when due of all or any
portion of its share of a Capital Call, the secretary of the
Partnership shall give written notice of the failure to such
Partner, with a copy to all other Partners. If the Partner fails
to pay the amount due within 10 days following receipt of notice,
the secretary shall promptly give notice of such failure to the
other Partners. At any time within 15 days following receipt of
such notice, then, unless the Nondelinquent Partners elect to
make capital contributions in accordance with Section 4.3(b)
hereof, (i) the amount contributed by each Nondelinquent Partner
pursuant to the Capital Call shall be treated as a loan to the
Partnership for a term to be specified by such Nondelinquent
Partner, bearing interest payable quarterly at the Default
Interest Rate and (ii) each Nondelinquent Partner may make an
additional loan to the Partnership for a term to be specified by
such Non-Delinquent Partner, also bearing interest payable
quarterly at the Default Interest Rate, in an amount equal to all
or any portion of the unpaid contribution.

- 17 -

<PAGE> 19

If two or more Partners desire to provide funds under clause (ii)
of the preceding sentence, the total amount of funds provided
shall be allocated among such Partners in proportion to their
then current relative Percentage Interests or in such other
manner as they may agree.

(b) If Nondelinquent Partners whose Percentage Interests represent
more than 50% of the Percentage Interests of all of the
Nondelinquent Partners so elect (for purposes of such
calculations, any Partner that is an Affiliate of a Delinquent
Partner shall be treated as a Delinquent Partner, and all
Partners which are Affiliates of each other shall be deemed to be
a single Partner), then in lieu of making loans to the
Partnership in accordance with Section 4.3(a) hereof, (A) the
amount contributed by each Nondelinquent Partner pursuant to the
Capital Call shall be treated as a contribution to the capital of
the Partnership in exchange for an additional interest in the
Partnership and (B) each Nondelinquent Partner may make an
additional contribution of capital to the Partnership in exchange
for an additional interest in the Partnership in an amount equal
to all or any portion of the unpaid contribution. If two or more
Partners desire to make capital contributions under clause (B) of
the preceding sentence, the total amount of capital to be
contributed shall be allocated among such Partners in proportion
to their then current relative Percentage Interests or in such
other manner as they may agree.

(c) The amounts contributed pursuant to Section 4.3(b) hereof shall
increase the Capital Accounts of the contributing Partners in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, the
Percentage Interests shall be recalculated (and such recalculated
Percentage Interests shall thereafter apply for all purposes of
this Agreement) such that the Percentage Interest of each Partner
shall equal the ratio of its Specified Account Value to the
aggregate Specified Account Values of all of the Partners
calculated as if the amounts contributed pursuant to Section
4.3(b) were 115% of the amounts actually contributed. Once an
adjustment is made pursuant to this Section 4.3(c), any future
calculations of Percentage Interests in the Partnership shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis using the methodology (including
the 115% weighing) specified above.

(d) Any Partner who becomes a Delinquent Partner hereby agrees to
cause each of its Affiliated Entities to agree to the terms of
this Section 4.3.

4.4. Capital Accounts. The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner a
single Capital Account with respect to the Partner's Partnership Interest in
accordance with the regulations issued pursuant to Section 704 of the Code.
The Capital Account of each Partner shall be maintained for such Partner in
accordance with the following provisions:

(a) To each Partner's Capital Account there shall be credited the
amount of cash and the Agreed Value of any assets contributed to
the capital of the Partnership by such Partner pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, such Partner's distributive share of
Profits and any items in the nature of income or gain which are
specially allocated pursuant to Section 6.2 or Section 6.3 or
Section 6.4.5, and the amount of any Partnership liabilities
which are assumed by such Partner or which are secured by any
Partnership property distributed to such Partner.

(b) To each Partner's Capital Account there shall be debited the
amount of cash and the Agreed Value of any Partnership property
distributed to such Partner pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement, such Partner's distributive share of Losses and any
items in the nature of expenses or losses which are specially
allocated pursuant to Section 6.2 or Section 6.3 or Section
6.4.5, and the amount of any liabilities of such Partner which
are assumed by the Partnership or which are secured by any
property contributed by such Partner to the Partnership, and the
amount of any liabilities of any other partnership, interests in
which were contributed to the Partnership, to the extent such
liabilities are included in the Agreed Value of such contributed
partnership interests.

(c) In the event that all or a portion of a Partnership Interest is
transferred in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
transferee shall succeed to the Capital Account of the transferor
to the extent that it relates to the transferred interest.

(d) In determining the amount of any liability for purposes of
paragraphs (a) and (b) hereof, there shall be taken into account
Code Section 752(c) and any other applicable provisions of the
Code and Regulations.

(e) Further adjustments shall be made to the extent provided in
Section 4.3(b)(viii) of the Tomcom Partnership Agreement.

The principal amount of a promissory note which is not readily traded on
an established securities market and which is contributed to the Partnership by
the maker of the note (or by a person related to the maker of the note within
the meaning of Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c)) shall not be included
in the Capital Account of any Partner until the Partnership makes a taxable
disposition of the note or until (and to the extent) principal payments are
made on the note, all in accordance with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(d)(2) (any such note being referred to as a PARTNER NOTE).

The foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement
relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with
Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2, and shall be interpreted and
applied in a manner consistent with such Regulations. To the extent that such
Regulations require that adjustments other than those set out above or in
Section 6.2.6 be made to the Capital Accounts of the Partners, such adjustments
shall be made.

4.5. Conversion to Limited Partner. If at any time the Percentage
Interests of a Partner and its Affiliates who are Partners aggregate less than
35% for a period of more than 90 days (except solely as a result of capital
contributions made in accordance with the second sentence of Section 4.2 to
fund bids in accordance with Section 3.2(a)), then such Partner shall cease to
be a General Partner and shall continue to be, or become, a Limited Partner
having no right to participate in the management of the business and affairs of
the Partnership, including the right to designate members of the Executive
Committee.

unless such action, and the taking thereof by such Partner, shall have
been expressly authorized by the Executive Committee or shall be expressly
and specifically authorized by this Agreement. Each Partner, by execution
of this Agreement, agrees to, consents to, and acknowledges the delegation
of powers and authority to the members of the Executive Committee
hereunder and to the actions and decisions of the members of the Executive
Committee within the scope of such authority.

5.1.2. Number and Term of Office. Each of the General Partners
shall have the right to designate three members of the Executive Committee
by written notice to the secretary of the Partnership and to each other
General Partner. Any General Partner may at any time, and from time to

Partnership and to each other General Partner of any such removal or
replacement. Each member of the Executive Committee shall be an officer
or employee or former employee of a Partner or an Affiliate thereof.

5.1.3. Resignations; Removals. Any member of the Executive

of the Partnership and the General Partner that appointed such member.
Such resignation shall take effect on the date shown on or specified in
such notice or, if such notice is not dated, at the date of the receipt of

resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. The General Partner
that appointed a resigning member shall be entitled to appoint a member to

upon a General Partner ceasing to be a general partner of the Partnership,
the members of the Executive Committee appointed by such Partner shall
cease to be members.

5.1.4. Place of Meeting. The Executive Committee may hold its
meetings at such place or places within or outside the State of Delaware

resolution of the Executive Committee, but such meetings shall be held at
least once each calendar month unless otherwise specified by the Executive
Committee. If the date fixed for any such regular meeting is a Saturday,
Sunday or legal holiday under the laws of the state where such meeting is
to be held, then the meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business
day or at such other time as may be determined by resolution of the
Executive Committee. At such meetings the members of the Executive
Committee shall transact such business as may properly be brought before
the meeting.

5.1.6. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Executive
Committee may be called by any member of the Executive Committee or by the
chief executive officer of the Partnership. Notice of each such meeting
shall be given to each member of the Executive Committee by telephone,
telecopy, telegram or similar method (in which case notice shall be given
at least five days before the time of the meeting) or sent by first-class
mail (in which case notice shall be given at least seven days before the
meeting), unless otherwise specified by the Executive Committee. Each
such notice shall state the time, place and purpose of the meeting to be
so held.

5.1.7. Voting. The member or members of the Executive Committee
appointed by each General Partner who are present (in person or by written
proxy) at any meeting of the Executive Committee (or who are acting by
written consent in lieu of a meeting) shall be entitled to act on behalf
of such General Partners. If only one member appointed by a given General
Partner is present at a meeting, such member shall be entitled to vote the
entire voting power held by all members appointed by such General Partner.
If more than one member appointed by a given General Partner is present at
a meeting, such members shall vote such General Partner's entire voting
power as a single unit. In the event of a disagreement at a meeting among
members appointed by a single General Partner as to how to vote on any
matter, the vote of the member designated by such General Partner as its
senior representative shall be controlling and the vote of the other
member or members representing such General Partner shall be disregarded
with respect to such matter.

Executive Committee shall require the affirmative vote of members of the
Executive Committee representing each of the General Partners, except as
may be otherwise specifically provided by this Agreement. The presence at
a duly called meeting of the Executive Committee of members representing
each General Partner shall constitute a quorum. If a quorum shall not be

prior to the beginning of any fiscal year, then the Partnership shall be
operated on the basis of the Business Plan in effect for the prior year
until a new Business Plan is approved, provided, however, that no Capital
Calls or borrowings provided for in the annual budget for such prior year
shall be repeated in such new year unless specifically approved for such

for in the financial commitment or financial view portions of the Business
Plan applicable to such period.

5.1.12. Deadlocks. Upon the occurrence of a Deadlock Event (as

the General Partners shall have used their mutual good faith

- 24 -

<PAGE> 26

efforts to secure all possible extensions of time for such vote or
action), no mutually satisfactory solution has been reached, the parties

(a) Each General Partner shall first refer the matter to the chief
executive officer of that partner of the General Partner
designated by such General Partner for resolution of the matter.

resolve the dispute, they shall (at the instance of either of
them, but in no event later than 20 days after the matter has
been referred to them) refer the matter to the chief executive
officers of the respective Partner Parent of such Partner for
resolution of the matter.

(c) Should the designated chief executive officers of the respective
Partner Parents fail to resolve the matter within 40 days, the

less than 90 days prior to the commencement of the next
succeeding fiscal year, (ii) a disagreement that continues for at
least 30 days over the removal of the Chief Executive Officer or

Partners has proposed a candidate to fill such vacancy, or (iii)
a disagreement continues for at least 30 days over the timing or
amount of a Capital Call other than as provided for in a Business

Partnership or their activities with respect thereto on or after the date
hereof (INDEMNIFIED DAMAGES), except for any such Indemnified Damages that
are Taxes imposed on or against any Partner or that have resulted
primarily from gross negligence, fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct of

of its Affiliates). The Partnership shall pay for or reimburse the
reasonable expenses incurred by any Mandatory Indemnitee, and may pay for
and reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by any Permitted

faith belief that the person is entitled to indemnification under this
provision and (b) the person's agreement to repay all advances if it is
ultimately determined that the person is not entitled to indemnification
under this Section 5.2.1. Any repeal or modification of any portion of
the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.2.1 or the adoption of any
provision of this Agreement inconsistent with any portion of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.2.1 shall not adversely affect any right or

Partnership would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the provisions of this Section 5.2.3 or otherwise.

5.3. Partner Compensation; Reimbursement.

promptly pay all applicable Taxes and other governmental charges imposed on or

5.5. Further Assurances. Following execution and delivery of this
Agreement by all of the Partners, each Partner shall, at its own cost, do,

6.1. General Allocation Rule. After giving effect to the special
allocations set forth in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 hereof, Profits and Losses for
any fiscal year (or any shorter period if during any fiscal year there is a

proportion to their respective Percentage Interests; provided, however, that
amortization deductions attributable to Organizational Expenses paid or
incurred directly by a Partner shall be allocated to such Partner.

6.2. Special Allocations. The following special allocations shall be
made in the following order:

6.2.1. Minimum Gain Chargeback. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 1.704-2(f) of the Regulations, notwithstanding any other provision

of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain, determined in accordance
with Regulations Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the previous

of the Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

6.2.2. Partner Minimum Gain Chargeback. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Regulations, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Article 6, if there is a net decrease in Partner
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain attributable to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt
during any fiscal year, each Partner who has a share of the Partner
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain attributable to such

- 28 -

<PAGE> 30

Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Section
1.704-2(i)(5) of the Regulations, shall be specially allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such fiscal year (and, if necessary,
subsequent years) in an amount equal to such Partner's share of the net
decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain attributable to such
Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations
Section 1.704-2(i)(4). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence
shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be
allocated to each Partner pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated
shall be determined in accordance with Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and
1.704-2(j)(2) of the Regulations. This Section 6.2.2 is intended to
comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in Section
1.704-2(i)(4) of the Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.

6.2.3. Qualified Income Offset. If any Partner unexpectedly
receives any adjustment, allocation or distribution described in
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), items of
Partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Partner
in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by
the Regulations, any resulting Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such
Partner as quickly as possible; provided, however,that an allocation
pursuant to this Section 6.2.3 shall be made if and only to the extent
that such Partner would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all
other allocations provided for in this Article 6 have been tentatively
made as if this Section 6.2.3 were not in this Agreement.

6.2.4. Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any
fiscal year shall be allocated among the Partners in proportion to their
respective Percentage Interests.

6.2.5. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Partner Nonrecourse
Deductions for any fiscal year shall be allocated to the Partner who bears
the economic risk of loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to
which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance
with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i).

6.2.6. Certain Section 754 Adjustments. To the extent an
adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to
Code Section 743(b), Code Section 732(d) or Code Section 734(b) is
required, pursuant to Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be
taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as the result of a
distribution to a Partner in complete liquidation of its interest in the
Partnership, the amount of such adjustment to Capital Accounts

- 29 -

<PAGE> 31

shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis
of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and such
gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in accordance
with their interests in the Partnership as determined under Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(3) in the event Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) applies, or to the Partner to whom such
distribution was made in the event Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) applies.

6.3. Curative Allocations. The allocations set forth in Sections 6.2.1
through 6.2.6 hereof (REGULATORY ALLOCATIONS) are intended to comply with
certain requirements of the Regulations and Internal Revenue Service advance
ruling requirements. It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that,
to the extent possible, all Regulatory Allocations shall be offset either with
other Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other items of
income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this Section 6.3. Therefore,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 6 (other than the
Regulatory Allocations and the following sentence), the Tax Matters Partner
shall make such offsetting special allocations of Partnership income, gain,
loss or deduction in whatever manner it determines in reasonable good faith is
appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each Partner's
Capital Account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the Capital
Account balance which such Partner would have had if the Regulatory Allocations
were not part of this Agreement and all Partnership items were allocated
pursuant to Section 6.1 hereof. In exercising its discretion under this
Section 6.3, the Tax Matters Partner shall take into account Regulatory
Allocations under Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 that, although not yet made, are
likely to offset other Regulatory Allocations previously made under Sections
6.2.4 and 6.2.5.

6.4. Other Allocation Rules.

6.4.1. Allocations When Percentage Interests Change. For
purposes of determining the Profits, Losses or any other items allocable
to any period, Profits, Losses and any such other items shall be
determined on a daily, monthly, or other basis, as determined by the Tax
Matters Partner using any permissible method under Code Section 706 and
the Regulations thereunder; provided, however, that any adjustments to
the Agreed Value of a Partnership asset treated as gain or loss under
paragraph (c) of the definition of "Profits" and "Losses" or under
paragraph (c) of Section 6.4.5 hereof, shall be allocated only to those
persons who were Partners immediately before the event giving rise to such
adjustment.

- 30 -

<PAGE> 32

6.4.2. Allocation of Particular Items. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, all items of Partnership income, gain, loss,
deduction and any other allocations not otherwise provided for shall be
divided among the Partners in the same proportions as they share Profits
or Losses, as the case may be, for the fiscal year or other relevant
period.

6.4.3. Tax Reporting. The Partners are aware of the income tax
consequences of the allocations made by this Article 6 and hereby agree to
be bound by the provisions of this Article 6 in reporting their shares of
Partnership income and loss for income tax purposes.

6.4.4. Profit Shares. Solely for purposes of determining a
Partner's proportionate share of the Partnership's "excess nonrecourse
liabilities," as defined in Regulations Section 1.752-3(a), the Partners'
interests in Partnership profits shall be deemed to be in proportion to
their respective shares of Profits set forth in Section 6.1.

6.4.5. Book Items Used in Special Allocations. For purposes of
determining the Partnership's items of income, gain, loss or deduction for
any fiscal year or other relevant period available to be allocated
pursuant to Sections 6.2 and 6.3 hereof, the following rules shall be
applied:

(a) Exempt Items. Any income of the Partnership that is
exempt from federal income tax shall be taken into
account as an item of income;

(b) Nondeductible Expenditures. Any Nondeductible
Expenditure of the Partnership shall be taken into
account as an item of deduction;

(c) Adjustments to Agreed Values. In the event the Agreed
Value of any Partnership asset is adjusted pursuant to
paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) under the definition
herein of "Agreed Value," the amount of such adjustment
shall be taken into account as gain or loss from the
disposition of such asset;

(d) Certain Dispositions. Gain or loss resulting from any
disposition of Partnership property with respect to which
gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax
purposes shall be computed by reference to the Agreed
Value of the property disposed of, notwithstanding that
the adjusted tax basis of such property differs from its
Agreed Value;

(e) Depreciation. In lieu of the depreciation, amortization
and other cost recovery deductions

- 31 -

<PAGE> 33
taken into account in computing the Partnership's taxable
income or loss shall be taken into account Depreciation
for such fiscal year or relevant period; and

(f) Certain Section 734(b) Adjustments. To the extent an
adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership
asset pursuant to Code Section 734(b) is required,
pursuant to Regulations Section 1.704-(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4),
to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts
as a result of a distribution other than in liquidation
of a Partner's interest in the Partnership, the amount of
such adjustment shall be treated as an item of gain (if
the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss
(if the adjustment decreases such basis) from the
disposition of such asset.

6.5. Tax Allocations; Code Section 704(c).

6.5.1. Generally. A Partner's allocable share of the
Partnership's items of income (including income exempt from tax), gain,
deduction, loss and Nondeductible Expenditure for tax purposes shall be
determined under the foregoing provisions of this Article 6 except as
provided in this Section 6.5.

6.5.2. Contributed Property. In accordance with Code Section
704(c) and the Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss and deduction
with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Partnership
shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Partners so as to
take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property
to the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and its initial Agreed
Value, determined in accordance with the definition of Agreed Value
hereunder.

6.5.3. Adjustments to Agreed Value. If the Agreed Value of any
Partnership asset is adjusted pursuant to the definition of Agreed Value
hereunder, subsequent allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction with
respect to such asset for tax purposes shall take account of any variation
between the adjusted basis of such asset for federal income tax purposes
and its Agreed Value in the same manner as under Code Section 704(c) and
the Regulations thereunder.

6.5.4. Elections. Upon the request of a transferee of a
Partnership Interest or of a distributee of a Partnership distribution,
the Partnership shall make the election under Section 754 of the Code in
accordance with applicable Regulations thereunder for the first fiscal
year in which such

- 32 -

<PAGE> 34
election could apply, unless the Tax Matters Partner reasonably determines
that such election is not in the best interest of the Partnership.
Subject to Section 11.17, any other elections or other decisions relating
to allocations pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be made by the Tax
Matters Partner in any manner that reasonably reflects the purpose and
intention of this Agreement. Allocations pursuant to this Section 6.5 are
solely for purposes of federal, state and local taxes and shall not
affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any Partner's
Capital Account or share of Profits, Losses, other items or distributions
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.

6.6. Distributions.

6.6.1. In General. Unless otherwise determined by the Executive
Committee, the Partnership shall distribute to the Partners in proportion
to their respective Percentage Interests, on a fiscal quarterly basis as
promptly as practicable after the end of each quarter, all Net Operating
Available Cash.

6.6.2. Partner Loans. For so long as any loans made pursuant to
Section 4.3(a) remain outstanding, any amounts that would otherwise be
distributed pursuant to Section 6.6.1 shall instead be used to repay such
loans. Amounts paid pursuant to this Section 6.6.2 shall be apportioned
among the holders of such loans in proportion to the relevant amounts
owing under each loan.

6.6.3. Liquidating Distributions. Notwithstanding Section 6.6.1
to the contrary, following the dissolution of the Partnership,
distributions to the Partners shall be made in accordance with the
provisions of Article 10.

6.6.4. Amounts Withheld. All amounts withheld pursuant to the
Code or any provision of any state or local tax law with respect to any
payment or distribution to the Partnership or the Partners shall be
treated as amounts distributed to the Partners pursuant to this Section
6.6 for all purposes under this Agreement. The Tax Matters Partner is
authorized to withhold from distributions, or with respect to allocations,
to the Partners and to pay over to any federal, state or local government
any amounts required to be so withheld pursuant to the Code or any other
provision of federal, state or local law and shall allocate any such
amounts to the Partners with respect to which such amounts were withheld.

the Partnership shall be determined in accordance with Code Section 706(b).

7.3. Statements and Reports. Except as may be otherwise determined by
the Executive Committee, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 45
days after the close of each fiscal year of the Partnership, the Partnership

respect to such period, (i) a profit and loss statement, (ii) a statement of
cash flows, (iii) a Partnership balance sheet as of the close of such period,
(iv) such other statements showing in reasonable detail each Partner's interest
in each of the items described in Section 7.1., and (v) proportional accounting

foregoing statements will be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied, and audited by an independent certified public accounting firm of
national reputation which shall be designated by the Executive Committee, and
the cost of preparing the statements and of each such audit will be paid for by
the Partnership. In addition, unaudited quarterly financial reports and

<PAGE> 36
kept at the Partnership's principal place of business. Any General Partner and
its representatives or designees may, during regular business hours, inspect
the books and records of the Partnership, and each General Partner and its
auditors may, during regular business hours, conduct an audit of such books and
records at its own expense. The Partnership shall provide access to the
facilities, systems and books and records of the Partnership to the extent
reasonably considered necessary by the auditors and internal audit departments
of the inspecting General Partner in the performance of the audits of the
inspecting General Partner. Whenever any such audit is conducted by any
General Partner and its auditors, such General Partner shall advise the other
General Partners and permit the other General Partners and their auditors to be
present during such audit.

7.5. Certain Tax Matters.

7.5.1. Preparation of Tax Returns. The Tax Matters Partner
shall arrange for the preparation and timely filing of all returns of
Partnership income, gains, losses, deductions, credits, and other items
necessary for federal and state income tax purposes, shall provide copies
of draft tax returns to all of the Partners at least fifteen days prior to
filing the returns and shall use reasonable good faith efforts to furnish
to the Partners within ninety days after the close of each taxable year of
the Partnership the tax information reasonably required for federal, state
and local income tax reporting purposes. The Tax Matters Partner shall
use good faith efforts to supply each Partner with the information
necessary to determine estimated tax payments or any other information
related to taxes reasonably requested by each Partner. The
classification, realization, and recognition of income, gains, losses,
deductions, credits, and other items shall be on the accrual method of
accounting for federal income tax purposes. The Tax Matters Partner shall
not change from the accrual method of accounting initially elected by the
Partnership (except if required to do so by law) without approval of the
Executive Committee.

7.5.2. Tax Elections. Except as provided in Sections 7.5.1 and

whether to make any election available under the Code or any other
applicable taxing statute.

7.5.3. Tax Controversies. Within 60 days after the date hereof,
the Executive Committee shall select a General Partner to serve as the
initial Tax Matters Partner and in any other similar capacity under state

expiration of such term, the other General Partner shall be designated to
act as the Tax Matters Partner and the General Partners shall thereafter

- 35 -
<PAGE> 37
alternate as Tax Matters Partner for two year periods during the term of
this Agreement. The Tax Matters Partner is authorized and required to
represent the Partnership (at the Partnership's expense) in connection
with all examinations of the Partnership's affairs by tax authorities,
including resulting administrative and judicial proceedings, and to expend
Partnership funds for professional services and costs associated
therewith. Each of the Partners agrees to cooperate with the Tax Matters
Partner and to do or refrain from doing any and all things reasonably
required by the Tax Matters Partner to conduct such proceedings. The
Partner designated as the Tax Matters Partner shall serve in such role
until the earlier of (i) the expiration of its term, (ii) its resignation
or (iii) a determination by the Executive Committee that a different
Partner should serve as the Tax Matters Partner.

7.6. Bank Accounts. The Partnership shall maintain appropriate accounts
at one or more financial institutions for all funds of the Partnership. Such
accounts shall be used solely for the business of the Partnership. Withdrawal
from such accounts shall be made only upon the signature of those persons
authorized by the Executive Committee.

ARTICLE 8.
TRANSFER OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; CHANGE OF 
OWNERSHIP; ADDITIONAL PARTNERS

8.1. Certain Definitions. The following terms when used in this
Agreement will have the respective meanings set forth below:

HOLDING COMPANY means any person of which a Partnership Interest or the
direct or indirect ownership thereof comprises all or substantially all of
its value in the reasonable judgment of the Executive Committee (as
determined by affirmative vote of members of the Executive Committee
representing Partners who then hold a majority of the then outstanding
Percentage Interests of all Partners excluding the Partner whose
Partnership Interest is at issue).

EQUITY INTEREST means any equity interest in a Holding Company.

TRANSFER means any disposition of all or any part of a Partnership
Interest or an Equity Interest, voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation
of law, including, without limitation, any sale, assignment, gift, pledge,
encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or merger; provided,
however, that any transaction involving a transfer both of

- 36 -
<PAGE> 38
ownership of a Partner's entire Partnership Interest and of other
substantial (in the reasonable judgment of the Executive Committee as
determined by affirmative vote of members of the Executive Committee
representing Partners who then hold a majority of the then outstanding
Percentage Interests of all Partners excluding the Partner whose
Partnership Interest is at issue) assets of such Partner or its Affiliates
shall not constitute a Transfer.

8.2. Restrictions on Transfer of Interests. Except as otherwise
expressly permitted by this Agreement, no Partner or its Affiliates shall
Transfer all or any part of its Partnership Interest or all or any part of its
Equity Interest, unless (i) such Transfer is permitted pursuant to Section 8.3
hereof and (ii) such Partner has complied with the provisions of Section 8.4
hereof. Any Transfer or purported Transfer of any Equity Interest or
Partnership Interest not made in accordance with this Article 8 shall be null
and void, but shall give rise to the consequences described in Section 8.8
hereof.

8.3. Permitted Transfers. Subject to the conditions and restrictions set
forth in Section 8.4 hereof, (a) a Partner or its Affiliates may at any time
Transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest or Equity Interest to a
Wholly Owned Affiliate of the transferor without the consent of the Executive
Committee if such Wholly Owned Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by the
terms and conditions of this Agreement applicable to the transferor as if it
had been a signatory hereto, (b) a Partner or its Affiliates may transfer its
Partnership Interests or Equity Interests in PCSCO or PCSN, as the case may be,
to Cellco and WMC, respectively, (c) a Partner or its Affiliates may make
broadly dispersed, underwritten public offerings of Equity Interests, or (d) a
Partner Parent may make a tax-free spinoff qualifying under section 355 of the
Code, to its shareholders of an entity the assets of which include all, but not
less than all, of such Partner Parent's ownership interest in the Partnership
and PCSCO or PCSN, as the case may be. A Transfer of less than all of a
Partner's Partnership Interest pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be deemed to
constitute a transfer of both the General Partner and Limited Partner
Percentage Interests of such Partner pro rata in proportion to the portion of
such Partner's entire Partnership Interest transferred. In addition, a Partner
or its Affiliates may effect a spin- off, distribution or dividend of Equity
Interests to the shareholders of the Partner Parents of the Partner or
Affiliate. In the event that a Transfer permitted under this Section 8.3
causes a termination of the Partnership under Section 708 of the Code, the
transferee shall indemnify and hold harmless the other Partners from all costs
or other adverse effects (including, but not limited to, the reduction of tax
benefits attributable to depreciation or amortization) resulting from such
termination.

- 37 -
<PAGE> 39
8.4. Effective Transfer.

(a) Prior to the date of any Transfer of a Partnership Interest, the
transferor and transferee shall furnish the Partnership with the
transferee's taxpayer identification number, sufficient
information to determine the transferee's initial tax basis in
the Partnership Interest transferred, and any other information
reasonably necessary to permit the Partnership to file all
required federal, state and local tax returns and other legally
required information statements or returns. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Partnership shall not be
required to make any distribution otherwise provided for in this
Agreement with respect to any transferred Partnership Interest
until it has received such information.

(b) Prior to the Transfer of any Partnership Interest, the 
transferee shall

(i) execute an amendment of this Agreement or a counterpart
to the signature page of this Agreement which shall
provide, "The undersigned hereby accepts and agrees to be
bound by all of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and shall become a substitute Partner under
this Agreement"; and

(ii) if the transferee is a corporation, provide the
Partnership with evidence satisfactory to the Partnership
of its authority to become a Partner and to be bound by
the terms of this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Transfer of any Partnership Interest or Equity 
Interest, the transferee shall:

(i) provide an opinion of counsel to the Partnership that the
Transfer does not (a) violate the then applicable federal
or state securities laws or rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission or any successor
thereto, any state securities commission and any other
government agencies with jurisdiction over such Transfer;
(b) subject the Partnership to greater regulation or
restriction under the MFJ than existed immediately prior
to such admission; (c) subject the Partnership to any
federal, state or local rule, regulation or law that
materially adversely affects the business or financial
condition of the Partnership; or (d) materially adversely
affect the Partnership's existence or qualification under
the Act; and

- 38 -

<PAGE> 40
(ii) provide the Partnership with evidence satisfactory to the
Partnership that any necessary prior consents have been
obtained from any regulatory authorities.

8.5. Change of Ownership. Upon any Change of Control of a General
Partner (other than a Change of Control resulting from a change of control of a
Partner Parent) (a CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP), the Partner subject to the Change of
Ownership shall promptly give notice thereof to the other General Partner and
the Partner not undergoing the Change of Ownership shall be entitled, at any
time within a 90-day period following the later of such notice or the Change of
Ownership, to purchase all but not less than all of the Partnership Interest of
the Partner undergoing the Change of Ownership at a purchase price equal to the
Private Market Value of the Partnership Interest determined as described below.
In the event that a Partnership Interest is not purchased pursuant to the
preceding sentence, any Person effecting such Change of Ownership shall, by
binding written instrument which shall be enforceable by the Partnership and
the other Partners, assume all of the obligations and liabilities hereunder of
the Partner which is the subject of such Change of Ownership. PRIVATE MARKET
VALUE means, with respect to any interest in the Partnership, as of the date of
determination, the Fair Market Value of such asset adjusted to include a pro
rata share of any control premium inherent in a sale of the Partnership as a
whole. FAIR MARKET VALUE shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Tomcom
Partnership Agreement and the Fair Market Value, as of the date of
determination, of any asset shall be determined (a) by mutual agreement of the
General Partners or (b) if no such agreement is reached within ten days of the
relevant date of determination, as follows:

(i) Selection of Appraisers. Each General Partner shall
designate by written notice to the Partnership and each
General Partner a firm of recognized national standing
familiar with appraisal techniques applicable to assets
of the type being evaluated to serve as an Appraiser
pursuant to this Section 8.5 (the firms designated by the
General Partners being referred to herein FIRST APPRAISER
and the SECOND APPRAISER, respectively) with five
business days after the failure to reach agreement in
accordance with the terms of clause (a) above. In the
event that either General Partner fails to designate its
or their Appraiser within the foregoing time period, the
other shall have the right to designate such Appraiser by
notifying the failing party or parties in writing of such
designation (and the Appraiser so

- 39 -

<PAGE> 41
designated shall be the First Appraiser or the Second
Appraiser, as the case may be).

(ii) Evaluation Procedures. Each Appraiser shall be directed to
determine the Private Market Value of the asset. Each
Appraiser will also be directed to deliver an Appraiser's
Certificate to each General Partner on or before the 30th day
after their respective designation (the CERTIFICATE DATE),
upon the conclusion of its evaluation, and each Appraiser's
Certificate once delivered may not be retracted or modified
in any respect. Each Appraiser will keep confidential all
information disclosed by the Partnership in the course of
conducting its evaluation, and, to that end, will execute
such customary documentation as the Partnership may
reasonably request with respect to such confidentiality
obligation. The General Partners will cooperate in causing
the Partnership to provide each Appraiser with such
information within the Partnership's possession that may be
reasonably requested in writing by the Appraiser for purposes
of its evaluation hereunder. The Appraisers shall consult
with each other in the course of conducting their respective
evaluations. Each General Partner shall have full access to
each Appraiser's work papers. Each Appraiser will be
directed to comply with the provisions of this Section 8.5,
and to that end each party will provide to its respective
Appraiser a complete and correct copy of this Section 8.5
(and the definitions of capitalized terms used in this
Section 8.5 that are defined elsewhere in this Agreement).

(iii) Private Market Determination. The Private Market Value of any
asset shall be determined on the basis of the Appraisers
Certificates in accordance with the provisions of this
subparagraph (iii). The higher of the values set forth on
the Appraisers' Certificates is hereinafter referred to as
the HIGHER VALUE, and the lower of such values is hereinafter
referred to as the LOWER VALUE. If the Higher Value is not
more than 110% of the Lower Value, the Private Market Value
will be the arithmetic average of such two Values. If the
Higher Value is more than 110% of the Lower Value, a third
appraiser shall be selected in accordance with the provisions
of subparagraph (iv) below, and the Private Market Value will
be determined in

- 40 -
<PAGE> 42
accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (v) below.

(iv) Selection of and Procedures for Third Appraiser. If the Higher
Value is more than 110% of the Lower Value, within seven days
thereafter the First Appraiser and the Second Appraiser shall
agree upon and jointly designate a third firm of recognized
national standing familiar with appraisal techniques
applicable to assets of the type being evaluated to serve as
an appraiser pursuant to this Section 8.5 (the THIRD
APPRAISER), by written notice to each General Partner. The
General Partners shall direct the Third Appraiser to
determine the Private Market Value of the asset (the THIRD
VALUE) in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (ii)
above, and Certificate on or before the 30th day after the
designation of such appraiser hereunder. The Third Appraiser
will be directed to comply with the provisions of this
Section 8.5, and to that end of the parties will provide to
the Third Appraiser a complete and correct copy of this
Section 8.5 (and the definitions of capitalized terms used in
this Section 8.5 that are defined elsewhere in this
Agreement).

(v) Alternative Determination of Private Market. Upon the delivery
of the Appraiser's Certificate of the Third Appraiser, the
Private Market Value will be determined as provided in this
subparagraph (v). The Private Market Value will be (w) the
Lower Value, if the Third Value is less than the Lower Value,
(x) the Higher Value, if the Third Value is greater than the
Higher Value, (y) the arithmetic average of the Third Value
and the other Value (Lower or Higher) that is closer to the
Third Value if the Third Value falls within the range between
(and including) the Lower Value and the Higher Value and (z)
the Third Value, if the Lower Value and the Higher Value are
equally close to the Third Value.

(vi) Costs. Each General Partners will bear the cost of the Appraiser
designated by it or on its behalf. If the Higher Value is
not more than 115% of the Lower Value, or if the Higher Value
and the Lower Value are equally close to the Third Value,
each General Partner shall bear 50% of the cost of the Third
Appraiser, if any; otherwise, the party whose Appraiser's
determination of Private Market Value is

- 41 -

<PAGE> 43
further away from the Third Value shall bear the entire 
costs of the Third Appraiser. The General Partners 
agree to pay when due the fees and expenses of the 
Appraisers in accordance with the foregoing provisions.

(vii) Conclusive Determination. To the fullest extent provided 
by law, the determination of the Private Market Value 
made pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall be final and 
binding on the Partnership and the Partners hereto, and 
such determination shall not be appealable to or 
reviewable by any court or arbitrator; provided that the 
foregoing shall not limit a Partner's rights to seek 
arbitration of the obligations of the other Partners and 
the Partnership hereunder.

8.6. Additional Partners. Additional partners may be admitted to the
Partnership as General Partners or Limited Partners upon approval by the
Executive Committee.

(a) Any additional partner admitted to the Partnership pursuant to
this Section 8.6 (the ADDITIONAL PARTNER) shall become a Partner
in the Partnership and shall be bound by this Agreement upon the
completion of the following:

(i) Execution by the Additional Partner of an amendment of
this Agreement or a counterpart to the signature page of
this Agreement which shall provide, "The undersigned
hereby accepts and agrees to be bound by all of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement.";

(ii) If the Additional Partner is a corporation, it shall have
provided the Partnership with evidence satisfactory to
the Partnership of its authority to become a Partner and
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement;

(iii) The Additional Partner shall have provided an opinion of
counsel to the Partnership that the admission of the
Additional Partner does not (a) violate the then
applicable federal or state securities laws or rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or
any successor thereto, any state securities commissions
and any other government agencies with jurisdiction over
the Partnership; (b) subject the Partnership to greater
regulation or restriction under the MFJ than existed
immediately prior to such admission; (c) subject the

- 42 -

<PAGE> 44
Partnership to any federal, state or local rule,
regulation or law that materially adversely affects the
business or financial condition of the Partnership; or
(d) materially adversely affect the Partnership's
existence or qualification under the Act; and

(iv) Any necessary prior consents shall have been obtained
from any regulatory authorities.

8.7. Covenant Not to Withdraw or Dissolve. Notwithstanding any provision
of the Act, each Partner hereby covenants and agrees that the Partners have
entered into this Agreement based on their mutual expectation that, except as
otherwise expressly required or permitted hereby, no Partner shall withdraw or
retire from the Partnership, be entitled to demand or receive a return of such
Partner's contributions or profits (or a bond or other security for the return
of such contributions or profits), or exercise any power under the Act to
dissolve the Partnership without the approval of the Executive Committee.

8.8. Consequences of Breaches of Covenant. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the Act, if a Partner or its Affiliate (BREACHING PARTNER) (i)
attempts to Transfer its Partnership Interest or Equity Interest in breach of
Section 8.2, (ii) attempts to cause a partition in breach of Section 2.7, (iii)
attempts to withdraw from the Partnership or dissolve the Partnership in breach
of Section 8.7, or (iv) suffers an Event of Bankruptcy, the Partnership shall
continue and such Breaching Partner shall be subject to this Section 8.8 and in
such event, the following shall occur:

(a) (i) the Breaching Partner shall immediately cease to be a
General Partner, (ii) the general partnership interests in the
Partnership of such Breaching Partner shall automatically be
deemed to become limited partnership interests, (iii) such
Breaching Partner shall have no right to participate in the
management of the Partnership, including the right to appoint
members at the Executive Committee, and shall have no further
power to act for or bind the Partnership, and (iv) the other
Partners are, without necessity of any further action or
documentation, hereby appointed attorneys-in- fact of the
Breaching Partner for the purpose of carrying out the provisions
of this Section 8.8 and taking any action and executing any
documents which such Partners may deem necessary or advisable to
accomplish the purposes hereof, such appointment being
irrevocable and coupled with an interest;

- 43 -

<PAGE> 45
(b) the other Partners shall continue to have the right to possess
the Partnership's property and goodwill and to conduct its
business and affairs;

(c) the Breaching Partner shall be liable in damages, without
requirement of a prior accounting, to the Partnership for all
costs and liabilities that the Partnership or any Partner may
incur as the result of such breach;

(d) the Partnership shall have no obligation to pay to the Breaching
Partner its contributions, capital, or profits, but may, by
notice to the Breaching Partner within 30 days of its withdrawal,
elect to make Breach Payments (as hereinafter defined) to the
Breaching Partner in complete satisfaction of the Breaching
Partner's interest in the Partnership;

(e) if the Partnership does not elect to make Breach Payments
pursuant to Section 8.8(d) hereof, the Partnership shall treat
the Breaching Partner as if it were an unadmitted assignee of the
interest of the Breaching Partner and shall make distributions
and allocations to the Breaching Partner only of those amounts
and items otherwise payable or allocable with respect to such
interest hereunder;

(f) the Partnership may apply any distributions otherwise payable
with respect to such interest (including Breach Payments) to
satisfy any claims it may have against the Breaching Partner;

(g) the Breaching Partner shall have no right to inspect the
Partnership's books or records or obtain other information
concerning the Partnership's operations; and

(h) the Breaching Partner shall continue to be liable to the
Partnership for any unpaid capital contributions required
hereunder with respect to such interest and to be jointly and
severally liable with the other Partners for any debts and
liabilities (whether actual or contingent, known or unknown) of
the Partnership existing at the time the Breaching Partner
withdraws or dissolves.

8.8.1. Breach Payments. For purposes hereof, Breach Payments shall be
made in five installments, each equal to 20% of the Breach Amount, payable on
the next five consecutive anniversaries of the breach by the Breaching Partner,
with simple interest accrued from the date of such breach through the date each
such installment is paid on the unpaid balance of such Breach Amount at the
lowest rate per annum necessary to avoid imputed interest on such payments
under the Code. The Breach Amount shall be an amount equal to 90% of the
greater of (i) 100 dollars or (ii) the

- 44 -

<PAGE> 46
Capital Account balance (calculated on the assumption that Partner Notes
then outstanding are not repaid) of the Breaching Partner as of the last day of
the month preceding the month during which such breach occurred, less any
Partnership distributions to the Breaching Partner after such day. In
addition, any Partner Note of the Breaching Partner shall be cancelled, but
without the necessity of making any payment in respect thereof. The Breach
Amount as so determined shall be final and binding on the Partnership and the
Breaching Partner. The Partnership may, at its sole election, prepay all or
any portion of the Breach Payments or interest accrued thereon at any time
without penalty.

8.8.2. No Bonding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Act,
if, under Section 8.8(e) hereof, the Partnership treats a Breaching Partner as
an unadmitted assignee of an interest in the Partnership, the Partnership shall
not be obligated to secure the value of the Breaching Partner's interest by
bond or otherwise; provided, however, that if a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that, in order to continue the business of the Partnership such
value must be so secured, the Partnership may provide such security. If the
Partnership provides such security, the Breaching Partner shall not have any
right to participate in Partnership profits or distributions during the term of
the Partnership, or to receive any interest on the value of such interest. For
this purpose, the value of the interest of the Breaching Partner shall be an
amount equal to 90% of the greater of (i) 100 dollars or (ii) the Capital
Account balance (calculated on the assumption that Partner Notes then
outstanding are not repaid) of such interest as of the last day of the month
preceding the month during which the breach by the Breaching Partner occurs.

ARTICLE 9.

Confidential Information during the term of this Agreement or at any time
thereafter for any purpose other than the performance of its obligations or the
exercise of its rights under this Agreement. The Partnership and each Partner

Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of this
Section 9.2.

ARTICLE 10.
DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

10.1. Dissolution Generally.

(a) The Partnership will be dissolved on the earliest of (i) an
affirmative vote of the Executive Committee; (ii) delivery of the
Change of Control Dissolution Notice

- 46 -

<PAGE> 48
contemplated by Section 10.1(c); or (iii) 12:00 midnight on the
Termination Date (hereinafter defined); provided, however, that
the Partnership shall not terminate until its affairs have been
wound up and its assets distributed as provided herein (a
DISSOLUTION EVENT).

(b) Without the unanimous written consent of the Partners, each
Partner agrees not to withdraw as a Partner or do anything that
would otherwise dissolve the Partnership (except as permitted by
the terms of Article 10). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
General Partner withdraws from the Partnership, upon such
withdrawal, (i) the general partner interests in the Partnership
of such Partner shall automatically be deemed to become limited
partner interests in the Partnership and (ii) such Partner shall
have no right to participate in the management of the business
and affairs of the Partnership, including the right to designate
members of the Executive Committee.

(c) Changes of Control. In the event of a Change of Control
(hereinafter defined) of any General Partner (such Partner, the
CHANGE OF CONTROL PARTNER), the other General Partner shall have
the right to elect, by notice in writing to all Partners (the
CHANGE OF CONTROL DISSOLUTION NOTICE), to cause the Partnership
to be dissolved and liquidated in accordance with Section 10.3.
Such Change of Control Dissolution Notice shall be given not
later than 90 days after the Change of Control, and, if not given
within such period, the right to cause a dissolution and
liquidation based on such Change of Control will cease. CHANGE
OF CONTROL shall be deemed to have occurred when (i) any Person,
other than a Partner Parent of such Partner or a Wholly Owned
Affiliate of such Partner Parent (an UNAFFILIATED ENTITY), shall
acquire (whether by merger, consolidation, sale, assignment,
lease, transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions), or otherwise beneficially own 50% or more
of the outstanding voting securities of any Partner (or any
entity which, directly or indirectly through the ownership of one
or more majority-owned successive subsidiary entities, owns more
than 50% of the outstanding voting interests in such Partner) (a
CONTROL ENTITY) or (ii) the Partner Parents of such Partner shall
otherwise cease to beneficially own a majority of the outstanding
voting securities of such Partner or any Control Entity of such
Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the transactions
contemplated by Section 8.3 shall not constitute a Change of
Control hereunder.

- 47 -

<PAGE> 49

(d) The TERMINATION DATE shall mean December 31, 2014, provided that
the Termination Date shall be October 20, 2001 if (i) either
Partner elects in its sole discretion in light of business
circumstances at that time to terminate the Partnership on that
date, and (ii) the Tax Cost (hereinafter defined) associated with
such termination would not exceed $100 million. TAX COST shall
mean the total amount of Taxes which would be recognized by all
Partners as a result of the liquidation of the Partnership in
accordance with Section 10.3 hereof immediately after the
Termination Date.

10.2. Bankruptcy of a General Partner. If a General Partner suffers an
Event of Bankruptcy at such time the bankrupt Partner is the only General
Partner, the other Partners may (i) consent in writing to dissolve the
Partnership or (ii) within 90 days after such Event of Bankruptcy occurs, agree
in writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to appoint,
effective as of the date of such Event of Bankruptcy, one or more additional
General Partners. In the case of clause (ii), the business of the Partnership
shall be carried on by such newly appointed General Partner(s) and the bankrupt
Partner shall have its general partnership interest in the Partnership
converted into a limited partner interest in the Partnership and continue to
be, or become a Limited Partner subject to the provisions of Section 10.2. In
the event the remaining Partners fail to make any election pursuant to this
Section 10.2, the Partnership shall be dissolved. In the event any General
Partner shall become a "debtor" as defined in the United States Bankruptcy Code
of 1978, as amended (the BANKRUPTCY CODE) in any case commenced thereunder and
at any time during the pendency of such case there shall be appointed (i) a
trustee with respect to the bankrupt Partner under Section 701, 702 or 1104 of
the Bankruptcy Code (or any successor provisions thereto), or (ii) an examiner
having expanded powers beyond those specifically enumerated in Section 1104(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code, then the other Partners may, at any time thereafter, so
long as such condition exists, elect to dissolve the Partnership, in which
event the affairs of the Partnership shall be wound up as provided in this
Article 10.

10.3. Liquidation.

(a) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, the Partner selected by the
Executive Committee shall be the liquidator of the Partnership (the
LIQUIDATING PARTNER). The Liquidating Partner shall be entitled to
receive such compensation for its services as may be approved by the
Executive Committee. The Liquidating Partner shall not resign at any
time without fifteen days' prior written notice and

- 48 -

<PAGE> 50
may be removed only by a decision of the Executive Committee.
Upon dissolution, resignation, or removal of the Liquidating
Partner, a successor and substitute Liquidating Partner (who
shall have and succeed to all rights, powers, and obligations of
the original Liquidating Partner) shall, within thirty days
thereafter, be approved by the Executive Committee. Except as
expressly provided in this Article 10, the Liquidating Partner
approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may
exercise, without further authorization or approval of the
Executive Committee or any Partner, all of the powers conferred
upon the Tax Matters Partner under the terms of this Agreement
(but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual
and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers) to the extent
appropriate or necessary in the good faith judgment of the
Liquidating Partner to carry out the duties and functions of the
Liquidating Partner hereunder for and during such period of time
as shall be reasonably required in the good faith judgment of the
Liquidating Partner to complete the winding-up and liquidation of
the Partnership as provided for herein. Prior to any
distribution, the Capital Accounts of the Partners shall be
adjusted pursuant to Article 6 to reflect their respective
distributive shares of the income, gain, loss and deduction of
the Partnership up through and including the date of distribution
(including any income, gain, loss, and deduction that arises by
reason of the adjustment of the Agreed Values of Partnership
assets that occurs by reason of the dissolution). The
Liquidating Partner shall, subject to providing adequate reserves
for the payment of amounts payable under Section 10.3(a)(i)
hereof, implement the definitive liquidation plan described in
Section 10.3(e) and shall distribute assets among the Partners as
contemplated thereby (with the Agreed Value being debited against
such Partner's Capital Account balance), provided that no Partner
may receive an amount in excess of its positive Capital Account
balance. If any assets still remain in the Partnership, the
Liquidating Partner shall liquidate such assets and apply and
distribute the proceeds of such liquidation in the following
order and priority, to the maximum extent permitted by law:

(i) First, to creditors of the Partnership (including
Partners to the extent permitted by law) in satisfaction
of the Partnership's known debts and liabilities (whether
by payment or the making of provision for the known
amount thereof); and

- 49 -

<PAGE> 51
(ii) Second, to the Partners, in proportion to and to the
extent of the positive balances in their respective
Capital Accounts appropriately adjusted as set forth
above.

(b) On or before December 31, 2013, unless a Partner has elected to
cause the Termination Date to be October 20, 2001, in which case
on or before October 20, 2000, or on or before the 30th day after
an event described in Section 10.1(a)(i) or (ii) or any other
event of dissolution, each General Partner shall submit a
proposed plan of liquidation of the Partnership (a LIQUIDATING
PROPOSAL) to the Executive Committee. The Liquidating Proposals
shall provide for distributions to Partners of the Partnership's
assets, in kind, in proportion to and to the extent of the
respective balances in their Capital Accounts adjusted as
provided in Section 10.3(a)(ii). Subject to the foregoing, a
Liquidating Proposal shall also take into account the following
considerations (with the matters described in clause (i) and
(ii)(E) on the one hand and clauses (ii)(A), (B) and (C) on the
other hand, being given equal weight):

(i) To the extent practicable, the Liquidating Proposal shall
be designed to minimize the imposition of taxes upon the
Partners (and may, to that end, provide for the
continuation of certain operations) and to provide for a
distribution of Section 751 property on a pro rata basis.

(ii) The proposed allocation of PCS Licenses and related
properties (including equity interests in entities owned
by the Partnership) among the Partners shall be developed
with a view to achieving the following objectives:

(A) Each Partner shall receive PCS Licenses covering
geographical areas which, in the aggregate,
contain an approximately equal number of natural
persons in the service area;

(B) Each PCS License shall be distributed to the
Partner, if any, which holds other wireless
telecommunications businesses that are
contiguous to or would otherwise have
geographical synergy with such PCS License;

(C) PCS Licenses concentrated in a particular 
geographic area shall be distributed to a 
single Partner;

- 50 -

<PAGE> 52
(D) The indirect joint ownership of a PCS License by
the Partnership and a Designated Entity and the
terms of such relationship shall be taken into
account in determining the relative value of
such interest; and

(E) The amount of any cash payment needed to offset
the receipt by a Partner of PCS Licenses and
related assets and liabilities having a fair
market value greater than such Partner's
proportionate share of the positive Capital
Account balances of the Partners shall be
minimized, and to that end, the proposed
allocation may provide for the continuation of
certain operations in joint venture or
partnership form.

(c) The Executive Committee shall consider each Liquidating Proposal
in good faith and shall adopt a plan of liquidation of the
Partnership by unanimous vote within twenty days of receiving the
Liquidating Proposals. If the Executive Committee is unable to
agree upon a mutually satisfactory plan of liquidation, each of
the General Partners shall first refer the matter to the chief
executive officer of the respective Partner Parent designated by
each such General Partner for resolution by unanimous vote of
such chief executive officers. If such officers are unable to
resolve the dispute within 20 days after the matter has been
referred to them, they shall refer the matter to arbitration in
accordance with paragraph (d) below.

(d) Not later than 10 days following the failure of the designated
chief executive officers of the Partner Parents to agree upon a
plan of liquidation, the issue shall be submitted to arbitration
by a single arbitrator under the direction of the American
Arbitration Association. The situs of the arbitration shall be
Chicago, Illinois. The arbitrator shall be selected by the
General Partners and shall be familiar with the PCS and cellular
industries. If the General Partners cannot agree on the
arbitrator within 10 days of the submission of the dispute to
arbitration, an arbitrator with such qualifications shall be
named by the American Arbitration Association within 10 days
thereafter. Each of the Liquidating Proposals submitted by the
General Partners to the Executive Committee pursuant to Section
10.3(c) above shall be presented to the arbitrator. Within 45
days of the submission of the Liquidating Proposals to

- 51 -

<PAGE> 53
arbitration, the arbitrator shall select the Liquidating Proposal
that the arbitrator determines best satisfies the criteria set
forth in Sections 10.3(b)(i) and 10.3(b)(ii) above. The
arbitrator must select one such Liquidating Proposal in its
entirety, without incorporating terms from any other Liquidating
Proposal or varying, modifying or otherwise altering the terms of
the Liquidating Proposal in any way. The arbitrator shall have
no right to include or decide issues other than the selection of
a Liquidating Proposal and the Agreed Values of any asset to be
distributed. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final,
unappealable and legally binding and the Partnership shall
promptly implement the Liquidating Proposal selected by the
arbitrator. Except as specified herein, the then existing
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association shall govern the conduct of the arbitration.

(e) After a definitive plan of liquidation pursuant to this Section
10.3 has been approved, the Executive Committee and each Partner
and its Affiliates shall promptly seek all necessary regulatory
and other approvals and shall take all other necessary actions to
effect such plan of liquidation.

10.4. Distribution in Trust. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 10.3 requiring the liquidation of the assets of the Partnership,
but subject to the order of priorities set forth therein, in the
discretion of the Executive Committee, a pro rata portion of the
distributions that would otherwise be made to the Partners pursuant to
Section 10.3(a)(ii) hereof may be:

(a) distributed to a trust established for the benefit of the
Partners for the purposes of liquidating Partnership assets,
collecting amounts owed to the Partnership, and paying any
contingent or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the
Partnership or of the Partners arising out of or in connection
with the Partnership. The assets of any such trust shall be
distributed to the Partners from time to time, in the reasonable
discretion of the Executive Committee, in the same proportions as
the amount distributed to such trust by the Partnership would
otherwise have been distributed to the Partners pursuant to this
Agreement; or

(b) withheld to provide a reasonable reserve of Partnership
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) and to reflect the
unrealized portion of any installment obligations owed to the
Partnership, provided that such withheld amounts

- 52 -

<PAGE> 54
shall be distributed to the Partners as soon as practicable.

In exercising its rights under this Section 10.4, the Executive Committee
must comply with the liquidating distribution timing requirements of Section
10.6 hereof. By way of clarification, for purposes of determining the
Partners' respective shares of income, gain, loss, and deduction of the
Partnership for the taxable year of the Partnership in which the distribution
in liquidation occurs and of adjusting the Capital Accounts of the Partners
therefor in accordance with Section 10.3 and Article 6, the definitions herein
of "Agreed Value" and "Profits" and "Losses" require that Partnership assets to
be distributed to the trust referred to in clause (a) above or to the Partners
in accordance with Section 10.3 hereof shall be considered to have been first
sold at their fair market values (taking Code Section 7701(g) into account) and
the Profits or Losses deemed realized therefrom shall be allocated among the
Partners as if an actual sale had occurred, and the Capital Accounts of the
Partners shall be adjusted to reflect such allocation in accordance with
Article 6. The fair market value of any property distributed to such trust
shall be the value determined by the Executive Committee.

10.5. Rights of Partners. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each Partner shall look solely to the assets of the Partnership for
the return of its capital contributions and shall have no right or power to
demand or receive property other than cash from the Partnership. No Partner
shall have priority over any other Partner as to the return of his capital
contributions, distributions, or allocations except as provided in this
Agreement.

10.6. Compliance with Timing Requirements of Regulations. In the event
that the Partnership is liquidated within the meaning of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), then distributions shall be made pursuant to Section 10.3
to the Partners who have positive Capital Accounts in compliance with the
timing requirements of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2). If any
Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital Account (after giving effect to
all contributions, distributions and allocations for all taxable years,
including the year during which such liquidation occurs), such Partner shall
contribute to the capital of the Partnership the amount necessary to restore
such deficit balance to zero in compliance with Regulations Section 1.704-
1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(3).

10.7. Non-Dissolving Code Section 708(b) Terminations. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Article 10, in the event that the Partnership is
liquidated within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) but
no Dissolution Event

- 53 -

<PAGE> 55
has occurred, the Partnership's assets shall not be liquidated, the
Partnership's liabilities shall not be paid or discharged, and the
Partnership's affairs shall not be wound up. Instead, the Partnership shall be
deemed to have distributed the assets of the Partnership in kind to the
Partners, who shall be deemed to have assumed and taken subject to all
Partnership liabilities, all in accordance with their Capital Accounts and if
any Partner's Capital Account has a deficit balance (after giving effect to all
contributions, distributions, and allocations for all fiscal years, including
the fiscal year during which such liquidation occurs), such Partner shall
contribute to the capital of the Partnership the amount necessary to restore
such deficit balance to zero in compliance with Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2(ii)(b)(3). Immediately thereafter the Partners shall be deemed to
have recontributed such assets in kind to the Partnership, which shall be
deemed to have assumed and taken subject to all such liabilities.

10.8. Allocations during the Period of Liquidation. Until the date on
which all of the assets of the Partnership have been distributed to the
Partners pursuant to Section 10.3 hereof, the Partners shall continue to share
Profits, Losses and other items of Partnership income, gain, deduction and loss
as provided in Article 6 hereof.

ARTICLE 11.
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

11.1. Further Assurances. From and after the date of execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Partners shall execute and deliver such further
documents and instruments and shall do such further acts and things as any
Partner may reasonably request in order to effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Partners shall cooperate and assist one
another in the performance of the provisions of this Agreement and shall take
such steps as are reasonably necessary to allow another party to this Agreement
to discharge its obligations under this Agreement.

11.2. Assignment. No Partner may assign or otherwise transfer,
including, without limitation, by operation of law, this Agreement or any of
its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with the provisions of
Articles 8 and 10. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding
upon the Partners, their legal representatives, successors and assigns.

11.3. Breach; Equitable Relief. The Partners acknowledge that the rights
of the Partners described in this Agreement are unique and that money damages
alone for breach of this Agreement

- 54 -

<PAGE> 56
would not constitute an adequate remedy. Any Partner aggrieved by a breach of
the provisions hereof may bring an action at law or suit in equity to obtain
redress, including without limitation specific performance, injunctive relief
or any other available equitable remedy. Time and strict performance are of
the essence in this Agreement.

11.4. Amendment. No amendment to this Agreement shall be valid unless
such amendment is in writing and is signed by authorized representatives of the
parties hereto.

11.5. Waiver. Any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement may be
waived at any time and from time to time in writing by the party entitled to
the benefit thereof, but a waiver in one instance shall not be deemed to
constitute a waiver in any other instance. A failure to enforce any provision
of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such provision or of any
other provision hereof.

11.6. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement
shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any circumstance, the
remaining provisions shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and
shall be construed as if the unenforceable portion or portions were deleted.

11.7. Construction. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
for the benefit of or enforceable by any third party; provided, however, that
Mandatory Indemnitees shall have the right to enforce the indemnification
provisions of Section 5.2 as such provisions apply to them. No third party,
including without limitation any creditor or employee of the Partnership, shall
have any rights against the Partners or any of their Affiliates, successors or
assigns by reason of or under this Agreement.

11.8. Governing Law; Arbitration.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

(b) Each Partner hereby irrevocably appoints The Corporation Trust
Company, at its office in Wilmington, Delaware, United States of
America, its lawful agent and attorney to accept and acknowledge
service of any and all process against it in any action, suit or
proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement and upon
whom such process may be served, with the same effect as if such
party were a resident of the State of Delaware and had been
lawfully served with such process in such jurisdiction, and
waives all claim of error by reason of such service; provided
that in the case of any service upon such agent and

- 55 -
<PAGE> 57
attorney, the party effecting such service shall also deliver a
copy thereof to the other party at the address and in the manner
specified in Section 11.12. In the event that such agent and
attorney resigns or otherwise becomes incapable of acting as
such, such party will appoint a successor agent and attorney in
Wilmington, Delaware, reasonably satisfactory to the other party,
with like powers.

(c) Each Partner hereby acknowledges that this Agreement is subject
to the Arbitration Agreement of the Partners which is being
entered into of even date herewith, and the Arbitration Agreement
will govern the resolution of disputes relating to this Agreement
in accordance with its terms. Each Additional Partner or
substitute Partner shall execute the Arbitration Agreement or a
counterpart to the Arbitration Agreement on or prior to its
admission to the Partnership.

11.9. Attorneys' Fees. If suit or action is filed by any Partner to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, or otherwise with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees as fixed by the trial court and, if any
appeal is taken from the decision of the trial court, reasonable attorneys'
fees as fixed by the appellate court. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
prevailing party shall be deemed to include a Partner that successfully opposes
a petition for review filed with an appellate court.

11.10. MFJ Compliance.

11.10.1. Each of BAC, NYN and USW (the "BOC Participants") and
their respective BOC affiliates in Cellco and WMC agree that they will pursue,
in conjunction with the Regional Bell Operating Companies ("BOCs") within the
meaning of the MFJ, the "Motion of the Bell Companies for a Modification of
Section II of the Decree to Permit Them to Provide Cellular and Other Wireless
Services Across LATA Boundaries," filed with the Decree Court on June 20, 1994.
If the Decree Court were to deny the BOCs' motion or if the Decree Court or
Department of Justice were to take the position that the relief requested in
the motion does not apply to PCS Service, the BOC Participants will request a
waiver for the benefit of the Partnership that would enable the Partnership to
conduct the Partnership Business free of restrictions on BOCs in the MFJ. In
addition, the BOC Participants will request a waiver for the benefit of the
Partnership if the waiver is: (a) to permit the Partnership to offer the same
services as those set forth in any waiver request which such BOC Participant or
an affiliate has pending or which such BOC Participant ,any of its affiliates,
or any BOC has obtained for its cellular or PCS

- 56 -
<PAGE> 58
businesses, including businesses incidental thereto; (b) based on the same
relevant facts as those set forth in any such waiver such BOC Participant, an
affiliate thereof or a BOC has pending or has obtained, as the case may be, and
(c) with respect to the Partnership, within the scope of the Partnership
Business. Except as described above, neither any such BOC Participant nor any
affiliate shall be obliged to request any waiver for the benefit of the
Partnership.

11.10.2. Unless and until the (1) Decree Court or (2) the Department
of Justice shall issue a written opinion, or (3) USW, BAC and NYN shall
unanimously agree that the MFJ does not apply to the Partnership, the
Partnership will conform to the requirements and prohibitions of the MFJ. As
long as a BOC Participant holds any ownership interest in the Partnership, the
Partnership will not engage in any MFJ Restricted Activities. ATI or any
Affiliate thereof will have the option to engage in MFJ Restricted Activities,
specifically including the provision of interexchange (interLATA)
telecommunications services (it being understood that such services may be
provided by the Partnership if it is thereafter permitted to do so) and engage
in any business practice and enter into any transaction in which the
Partnership does not engage by reason of the MFJ. ATI shall not be deemed to
be engaged in or possessing any interest in a business venture in violation of
Article 3 hereof or Section 7.4 of the Tomcom Partnership Agreement solely as a
result of the nature of the business being an MFJ Restricted Activity. Except
as provided in the preceding sentence, the provisions of this Section 11.10
shall take precedence, in the event of any conflict, over any other provision
of this Agreement.

11.10.3. Unless and until the Decree Court, the Department of
Justice, or USW's CECO Decree Committee shall issue a written opinion that the
CECO does not apply to the Partnership, the Partnership will conform to the
requirements and prohibitions of the CECO. Unless and until the Decree Court,
the Department of Justice, or USW's MFJ Compliance Committee shall issue a
written opinion that the EO does not apply to the Partnership, the Partnership
will conform to the requirements and prohibitions of the EO. In conforming to
the requirements and prohibitions of the CECO and EO, the Partnership will
utilize the procedures established by USW for compliance with them. At the
request of the Partnership, USW will provide training, instruction and
assistance to the Partnership in matters associated with CECO and EO
compliance.

11.10.4. If, at any time, a third party raises legitimate concerns
regarding whether as a result of the transactions arising out of this Agreement
and the Tomcom Partnership Agreement ATI or Systems in which it has an
ownership interest can lawfully engage in MFJ Restricted Activities, or if a
third

- 57 -
<PAGE> 59
party or USW's CECO Decree Committee raises legitimate concerns regarding
whether, in light of the activities of the Partnership and ATI, the BOC
Participants are in compliance with the MFJ (collectively, "MFJ Concerns"), the
parties agree:

(a) except in the circumstances set forth in (iii) below, that ATI
and/or the Partnership shall have the right to continue the
activities giving rise to the MFJ Concerns;

(b) to restructure the relationships among them and their respective
properties to the minimum extent necessary to satisfy the MFJ
Concerns while preserving, to the fullest extent possible, the
intent of the parties regarding the Partnership. The obligation
to restructure shall arise when (A) counsel for any Partner
Parent believes that an MFJ Concern is well founded, (B) USW's
CECO Decree Committee or similar committee representing another
BOC Participant determines that an activity of the Partnership or
ATI has or will put USW or such BOC Participant in violation of
the MFJ, or (C) ATI determines that in light of the activities of
the Partnership that the right of ATI or Systems in which it has
an ownership interest to lawfully engage in MFJ Restricted
Activities is subject to a well founded challenge under the MFJ
and (in any such case) outside counsel for any Partner Parent
issues a written opinion that the MFJ Concern cannot be cured
without restructuring. In the event the obligation to
restructure arises pursuant to the preceding sentence, the
Partners shall attempt to determine the manner of restructuring
which best gives effect to the first sentence of this clause
(ii). If the Partners reach agreement on a proposal, they will
present it to the Partner Parents and then, if the Partner
Parents approve that proposal, to the Partnership Committee. If
the Partner Parents are unable to agree on a restructuring
proposal, each of them will present its proposal to USW's CECO
Decree Committee; the Partner Parents will then present to the
Partnership Committee any of the proposals the CECO Decree
Committee has approved. The Partners will implement a
restructuring proposal only upon the unanimous vote of the
Partnership Committee. If the Partnership Committee does not
unanimously approve any restructuring proposal, the Partner
Parents shall resolve the manner of restructuring by the
procedure described in paragraph 2.6(d)(i) of the Tomcom
Agreement (provided that the 40-day period set forth therein for
referral of disputes to the Independent Member shall be a 30-day
period); and

- 58 -

<PAGE> 60
(c) If despite their best efforts, the Partners fail to reach
agreement on and implement a restructuring proposal pursuant to
(ii) above, and if a Partner Parent has received either:

(i) an opinion from the Decree Court that activities giving
rise to the MFJ Concerns have put a Partner Parent in
violation of the MFJ; or

(ii) a written statement from the Department of Justice that
such activities have put a BOC Partner Parent in
violation of the MFJ, and either counsel for any one of
the BOC Participants agrees, or USW's CECO Decree
Committee or any committee established by another BOC
Participant for purposes of reviewing MFJ issues has
determined, that there is a reasonable factual and legal
basis for such an opinion from the Department of Justice;

then, ATI, its Cellular and PCS Systems and/or the Partnership will stop the
activities giving rise to the MFJ Concerns until such time as implementation of
a restructuring proposal pursuant to (ii) above permits the resumption of such
activities.

11.10.5. Subject to compliance with the MFJ by the Partnership in
connection therewith, and subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 7.4
of the Tomcom Partnership Agreement, ATI or any Affiliate thereof will have the
option to engage in MFJ Restricted Activities, specifically including the
provision of interexchange (interLATA) telecommunications services and engage
in any business practice and enter into any transaction in which the
Partnership does not engage by reason of the MFJ. Except as provided in the
preceding sentence, the provisions of this Section 11.10 shall take precedence,
in the event of any conflict, over any other provision of this Agreement.

11.11. Availability of Documents. The Partners and their Affiliates will
make available to the Partnership true and complete copies of any and all
documents necessary for the Partnership to fulfill its responsibilities under
this Agreement or applicable law.

11.12. Notices. Any notice or notification required, permitted or
contemplated hereunder shall be in writing, shall be addressed to the party to
be notified at the address set forth below, or at such other address as each
party may designate for itself from time to time by notice hereunder, and,

<PAGE> 4
(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.1 to the
contrary, in the event that (i) ATI and any Person or "group" (within the
meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) enter into an agreement

Directors of ATI has not approved or recommended, the Board of Directors of ATI
has terminated or amended (or agreed to terminate or amend) the Rights
Agreement or has redeemed (or agreed to redeem) the Rights issued thereunder,
and such action has permitted or will have permitted the consummation of such
Acquisition Proposal or offer, or a final, non-appealable court order has
declared the Rights Agreement invalid or otherwise required the redemption of
the Rights issued thereunder or (iv) ATI and any Person enter into an agreement
providing for a transaction or series of related transactions that results in
the transfer, sale or other disposition by ATI of assets (A) that represent

of its total operating revenues on a proportionate basis in the preceding
fiscal year and (C) that generated more than 80% of its total net income from
operations on a proportionate basis during the preceding fiscal year (excepting
any such transaction or series of related transactions in which a majority of
the value of the consideration received in exchange for the assets transferred,

like kind or nature), this Section 2.1 shall not prohibit Tomcom Parent Partner
(unless acting in concert with such Person) from making either a competing
Acquisition Proposal or a tender or exchange offer pursuant to which Tomcom
Parent Partner or its Affiliates would acquire at least the same percentage
(calculated by voting power) of ATI's then outstanding Voting Securities as
would be acquired in such non-Tomcom Parent Partner Acquisition Proposal or
such non-Tomcom Parent Partner tender or exchange offer (a "Tomcom Parent
Partner Response"). Tomcom Parent Partner agrees that any Tomcom Parent
Partner Response (including amendments thereto) will provide for consideration
that is no less favorable to ATI's shareholders than that being offered
pursuant to such non-Tomcom Parent Partner Acquisition Proposal or such non-
Tomcom Parent Partner tender or exchange offer (taking into account the form of
consideration and the number of shares to be acquired pursuant to such Tomcom
Parent Partner Response). In the event that the transactions contemplated by
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) shall have been terminated or abandoned after
the Tomcom Parent Partner Response, Tomcom Parent Partner shall have the
ability, subject to the requirements of the preceding sentence, to amend or
modify its response, and to consummate the transaction contemplated by the
Tomcom Parent Partner Response or such amendment or modification, so long as
Tomcom Parent Partner shall not have terminated or abandoned their initial
response other than as a result of such amendment or modification. In the
event that the transactions contemplated by clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)
shall have been terminated or abandoned prior to the Tomcom Parent Partner
Response, or, if not so terminated or abandoned, in the event thereafter that
such transactions and those contemplated by such Tomcom Parent Partner Response
shall have been terminated or abandoned, all of the restrictions contained in
this Section 2.1 shall again be applicable.

(c) Until the second anniversary of the earlier of (x) the
dissolution of Tomcom and (y) the cessation of any direct or indirect
beneficial interest in each (but not just in one) of Tomcom or PCS Primeco by
Tomcom Parent Partner, neither Tomcom Parent Partner nor its Affiliates may (i)
act in concert with any Strategic Partner with respect to any of the activities
set forth in this Section 2.1 or (ii) transfer any Voting Securities of ATI to
any Strategic Partner.

4.7. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon

representatives. The parties hereto may amend this Agreement without notice to

bound by the terms of this Agreement (with all references to Tomcom Parent

assign this Agreement; provided, however, that ATI may assign its rights and
delegate its obligations under this Agreement to any corporation which becomes

4.11. Arbitration. The parties agree to submit their disputes to
arbitration.

4.12. Possible Reincorporation of ATI. ATI is considering
reincorporating in the State of Delaware. Such reincorporation may be effected
by a merger in which ATI would become a wholly owned subsidiary of a Delaware
corporation ("ATI Delaware") and the shareholders of ATI would become

beneficial interest in each (but not just in one) of Tomcom or PCS Primeco by
Tomcom Parent Partner, neither Tomcom Parent Partner nor its Affiliates may (i)
act in concert with any Strategic Partner with respect to any of the activities

BELL ATLANTIC, NYNEX, AIRTOUCH AND U S WEST FORM
STRATEGIC NATIONAL WIRELESS PARTNERSHIP

Venture to Speed New Level of Wireless Services to American Consumers

NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 1994 - Bell Atlantic, NYNEX, AirTouch and U S WEST
today announced that they have signed a definitive agreement to form a premier
wireless partnership to provide nationally branded, innovative and easy-to-use
wireless communications services.

The venture has two elements. The first is a partnership formed to
bid for licenses in the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) upcoming PCS
(personal communications services) auction and to roll out PCS services
rapidly. A second partnership will develop a national branding and marketing
strategy and a common "look and feel" for services for both cellular and PCS
customers.

The venture will provide the seamless service and standardized
features customers want in their hometowns and as they travel around the
country. In addition, the companies will be open to affiliations with other
wireless providers throughout the U.S., making it easier for those providers to
offer their customers the standardized services developed by the partnership.

The new partnership will be a major player in the rapidly evolving
wireless industry. Together, the four companies own cellular licenses in 15 of
the top 20 cities, covering more than 100 million people. The four companies
serve nearly four million cellular customers across the country.

"Our strategy from the beginning has been to make it simple for
customers to decide how, when and where to communicate," said William C.
Ferguson, chairman and CEO of NYNEX. "The structure of this new competitive
business enables us to move quickly to provide customers with innovative
wireless services and to adapt rapidly as regulation changes to allow NYNEX,
Bell Atlantic and U S WEST to offer other new services."

"This partnership will enable us to bring the benefits of wireless
communications to customers throughout the U.S. faster and more efficiently,"
said Sam Ginn, chairman and CEO of AirTouch Communications. "The partners'
existing cellular companies already have developed a strong set of skills.
Through the new PCS partnership, we can build upon this impressive experience
and create a truly nationwide capability."

"We all believe that the information industry of the future will be
driven by companies with a national and global presence that can speed services
to customers anytime, anywhere," said Raymond W. Smith, chairman and CEO of
Bell Atlantic. "We will create the highest quality seamless service available
and bring a new level of competition to the wireless market."

"All of us share a similar vision of the 'wireless future.' Our
companies have strong track records in product innovation, customer focus and
wireless technology. That adds up to a very effective vehicle to give customers
across the country new and expanded customer-friendly wireless features and
services. It also reflects our philosophy of joining with strategic partners
where it makes sense and best meets customer needs," said Richard D. McCormick,
chairman and chief executive officer, U S WEST, Inc.

Under the partnership, the PCS entity intends to bid vigorously for
radio spectrum in upcoming FCC PCS auctions. These PCS licenses will
complement the existing cellular franchises of Bell Atlantic, NYNEX, AirTouch,
and U S WEST to build a national "footprint." This entity will be governed by
a board made up of three members from the Bell Atlantic/NYNEX partnership and
three from the AirTouch/U S WEST joint venture.

The second element of the partnership will provide services for the
existing cellular businesses of the four partners and for the newly acquired
PCS properties owned by the partnership. This organization will develop
technical and service standards for its wireless properties, adopt a national
brand and marketing strategy, develop information technology and create a
national distribution strategy. In addition, it will make these standards
available to other PCS providers across the country.

This entity will be governed by a board made up of three members from
the Bell Atlantic/NYNEX partnership, three from the AirTouch/U S WEST joint
venture and one independent board member.

The cellular properties of Bell Atlantic/NYNEX will not be merged with
AirTouch/U S West. These properties will be managed and owned as separate
entities. AirTouch will continue to have the freedom to provide interLATA
wireless services, free of the constraints of the Consent Decree that broke up
the Bell system. Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and U S WEST remain subject to these
constraints and cannot offer wireless interLATA services.

In June, Bell Atlantic and NYNEX announced that they would merge their
cellular wireless businesses, covering 55 million potential customers
along the East Coast and in the Southwest. This territory includes New
York City, which has the single largest concentration of wireless customers 
in the country.

In July, AirTouch and U S WEST announced that they would coordinate
their domestic cellular assets to achieve economies of scale and create a
regional footprint. They intend to merge their businesses in the next several
years. This cellular partnership will be 70 percent owned by AirTouch and 30
percent owned by U S WEST. Their PCS partnership will be equally owned by
AirTouch and U S WEST. Their cellular properties cover more than 53 million
potential customers in the western half of the U.S. The joint venture also
includes the Atlanta area and several Midwest markets in Michigan and Ohio.
