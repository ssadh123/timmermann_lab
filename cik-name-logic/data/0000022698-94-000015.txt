Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On June 3, 1994, the Corporation consummated the previously
announced merger (the "Merger") of Radiation Systems, Inc.
("RSi") into CTS America, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Corporation, and the surviving corporation changed its name to
COMSAT RSI, Inc. ("COMSAT RSI"). The terms of the Merger and the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 30, 1994 (the
"Merger Agreement"), between the Corporation, CTS America, Inc.
and RSi are described more fully in the Corporation's
Registration Statement on Form S-4, Registration No. 33-53437 (as
amended and supplemented, the "Registration Statement"), with
respect to the shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, without
par value ("COMSAT Common Stock"), which were issued in the
Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Registration
Statement, including specifically the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
contained therein, is incorporated herein by reference.

The Merger was approved by RSi stockholders at a special
meeting on June 3, 1994. In the Merger, RSi stockholders will
receive .780 shares of COMSAT Common Stock (the "Conversion
Fraction") for each share of RSi Common Stock, par value $1.00
per share (the "RSi Common Stock"), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective date of the Merger, other than
shares held by RSi, the Corporation or a subsidiary of RSi or of
the Corporation. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the
Conversion Fraction was determined by dividing $18.25 by the
average closing price of COMSAT Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Tape during the 20 trading days ending
five trading days prior to the closing date of the Merger;
provided, that the Conversion Fraction could not be less than
.638 and could not be more than .780, and that cash shall be paid
in lieu of fractional shares.

For immediate release

COMSAT, RADIATION SYSTEMS, INC. CLOSE ON MERGER
-- New Business Unit to be Called COMSAT RSI --

BETHESDA, Md. -- COMSAT Corporation (NYSE:CQ) today announced
the closing of the acquisition of Radiation Systems, Inc.
(NASDAQ:RADS) following approval of the COMSAT-RSi merger
agreement by RSi stockholders at a special meeting in Sterling,
Va.

The merger combines RSi, the Sterling, Va.-based designer,
manufacturer and integrator of satellite earth stations, advanced
antennas and other turnkey systems for telecommunications, radar,
air traffic control and military uses, with COMSAT's existing
systems integration business, COMSAT Technology Services (CTS). 
The new business unit is called COMSAT RSI. The merger will be
treated as a pooling of interest for accounting purposes.

"We're very pleased that RSi stockholders have approved this
merger and we welcome them as new COMSAT shareholders," said
Bruce L. Crockett, president and CEO of COMSAT. "This merger
allows us to take advantage of the core competencies of both
companies and makes COMSAT an even stronger player in the
development of sophisticated wireless communications services for
our customers."

Richard E. Thomas, former president and CEO of RSi and the new
president of COMSAT RSI, said the new business unit plans to
"aggressively pursue emerging opportunities around the world by
combining RSi's business experience, manufacturing skills and
antenna know-how with COMSAT's reputation and expertise in the
international telecommunications marketplace."
