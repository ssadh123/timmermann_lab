Whereas, the Company by a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (hereinafter sometimes

plement thereto or modification thereof, and the "Mortgage" when referred to
as now or heretofore supplemented and modified) dated as of May 1, 1940, made

the Trustee thereunder upon certain trusts, terms and conditions, and with and
subject to certain provisos and covenants therein contained, all and singular
the property, rights and franchises which the Company then owned or should
thereafter acquire, excepting the property expressly excepted by the terms of
the Original Mortgage or any indenture supplemental thereto, to which Mortgage

Whereas, the Original Mortgage has been supplemented and modified by supple-
mental indentures dated as of May 1, 1942, as of February 1, 1948, as of April

thereto authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, and
that the form of each series, as established by the Board of Directors, shall
specify the descriptive title of the bonds and various other terms thereof,
and may also contain other provisions as the Board of Directors may, in its
discretion, cause to be inserted therein expressing or referring to the terms
and conditions upon which such bonds are to be issued and secured under the
Original Mortgage or any indenture supplemental thereto or in modification
thereof; and

Whereas, the Company now desires to provide for the establishment, execu-
tion, authentication and delivery under the Mortgage of bonds of a series to
be known as its "First Mortgage Bonds, 6.05% Series, due 2004" (the bonds of
said series being hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "2004 Bonds"), lim-
ited to the aggregate principal amount of Eighty Million Dollars
($80,000,000); and

Whereas, all things necessary to make the 2004 Bonds hereinafter described,
when duly executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee, valid, binding and legal obligations of the Company, and to make this
Thirty-Ninth Supplemental Indenture a valid and binding agreement supplemental
to the Original Mortgage, have been done and performed; and

Whereas, the execution and delivery by the Company of this Thirty-Ninth Sup-
plemental Indenture, and the terms of the 2004 Bonds, have been duly autho-
rized by the Board of Directors of the Company by appropriate resolutions of
said Board; and

Whereas, it is provided in and by the Original Mortgage that the Company
will execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as
may be necessary or proper to carry out more effectually the purposes of the
Mortgage, and to make subject to the lien thereof any property thereafter ac-
quired and intended to be subject to the lien thereof; and

Whereas, the Company has, since the date of execution and delivery of the
Original Mortgage, purchased and acquired property and desires by this Thirty-
Ninth Supplemental Indenture specifically to convey to the Trustee

tion, transfer and exchange of such bonds as hereinafter provided; all refer-
ence herein to the office or agency of the Company for the payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 2004 Bonds, or the regis-
tration, transfer or exchange thereof, being to American National Bank and
Trust Company of Chicago. In the event of the resignation or inability to act
of American National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, then a successor agent
for all such purposes in the City of Chicago, Illinois, shall be appointed by
the Board of Directors of the Company.

The 2004 Bonds shall be dated as of the date of authentication thereof, ex-
cept as otherwise provided in Section 10 of the Original Mortgage.

The 2004 Bonds shall initially be issued and held in book-entry form on the
books of the central depository system, The Depository Trust Company, its suc-
cessors, or any successor central depository system appointed by the Company
from time to time (the "Clearing Agency"). The Company and the Trustee may, in
connection herewith, do or perform or cause to be done or performed any acts
or things not adverse to the rights of the holders of the 2004 Bonds, as are
necessary or appropriate to accomplish or recognize such book-entry form 2004
Bonds.

So long as the 2004 Bonds remain and are held in book-entry form on the
books of a Clearing Agency, then (a) any such 2004 Bond may be registered

upon the books kept by the Trustee in the name of such Clearing Agency, or any
nominee thereof, including Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Com-
pany; (b) the Clearing Agency in whose names such 2004 Bond is so registered
shall be, and the Company and the Trustee may deem and treat such Clearing
Agency as, the absolute owner and holder of such 2004 Bond for all purposes of
the Indenture, including, without limitation, the receiving of payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such 2004 Bond, the receiving
of notice and giving of consent; (c) neither the Company nor the Trustee shall
have any responsibility or obligation hereunder to any direct or indirect par-
ticipant, within the meaning of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, of such Clearing Agency, or any person on behalf of which,
or otherwise in respect of which, any such participant holds any interest in
any 2004 Bond, including, without limitation, any responsibility or obligation
hereunder to maintain accurate records of any beneficial interests in any 2004
Bond or any responsibility or obligation hereunder with respect to the receiv-
ing by such participants or the beneficial owners of payment of principal,
premium, if any, or interest on any 2004 Bonds, the receiving by such partici-
pants or the beneficial owners of notice or the giving of consent by such par-
ticipants or the beneficial owners; and (d) the Clearing Agency is not re-
quired to present any 2004 Bond called for partial redemption prior to receiv-
ing payment so long as the Trustee and the Clearing Agency have agreed to the
method for noting such partial redemption.

If (a) the Company receives notice from the Clearing Agency which is cur-
rently the registered owner of the 2004 Bonds to the effect that such Clearing
Agency is unable or unwilling to discharge its responsibility as a Clearing
Agency for the 2004 Bonds or (b) the Company elects to discontinue its use of
such Clearing Agency as a Clearing Agency for the 2004 Bonds, then the Company
and Trustee each shall do or perform or cause to be done or performed all acts
or things, not adverse to the rights of the holders of the 2004 Bonds, as are
necessary or appropriate to discontinue use of such Clearing Agency as a
Clearing Agency for the 2004 Bonds and to transfer the ownership of each of
the 2004 Bonds to such person or persons, including any other Clearing Agency,
as the holder of the 2004 Bonds may direct in accordance with the Indenture.
Any expenses of such discontinuance and transfer, includ-

8
<PAGE>

ing expenses of printing new certificates to evidence the 2024 Bonds, shall be
paid by the Company.

So long as the 2004 Bonds remain and are held in book-entry form on the
books of a Clearing Agency, the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely
upon a certificate or other written representation from the Clearing Agency or
any participant or indirect participant with respect to the identity of any
beneficial owners of the 2004 Bonds as of a record date selected by the Trust-
ee. For purposes of determining whether the consent, advice, direction or de-
mand of a Bondholder has been obtained, the Trustee shall be entitled to treat
the beneficial owners of the 2004 Bonds as the Bondholders and any consent,
request, direction, approval, objection or other instrument of such beneficial
owner may be obtained in the same fashion described in the Indenture.

The 2004 Bonds shall not be subject to redemption by the Company prior to
the maturity thereof except out of monies deposited with the Trustee repre-
senting the proceeds of mortgaged and pledged property taken by the exercise
of the power of eminent domain or otherwise as provided in paragraph B of Sec-
tion 69 of the Mortgage, in which event the redemption price of the 2004 Bonds
so to be redeemed shall be the principal amount of such bonds plus accrued in-
terest thereon to the date of redemption.

At the option of the holder, any 2004 Bond, upon surrender thereof at said
office or agency of the Company together with a written instrument of transfer
in form approved by the Company duly executed by the holder or by his duly au-
thorized attorney, shall be exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount
of fully registered bonds of the same series of other authorized denomina-
tions.

The 2004 Bonds shall be transferable on the books of the Company at said of-
fice or agency of the Company in the City of Chicago, Illinois, by the regis-
tered holder thereof, in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon sur-
render thereof for cancellation.

The Company shall not be required to make transfers or exchanges of any of
the 2004 Bonds for a period of ten (10) days next preceding any interest pay-
ment date of said bonds.

Million Dollars ($80,000,000) and shall be issued under the provisions of Ar-

amount to Eighty Million Dollars ($80,000,000) and established by a Thirty-
Ninth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 1, 1994, all bonds of all
series issued and to be issued under and equally secured (except insofar as
any sinking or other fund, established in accordance with the provisions of
the Mortgage hereinafter mentioned, may afford additional security for the
bonds of any particular series) by a Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of
May 1, 1940, executed by the Company to American National Bank and Trust Com-
pany of Chicago, as Trustee (which Mortgage and Deed of Trust as supplemented
and modified by all supplemental indentures thereto is hereinafter referred to

With the consent of the Company and to the extent permitted by and as pro-
vided in the Mortgage, the rights and obligations of the Company and/or of the
holders of the bonds and/or coupons and/or the terms and provisions of the
Mortgage and/or any instruments supplemental thereto may be modified or altered
by affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds per
centum (66 2/3%) in principal amount of the bonds affected by such modification
or alteration then outstanding under the Mortgage (excluding bonds disqualified
from voting by reason of the Company's interest therein as provided in the
Mortgage); provided that no such modification or alteration shall permit the
extension of the maturity of the principal of this bond or the reduction in the
rate of interest hereon or any other modification in the terms
of payment of such principal or interest without the consent of the holder
hereof. The principal hereof may be declared or may become due and payable
prior to the stated date of maturity hereof, on the conditions, in the manner
and at the time set forth in the Mortgage, upon the occurrence of a completed
default as in the Mortgage provided.

The 2004 Bonds are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in
the denomination of one thousand dollars and any larger denomination which is a
multiple of one thousand dollars. In the manner and upon payment of the charges
hereinafter mentioned, the 2004 Bonds, upon surrender thereof at the office or
agency of the Company in the City of Chicago, Illinois, together with a written
instrument of transfer in form approved by the Company duly executed by the
registered holder or by his duly authorized attorney, are exchangeable for a
like aggregate principal amount of fully registered bonds of the same series of
other authorized denominations.

This bond is transferable as prescribed in the Mortgage by the registered
owner hereof in person, or by his duly authorized attorney, at the office or
agency of the Company in the City of Chicago, Illinois, upon surrender and can-
cellation of this bond and upon presentation of a written instrument of trans-
fer, duly executed and upon payment of the charges hereinafter mentioned, and,
thereupon, a new fully registered bond of the same series for a like principal
amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor as provided in the
Mortgage. The Company and the Trustee may deem and treat

13
<PAGE>

the person in whose name this bond is registered as the absolute owner hereof
for the purpose of receiving payment and for all other purposes.

No charge shall be made upon any transfer or exchange of any of the 2004
Bonds other than for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to
be paid by the Company.

The Company shall not be required to make transfers or exchanges of any of
the 2004 Bonds for a period of ten (10) days next preceding any interest pay-
ment date of said bonds.

turity thereof except out of monies deposited with the Trustee representing
the proceeds of mortgaged and pledged property taken by the exercise of the
power of eminent domain or otherwise as provided in paragraph B of Section 69
of the Mortgage, in which event the redemption price of the 2004 Bonds so to
be redeemed shall be the principal amount of such bonds plus accrued interest
thereon to the date of redemption.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on
this bond against any incorporator or any past, present or future subscriber
to the capital stock, stockholder, officer or director of the Company or of
any predecessor or successor corporation, as such, either directly or through
the Company or any predecessor or successor corporation, under any rule of
law, statute or constitution or by the enforcement of any assessment or other-
wise, all such liability of incorporators, subscribers, stockholders, officers
and directors, as such, being waived and released by the terms of the Mort-
gage.

the Company may execute, and upon its request in writing the Trustee shall au-
thenticate and deliver, in lieu thereof, fully registered 2004 Bonds in tempo-
rary form, as provided in Section 15 of the Original Mortgage. Such bonds may,
in lieu of the statement of the specific redemption prices required to be set
forth in such bonds in definitive form, include a reference to this Thirty-
Ninth Supplemental Indenture for a statement of such redemption prices.

Section 5. The covenant of the Company to make annual payments
to the Trustee for a Maintenance and Improvement Fund as contained in Section
41 of the Original Mortgage and in the first twenty-four Supplemental Inden-
tures to the Original Mortgage creating the several series of First Mortgage
Bonds presently outstanding under such Supplemental Indentures shall not apply
to, or be for the benefit of, the 2004 Bonds, and the Company reserves the
right, without any consent of, or other action by, the holders of the 2004
Bonds, to amend, modify or delete the provisions of the Mortgage relating to
such Maintenance and Improvement Fund, and by acceptance of the 2004 Bonds, the
holders thereof waive any right or privilege so to consent or take any other

remain outstanding, it will comply with all of the provisions of Section 47 of
the Original Mortgage, including the provisions with respect to limitations on
dividends and distributions and the purchase and redemption of stock.

and created and agrees to perform the same upon the terms and conditions herein
and in the Mortgage set forth and upon the following terms and conditions:

ments of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the cor-

implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon, or to give to, any
person, co-partnership or corporation, other than the parties hereto and the
holders of the bonds and coupons outstanding under the Mortgage, any right,
remedy, or claim under or by reason of this Thirty-Ninth Supplemental Indenture
or any covenant, condition or stipulation hereof; and all the covenants, condi-
tions, stipulations, promises and agreements in this Thirty-Ninth Supplemental
Indenture contained by or on behalf of the Company shall be for the sole and

THIS FORTIETH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, dated as of February 1, 1994, between
Indianapolis Power & Light Company, a corporation of the State of Indiana,
hereinafter sometimes called the "Company," party of the first part, and Ameri-
can National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, a national banking association,
as Trustee, hereinafter sometimes called the "Trustee," party of the second
part;
Whereas, the Company by a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (hereinafter sometimes
called the "Original Mortgage" when referred to as existing prior to any sup-
plement thereto or modification thereof, and the "Mortgage" when referred to as
now or heretofore supplemented and modified) dated as of May 1, 1940, made to
said American National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, as Trustee, to secure
the payment of the bonds issued from time to time under the Mortgage for the
purposes of and subject to the limitations specified in the Mortgage, and to
secure the performance of the covenants therein contained, conveyed to the
Trustee thereunder upon certain trusts, terms and conditions, and with and sub-
ject to certain provisos and covenants therein contained, all and singular the
property, rights and franchises which the Company then owned or should thereaf-
ter acquire, excepting the property expressly excepted by the terms of the
Original Mortgage or any indenture supplemental thereto, to which Mortgage ref-
erence is hereby made for greater certainty; and

Whereas, the Original Mortgage has been supplemented and modified by supple-
mental indentures dated as of May 1, 1942, as of February 1, 1948, as of April
1, 1949, two as of October 1, 1949, as of February 1, 1951, as of March 1,
1953, as of June 1, 1956, as of March 1, 1958, as of October 1, 1960, as of Au-
gust 1, 1964, as of April 1, 1966, as of May 1, 1967, as of May 1, 1968, as of
October 1, 1970, as of March 1, 1972, as of March 15, 1973, as of February 15,
1974, as of August 15, 1974, as of September 15, 1975, as of June 1, 1976, as
of July 1, 1976, as of August 1, 1977, as of September 1, 1978, two as of Au-
gust 1, 1981, as of November 1, 1983, as of November 1, 1984, as of December 1,
1984, as of September 1, 1985, as of October 1, 1986, as of June 1, 1989, as of
August 1, 1989, as of October 15, 1991, as of August 1, 1992, as of April 1,
1993, two as of October 1, 1993 and as of February 1, 1994.
Whereas, Section 8 of the Original Mortgage provides, among other things,
that the form of each series of bonds (other than the initial issue of

1
<PAGE>

bonds) issued thereunder shall be established by an indenture supplemental
thereto authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, and
that the form of each series, as established by the Board of Directors, shall
specify the descriptive title of the bonds and various other terms thereof,
and may also contain other provisions as the Board of Directors may, in its
discretion, cause to be inserted therein expressing or referring to the terms
and conditions upon which such bonds are to be issued and secured under the
Original Mortgage or any indenture supplemental thereto or in modification
thereof; and

Whereas, the Company now desires to provide for the establishment, execu-
tion, authentication and delivery under the Mortgage of bonds of a series to
be known as its "First Mortgage Bonds, 7.05% Series, due 2024" (the bonds of
said series being hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "2024 Bonds"), lim-
ited to the aggregate principal amount of One Hundred Million Dollars
($100,000,000); and

Whereas, all things necessary to make the 2024 Bonds hereinafter described,
when duly executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee, valid, binding and legal obligations of the Company, and to make this
Fortieth Supplemental Indenture a valid and binding agreement supplemental to
the Original Mortgage, have been done and performed; and

Whereas, the execution and delivery by the Company of this Fortieth Supple-
mental Indenture, and the terms of the 2024 Bonds, have been duly authorized
by the Board of Directors of the Company by appropriate resolutions of said
Board; and

Whereas, it is provided in and by the Original Mortgage that the Company
will execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as
may be necessary or proper to carry out more effectually the purposes of the
Mortgage, and to make subject to the lien thereof any property thereafter ac-
quired and intended to be subject to the lien thereof; and

Whereas, the Company has, since the date of execution and delivery of the
Original Mortgage, purchased and acquired property and desires by this Forti-
eth Supplemental Indenture specifically to convey to the Trustee

2
<PAGE>

such property for the better protection and security of the bonds issued and to
be issued under the Original Mortgage, or any indenture supplemental thereto;

Now, Therefore, This Indenture Witnesseth that, in consideration of the prem-

The person in whose name any such bond is registered at the close of business

fault may be established by or in behalf of the Company by notice mailed to the
holders of the 2024 Bonds not less than ten (10) days preceding such record
date, which record date shall not be more than thirty (30) days prior to the
subsequent interest payment date. The term "record date" as used in this Sec-
tion with respect to any regular interest payment date shall mean the tenth day

herein to the office or agency of the Company for the payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, and interest on the 2024 Bonds, or the registration,
transfer or exchange thereof, being to American National Bank and Trust Company
of Chicago. In the event of the resignation or inability to act of American Na-
tional Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, then a successor agent for all such
purposes in the City of Chicago, Illinois, shall be appointed by the Board of
Directors of the Company.

The 2024 Bonds shall be dated as of the date of authentication thereof, ex-
cept as otherwise provided in Section 10 of the Original Mortgage.

The 2024 Bonds shall initially be issued and held in book-entry form on the
books of the central depository system, The Depository Trust Company, its suc-
cessors, or any successor central depository system appointed by the Company
from time to time (the "Clearing Agency"). The Company and the Trustee may, in
connection herewith, do or perform or cause to be done or performed any acts or
things not adverse to the rights of the holders of the 2024 Bonds, as are nec-
essary or appropriate to accomplish or recognize such book-entry form 2024
Bonds.

<PAGE>

So long as the 2024 Bonds remain and are held in book-entry form on the books
of a Clearing Agency, then (a) any such 2024 Bond may be registered upon the
books kept by the Trustee in the name of such Clearing Agency, or any nominee
thereof, including Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company; (b)
the Clearing Agency in whose names such 2024 Bond is so registered shall be,
and the Company and the Trustee may deem and treat such Clearing Agency as, the
absolute owner and holder of such 2024 Bond for all purposes of the Indenture,
including, without limitation, the receiving of payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on such 2024 Bond, the receiving of notice and
giving of consent; (c) neither the Company nor the Trustee shall have any re-
sponsibility or obligation hereunder to any direct or indirect participant,
within the meaning of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, of such Clearing Agency, or any person on behalf of which, or other-
wise in respect of which, any such participant holds any interest in any 2024
Bond, including, without limitation, any responsibility or obligation hereunder
to maintain accurate records of any beneficial interests in any 2024 Bond or
any responsibility or obligation hereunder with respect to the receiving by
such participants or the beneficial owners of payment of principal, premium, if
any, or interest on any 2024 Bonds, the receiving by such participants or the
beneficial owners of notice or the giving of consent by such participants or
the beneficial owners; and (d) the Clearing Agency is not required to present
any 2024 Bond called for partial redemption prior to receiving payment so long
as the Trustee and the Clearing Agency have agreed to the method for noting
such partial redemption.

If (a) the Company receives notice from the Clearing Agency which is cur-
rently the registered owner of the 2024 Bonds to the effect that such Clearing
Agency is unable or unwilling to discharge its responsibility as a Clearing
Agency for the 2024 Bonds or (b) the Company elects to discontinue its use of
such Clearing Agency as a Clearing Agency for the 2024 Bonds, then the Company
and Trustee each shall do or perform or cause to be done or performed all acts
or things, not adverse to the rights of the holders of the 2024 Bonds, as are
necessary or appropriate to discontinue use of such Clearing Agency as a Clear-
ing Agency for the 2024 Bonds and to transfer the ownership of each of the 2024
Bonds to such person or persons, including any other

8

Clearing Agency, as the holder of the 2024 Bonds may direct in accordance with
the Indenture. Any expenses of such discontinuance and transfer, including ex-
penses of printing new certificates to evidence the 2024 Bonds, shall be paid
by the Company.

So long as the 2024 Bonds remain and are held in book-entry form on the
books of a Clearing Agency, the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely
upon a certificate or other written representation from the Clearing Agency or
any participant or indirect participant with respect to the identity of any
beneficial owners of the 2024 Bonds as of a record date selected by the Trust-
ee. For purposes of determining whether the consent, advice, direction or de-
mand of a Bondholder has been obtained, the Trustee shall be entitled to treat
the beneficial owners of the 2024 Bonds as the Bondholders and any consent,
request, direction, approval, objection or other instrument of such beneficial
owner may be obtained in the same fashion described in the Indenture.

Upon the notice and in the manner and with the effect provided in the Mort-
gage and in this Section 2, the 2024 Bonds shall be redeemable prior to the
maturity thereof, as a whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the
option of the Company, at the principal amount thereof and accrued interest to
the date of redemption, and at the redemption prices set forth under the head-
ing "Redemption Price" in the form of 2024 Bonds hereinafter recited, if re-
deemed otherwise than in the manner provided in the next paragraph, provided,
however, that none of the 2024 Bonds may be redeemed prior to February 1,
2004.

Upon the notice and in the manner and with the effect provided in the Mort-
gage and in this Section 2, the 2024 Bonds shall be redeemable by the Company
prior to the maturity thereof out of monies deposited with the Trustee repre-
senting the proceeds of mortgaged and pledged property taken by the exercise
of the power of eminent domain or otherwise as provided in paragraph B of Sec-
tion 69 of the Mortgage, at the principal amount of the 2024 Bonds as to be
redeemed and accrued interest to the date of redemption.

vided in Section 59 of the Mortgage.

office or agency of the Company together with a written instrument of transfer
in form approved by the Company duly executed by the holder or by his duly au-
thorized attorney, shall be exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount
of fully registered bonds of the same series of other authorized denominations.

The 2024 Bonds shall be transferable on the books of the Company at said of-
fice or agency of the Company in the City of Chicago, Illinois, by the regis-
tered holder thereof, in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon sur-
render thereof for cancellation.

date of said bonds.

dred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) and shall be issued under the provisions of

Due February 1, 2024

This bond is one of an issue of bonds of the Company, issuable in series,
and is one of a series known as its First Mortgage Bonds, 7.05% Series, due
2024 (herein sometimes called the "2024 Bonds") limited in aggregate principal
amount to One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) and established by a For-
tieth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 1, 1994, all bonds of all
series issued and to be issued under and equally secured (except insofar as
any sinking or other fund, established in accordance with the provisions of
the Mortgage hereinafter mentioned, may afford additional security for the
bonds of any particular series) by a Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of
May 1, 1940, executed by the Company to American National Bank and Trust Com-
pany of Chicago, as Trustee (which Mortgage and Deed of Trust as supplemented
and modified by all supplemental indentures thereto is hereinafter referred to
as the "Mortgage"), to which Mortgage reference is made for a description of
the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security, the
rights of the bearers or registered owners of the bonds in respect of such se-
curity, the duties and immunities of the Trustee and the terms and conditions
upon which the bonds are secured.

With the consent of the Company and to the extent permitted by and as pro-
vided in the Mortgage, the rights and obligations of the Company and/or of the
holders of the bonds and/or coupons and/or the terms and provisions of the
Mortgage and/or any instruments supplemental thereto may be modified or al-
tered by affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds
per centum (66 2/3%) in principal amount of the bonds affected by such modifi-
cation or alteration then outstanding under the Mortgage (excluding bonds dis-
qualified from voting by reason of the Company's interest therein as provided
in the Mortgage); provided that no such modification or alteration shall per-
mit the extension of the maturity of the principal of this bond or the reduc-
tion in the rate of interest hereon or any other modification in the terms

13
<PAGE>

of payment of such principal or interest without the consent of the holder
hereof. The principal hereof may be declared or may become due and payable
prior to the stated date of maturity hereof, on the conditions, in the manner
and at the time set forth in the Mortgage, upon the occurrence of a completed
default as in the Mortgage provided.

The 2024 Bonds are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in
the denomination of one thousand dollars and any larger denomination which is a
multiple of one thousand dollars. In the manner and upon payment of the charges
hereinafter mentioned, the 2024 Bonds, upon surrender thereof at the office or

instrument of transfer in form approved by the Company duly executed by the
registered holder or by his duly authorized attorney, are exchangeable for a
like aggregate principal amount of fully registered bonds of the same series of
other authorized denominations.

This bond is transferable as prescribed in the Mortgage by the registered
owner hereof in person, or by his duly authorized attorney, at the office or
agency of the Company in the City of Chicago, Illinois, upon surrender and can-
cellation of this bond and upon presentation of a written instrument of trans-
fer, duly executed and upon payment of the charges hereinafter mentioned, and,
thereupon, a new fully registered bond of the same series for a like principal
amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor as provided in the
Mortgage. The Company and the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose
name this bond is registered as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of
receiving payment and for all other purposes.

No charge shall be made upon any transfer or exchange of any of the 2024
Bonds other than for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to
be paid by the Company.

The Company shall not be required to make transfers or exchanges of any of
the 2024 Bonds for a period of ten (10) days next preceding any interest pay-
ment date of said bonds.

IPALCO ENTERPRISES, INC.
REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR 1993

Indianapolis, IN, January 25, 1994 -- IPALCO Enterprises, Inc.
(NYSE: IPL), today announced financial results for 1993.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 1993, was $75.4
million or $2.00 per share, compared to $88.3 million, or $2.35 per
share, during the comparable period in 1992. During the fourth
quarter of 1993, net income was $18.0 million, or 48 cents per
share, compared to $20.0 million, or 53 cents per share, in 1992.

The 1993 results reflect the third quarter, one-time,
nonrecurring charge for costs associated with the tender offer to
shareholders of PSI Resources, Inc. IPALCO expensed to Other
Income and Deductions the associated legal, financial and
administrative costs totaling $21.1 million after taxes, an impact
of 56 cents per share.

Financial results for 1993 of Indianapolis Power & Light
Company (IPL), IPALCO's principal subsidiary, reflect a substantial
improvement over the comparable period in 1992. Utility operating
income for 1993 was $142.4 million, compared to $134.2 million in
1992.

Utility operating revenues during 1993 were $664.3 million
versus $633.2 million during 1992. Retail kilowatthour sales
during 1993 increased 5.9 percent compared to 1992. The increase
in sales is primarily attributable to a return of more normal
weather this year as compared to 1992 and the continued strength of
the service territory's economy.

Cooling degree days were up 4 percent above normal during
1993, and heating degree days were .3 percent above normal. Sales
to industrial customers, which are less weather-sensitive,
increased 5.6 percent in 1993 compared to 1992.

Commenting on the results, John R. Hodowal, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of IPALCO, said, "We are pleased with the 1993
financial results of our principal subsidiary, Indianapolis Power
& Light Company. The strong sales growth in our non-weather-
sensitive industrial sector continues to demonstrate the underlying
strength of IPL's service territory.

"As one of the nation's lowest cost providers of energy to any
service territory and with our continued attention to cost control
and superior customer service, we believe that IPALCO will continue
to help fuel the growth of our Indiana economy," Hodowal added.

"We are also pleased that 1993 marked a year of progress for
our unregulated energy ventures. In Cleveland, Ohio, Cleveland
District Cooling Corporation began operation of a district air
conditioning system for downtown Cleveland. Indianapolis Campus
Energy (ICE) announced that it will design, build and operate a
campus energy facility for Eli Lilly and Company. And SHAPE,
another unregulated subsidiary of IPALCO's which stands for "Store
Heat and Produce Energy," began testing a heat storage device for
the trucking industry that will save energy and improve the
environment."

Hodowal concluded, " We are very excited about IPALCO's
future. We will continue to seek out the products and services
that our customers desire and reward our shareholders
appropriately."
