FOR RELEASE: February 10, 1994

MORRISON KNUDSEN CORPORATION ANNOUNCES FORMATION OF
INFRASTRUCTURE CORPORATION

BOISE -- William J. Agee, chairman and chief executive officer of
Morrison Knudsen Corporation, announced today the formation of a new
corporation within the company to focus on the emerging market for
design-build infrastructure and transportation projects in the public and
private sectors, both domestically and internationally. The new organization
will consolidate MK's capabilities in project finance and development, civil
construction and transportation design-engineering and program management.

"By providing greater focus for the proven capabilities and expertise of
the company in this fast expanding market, MK will enhance its position as one
of the country's preeminent developers of infrastructure and transportation
projects," Agee commented.

The new corporation will be headed by senior MK executives who bring
together the company's extensive experience in the identification, financial
packaging, design, construction and operation of large infrastructure
projects. "The formation of this corporation and the assignment of four of
the company's key executives to it, underscores MK's dedication to this
emerging market and its commitment to be a leader in the infrastructure and
transportation markets worldwide," Agee added.

"The recent award of the $650-million contract for the design,
construction and operation of the Prince Edward Island Bridge in Canada
highlighted the necessity to form this corporation and coordinate all of MK's
activities in this market in one organization," Agee said. He added that,
"The corporation also will be responsible for the completion of the
$300-million design-build-and-operate toll-road project for the E-470
Authority in Denver, Colorado, and for the $300-million design-and-construct
contract for the electrification of the Amtrak's Northeast Corridor."

FOR RELEASE: FEBRUARY 18, 1994

MK'S MINING GROUP HEADQUARTERS TO MOVE
TO SAN ANTONIO

Boise -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation announced today that it will
relocate its Boise-based Mining Group headquarters to San Antonio, Texas in
the summer of 1994.

The company said the move will combine the engineering, administrative
and management skills provided through its Boise office with the earth science
and environmental expertise of its current San Antonio office. The planned
consolidation will place 88 percent of the Mining Group's domestic personnel
in one central location. The group currently has more than 100 salaried
employees in Texas at three locations. Nearly 40 are based in San Antonio as
part of MK Mining's Gulf Coast Engineering office.

"As management, marketing, engineering and administrative staffs move
closer to field operations, direct communication will be enhanced and the
operational mines will be better served," said Robert A. Tinstman, President
of MK's Mining Group. "We look forward to the move which will further
strengthen our competitiveness in a changing marketplace," he added.

More than 65 percent of the group's salaried domestic employees
currently work in Texas and two-thirds of the group's 10 million tons of
domestic coal production originates in that state.

The move will affect approximately 40 of MK's 1,700 Boise employees. In
the past two years, MK's Boise employment has risen from 1,266 to 1,671. Last
year, more than 700 of MK's 12,000 employees world-wide relocated as new
markets opened and new projects began.

In addition to its Gulf Coast office in San Antonio, MK's Atascosa
Mining Company operates mines near Jourdanton, Texas and employs 27
professionals, engineers and support personnel. The Navasota Mining Company
operates mines outside of Bryan, Texas and employs 46. In addition to its
professional staff, the group employees approximately 300 hourly personnel at
the two mine operations. Last year, the two mines accounted for 6.7 million
tons of MK's total coal production.

The company also cited the realization of NAFTA and its planned
expansion into Mexico as another benefit in relocating to San Antonio.

Morrison Knudsen Corporation (MRN-NYSE) serves the world's power,
transportation, environmental, and industrial markets as an engineer,
contractor, and manufacturer, offering complete development, operations, and
financial services.
