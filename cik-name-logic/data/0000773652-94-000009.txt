For Immediate Release

New York, N.Y., August 30, 1994 - Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc.
(RCPI) announced today that it intends to record the unrecorded
portion (approximately $1.25 billion) of its mortgage on most of the
land and buildings constituting Rockefeller Center.

RCPI has decided to record this portion of its mortgage to enhance
the security of its Mortgage Loan on the Property in view of the
scheduled year-end reduction in the amount of the letters of credit
provided by the Borrowers as additional collateral and the present
unwillingness of the parents of the Borrowers either to defer this
reduction or to commit to cover future cash shortfalls at the
Property.

RCPI said it has delivered a notice to the Borrowers stating that
RCPI was exercising its right to require the Borrowers to pay the
recording tax on the mortgage in the amount of approximately $35
million.

RCPI's President and Chief Executive Officer Edward P. Fontaine said,
"Recording the mortgage is appropriate at this time to safeguard the
investment of RCPI's fifty thousand shareholders. We expect that
this step should also enhance our ability to obtain future
financing."
