Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

The Actava Group Inc. ("Actava" or the "Company") has transferred
ownership of its four sporting goods subsidiaries to Roadmaster Industries,
Inc. ("Roadmaster") in exchange for 19,169,000 shares of Roadmaster's Common
Stock (the "Exchange Transaction"). The closing of the transaction was
effective as of December 6, 1994 (the "Closing Date"). Actava now owns
approximately 39% of the issued and outstanding shares of Roadmaster's Common
Stock based on 48,588,444 shares of Roadmaster's Common Stock outstanding as of
the Closing Date. The consideration received by Actava in the Exchange
Transaction was determined through arm's length negotiations between Actava and
Roadmaster.

The four Actava subsidiaries transferred to Roadmaster were Diversified
Products Corporation ("Diversified Products"), Hutch Sports USA Inc. ("Hutch"),
Nelson/Weather-Rite, Inc. ("Nelson/Weather-Rite"), and Willow Hosiery Company
Inc. ("Willow"), (collectively referred to as the "Sports Subsidiaries"). On
the Closing Date, the aggregate book value of the Sports Subsidiaries was
approximately $72.6 million. The market value of the shares of Roadmaster's
Common Stock received by Actava in exchange for the Sports Subsidiaries was
approximately $76.7 million as of the Closing Date. Due to the nature of the
exchange, Actava will record its investment in Roadmaster on its books at an
amount equal to the aggregate book value of the Sports Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date rather than recognizing a gain on the transaction.

Pursuant to the terms of a Shareholders' Agreement executed by Actava,
Roadmaster, and two officers and directors of Roadmaster in connection
with the Exchange Transaction, four persons designated by Actava have been
elected to the Board of Directors of Roadmaster, which now consists of nine
members. The four Roadmaster directors designated by Actava are John D.
Phillips, President and Chief Executive Officer of Actava, Carl E. Sanders, a
member of the Board of Directors of Actava and the Chairman of the Atlanta law
firm Troutman Sanders, Clay C. Long, a senior partner in Long, Aldridge &
Norman, an Atlanta law firm, and Michael P. Marshall, a private investor and
the former Chairman of the Board of Directors of Resurgens Communications
Group, Inc. Subject to the terms and limitations contained in the
Shareholders Agreement, Actava will continue to have the right to designate
four of the nine members of the Board of Directors of Roadmaster.

The Exchange Transaction was approved by Actava's stockholders
at a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on December 6, 1994.
