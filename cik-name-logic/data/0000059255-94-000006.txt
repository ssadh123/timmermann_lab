VALHI REPORTS IMPROVED FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

DALLAS, TEXAS . . April 27, 1994 . . Valhi reported a net loss for the
first quarter of 1994 of $700,000, or $.01 per share, compared to a net loss of
$60.3 million, or $.53 per share, in the first quarter of 1993. 

Sales were up 10% to $189 million as each of the Company's four business
segments reported higher sales, and operating income increased 13% to $18.6
million. In the refined sugar segment, higher volumes more than offset the
effect of slightly lower prices. Earnings declines in the solid wood portion of
the forest products segment, primarily attributable to the Company's reduction
in logs offered for sale, more than offset significant improvements in medium
density fiberboard ("MDF") earnings. MDF operations benefitted from both higher
volumes and sales prices. Fast food earnings were hampered by relatively worse
winter weather early in 1994, while increased promotion of value-priced
sandwiches aided sales comparisons and dampened margin comparisons. The
significant improvement in hardware products sales, earnings and margins
resulted from higher volumes in each major product line.

The repayment of certain high-cost debt during 1993, funded in part using
proceeds from lower-cost borrowings, was a significant factor in the 25%
reduction in interest expense. The unfavorable comparison of general corporate
and other items includes a $1 million 1994 decline in market value of the
Company's holdings of fixed-income investments.

Valhi's aggregate equity in losses of its publicly-traded unconsolidated
affiliates, NL Industries, Inc. (49%-owned) and Tremont Corporation (48%-owned),
was significantly lower in the first quarter of 1994 than in 1993. The 1993
loss attributable to affiliates included an $84 million provision for an other
than temporary decline in market value of NL stock.

The geographic mix of income in 1994 comprising the relatively nominal net
pre-tax loss resulted in net income tax expense for the period.

Valhi, Inc., headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a diversified industrial
management company engaged in the refined sugar, forest products, fast food and
hardware products industries. Valhi is also engaged in the chemicals and
titanium metals industries through its interests in NL and Tremont. Valhi's
common stock is traded on the New York and Pacific Stock Exchanges under the
symbol "VHI."
