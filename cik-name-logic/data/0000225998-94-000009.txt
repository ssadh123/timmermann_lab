Item 5. Other Events

On May 2, 1994, Washington Energy Company made the following press release:

WASHINGTON ENERGY ANNOUNCES SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS;
CABOT OIL & GAS MERGER EXPECTED TO CLOSE TODAY

SEATTLE -- Washington Energy Company's second-quarter
results bear out the company's earlier announcement that it
expected significantly reduced earnings this year, Chairman,
Chief Executive Officer and President William P. Vititoe said
today. 

The company reported today that second-quarter earnings per
share of common stock decreased 52 percent, compared to the same
quarter a year ago. The decline was primarily due to the effects
of warm winter weather and a reduced profit margin upon its
natural gas utility, lower income from the newly-formed
merchandising subsidiary and a loss from pipeline demand charges
and brokerage activities at its oil and gas exploration and
production subsidiary.

For the three months ending March 31, 1994, earnings on
common stock were $7.4 million, and earnings per share were 32
cents, compared to $15.5 million, and 67 cents per share, during
the same period a year ago.

Lower earnings reflect reduced rates that went into effect 
in October 1993 for the company's Washington Natural Gas
subsidiary.

Also, weather during the quarter was approximately 7 percent
warmer than normal. A combination of warmer temperatures and
shifting by some large-volume customers between classes and to
alternative fuels lowered gas sales volumes, which were down
approximately 4 percent.

Partially offsetting the lower gas sales volumes were an
additional 21,600, or 5 percent more, customers served on average
during the quarter by Washington Natural Gas compared to a year
ago. The gas utility now serves more than 440,000 customers in
the central Puget Sound region of western Washington.

As anticipated, earnings were also affected by lower income
from the company's retail merchandise and services operation as
the business is re-established in a new subsidiary, Washington
Energy Services.

Operating income, before income taxes, of $366,000 during
the quarter for Washington Energy Resources, the oil and gas
exploration and production subsidiary, was down from $2.2 million
during the same period a year ago. The decline was due primarily
to a loss of $1.6 million from pipeline demand charges and
brokerage activities. 

12-month results

Income from continuing operations, after preferred
dividends, was 28 cents on a per-share basis for the 12 months
ended March 31, 1994, down 72 percent from the same period a year 
ago, primarily reflecting the impact of reduced profits for
Washington Natural Gas.<PAGE>
PAGE 3

By comparison, 12-month earnings on common from continuing
operations one year ago was 99 cents per share.

After discontinued operations, the company reported a loss
in earnings on common of 19 cents a share, compared to earnings
of 87 cents a share, a year ago. 

Vititoe noted that the loss reflects a charge of 47 cents
per share from the loss recorded during the year on operations
and divestiture of the Unisyn Biowaste Technology operation. 

Cabot Oil & Gas Merger Expected to Close

In addition, Washington Energy announced it expects to close
today the merger of its oil and gas subsidiary, Washington Energy
Resources Company, with a subsidiary of Cabot Oil & Gas
Corporation.

Washington Energy will receive 2,133,000 shares of Cabot Oil
& Gas common stock, 1,134,000 shares of 6% convertible preferred
stock of Cabot, stated at $50 value, and approximately $64
million in cash. The value announced in a press release on 
Feb. 25, 1994, of $180 million, has been reduced by approximately
$23 million, to reflect a downward revision in reserves due to
lower production from newly drilled wells. 

The purchase price is subject to further adjustment based on
performance of wells in a certain field over the next year.

Washington Energy Company will retain certain marketing and
pipeline capacity assets. As previously announced, the company 
plans to establish a reserve for losses due to pipeline capacity
charges and other costs related to the merger.

Vititoe noted that because the company is required to
provide deferred taxes of over $20 million and will provide
reserves for contingencies of over $15 million, net of tax, as a
result of the merger and related transactions, the company
expects to record a loss of $25 to $30 million for these items
during the third quarter, ending June 30, 1994.
