PURCHASE PRICE; POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT; ALLOCATIONS

Section 2.01 Cash at Closing. In consideration of the sale and
purchase contemplated herein, the Buyer agrees at the Closing (a) to pay the
Seller the cash sum of Thirty One Million Dollars ($31,000,000) by means of a
wire transfer of such funds to a bank account to be designated in writing by
the Seller prior to Closing, and (b) to assume and discharge the Seller's
obligations and liabilities with respect to the Assumed Obligations as they
come due.

Section 2.02 Post-Closing Price Adjustment. The cash portion of
the purchase price has been established based on the assumption that as of the
close of business on December 31, 1993 (hereafter referred to as the "Effective
Time") the Inventory, Supplies, Accounts Receivable, and Seller's Prepayments
(hereafter referred to as the "Acquired Current Assets") will exceed the
Assumed Current Liabilities by Twelve Million Four Hundred Sixty-Six Thousand
Dollars ($12,466,000) (hereafter referred to as the "Baseline Working
Capital"). After the Closing, the cash portion of the purchase price shall be
adjusted to account for any variation in the difference between the Baseline
Working Capital and the Acquired Working Capital (defined below) as of the
Effective Time. For example, if the Acquired Working Capital is less than the
Baseline Working Capital, the Seller shall refund the difference to the Buyer
in immediately available funds and if the Acquired Working Capital exceeds the
Baseline Working Capital, the Buyer shall pay the difference to the Seller in
immediately available funds. The "Acquired Working Capital" shall be the
difference at the Effective Time between (i) the sum of the Acquired Current
Assets and (ii) the sum of the Assumed Current Liabilities. The procedure for
determining and paying the post-closing price adjustment shall be as follows:

(a) Joint Inventory. The Buyer and the Seller shall
conduct a joint physical inventory count of the Inventory (hereafter
referred to as the "Joint Inventory") as of the Effective Time. The
Joint Inventory shall be conducted using comprehensive count
procedures and shall be valued at the lower of cost or market using
the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") cost method.

(b) Initial Closing Balance Sheet. Within ninety (90)
days after the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a
pro-forma balance sheet as of the Effective Time prepared in

-8-
<PAGE> 18
accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied (hereafter referred to as "GAAP") followed in the
preparation of the Seller's interim unaudited June 30, 1993 pro-forma
balance sheet attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference as
Exhibit E, reflecting only the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Current Liabilities (hereafter referred to as the "Initial Closing
Balance Sheet"). The Buyer shall simultaneously deliver to the Seller
an itemized schedule of all the Assumed Current Liabilities, Customer
Deposits and Seller's Prepayments included in the Initial Closing
Balance Sheet. The Initial Closing Balance Sheet shall value the
Inventory in the manner set forth in subsection (a) above and the
Supplies at the lower of cost or market regardless of whether that
approach was used in prior periods and shall reflect a reserve for bad
debts determined in accordance with Section 2.03(a).

(c) Seller's Review of Initial Closing Balance Sheet.
The Seller shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of the
Initial Closing Balance Sheet to review the results thereof. During
the period, the Buyer shall provide any information and supporting
documents relating to the Initial Closing Balance Sheet and the
Assumed Current Liabilities, Customer Deposits and Seller's
Prepayments reasonably requested by the Seller to determine its
accuracy. Any objections the Seller may have to the amount of the
Acquired Working Capital reflected in the Initial Closing Balance
Sheet (including any additions or changes to the Assumed Current
Liabilities, Customer Deposits and Seller's Prepayments incorporated
therein) shall be communicated by a written notice of objections
delivered to the Buyer within such thirty (30) day period. The notice
shall set forth the specific grounds for each objection and enclose
all available supporting data. In the event the Seller fails to
provide notice of objections to the Buyer within the thirty (30) day
period, the determinations of the Acquired Working Capital set forth
in the Initial Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed final and binding
on all parties to this Agreement. The Initial Closing Balance Sheet,
as prepared by the Buyer if the Seller does not provide notice of
objections to the Buyer within the thirty (30) day period, or if
objections are received, as determined in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.02(d) or (e) below, is herein
referred to as the "Final Closing Balance Sheet."

(d) Buyer's Review of Seller's Objections. In the event
the Seller delivers a notice of objections to the Initial Closing
Balance Sheet to the Buyer within the thirty (30) day period set forth
in subsection (c) above, the Buyer shall have an additional thirty
(30) days to review the Seller's objections. During this period, the
Buyer and the Seller shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on
the amount

-9-
<PAGE> 19
of the Acquired Working Capital. Any such written agreement shall be
final and binding on all parties to this Agreement.

(e) Final Determination by Accounting Firm. In the event
the Seller objects to the Initial Closing Balance Sheet and the
parties are unable to resolve their differences within the thirty (30)
day period provided in subsection (d) above, the Buyer and the Seller
shall jointly select a nationally recognized certified public
accounting firm that has no business or professional relationship to
either party or their affiliates to determine the Final Closing
Balance Sheet, including the amount of the Acquired Working Capital.
In the event the Buyer and the Seller are unable to jointly select an
accounting firm within ten (10) days after the thirty (30) day period
set forth in (d) above has elapsed, the parties shall jointly
request the Chief Judge of the Hillsborough County, Florida Circuit
Court to appoint an accounting firm satisfying the foregoing
qualifications to make such determination. The accounting firm
selected in the manner set forth above shall be required to render its
determination within thirty (30) days after such appointment. During
this period, the Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate with such
accounting firm by providing access to or copies of all books and
records it reasonably requests. The determination of Acquired Working
Capital rendered by such accounting firm shall be final and binding on
all parties to this Agreement.

(f) Procedure for Payment of Adjustment. The amount of
the post-closing price adjustment finally established to be due the
Buyer or the Seller based on the Final Closing Balance Sheet
determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsections
(a)-(e) above shall be paid in immediately available funds within five
(5) Business Days following the final determination, together with
interest from and after the Closing Date at a floating rate equal to
the prime rate announced from time to time by Citibank, N.A., New
York, New York, as its prime rate. Such payment shall be made by wire
transfer to an account designated by the party entitled to the
payment.

Section 2.03 Reserves for Bad Debts. The reserves for bad debts
used in the Closing Balance Sheet shall equal $400,000, plus the balances
outstanding at the Effective Time on the accounts listed in Schedule 2.03(a).

Section 2.04 Allocation of Purchase Price. At or prior to the
Closing, the Buyer and the Seller shall execute a written instrument in the
form of Exhibit C setting forth by asset category and amount the mutually
agreed allocation of the consideration being paid by the Buyer for the
Purchased Assets. Exhibit C shall include specific allocations for each parcel
of Real Estate and each titled motor vehicle (including trailers). The sums
allocated

-10-
<PAGE> 20
to the Acquired Current Assets shall subsequently be modified to conform to the
Closing Balance Sheet which serves as the basis for any post-closing adjustment
in the purchase price. Each party agrees to report the purchase and sale
contemplated herein on Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and for all other
federal and state tax purposes in accordance with such allocation.

ARTICLE III

TITLE INSURANCE AND RELATED MATTERS

Section 3.01 Title Insurance. Not less than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Seller, at its expense, shall furnish to the
Buyer a commitment together with legible copies of all documents pertaining to
any exceptions therein (hereafter referred to as the "Commitment"), for an
owner's title insurance policy issued by First American Title Insurance Company
(hereafter referred to as the "Title Company"). The Seller's counsel will act
as the title agent for the Title Company. Upon request, Seller's counsel shall
provide written confirmation from the Title Company of its authority as agent.
The Commitment shall commit to provide to the Buyer a single ALTA title
insurance owner's policy (current Florida form), (hereafter referred to as the
"Title Policy"), in the amount of the purchase price allocated to the Real
Property, insuring the Buyer's title to the Real Property to be marketable and
free of all Encumbrances and other matters, except for (a) the exceptions set
forth in Schedule 3.01(a) attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference
(hereafter referred to as the "Permitted Exceptions"), and (b) those matters
that do not constitute Title Defects as defined in Section 3.03. The initial
Commitment may be subject to exceptions for: (i) real property ad valorem
taxes and assessments for the calendar year during which the Closing occurs,
(ii) unfiled mechanics' liens, (iii) survey, (iv) unrecorded easements, (v)
rights of parties in possession and (vi) those matters created or first
appearing in the Public Records or attaching subsequent to the effective date
of the Commitment but prior to the date the Buyer acquires the Real Property.
The Seller shall pay the 1993 ad valorem taxes on the Real Property prior to
the Closing. Subject to compliance with the provisions of Sections 3.02 and
3.03 of this Agreement, the exceptions referred to in paragraphs (i) through
(vi) above shall be deleted from the Commitment at the Closing and will not
appear in the Title Policy.

Section 3.02 Surveys. The Seller shall, at the Seller's expense,
obtain current surveys of the Real Property (the "Surveys") not less than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Two prints of the Surveys shall
be promptly delivered to the Buyer. The Surveys shall be certified to the
Buyer, the Title Company, and the Seller's counsel, and shall clearly set forth
the bearings and dimensions of all boundary lines as well as the dimensions and
locations of all improvements, streets, accesses,

-11-
<PAGE> 21
easements, encroachments and setbacks and shall otherwise meet the minimum
technical requirements of the Florida Statutes and the Florida Administrative
Code. When the Seller obtains the Surveys, the exceptions described in
Sections 3.01(iii) and (iv) above will be deleted from the Commitment at the
Closing and will not appear in the Title Policy when issued. At the Buyer's
option the legal description of the Real Property as determined by the Surveys
shall be used in the deeds, the Commitment and the Title Policy.

Section 3.03 Title Defects and Remedies. The term "Title Defect"
means any Encumbrance, restriction, reservation, easement, matter disclosed by
the Survey, or any other matter which would in the Buyer's reasonable
discretion cause the title to be unmarketable under the Uniform Title Standards
adopted by the Florida Bar and applicable law. The Buyer shall have one (1)
Business Day after receipt of the Commitment (including any endorsement
thereto), and all of the Surveys, to give the Seller notice of any Title
Defect. The Seller shall have thirty (30) days after the date of such notice
(hereafter referred to as the "Cure Period") in which to cure such Title Defect
and furnish to the Buyer evidence that such Title Defect has been cured.
Seller shall exercise reasonable efforts, at the Seller's sole expense to cure
all Title Defects but Seller shall not be required to initiate any legal
proceedings to cure any Title Defect. If the Seller fails or is unable to cure
any Title Defect within the applicable Cure Period, the Buyer shall have the
option, to be exercised by giving the Seller notice within one (1) Business Day
after the end of such Cure Period, either to complete the purchase of the
Purchased Assets without reduction in the purchase price and accept title to
the Real Property subject to any uncured Title Defects or to terminate this
Agreement. If the Buyer elects to complete such purchase, the Title Policy and
closing documents shall reflect the uncured Title Defects accepted by the Buyer
as being Permitted Exceptions. If the Closing Date is extended because of the
provisions of this Section, then the Closing shall take place on or before the
tenth day after: (i) the date any and all Title Defects have been cured; or
(ii) the Buyer's election to complete the purchase of the Purchased Assets
subject to any uncured Title Defects.

that is the subject of the Assumed Leases, and to have such services
reconnected in or otherwise transferred to the Buyer's name immediately

price to the extent that the insurance proceeds are less than the reasonable
cost of repairing or replacing the damaged property. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, in the event the difference between the
insurance proceeds and loss in the fair market value of the affected
Purchased Assets is less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), the Buyer shall
not be entitled to terminate this Agreement and instead shall be entitled to a

Section 8.02 Condemnation. If any authority having the right of
eminent domain commences negotiations or commences legal action for the
damaging, taking or acquiring of any Assets, either temporarily or permanently,
by condemnation or by exercise of the right of eminent domain (a "Taking"), the
Seller will promptly give notice of the same to the Buyer. In the event of a
material Taking, at the Buyer's option and subject to the limitation set forth
below, the Buyer will have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving
notice thereof to the Seller within the earlier of fifteen (15) days after
receipt of the Seller's notice under this Section 8.02 or one (1) day prior to
the Closing Date. If the Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to this
Section, this Agreement will become null and void, and the Seller, Upjohn and
the

-32-
<PAGE> 42
Buyer will thereupon have no further liabilities or obligations under this
Agreement or otherwise. If the Buyer elects not to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.02 or if the Taking is not material, the Buyer will
be entitled to the benefits of all awards, claims, settlement proceeds, and
other proceeds payable by reason of any such Taking, and the Seller will assign
to the Buyer all awards, claims, settlement proceeds, or other proceeds payable
by reason of any such Taking. In the event of any negotiations with respect to
any of the Purchased Assets with any authority regarding settlement on account
of any Taking, the Seller will inform the Buyer of all such negotiations, will
permit the Buyer to take part therein, and will not enter into any settlements
thereof without the Buyer's prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, in the event the difference between the
condemnation proceeds and loss in the fair market value of the affected
Purchased Assets is less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and Buyer's
ability to utilize the Purchased Assets is not materially impaired, the Buyer
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement.

The Buyer shall be solely responsible for all costs attributable to Hazardous
Substance contamination discovered on or after the first day of the sixth year
after the Closing Date when the party

-44-
<PAGE> 54
responsible for such contamination cannot be determined by clear and convincing
evidence. As used in this Section 11.05(g) and in Section 11.05(h) below,
"costs" shall include all damages, losses, obligations, deficiencies,
liabilities, claims, Encumbrances, fines, penalties, and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable compensation for time expended by the
Buyer's environmental personnel and other employees, arising from or relating
to Hazardous Substance contamination, including the remediation therefor and
the costs associated with monetary compliance with all Environmental Control
Laws.

(h) Plant City Corrective Action Plan; Disposal of
Containers. The Seller has been engaged in negotiations with the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection ("FDEP") regarding the appropriate
nature and scope of a Preliminary Corrective Action Plan and a Corrective
Action Plan (collectively referred to as "CAP") deemed desirable for the
parcels of the Seller's Real Property located on Highway 39 in Plant City,
Florida (hereafter referred to as the "Plant City Real Property"). The purpose
of the CAP and related activity is to define environmental conditions within
the scope of the CAP and identify action, if any, which may be appropriate for
protection of human health or the environment. The Seller and Upjohn shall
continue with such project, and shall be fully responsible for implementation
and completion of the remediation contemplated by the CAP to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Buyer and all appropriate regulatory authorities. The
parties recognize that, upon completion of the remediation contemplated by the
CAP, certain monitoring, risk assessment or additional remedial action at the
Plant City Real Property may be required. After completion of the remediation
contemplated by the CAP, the Buyer shall assume responsibility for undertaking
any and all monitoring, risk assessment or additional remedial action relating
to or identified by or through the CAP and required by appropriate regulatory
authorities and shall pay all costs associated therewith. The Seller and
Upjohn shall reimburse the Buyer, no less frequently than quarterly, all
reasonable costs incurred by the Buyer in fulfilling such responsibilities to
the extent that such costs (i) arise out of application of the least costly
engineering practice adequate for compliance with applicable regulatory
requirements, and (ii) arise solely out of requirements imposed due to
conditions at the Plant City Real Property as of the Closing Date. In the
event the costs of the CAP, the monitoring, the risk assessment or the remedial
action are increased as a result of additional contamination of the Plant City
Real Property occurring after the Closing Date, the Seller and Upjohn shall not
be obligated to reimburse the Buyer for such increased costs. The Seller and
Upjohn shall continue and complete the remediation, cleanup and disposal now in
progress at the Plant City Real Property to the approval of the Buyer (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and all appropriate governmental
agencies and prior to the Closing shall properly dispose of all drums, vessels
and other containers which contain or previously contained

-45-
<PAGE> 55
Hazardous Substances at the Plant City Real Property or any other parcel of
Real Property and which are not in use or to be used for the storage of
saleable products as of the Closing Date. All reasonable costs associated
therewith shall be paid by the Seller and Upjohn. All contracts entered into
by the Seller or Upjohn for remediation work to be performed at the Plant City
Real Property or any other parcel of Real Property shall disclose that neither
the Seller nor Upjohn owns the Real Property and that the Real Property is
therefore not subject to construction or mechanics' liens by reason of the work
to be performed thereunder. The Seller and Upjohn will use reasonable efforts
to ensure that the Buyer is not named as a party to any consent order or
enforcement proceeding that may be issued by the FDEP relating to the CAP or
the environmental conditions giving rise to the CAP; provided, however, that
such reasonable efforts shall not be deemed to require the Seller or Upjohn to
agree to any condition, obligation or other provision of the CAP which may be
requested by the FDEP which the Seller or Upjohn determine, in their sole
discretion, is not in the best interest of the Seller or Upjohn.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.05(h)
which contemplates that the Seller and Upjohn shall be responsible for
implementing the remediation contemplated by the CAP, after the Closing the
Buyer will give due consideration to proposals from the Seller and Upjohn under
which the Buyer would assume responsibility for implementing part or all of
such remediations, but the Buyer shall not be obligated to do so.

Buyer shall grant Seller and Upjohn access to the Plant City Real
Property and appropriate records in order for Seller and Upjohn to fulfill
their obligations under this Subsection 11.05(h).

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no later than
June 1, 1994 the Seller and Upjohn shall use their best efforts to complete to
the satisfaction of FDEP a sufficient portion of the remediation contemplated
by the preliminary or final CAP relating to the area within the Plant City Real
Property denoted by diagonal lines on the site plan appended to this Agreement
as Exhibit F to allow construction of a tank farm consisting of six or seven
tanks and associated secondary containment improvements. In the event the
Seller and Upjohn fail for any reason to complete such remediation to the
satisfaction of FDEP by June 1, 1994, they shall pay to the Buyer liquidated
damages in the amount of Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000) per month for each
full month thereafter that the remediation remains incomplete. Such amount
shall be prorated for that portion of any delay involving less than a full
month. The Seller and Upjohn acknowledge that liquidated damages of forty
thousand dollars per month represents a reasonable estimate of the actual
damages the Buyer would suffer as a result of the failure of the remediation to
be completed by June 1, 1994 and is not intended as a penalty. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no liquidated damages shall be

-46-
<PAGE> 56
assessed for any delays beyond June 1, 1994 that are directly attributable to
cessation of remediation work due to a hurricane, tornado or flood or damages
caused by any such event. The foregoing liquidated damages shall be payable in
lieu of any other damages relating to a breach of the obligation set forth in
this paragraph, whether actual, special, incidental or consequential.

(i) Limitations on Scope of Remediation Work. In the
event that any remediation is required to be performed or funded by the Seller
and Upjohn after the expiration of the applicable limitations period set forth
in Section 11.01 pursuant to a written notice served on the Seller and Upjohn
prior thereto, the scope of the remediation work to be performed or funded by
the Seller and Upjohn shall be determined by the applicable laws and
regulations relating to the scope of such work in effect as of the last day of
the applicable limitations period, notwithstanding any change in such laws or
regulations that may become effective thereafter.

(j) Definition of Environmental Claim. For purposes of
this Article XI, the term "Environmental Claim" shall mean: (i) any and all
claims, actions or proceedings of any type or nature commenced by the EPA,
FDEP, other governmental agency or by a third party relating to a violation or
an alleged violation of any Environmental Control Law; (ii) a written notice
from the EPA, the FDEP or other governmental agency of any violation or
potential violation of any Environmental Control Law, including, but not
limited to, a Warning Notice, Notice of Non-Compliance, Notice of Violation, a
request for a preliminary assessment, or a site investigation notice from the
EPA, the Florida DEP or other governmental agency; or (iii) a written notice of
a claim or potential claim by a third party. Nothing herein shall preclude
Buyer from notifying the EPA, the FDEP or other appropriate governmental agency
of any violation of any Environmental Control Law if Buyer reasonably
determines that such notification is required under such laws. Notwithstanding
any other provisions contained herein, Seller and Upjohn shall only be
responsible for Environmental Claims asserted within the applicable time
limitations set forth in Section 11.01.

Section 11.06 Exclusive Remedy. (a) Each of the Buyer, Seller and
Upjohn hereby acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims relating to the covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the documents
required to be delivered pursuant hereto shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XI, and, in furtherance of
the foregoing, each of the Buyer, Seller and Upjohn hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action it may have against the Buyer or Seller and Upjohn, as the
case may be, arising under or based upon common law or any federal, state or
local statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation other than any such rights,
claims or causes of action based upon fraud.

-47-
<PAGE> 57
(b) Except as set forth in this Agreement and the
documents required to be delivered pursuant hereto, neither the Buyer nor
Seller and Upjohn is making any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
with respect to the matters contained herein.

Section 11.07 Notice. Promptly, and in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days after acquiring knowledge of any damage, loss, deficiency,
liability, claim, Encumbrance, penalty, cost, expense, action, suit,
investigation, proceeding, demand, assessment, audit, judgment, or claim
against which the Seller and Upjohn have agreed to indemnify the Buyer or
against which the Buyer has agreed to indemnify the Seller and Upjohn, the
Seller and Upjohn or the Buyer, as the case may be, will give to the other
party written notice thereof in the manner set forth in Section 16.01.

Section 11.08 Third Party Claims. With respect to each third party
claim subject to this Article XI (a "Third Party Claim"), the party seeking
indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt notice to the
indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying Party") of the Third Party Claim in
accordance with Section 11.07. If the remedy sought in the Third Party Claim
is solely money damages and/or equitable relief as would not have a material
adverse effect on the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party, at its
sole cost and expense, may, upon notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen
(15) days after the Indemnifying Party receives notice of the Third Party
Claim, assume the defense of the Third Party Claim. If it assumes the defense
of a Third Party Claim then the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel of its
choosing to conduct the defense. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claim, unless (i) the settlement or judgment is solely for money damages and/or
such equitable relief as would not have a material adverse effect on the
Indemnified Party or (ii) the Indemnified Party consents thereto, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim, the defense of which is
assumed by the Indemnifying Party, with its own counsel and at its own expense.
With respect to any Third Party Claim in which the remedy sought is not solely
money damages and/or such equitable relief as would not have a material adverse
effect on the Indemnified Party, then (i) the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall, upon notice
to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnifying Party
receives notice of the Third Party Claim, be entitled to participate in the
defense with its own counsel at its own expense and (iii) the Indemnified Party
shall not consent to any settlement of, or entry of any judgment arising from,
such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party consents thereto, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnifying Party does not
elect to assume or participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim in
accordance with the terms of

-48-
<PAGE> 58
this Section 11.08, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to conduct its
own defense of the Third Party Claim. The parties shall cooperate in the
defense of any Third Party Claim and the relevant records of each party shall
be made available on a timely basis.

Section 11.09 Remediation.

(a) Notwithstanding the notice provisions set forth in
Section 11.07 of this Agreement and except as otherwise expressly
provided in Section 11.05, in the event that Buyer intends to
undertake remediation work of Hazardous Substances in or on the Real
Property due to the existence of any of the circumstances, events or
conditions contemplated by Sections 11.04 or 11.05 of this Agreement,
the Buyer will give written notice to the Seller and Upjohn of its
intent to undertake such remediation, together with: (i) an estimate
of the cost to perform such remediation (hereafter referred to as the
"Estimate") and (ii) a statement of the amount expended and costs
incurred by or for the benefit of the Buyer prior to the date of such
notice, in connection with the determination of the scope and need for
such remediation. The Seller and Upjohn shall, within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of such notice notify the Buyer either
that it will not undertake the remediation, or that it will undertake
such remediation. If the Seller and Upjohn elect not to undertake the
remediation, the Buyer shall allow Seller and Upjohn a reasonable
opportunity to comment on the Buyer's remediation plans and to
participate in any significant negotiations with governmental
authorities that may take place regarding such remediation plan.
Within ten (10) Business Days after receipt from the Buyer of an
invoice reflecting costs incurred with respect to such remediation,
Seller and Upjohn shall reimburse the Buyer for the reasonable costs
for the least costly engineering practice adequate for compliance with
applicable regulatory requirements and as set forth in such invoice
(or a portion thereof as provided in Section 11.05).

(b) In the event the Seller and Upjohn elect to undertake
the remediation of the Real Property it shall bear and pay directly
and promptly all costs of such remediation, except as otherwise
provided in Section 11.05. The Seller and Upjohn shall, in connection
therewith, be provided reasonable access to the contamination site by
the Buyer and the Seller and Upjohn shall perform or cause to be
performed, in a diligent and workmanlike manner, any and all acts
necessary to remediate the contamination of the Real Property as
required by all applicable laws, rules, and regulations and orders,
directives or instructions of any agency or judicial or quasi judicial
body having jurisdiction; provided, however, that Seller and Upjohn
shall not be required by this Agreement to comply with any laws,
rules, regulations, orders, directives,

-49-
<PAGE> 59
or instructions of any agency or judicial or quasi-judicial body if
Seller and Upjohn, in good faith, appeal, defend against, or otherwise
contest any such laws, rules, regulations, orders, directives or
instructions and hold the Buyer harmless with respect to any loss,
cost or expense resulting from a delay in performing any remediation
attributable to any such defense, contest or appeal. The Seller and
Upjohn shall not engage any consultant, engineer or any other person
to perform remediation work without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Seller
and Upjohn will perform such remediation in a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with the Buyer's business operations. The
Seller will assure that each person involved in or associated with the
remediation work is covered by (a) workers' compensation insurance
either as required by applicable law, or sufficient to compensate such
person for any injury suffered while involved in or associated with
the remediation, and (b) appropriate liability insurance sufficient to
compensate the Buyer for any loss, damage, cost, expense or charge
occasioned by such person while so involved or associated with the
remediation.

ARTICLE XII

Section 12.01 Cooperation. The Buyer and the Seller and Upjohn
will cooperate upon and after the Closing Date in effecting the orderly

the requesting party's expense, but without additional consideration, the other
party will execute and deliver from time to time such further instruments of
assignment, conveyance and transfer, will sign any documents necessary or
useful to ensure that all of the right, title and interest in and to the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Leases and the Assumed Contracts vests in the

and the Buyer will cooperate and assist the Seller and Upjohn, at the expense
of the Seller and Upjohn, in connection with the defense of claims relating to
product warranties issued by the Seller which the Seller and Upjohn in good
faith determine should not be recognized.

Section 12.05 Use of License Tags. After the Closing, the Buyer
will use its best efforts to obtain new license tags at the earliest
practicable date for all of the rolling stock included in the Purchased Assets
that require license tags. Until the earlier of (a) the date the new license
tags are issued or (b) five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall be entitled to operate the rolling stock included in the Purchased Assets
using the Seller's license tags. The Buyer covenants and agrees that as long
as Buyer operates using Seller's license tags it shall have insurance policies
in place, including umbrella policies providing motor vehicle liability
coverage for all owned, non-owned and hired vehicles operated by the Buyer in
an amount not less than Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000) with
deductibles aggregating not more than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). At
Closing, the Buyer shall furnish the Seller and Upjohn with a certificate of
insurance attesting that the Seller and Upjohn have been added as an additional
insured under the Seller's primary motor vehicle liability insurance policy
issued by Insurance Company of North America providing coverage up to One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000). The Buyer covenants and agrees to indemnify

-51-
<PAGE> 61
and hold harmless the Seller and Upjohn from and against all loss, cost or
expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees, by reason of any suit, claim or
demand arising out of or resulting from the Buyer's operation of the rolling
stock after the Effective Time using the Seller's license tags.

arrangements to enable the Buyer to deposit checks and other payments with
respect to the Accounts Receivable into the Buyer's bank accounts without
endorsement by the Seller.

Section 12.08 Covenant not to Compete and Confidentiality. As a
material inducement to the Buyer to enter into this Agreement, the Seller,
Upjohn and Asgrow Seed Company jointly and severally agree that for a period of
five (5) years after the Closing Date, they will not, either directly or
indirectly, as a stockholder of any corporation or partner of any partnership
or as an owner, investor, principal or agent, or in any other manner, engage in
any business within the State of Florida which markets Fertilizers, Crop
Protection Products (both as defined below) or any other products that the
Seller currently markets within the State of Florida or any products similar
thereto; provided that this restrictive covenant shall not apply to seeds. As
used herein, "Fertilizers" means chemicals applied to plants or the soil for

shield plants from inclement weather and chemical fungicides, pesticides and
insecticides. Nothing contained herein shall restrict Seller, Upjohn, Asgrow
Seed Company or any of their affiliates from developing, selling or engaging in
any other activities involving biotechnology or seeds, including without
limitation, coating seeds with fungicides, pesticides and insecticides. In the

limitations permitted by applicable law. The Seller, Upjohn and Asgrow Seed
Company further jointly and severally agree that from and after the Closing
Date they will hold in confidence and not make use of any proprietary
information or trade secrets that they possess relating to the business of the
Seller or the Buyer, except to the extent that (i) Asgrow Seed Company makes
use of the Customer List in connection with the sale or marketing of seeds,
(ii) disclosures are ordered by any court, and (iii) such information has
become public knowledge other than by reason of their breach of the provisions
of this Section. The Seller, Upjohn and Asgrow Seed Company hereby agree that
the covenants set forth in this Section are a material and substantial
inducement to the Buyer to enter

-52-
<PAGE> 62
into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and that in the
event of a breach of such covenants the Buyer shall be entitled to all
available legal and equitable remedies, including without limitation,
injunctive relief, both preliminary and permanent, and the Buyer shall not be
required to post a surety bond in connection therewith.

Section 12.09 Delivery of Title Policy. On or before January 28,
1994, the Seller and Upjohn shall cause the Title Policy to be delivered to the

the Buyer, the Seller and Upjohn will pay, discharge and satisfy any obligation
or liability of the Seller existing at the Effective Time arising out of
events,

-53-
<PAGE> 63
acts or occurrences or operations of the Seller prior to the Effective Time.
In turn, the Buyer will pay, discharge and satisfy when they come due the
Assumed Obligations and any obligations or liability of the Buyer which accrues
after the Effective Time arising out of events, acts or occurrences or
operation of the Purchased Assets or the business of the Buyer after the
Effective Time, and will hold the Seller and Upjohn harmless against all claims
of creditors which may be asserted against the Seller or Upjohn by reason of
its failure to pay any such obligations or liabilities.

party may on or before the Closing give notice of termination to the defaulting
