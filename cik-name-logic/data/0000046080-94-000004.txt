HASBRO, INC. ANNOUNCES RECORD RESULTS
FOR FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 1993

Pawtucket, RI (February 10, 1994) -- Hasbro, Inc. (HAS:ASE) today 
reported its results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 26, 
1993.

For the sixth consecutive year, the Company reported record fourth 
quarter levels of both net revenues and earnings. Net revenues were 
$932,196,000, an increase of more than 12% from the $831,336,000 of the 
corresponding quarter a year earlier. Net earnings, at $70,726,000, 
increased 8% from last year's fourth quarter record of $65,638,000. Absent 
the effect of the previously announced $15,500,000 pretax fourth quarter 
restructuring charge, net earnings increased more than 22% from those of a 
year ago. Earnings per share for the quarter, after the restructuring 
charge, increased to $.78 from $.73 in the same period a year ago. The 
weighted average number of shares for the quarter was 90,314,000 up from 
89,671,000 in 1992.

Net revenues and earnings for the year also reached record levels. Net 
revenues were $2.747 billion, up 8% from the $2.541 billion reported in 
1992. For the year, net earnings were $200,004,000, or $2.22 per share. 
Absent the effect of the restructuring charge, full year net earnings 
approximated $210,000,000 or $2.33 per share, an increase of more than 15% 
from the $179,164,000, or $2.01 per share reported a year ago. The weighted 
average number of shares for 1993 was 90,031,000 compared to 89,086,000 in 
1992.

Both periods also were adversely impacted by the strengthened U.S. 
dollar. In constant dollars, revenues for the quarter and year would have 
increased approximately $140,000,000, or 17% and $313,000,000, or 12%, 
respectively, over comparable 1992 amounts.

Alan G. Hassenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commenting 
on the results stated that "it sounds repetitious, but again a very strong 
fourth quarter has brought us to the end of another terrific year during 
which Hasbro remained in top form."

"During the fourth quarter, the trends experienced during the first 
nine months continued to be evident. Domestically, we enjoyed another very 
successful quarter. Our promoted brands group was again led by Kenner, in 
part due to the continued enthusiasm for its Littlest Pet Shop(R) and 
Jurassic Park(TM) items, while Hasbro Toy, after a difficult period during 
the year, began to see an up-turn in several of its products, including 
Tonka's Talk 'N Play Fire Truck(TM) and The Real Power Tool Shop(TM). The 
infant and preschool units also performed better than expected. Playskool 
was buoyed by the success of Talking Barney(R) and many of their traditional 
products including Play-Doh(R) and Tinkertoy(R), while the Kid Dimension 
line was very well accepted by both retailers and consumers during its 
initial year. In the games area, Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers 
continued to grow, with strength shown in many of their newer items, 
including Don't Wake Daddy(R), Ask Zandar(TM) and Jenga(R), and in the 
classics such as Monopoly(R), Scrabble(R) and The Game of Life(R). 
Internationally, fourth quarter revenues also increased from those of a year 
ago. Strong performances by our Canadian, Mexican, U.K. and German units 
helped to offset the negative effects of the strengthened U.S. dollar and 
the generally weak worldwide economic conditions." 

Mr. Hassenfeld concluded, "we believe that the momentum which we have 
built during the second half of 1993, our strong line of continuing 
products, the new products being introduced at the American International 
Toy Fair next week and an improving international retail environment should 
provide us a solid base on which to build a successful 1994."
