Item No. 5. Other Events. Fleming Companies, Inc. announced today 
that Smitty's Super Valu, a Phoenix, Ariz., customer, has challenged the
enforceability of its supply contract with Fleming and may seek
alternate arrangements. Smitty's has provided Fleming with the opportunity 
to match the terms offered by a competitor. Under the provisions of its 
supply contract, Fleming has three months in which to respond. Fleming's 
supply contract will expire in 31 months if the company matches the competing 
offer and in 15 months if it does not. Fleming intends to comply fully
with the supply contract and expects Smitty's to do likewise. 
Smitty's purchased approximately $290 million of products from
Fleming during the past 12 months.
