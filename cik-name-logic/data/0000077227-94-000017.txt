Item 5. OTHER EVENTS.

As previously reported, in March 1993 the Pennsylvania

Public Utility Commission ("PaPUC") issued a generic policy

statement permitting the deferral of incremental expense

associated with the adoption by Pennsylvania utilities of

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 ("FAS 106"),

"Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than

Pensions."

Consistent with the PaPUC policy statement, in July

1993 Pennsylvania Electric Company ("Penelec") filed a petition

with the PaPUC seeking approval to defer approximately $10

million annually of FAS 106 incremental expense until such

expense has been recognized in Penelec's base rates. The PaPUC

approved Penelec's petition by declaratory order in October 1993.

The Company's affiliate, Metropolitan Edison Company ("Met-Ed"),

had earlier received PaPUC authorization as part of a 1993 order

issued in Met-Ed's retail base rate case to defer incremental FAS

106 expense in which the PaPUC stated that "provided that the

Company can satisfy its burden of proving adequate cost controls

in a future rate case within five years of the inception of FAS

106, the prudently incurred costs booked to the regulatory asset

account can be included in rates". The rate order did not,

however, provide for current collection of revenues associated

with such costs.

As also previously reported, in a proceeding involving

an unaffiliated Pennsylvania utility, Pennsylvania Power & Light

Company ("PP&L"), the Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate

("Advocate") appealed a PaPUC declaratory order issued outside a

1

full base rate proceeding permitting that utility to defer its

incremental FAS 106 expense pending its next base rate order. On

May 26, 1994, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court upheld the

Advocate's appeal and reversed the PaPUC's declaratory order.

The Commonwealth Court held that FAS 106 expense incurred by PP&L

after January 1, 1993 (the effective date for the FAS 106

accounting change) but prior to its next base rate case could not

be deferred for future recovery as part of a later base rate case

order, and that to assure such future recovery constituted

unlawful retroactive ratemaking.

The ultimate outcome of any appeal by a party to that

case, should one be made, of the Commonwealth Court decision can

not be predicted.

Unless the Commonwealth Court decision is overturned,

Penelec would have to write-off any FAS 106 expense amounts

deferred on its books. It is estimated that approximately $14.5

million (before income taxes) representing the Pennsylvania

jurisdictional amount of incremental expense resulting from FAS

106 will have been deferred by Penelec during 1993 and through

June 30, 1994. Moreover, after any write-off, Penelec would

charge to income annual incremental expense resulting from FAS

106 which currently approximate $9.6 million (before income

taxes).

As noted above, Met-Ed was authorized in a 1993 retail

base rate order of the PaPUC to defer for future recovery annual

incremental (including the annual transition obligation) FAS 106

expense which amount to approximately $8.4 million (before income

taxes) and which will have amounted to approximately $12 million

through June 30, 1994. As previously reported, the Advocate has

appealed certain aspects of the PaPUC's 1993 rate order for Met-

Ed, including the deferral for future recovery of incremental FAS

106 expense. However, the Advocate did not pursue the FAS 106

issue in its brief or in oral argument.

The Advocate also has appealed a PaPUC base rate order

granting an unaffiliated Pennsylvania water utility recovery in

current rates of its transition obligation resulting from the

utility's adoption of FAS 106 on January 1, 1993. On June 7,

1994, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the PaPUC's order and

dismissed the appeal, finding that the PaPUC's allowance of

recovery of FAS 106 transition obligation costs did not

constitute unlawful retroactive ratemaking.

There can be no assurance of the ultimate outcome of

these proceedings.
