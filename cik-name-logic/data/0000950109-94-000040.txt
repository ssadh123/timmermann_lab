Citizens Savings has pledged, in addition to all of its stock in the Federal
Home Loan Bank, real estate loans of approximately $23,120,000 as collateral
for such borrowings.

3. Capital Requirements

On August 9, 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and 
Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA") was signed into law. This legislation,
among other things, strengthened the deposit insurance for savings 
institutions' customers by creating a new fund called the Savings 
Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF"). SAIF is backed by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. Government and administered by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), FIRREA significantly restructured the 
regulation of thrift institutions, increased the capital requirements 
applicable to thrift institutions and contained other revisions that may
materially impact the future operations of thrift institutions.

Prior to its conversion to a North Carolina-chartered savings bank on 
October 1, 1992, Citizens Savings was subject to capital requirements of the
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). Upon its conversion to a state savings
bank, Citizens Savings ceased to be subject to the OTS capital requirements
and became subject to the capital requirements of the FDIC and the North
Carolina Administrator. The FDIC requires Citizens Savings to have a
minimum leverage ratio of Tier I capital (principally consisting of common
shareholders equity, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited
amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less certain goodwill
items) to adjusted assets (adjusted for goodwill and any other items
deducted from capital to arrive at

<PAGE>

Tier I capital) of at least 3%; provided, however that all institutions, 
other than those (i) receiving the hightest rating during the examination 
process and (ii) not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth, are
required to maintain a ratio of 1% or 2% above the stated minimum, with an
absolute minimum leverage ratio of not less than 4%. The FDIC also requires 
Citizens Savings to have a ratio of Tier II capital (primarily Tier I capital
plus general loss reserves) to risk-weighted assets of least 8%. The NC
Administrator requires a net worth equal to at least 5% of total assets.

At September 30, 1993, Citizens Savings had Tier I capital as a percentage 
of adjusted assets of 7.8%, Tier II capital as a percentage of risk-weighted
assets of 15.3% and total capital as a percentage of total assets of 8.4%.

Pursuant to Section 7 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by 
Section 302 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of
1991 (FIDICA), the FDIC has implemented the Risk-Related Premium System
(RRPS) beginning with the assessment period starting January 1, 1993. In the
RRPS, the FDIC has placed institutions into RRPS capital groups and
supervisory subgroups. Assignment to one of three capital groups, coupled
with assignment to one of three supervisory subgroups, will determine which
of the nine risk classifications is appropriate for an institution. Risk
classifications of institutions, in turn, determine the appropriate premium
rate, ranging from .23% to .31% of domestic deposits. Citizens Savings has
been notified by the FDIC that it will be assessed its insurance premium at a
rate of .23%.

4. Pending Change of Ownership of Citizens Savings Bank

On January 19, 1993 Citizens Savings and BB&T Financial Corporation ("BB&T"),
a registered North Carolina bank holding company headquarted in Wilson, North
Carolina, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and related
Plan of Share Exchange for Aquisition of Shares of Citizens Savings Bank,
SSB, Inc. by BB&T Financial Corporation (the "Agreements") which provided
for the acquisition of Citizens Savings by BB&T through an exchange of all
of the issued and outstanding stock of Citizens for common stock of BB&T (the
"Acquisition").

The Acquisition was completed on October 25, 1993. Shareholders of Citizens 
Savings received .9389 shares of BB&T Financial Corporation common stock for 
each outstanding share of Citizens Savings common stock. All assets and 
liabilities at the merger date became the responsibility of BB&T as of
October 26, 1993.

Home Savings Bank of Albemarle, S.S.B.
Albemarle, North Carolina

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
condition of Home Savings Bank of Albemarle, S.S.B. and subsidiary as of
September 30, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of income,
retained earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Bank's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Home Savings
Bank of Albemarle, S.S.B. and subsidiary as of September 30, 1993 and 1992, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years

HOME SAVINGS BANK OF ALBEMARLE, S.S.B. AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Nature of business:

Home Savings Bank of Albemarle, S.S.B. (the "Bank"), formerly Home
Savings and Loan Association as discussed in Note 16, is primarily
engaged in the business of obtaining savings deposits and originating
single-family residential loans within its primary lending area, the
Stanly County, North Carolina area. The Bank's underwriting policies
require such loans to be made 80% loan-to-value based upon appraised
values unless private mortgage insurance is obtained. These loans are
secured by the underlying properties.

The following is a description of the significant accounting policies 
used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements:

Principles of consolidation:

These financial statements include the accounts of the Bank and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Stanly County Service Corp. The service
corporation is inactive except for income received from its 
investment in the Investors Title Agency partnership. All
significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and cash equivalents:

For purposes of reporting the consolidated statements of cash flows,
the Bank includes cash on hand and demand deposits at other 
financial institutions as cash equivalents. The Bank may have 
deposits with financial institutions which are in excess of the 
federally-insured amounts.

Investment securities:

Bonds and notes are carried at cost, adjusted for premiums and
discounts that are recognized in interest income using a method 
which approximates the interest method over the period to maturity. 
Management has the ability and intends to hold such investments to
maturity. In determining whether securities can be held to maturity,
management considers whether there are conditions, such as liquidity
or regulatory requirements which would impair its ability to hold
such securities.

Equity securities that are nonmarketable are carried at cost. All
other equity securities are carried at the lower of cost or 
estimated market value in the aggregate.
<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Gains and losses on the sale of investment securities are determined
using the specific-identification method.

Mortgage-backed certificates:

Mortgage-backed certificates are stated at cost, adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of fees and discounts using a
method that approximates level yield. The Bank has adequate
liquidity and capital, and it is generally management's intention,
and it has the ability to hold such assets to maturity. Should any
be sold, gains and losses will be recognized based on the
specific-identification method. All sales are made without
recourse.

At September 30, 1993, the Bank had no outstanding commitments to 
sell loans or mortgage-backed certificates.

Loans receivable:

Loans receivable are stated at unpaid principal balances, less the
allowance for loan losses, the undisbursed portion of construction
loans, participations sold and net deferred loan origination fees.

The allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income and
decreased by charge-offs (net of recoveries). Management's periodic
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the Bank's
past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the
portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability
to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, and
current economic conditions.

Loan origination fees:

Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred, 
and the net fee or cost is recognized as an adjustment to interest
income using the interest method over the contractual life of the
loans, adjusted for actual prepayments.

Real estate acquired in settlement of loans:

Real estate acquired in settlement of loans ("REO") is initially
recorded at the lower of cost (loan value of real estate acquired in
settlement of loans plus incidental expenses) or estimated fair 
value.
<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Prior to September 30, 1992, the carrying values were reduced when
they exceeded net realizable value. Subsequent to September 30,
1992, the Bank complied with SOP 92-3, Accounting for Foreclosed
-------------------------
Assets. Subsequent to September 30, 1992, the carrying values of
------
REO are reduced when they exceed fair value minus the estimated
costs to sell. Costs relating to the development and improvement of
the property are capitalized, while holding costs of the property
are charged to expense in the period incurred.

Office properties and equipment:

Office properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation which is computed principally by the straight-line 
method.

Off-balance-sheet risk:

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet
risk such as commitments to extend credit and lines of credit. 
Management assesses the risk related to these instruments for
potential losses on an ongoing basis.

Pension plan:

The Bank has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering
all employees who meet the eligibility requirements. To be 
eligible, an employee must be 21 years of age and have completed 1
year of continuous service. The plan provides benefits based on a
final average salary and service and is integrated with Social
Security. The employee's benefits are subject to certain reductions
if the employee retires before 35 years of service or before
reaching the age of 65. The Bank's funding policy is to make the
maximum annual contribution that is deductible for income tax
purposes.

Income taxes:

The Bank and its subsidiary file a consolidated tax return. 
Deferred income taxes result from timing differences in the
recognition of certain items of income and expense for tax and
financial statement purposes as explained more fully in Note 11.
<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Fair value of financial instruments:

The estimated fair values required under SFAS No. 107, Disclosures
-----------
About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, have been determined by
-----------------------------------------
the Bank using available market information and appropriate
valuation methodologies; however, considerable judgment is required
to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates
presented for the fair value of the Bank's financial instruments are
not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Bank could realize in
a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions
or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
estimated fair market value amounts.

The fair value of the Bank's cash and cash equivalents is estimated
to be equal to their recorded amounts. Investment securities' and
mortgage-backed certificates' fair value is estimated using quoted
market values obtained from independent pricing services. The fair
value of loans is estimated by the use of discounted cash flows
adjusted by a credit risk factor equal to the Bank's recorded loss
allowances. Borrowings and savings deposits, other than deposits
with no stated maturities, are estimated to have a fair value
determined on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The
fair value of deposits with no stated maturities, primarily checking
and statement savings accounts, is estimated to be equal to the
amount payable on demand.

The fair value estimates presented are based on pertinent 
information available to management as of September 30, 1993. 
Although management is not aware of any factors that would
significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts
have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these
financial statements since that date and therefore, current
estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts
presented here.

Note 2. Cash

Noninterest-bearing cash amounting to approximately $47,000, and 
$59,000 was held by a trustee at September 30, 1993 and 1992,
respectively, and was required to be used to repay loan principal and
interest due to the Federal National Mortgage Association and taxes and
insurance for the related loans.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") stock and other securities, which 
consist of stock in the Bank's service center, have been excluded from
the maturity table above because they do not have a contractual maturity
associated with debt securities. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB
system, is required to maintain an investment in capital stock of the
FHLB in an amount equal to the greater of 1% of its outstanding home
loans or 5% of advances from the FHLB. No ready market exists for such
stock, and it has no quoted market value. For presentation purposes,
such stock is assumed to have a market value which is equal to cost.

Note 10. Deferred Compensation Agreements

The Bank has entered into unfunded deferred compensation agreements
providing retirement and death benefits for six directors and 
supplemental retirement and death benefits income agreements for two 
executive officers. Vested benefits under the deferred compensation 
agreements are payable in monthly installments over a 10-year period
upon death or retirement and over a 15-year and 18-year period for the
supplemental income agreements. The present value of the liability for
the benefits is being accrued over the vesting period per the
underlying agreements. The total of the deferred compensation expense
and supplemental income amounted to approximately $-0-, $55,000 and
$72,000 for the years ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

Note 11. Income Taxes

Under the Internal Revenue Code and North Carolina Income Tax Law, the
Bank is allowed a special bad debt deduction related to additions to
tax bad debt reserves established for the purpose of absorbing losses. 
The applicable provisions of the law permit the Bank to deduct from
taxable income an allowance for bad debts based on the greater of 8% of
taxable income before such deduction or actual loss experience. 
Because the Bank does not intend to use the reserve for purposes other
than to absorb losses, deferred income taxes have not been provided.

Retained earnings include approximately $3,957,000 and $3,576,000 at 
September 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively, for which no provision for
federal income taxes has been made. This amount represents allocations
of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only. If the amounts
that qualify as deductions for federal income tax purposes are later
used for purposes other than bad debt losses, or adjustments arising
from carryback of net operating losses, they will be subject to federal
income tax at the then current corporate rate. As discussed in Note
16, the Bank has reached an agreement to provide for the acquisition of
the Bank by BB&T Financial Corporation. In the event of a successful
merger, the retained earnings discussed above will be subject to
federal income taxes.

Income tax consists of the following:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Deferred taxes result from timing differences in the recognition of 
income and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes, primarily
from deferred loan fees, FHLB stock dividends, pension expense, 
deferred compensation and supplemental income expense.

In August 1993, the United States' Congress passed the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993. Although the effects of this new tax 
legislation have not yet been determined, management does not expect 
the impact to be material to the consolidated financial statements 
viewed on an overall basis.

Note 12. Capital Requirements

Prior to its conversion to a North Carolina-chartered savings bank on
October 1, 1992, Home Savings Bank of Albemarle, S.S.B. was subject to 
capital requirements of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). Upon
its conversion to a state savings bank, (as discussed in Note 16) the
Bank ceased to be subject to the OTS capital requirements and became
subject to the capital requirements of the FDIC and the Administrator
of the North Carolina Savings Institutions Division ("the
Administrator").

The FDIC requires Home Savings Bank of Albemarle, S.S.B. to have a 
minimum leverage ratio of Tier I Capital (principally consisting of 
retained earnings and any future common stockholders' equity, less any
intangible assets) to total assets of at least 3%, provided that it
receives the highest rating during the examination process. For
institutions that receive less than the highest rating, the Tier I
capital requirement is 1% to 2% above the stated minimum. The FDIC
also requires the Bank to have a ratio of total capital to
risk-weighted assets of 8%, of which at least 4% must be in the form of
Tier I capital. The FDIC capital requirements are very similar to the
OTS's core capital and risk-based capital requirements, but the FDIC
does not impose tangible capital requirement. The Administrator
requires a net worth equal to at least 5% of total assets.

Note 15. FASB Statements and Proposed Regulations

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued FASB Statement No.
106, Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than 
------------------------------------------------------------
Pensions, which the Bank has not adopted as of September 30, 1993,
--------
relative to postretirement health care, life insurance and other
welfare benefits. The Bank's current accounting policy is in
compliance with paragraph 13 of FASB Statement No. 106 (see Note 10) at
September 30, 1993.

The Statement, which will be in effect for the Bank's fiscal year 
beginning October 1, 1993 will revise the financial accounting and
reporting for an employer that offers certain postretirement benefits
to its employees. This statement is not expected to have a material
effect on the Bank's financial statements.

The FASB has issued Statement No. 109 which has not been adopted by 
the Bank as of September 30, 1993. FASB Statement No. 109 is effective
for the Bank's fiscal year ending September 30, 1994.

FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes 
---------------------------
financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income
taxes that result from an enterprise's activities during the current
and preceding years. It requires an asset and liability approach for
financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. The future effect
on retained earnings of adopting this statement is estimated to be
approximately $485,000 which represents a net deferred tax liability.

In June 1993, the FASB issued SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for
---------------------------
Impairment of Loans, relating to the accounting for impaired loans. 
-------------------
SFAS No. 114 requires that specified impaired loans be measured based
on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
loan's effective interest rate. The effective rate of a loan is
defined as the contractual interest rate adjusted for any deferred loan
fees or costs, premiums or discounts existing at the inception or
acquisition of the loan. Implementation of SFAS No. 114 is required for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. SFAS No. 114 is not
expected to have a material effect on the Bank's results of operations.
<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In June 1993, the FASB issued SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain 
----------------------
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, relating to the accounting
-----------------------------------------
for investments such as debt securities and equity securities which
have a readily determined fair value. Implementation of SFAS No. 115 is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. This
statement classifies securities as either securities that the holder
has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, securities
that were bought with the intention to sell in the near future which
are defined as trading securities, or securities that are available for
sale. Securities that will be held until maturity will be reported at
amortized cost. Securities that are classified as trading securities
will be reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
included in the statement of operations. Securities that are not
classified as held to maturity or trading will be recorded at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and shown
as a component of stockholders' equity. The impact of SFAS No. 115
upon the results of operations of the Bank has not been determined.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) was
enacted on December 19, 1991, and requires the implementation of
uniform accounting standards for all financial institutions that are no
less stringent than generally accepted accounting principles, the
development of a risk-based insurance assessment system (implemented
and effective January 1, 1993), gives the federal banking agencies
broad corrective action powers, additional restrictions on brokered
deposits, and new disclosure requirements for savings accounts, among
many other aspects of the Act.

Note 16. Charter and Stock Conversion

On October 29, 1992, Home Savings and Loan Association of Albemarle 
converted from a state-chartered savings and loan association operating
under Chapter 54B to a state-chartered savings bank under Chapter 54C
of the North Carolina General Statutes. In connection therewith, it
adopted the name of Home Savings Bank of Albemarle, S.S.B.

On May 27, 1993, BB&T Financial Corporation ("BB&T") and the Bank 
reached a definitive agreement providing for BB&T's acquisition of the
Bank contemporaneously with the Bank's conversion from a state mutual
savings bank to a state capital stock savings bank. The acquisition
will be accomplished by the offering of BB&T's common stock. Priority
will be given to eligible members of the Bank in a Subscription
Offering and in a simultaneous Community Offering to residents of
Stanly County, North Carolina. It is currently anticipated that any
shares remaining unsold after the Subscription and Community Offerings
will not be sold in a public offering or otherwise. The net proceeds
from the issuance and sale of BB&T's common stock will be infused as
additional capital for the Bank and as consideration of BB&T's
<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

acquisition of the Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Acquisition and
merger costs of approximately $64,000 are included in prepaids and
other assets and will be netted out of the proceeds. In the event the
acquisition is unsuccessful, these costs will be charged to operations.

The acquisition and conversion are subject to the approval of the 
Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Administrator and the deposit base. 
The acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting which requires that all assets and liabilities of the Bank
be adjusted to their estimated fair value as of the date of the
acquisition. As of September 30, 1993, no significant transactions
between BB&T and the Bank have occurred, nor are any anticipated by
management.

The Plan of Conversion requires that the converted institution 
establish a "Liquidation Account" for the benefit of eligible account
holders. This liquidation account will be assumed by BB&T upon
consummation of the Merger. In the unlikely event of liquidation of
the Bank or BB&T, assets would be first applied against the claims of
all creditors, including claims of all depositors. Any remaining
assets would then be distributed pro rata to eligible account holders
who continue to hold deposits at the Bank and following merger, BB&T.

Note 17. Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet 
risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of
its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to
extend credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements
of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in
the statement of financial position. The contract or notional amounts
of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Bank has in
particular classes of financial instruments.

The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by 
the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend
credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of these
instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making
commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet
instruments.

</TABLE>
<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as 
long as there is no violation of any condition established in the
contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and many require payment of a fee. The total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future requirements,
since some may expire without being drawn upon. The Bank evaluates
each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis.

Note 18. Reclassification of Financial Statements

Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for 1992 have
been reclassified to conform with classifications used in the September
30, 1993 consolidated financial statements. These reclassifications
had no effect on 1992 or 1991 net income or retained earnings.

Note 19. Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of the Bank's cash and cash equivalents, is estimated 
to be equal to its recorded amount. For investment securities and
mortgage-backed certificates, the fair value is estimated using quoted
market values obtained from independent pricing services.

The fair value of loans has been estimated by discounting projected 
cash flows at September 30, 1993, using nationally published rates
including those published by the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. These rates have been adjusted as necessary
to conform with the attributes of the specific loan types in the
portfolio. The valuation has also been adjusted for prepayment risk
using prepayment percentages published by the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Atlanta, which approximate the Bank's estimates of actual prepayment
activity experienced in the portfolio. Nonperforming loans are valued
at their recorded book values, because it is not practicable to
reasonably assess the credit adjustment that would be applied in the
marketplace for such loans. Management believes that the Bank's
general valuation allowances at September 30, 1993 are an appropriate
indication of the applicable credit risk associated with determining
the fair value of its loan portfolio and such allowances have been
deducted from the estimated fair value of loans.

The fair value of deposits with no stated maturities, including 
checking accounts and statement savings accounts, is estimated to be
equal to the amount payable on demand as of September 30, 1993. The
fair value of certificates of deposit is based upon the discounted
value of the contractual cash flows. The discount rates used in these
calculations approximate the current rates offered for deposits of
similar remaining maturities.
<PAGE>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fair value of checks outstanding on disbursement account is 
presumed to be its recorded book value.

The estimated fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated
using fees currently charged for similar arrangements adjusted for 
changes in interest rates and credit risk that has occurred subsequent
to origination. Because the Bank believes that the credit risk
associated with available but undisbursed commitments would essentially
offset fees that could be recognized under similar arrangements, and
because the commitments are either short term in nature or subject to
immediate repricing, no fair value has been assigned to these
off-balance-sheet commitments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

L.S.B. Bancshares, Inc. of South Carolina

NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation -- L.S.B. Bancshares, Inc.
of South Carolina (LSB), a bank holding company, and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, The Lexington State Bank (including its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Carolina Securities Corporation) and The Community Bank of South Carolina,
provide banking services to domestic markets principally in Lexington,
Richland, Beaufort, and Hampton Counties of South Carolina. The consolidated 
financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its 
subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany balances and 
transactions. The accounting and reporting policies of LSB and its subsidiaries 
are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and general 
practices within the banking industry.

Securities -- Investment securities are those securities that management 
acquires with the intent and ability to hold until maturity. Securities chosen 
for investment are selected according to several criteria including current 
funding opportunities, anticipated cash flow needs, analysis of overall expected
net yield and pledging requirements. Investment securities are stated at cost, 
increased by accretion of discounts and decreased by amortization of premiums 
using the interest method. The gain or loss recognized on the sale of an 
investment security is based on the adjusted cost of the specific certificate on
a trade date basis.

Trading account securities, primarily debt securities, are those securities that
have been purchased for resale. The carrying amounts for trading account 
securities are adjusted to estimated fair value. Realized and unrealized gains 
and losses resulting from such adjustments, and from recording the effects of 
sales of trading account securities, are recognized in noninterest income on a 
trade date basis.

Other investments include shares in mutual funds which are stated at the lower 
of aggregate cost or estimated fair value. Unrealized losses on mutual funds are
recorded directly in a separate stockholders' equity account. Realized gains or 
losses are determined using the specific identification method and are reflected
in income on a trade date basis.

Interest and Fees on Loans -- Interest income on installment loans is generally 
recognized using the sum-of-the-months digits method. The results of using this 
method were not materially different from those obtained by using the interest 
method. Interest income on all other loans is recognized using the interest 
method based upon the principal amounts outstanding. Loan origination and 
commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs (principally salaries 
and employee benefits) are being deferred and amortized as an adjustment of the 
related loan yields. Generally, these amounts are being amortized over the 
contractual life of the related loans or commitments.

When a loan is 90 days past due as to interest or principal or there is serious 
doubt as to collectibility, the accrual of interest income is generally 
discontinued unless the estimated net realizable value of collateral is 
sufficient to assure collection of the principal balance and accrued interest. 
Previously accrued interest on loans placed in a nonaccrual status is reversed 
against current income, and subsequent interest income is recognized when 
received. When the collectibility of a significant amount of principal is in 
serious doubt, the principal balance is reduced to the estimated net realizable 
value of collateral by charge-off to the allowance for loan losses and any
subsequent payments are credited to the outstanding principal balance until the
loan is repaid; then, such payments are credited to the allowance for loan
losses as recoveries. A nonaccrual loan is not returned to accrual status unless
principal and interest are current and the borrower has demonstrated the ability
to continue making payments as agreed. 

Allowance for Loan Losses -- An allowance for possible loan losses is maintained
at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide adequately for known and 
inherent risks in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based upon a continuing 
review of past loan loss experience, current economic conditions which may 
affect the borrowers' ability to pay the underlying collateral value of the 
loans. When it is determined that a loan will not perform substantially as 
agreed, a review of the loan is initiated to ascertain whether it is more likely
than not that a loss has occurred. If it is determined that a loss is likely, 
the estimated loss amount is charged off and deducted from the allowance. The 
provision for possible loan losses and recoveries on loans previously charged 
off are added to the allowance.

<PAGE>

Premises and Equipment -- Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less 
accumulated depreciation and amortization. The provision for depreciation and 
amortization is computed by using the straight-line method. Rates of 
depreciation are generally based on the following estimated useful lives: 
buildings - 33 to 40 years; furniture and equipment - 3 to 15 years; leasehold 
improvements - 3 to 10 years.

Other Real Estate -- Other real estate includes properties acquired through 
foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and loans accounted 
for as in-substance foreclosures. Collateral is considered foreclosed in 
substance when the borrower has little or no equity in its current fair value, 
proceeds for repayment of the related loan can be expected to come only from the
operation or sale of the collateral, and the borrower has either formally or 
effectively abandoned control of the collateral to LSB or has retained control 
but it is doubtful that the borrower can rebuild equity or otherwise repay the 
loan in the foreseeable future. Other real estate is initially recorded at the 
lower of cost or the estimated fair market value less estimated selling costs.

Loan losses arising from the acquisition of such property and in recognition of 
in-substance foreclosures are charged to the allowance for loan losses. An 
allowance for losses on other real estate is maintained for subsequent downward 
valuation adjustments.

Employee Benefit Plans -- LSB sponsors a trusteed non-contributory defined
benefit pension plan covering substantially all officers and employees meeting
certain age and service requirements. The benefits are based on years of
service and compensation during the five consecutive calendar years that
produces the highest average level of annual compensation within the last ten
years of participation. It is LSB's policy to find an amount between the
minimum funding amount required by ERISA and the maximum tax deductible
contribution. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the
future.

LSB also provides a trusteed profit-sharing plan which provides retirement and 
other benefits to substantially all officers and employees who meet certain age 
and service requirements. The plan includes a "salary reduction" feature 
pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan and 
present policies, participants are permitted to make discretionary contributions
up to 10% of annual compensation. LSB makes marching contributions of 50% of 
each participants contributions until the participant's contributions reach 6%
of annual compensation.

In December 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." 
This Statement requires the implementation, no later than 1993, of new 
accounting and disclosure rules for benefits other than pensions, such as 
postretirement health care programs. In addition, Statement No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," was issued in November 1992, by the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board. Statement No. 112 requires, no later than 
1994, the implementation of new accounting and disclosure rules for 
postemployment benefits such as payments to employees for disability, layoff, or
other event. LSB and its subsidiaries do not sponsor any postretirement 
benefits, nor are any material postemployment benefits provided. Therefore, the 
new requirements are not expected to have any material effect on the 
consolidated financial position or results of operations of LSB.

Income Taxes -- Amounts provided for income taxes are based on income reported
for financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes are provided for timing 
differences between the period in which certain income and expense items are 
recognized for financial reporting purposes and the period in which they affect 
taxable income.

Earnings Per Share -- Earnings per share is calculated using the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the year.

Statement of Cash Flows -- The statement of cash flows reports net cash
provided or used by operating, investing and financing activities and the net
effect of those flows on cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include
amounts due from banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreements to recall.

During 1992, 1991 and 1990, interest paid on deposits, short-term borrowings and
long-term debt amounted to $20,653,000, $26,777,000, and $28,639,000, 
respectively. Income tax payments of $2,257,000, $1,599,000, and $759,000 were 
made in 1992, 1991 and 1990, respectively.

<PAGE>

Fair Value Estimates -- Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in 
time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These 
estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering
for sale at one time LSB's entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.
Because no active trading market exists for a significant portion of LSB's 
financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on management's judgments 
regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk 
characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These 
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of 
significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes 
in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

Fair value estimates are based on existing on-and-off-balance sheet financial 
instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future 
business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered 
financial instruments. For example, LSB has a substantial trust department that 
contributes net fee income annually. The trust department is not a financial 
instrument, and its value has not been considered into the fair value estimates.
Other significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial 
assets or liabilities include net deferred tax assets, premises and equipment 
and intangible assets. In addition, the income tax ramifications related to the 
realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on 
fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

For cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
agreements to resell, accrued interest receivable and payable and short-term 
borrowings, the carrying amount approximates fair value because these 
instruments generally mature in 90 days or less and do not present unanticipated
credit concerns.

NOTE 2 -- BRANCH ACQUISITION

On May 7, 1992, LSB's subsidiary, The Community Bank of South Carolina, acquired
substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities
of three branch offices in Beaufort, South Carolina which formerly belonged to 
NationsBank of South Carolina, NA. The transaction was accounted for using the 
purchase method. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect the 
results of operations and the assets and liabilities of the acquired offices 
since the date of acquisition. The pro forma effect of this transaction on the 
consolidated operations of LSB is not material.

The principal assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the purchase are 
summarized below.

</TABLE> 

The intangible value of core deposits represents the estimated net present value
of the future economic benefits related to use of the deposits purchased. Such 
amount is being amortized in proportion to the estimated annual benefit to be 
derived over a period not to exceed fifteen years.

NOTE 3 -- CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS

The banking subsidiaries are required by regulation to maintain average cash 
reserve balances based on a percentage of deposits. The average amounts of the 
cash reserve balances at December 31, 1992 and 1991 were approximately 
$13,000,000 and $12,971,000, respectively.

The fair value of investment securities, except certain obligations of states 
and political subdivisions, is estimated based on published closing quotations 
or dealers' quotes. The fair value of certain obligations of states and 
political subdivisions is not readily available from market sources other than 
dealer quotations; consequently, fair value estimates are based on quoted market
prices of similar instruments, adjusted for differences between the quoted 
instruments and the instruments being valued.

<PAGE>

interest income that would have been recorded if nonaccrual loans had been in 
accordance with their original terms amounted to $322,000, $430,000 and $428,000
for the years ended December 31, 1992, 1991 and 1990, respectively. Recognized 
interest income on these loans was $102,000, $252,000 and $206,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1992, 1991 and 1990, respectively. There were no outstanding 
commitments at December 31, 1992, to lend additional funds to debtors owing 
nonaccrual loans.

Fair values are estimated for loan categories with similar financial 
characteristics. Within each category, the fair value of loans is calculated by 
discounting estimated cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated 
market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in
the loan. For certain categories of loans, such as variable rate loans, credit 
card receivables, and other lines of credit, the carrying amount, adjusted for 
credit risk, is a reasonable estimate of fair value because there is no 
contractual maturity or because LSB has the ability to reprice the loans as 
interest rate shifts occur. Since the discount rates are based on current loan 
rates offered as well as management's estimates, the fair values presented may
not necessarily be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale.

Transactions in the allowance for loan losses are summarized below:

</TABLE> 

As of December 31, 1992, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk
in any single borrower or groups of borrowers. The loan portfolio consists of 
extensions of credit to businesses and individuals principally in Lexington, 
Richland, Beaufort and Hampton Counties of South Carolina. Approximately 82% of 
LSB's loans were made in the Lexington-Richland County area, 12% in the Hampton 
County area, and 6% in the Beaufort County area. The economy of the 
Lexington-Richland County area is diversified and the area is a major center of 
state and county government, banking, insurance, manufacturing, service 
industries and higher education. Beaufort County's economy is influenced by 
tourism, the Paris Island Marine Depot and Training Center, retail businesses 
and agriculture. The county is increasingly attracting retirees to live in its 
coastal area. Hampton County is a rural area whose economy consists primarily of
agriculture, timber and wood products, and plastics industries. LSB's management
has established loan policies and practices that include set limitations on 
loan-to-collateral value for various types of collateral, requirements for 
appraisals, obtaining and maintaining current credit and financial information 
to borrowers, and credit approvals.

NOTE 7 -- PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

NOTE 10 -- SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

Short-term borrowings payable were:

</TABLE> 

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
generally mature on a one to thirty-one day basis. At December 31, 1992 and
1991, the combined weighted average interest rates related to Federal funds
purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase were 2.96% and
3.77%, respectively. At December 31, 1992 and 1991, the interest rates on
interest bearing notes issued to the U.S. Treasury were 2.85% and 4.02%,
respectively.

At December 31, 1992, the banking subsidiaries had unused short-term lines of 
credit to purchase federal funds from unrelated banks totaling $18,500,000. 
These lines of credit are available on a one to seven day basis for general 
corporate purposes of the banks. All of the lenders have reserved the right to 
withdraw these lines at their option.

NOTE 11--LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt consisted of the following:

until annual principal installments of $1,000,000
begin in 1996 with final maturity in 1999.............. $4,000 $2,000
======== ========
</TABLE> 

As of December 31, 1992, the carrying amount of LSB's long-term debt 
approximates fair value because the interest rate on such debt reprices 
immediately with changes in the lender's prime rate, and management is not aware
of any significant change in the credit risk associated with the debt.

Future debt maturities are as follows:

------
Total............................ $4,000
======
</TABLE> 

Interest on the subordinated note fluctuates at 97% of the lender's prime rate 
with LSB having certain options to fix the interest rate. The note is 
subordinate to the claims of depositors. In a related loan agreement, LSB has 
agreed to certain covenants including: maintenance of specified amounts of net 
worth; minimum ratios of capital adequacy, income to average assets and income 
to average equity; a maximum ratio of loans to deposits; maximum ratios of 
problem loans and other problem assets to total loans, and that ratios of the 
allowance for loan losses to problem loans and other problem assets be 
maintained above prescribed levels. The loan agreement also restricts the 
disposition of subsidiaries' common stock, the pledging of certain assets to 
secure indebtedness, additional borrowings, and the payment of cash dividends. 
Under the provisions of the loan agreement, $5,769,000 of consolidated retained 
earnings are available for cash dividends after December 31, 1992, provided that
such payments would not thereafter cause net worth and ratios of capital 
adequacy to decrease below the specified levels. LSB was in compliance with each
of the covenants as of December 31, 1992.

<PAGE>

NOTE 12 -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Sale of Common Stock -- As of July 14, 1992, LSB registered 200,000 shares of
its authorized but unissued common stock for sale through its Dividend
Reinvestment and Shareholder Stock Purchase Plan. Under this new plan, LSB is
offering all holders of its common stock the opportunity to reinvest
automatically their cash dividends in shares of common stock, and to invest up
to $1,000 in cash contributions per calendar quarter to purchase additional
shares. The price paid for shares purchased through the plan is the bid price
of the common stock reported on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market on the
trading day preceding the date an investment is made. Prior to this plan, a
dividend reinvestment plan was in effect that permitted only the reinvestment
of cash dividends to purchase shares. Shares issued under the Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase plan generally are newly issued shares. 
However, LSB may purchase shares for participants in the open market.

Following is a summary of the activity in the aforementioned plans:

Income tax expense related to investment security gains was $92,000, $68,000, 
and $16,000 for 1992, 1991, and 1990 respectively.

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires a change in the method of 
accounting primarily for deferred income taxes. LSB has elected to adopt the new
accounting rule as of January 1, 1993, without restatement of prior periods. The
effects of adopting Statement No. 109 as of the adoption date have been 
calculated and found by management to have no material adverse or beneficial 
effect on consolidated financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 17--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Commitments--In the normal course of business, LSB's banking subsidiaries are 
parties to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. These financial 
instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and 
securities lent, and have elements of credit risk in excess of the amount 
recognized in the balance sheet. The exposure to credit loss in the event of 
nonperformance by the other parties to these financial instruments is 
represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. Generally, 
the same credit policies used for on-balance-sheet instruments, such as loans, 
are used in extending commitments, standby letters of credit, and securities 
lent.

Following are the off-balance-sheet financial instruments whose contract amounts
represent credit risk:

</TABLE>
<TABLE> 
<CAPTION> 
December 31,
----------------------
1992 1991
-------- --------
(Dollars in thousands)
<S> <C> <C> 
Loan commitments............................. $60,291 $44,891
Standby letters of credit.................... 1,751 2,144
Securities lent.............................. 8,059
</TABLE> 

Loan commitments involve agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally 
have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and some involve 
payment of a fee. Many of the commitments are expected to expire without being 
fully drawn; therefore, the total amount of loan commitments does not 
necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness
is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if 
any, upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the 
borrower. Collateral held varies but may include commercial and residential real
properties, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments to guarantee the 
performance of a customer to a third party. All of the standby letters of credit
expire within 1993. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of 
credit is the same as that involved in making loan commitments to customers. As 
of December 31, 1992 and 1991, approximately $499,000 and $286,000, 
respectively, of the standby letters of credit were unsecured. Collateral for 
secured standby letters of credit varies but may include commercial and 
residential real properties, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, 
marketable securities and certificates of deposit. Since most of the letters of 
credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts do 
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

Securities lent represent customer securities lent to third parties. LSB's 
banking subsidiaries assume credit risk on these instruments by indemnifying the
customer against the borrower's failure to return the securities. To minimize 
this risk, the banking subsidiaries evaluate the creditworthiness of the 
borrower on a case-by-case basis, and collateral with a market value exceeding
100% of the contract amount of securities lent is obtained.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 requires the discosure of 
the estimated fair values of off-balance-sheet financial instruments for which 
it is practicable to estimate fair value. The estimated fair values of such 
off-balance-sheet financial instruments are generally based upon fees charged to
enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the 
agreements and the counterparties' creditworthiness. The vast majority of LSB's 
loan commitments do not involve the charging of a fee, and the fees associated 
with outstanding standby letters of credit and securities lent are not material.
Therefore, as of December 31, 1992, the estimated fair value of LSB's 
off-balance-sheet financial instruments is nominal. For loan commitments and 
standby letters of credit, the committed interest rates are either variable or 
approximate current interest rates offered for similar commitments. Management 
is not aware of any significant change in the credit risk associated with these 
commitments. Securities lent positions mature on a demand basis and do not 
present unanticipated credit concerns.

Contingent Liabilities--LSB and its subsidiaries are, from time to time, 
involved as defendants in various legal proceedings arising in the normal 
course of business. As of December 31, 1992, one of LSB's subsidiaries banks was
named as a defendant in a lawsuit in which the plaintiff seeks damages arising 
from the bank's repossession and foreclosure of collateral securing a loan. 
Management believes that the bank has meritorious defenses available

<PAGE>

and intends to vigorously contest this lawsuit. Although the amount of any 
ultimate liability with respect to this matter cannot be determined with 
certainty, in the opinion of management and legal counsel, these proceedings 
will not have a material adverse effect on LSB's consolidated financial
position. Management and legal counsel are not aware of any other pending or
threatened litigation, or unasserted claims or assessments that could result in
losses, if any, that would be material to the consolidated financial
statements.

NOTE 18--RESTRICTIONS ON SUBSIDIARY DIVIDENDS, LOANS OR ADVANCES

South Carolina banking regulations restrict the amount of dividends that can be 
paid to stockholders. All of the banking subsidiaries' dividends to LSB are
subject to the prior approval of the Commissioner of Banking and are payable 
only from their undivided profits. At December 31, 1992, the banking 
subsidiaries' undivided profits totaled $16,505,000. Under Federal Reserve Board
regulations, the amounts of loans or advances from the banking subsidiaries to 
the parent company are also restricted.

NOTE 19--LEASING

The annual minimum rental commitments under the terms of noncancelable operating
leases as of December 31, 1992, are as follows:

Rental expense for all operating leases was $63,000, $265,000, and $278,000 for 
the years ended December 31, 1992, 1991 and 1990, respectively. Some leases 
provide for the payment of executory costs and contain options to renew.

NOTE 20--LOANS TO RELATED PARTIES

Certain executive officers and directors of the consolidated companies, their 
immediate families and business interests were loan customers of, and had other 
transactions in the normal course of business with, the banking subsidiaries. 
Related party loans are made on substantially the same terms, including interest
rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable 
transactions with unrelated persons and do not involve more than normal risk of 
collectibility. The aggregate dollar amount of these loans was $2,977,000 and 
$2,962,000 at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively. During 1992, $1,473,000 
of new loans were made and repayments totaled $1,458,000.

NOTE 21--PENDING TRANSACTION

LSB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Agreement), as amended, dated 
November 10, 1992 whereby LSB will exchange previously unissued shares of its 
authorized common stock for all of the 20,000 outstanding common shares of The 
Dorn Banking Company (Dorn), McCormick, South Carolina. Dorn provides banking 
services to domestic markets principally in McCormick and Greenwood Counties of 
South Carolina. Under the terms of the Agreement, Dorn will be merged into LSB's
subsidiary, The Lexington State Bank. The proposed business combination is 
expected to be accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method.

<PAGE>

Under terms of the Agreement, 418,944 shares of LSB common stock will be 
exchanged for the 20,000 outstanding shares of Dom. Therefore, the exchange 
ratio is 20.95 shares of LSB common stock for one share of Dom common stock. 
The agreement is subject to approval by the stockholders of Dom and by 
regulatory authorities. The Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the effective date of the merger by the mutual consent of the LSB and Dom Boards
of Directors, or by either party should material adverse changes occur in the 
business of the other party.

The following table presents selected consolidated financial data for LSB and 
Dom on an historical basis and on a pro forma combined basis:
