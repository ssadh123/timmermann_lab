AmSouth reports record performance
for fourth quarter and 1993

BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, JANUARY 19, 1994 -- AmSouth Bancorporation reported
record net income for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 1993 of
$38.1 million and $146.2 million respectively. These amounts on a per share
basis were 80 cents for the quarter and $3.10 for the 12 months, and represent
increases over the same periods of the previous year of 35.0 percent and 35.3
percent respectively.

The net income on a per share basis for the year reflects the restatement
of AmSouth's earnings for the first three quarters of 1993 to include the
historical performance of the institutions merged in pooling-of-interests
transactions in the fourth quarter. The sum of AmSouth's originally reported
quarterly earnings for 1993 was $3.19 per share.

"The quarter just completed marks the 12th consecutive quarter of record
level earnings and the best overall yearly performance in the company's
history," stated John W. Woods, AmSouth's chairman and CEO. "Each of our major
lines of business experienced increased earnings in 1993, while our credit
quality and capital positions continued to strengthen."

AmSouth's performance resulted from improved profitability as return on
average assets reached 1.28 percent and return on average shareholders' equity
was 14.93 percent for 1993. The corporation's total assets at year-end
increased to a record $12.5 billion, an increase of 22.9 percent over year-end
1992.

AmSouth's gross interest spread for the fourth quarter of 1993 was 4.45
percent compared to 4.44 percent originally reported in the third quarter. For
the year the gross interest spread declined to 4.55 percent from the 4.72
percent restated for the previous year. This was primarily the result of
general asset repricing in the lower interest rate environment during the year. 
At the same time, noninterest revenues in 1993 increased 18.3 percent from the
levels restated for 1992.

AmSouth made significant progress towards improving its efficiency and
productivity during 1993. Employment was reduced in existing operations by
approximately 430 positions through an early retirement program and normal
attrition. Further reductions are anticipated upon completion of the company's
Productivity Improvement Project by year-end 1994. The total annualized cost
savings in personnel related expenses are estimated to exceed $20 million.

The year was particularly eventful in terms of acquisitions, according to
Woods. On February 1, AmSouth completed the acquisition of First Chattanooga
Financial Corporation, which ranks second in market share in the greater
Chattanooga area. The First National Bank of Clearwater and First Gulf Bank in
St. Petersburg were merged into AmSouth Bank of Florida in mid-October and were
followed December 9 by Mid-State Federal Savings Bank headquartered in Ocala.
<PAGE>

First Sunbelt Bankshares, parent company of The Georgia State Bank of Rome,
was merged by AmSouth Bancorporation in mid-December, and Orange Banking
Corporation, parent company of Orange Bank headquartered in Orlando was acquired
January 3, 1994. These two banks will be merged into AmSouth Bank of Georgia
and AmSouth Bank of Florida respectively during the first half of 1994.

Other pending Florida acquisitions include Fortune Bank headquartered in
Clearwater, FloridaBank in Jacksonville, Parkway Bank in Ft. Myers and Citizens
National Bank in Naples. The acquisition of First Federal Savings Bank in
Calhoun, Georgia also is pending. AmSouth anticipates completing all pending
acquisitions by mid-year 1994.

When pending acquisitions are completed, AmSouth Bancorporation will have
assets approaching $17 billion and will operate more than 300 banking offices in
four states.

"We look forward to the challenges of 1994. The keys to our continued
success will be the smooth integration of our remaining acquisitions, a
commitment to quality loan growth, further development and strengthening of our
noninterest revenues and improved productivity," Woods remarked.

At year-end 1993, AmSouth Bancorporation operated 147 banking offices in
Alabama, 64 offices in Florida, 20 offices in Tennessee and two in Georgia. 
Bank-related affiliates include AmSouth Mortgage Company, Inc. with 44 mortgage
originating offices in nine Southeastern states, AmSouth Investment Services,
Inc., and AmSouth Leasing Corporation.

Performance Analysis

The gross interest margin for the fourth quarter of 1993 exceeded
originally reported amounts for the third quarter of 1993 by $7.4 million,
primarily due to the acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter. The
gross interest spread for the fourth quarter was 4.45 percent, or one basis
point higher than the gross spread originally reported for the third quarter. 
Asset yield decline was offset by a higher incidence of loan fees and deposit
pricing improvement.

Loan growth for the fourth quarter compared to originally reported amounts
for third quarter was $934 million, of which $732 million is attributable to
the acquisitions.

The provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter totaled $4.6 million
compared to a negative $469,000 provision for loan losses originally reported
for the third quarter. The fourth quarter amount represents a more normalized
level of net charge offs of 28 basis points. Credit quality and coverage ratios
remain strong. As of December 31, 1993, nonperforming assets as a percent of
loans totaled 0.92 percent compared to 0.93 percent originally reported at the
end of the third quarter and 1.43 percent originally reported at December 31,
1992. Allowance for loan losses as a percent of nonperforming loans equaled
245.8 percent at December 31, 1993, compared to 263.0 percent originally
reported at September 30, 1993.

Noninterest revenues for the fourth quarter were up $7.3 million over
originally reported amounts for the three months ended September 30, 1993.

Noninterest expenses increased $6.7 million over originally reported third
quarter amounts primarily due to acquisitions. Approximately $3.6 million of
nonrecurring merger-related expenses were recorded in the fourth quarter.
