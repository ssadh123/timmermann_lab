QUAKER STATE TO SELL HERITAGE INSURANCE GROUP TO GE CAPITAL

OIL CITY, PA, May 10, 1994 --Quaker State Corporation and GE Capital
today announced they are negotiating an agreement for the sale of Quaker
State's wholly owned Heritage Insurance Group subsidiary to GE Capital for
approximately $85 million. It is hoped that a definitive agreement will be
signed shortly.

Under the agreement, GE Capital would acquire 100 percent of the stock
in Heritage. The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, would be
expected to close in the third quarter of this year.

Herbert M. Baum, Quaker State's chairman and chief executive officer,
said, "Heritage has been a valuable part of the Quaker State portfolio since
1984, however, on a long-term basis it does not fit our lubricants and
lubricant services strategy. We plan to reinvest the proceeds of this sale in
opportunities that better support this strategy."

Edward D. Stewart, executive vice president of GE Capital, said,
"Heritage provides an attractive platform to extend GE Capital's existing risk
management capabilities and expand the array of insurance products and services
we offer in the market, especially in the area of vehicle service contracts."

Heritage operates in 49 states, offering credit life and health
insurance, specialty indemnity coverage for auto and consumer products, and
service contract reimbursement insurance for auto dealers through a network of
independent insurance professionals.

Quaker State Corporation is principally a producer of branded motor oil
and lubricants and a marketer of products and services in the automotive
aftermarket. Subsidiaries provide efficient and inexpensive fast lube services,
produce natural gas and crude oil, and manufacture safety lighting equipment
for cars and trucks.

GE Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric Company, is a
diversified financial services company headquartered in Stamford, CT. GE
Capital's activities include equipment management, mid-market financing,
specialized financing, specialty insurance and consumer services. GE is a
diversified manufacturing, technology and services company with operations
worldwide.
