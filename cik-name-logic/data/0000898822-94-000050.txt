FIRST QUARTER REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS
For the Quarter Ending March 31, 1994

For Release: April 29, 1994

HECLA REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho -- Hecla Mining Company (HL & 
HL-B:NYSE) reported a net loss Friday of $5.7 million on 
revenue of $27.7 million for the first quarter of 1994. After 
a $2 million dividend to preferred shareholders, the company's 
loss for the 1994 quarter amounted to $7.7 million, or 19 cents 
per common share. First quarter results were adversely 
affected by approximately $2.2 million in nonrecurring merger-
related costs resulting from the acquisition of Equinox 
Resources Ltd. completed in March 1994 and initial start-up 
costs totaling $1.7 million at the new La Choya gold mine in 
Mexico. The loss compares with $5.5 million, or 15 cents per 
common share, for the same period in 1993.

Hecla's Chairman Arthur Brown said, "With expenses 
related to the acquisition of Equinox and the start-up of La 
Choya behind us, we expect improved earnings in the remainder 
of 1994." Brown said he's also encouraged by a report that a 
silver shortage exists which bodes well for future silver 
prices. He noted, "New discoveries of silver ore at the Gold 
Hunter and Greens Creek mines place Hecla in a position to 
significantly expand its silver production in the future." 
Brown added, "With production commencing this year at Hecla's 
new La Choya and Grouse Creek gold operations, the company 
expects to more than double its gold production."

In February, the company officially opened its first 
operation outside the United States and Canada. The La Choya 
gold mine is located approximately 30 miles south of the U.S. 
border in the state of Sonora, Mexico. La Choya is an open 
pit, heap leach mine with a carbon recovery plant. Exploration 
activities at La Choya have expanded proven and probable 
reserves to 6.7 million tons grading .037 ounce of gold per 
ton, or 244,300 contained ounces. The new reserves have 
extended the mine life from approximately 2-1/2 to four years. 
Production at La Choya is expected to be 50,000 ounces of gold 
in 1994. At full production, the mine is expected to produce 
63,000 ounces of gold annually.

Also in Mexico, Hecla opened a processing plant on 
March 12 to produce ball clay and kaolin slurries. Hecla's K-T 
Clay de Mexico S.A. de C.V. is located near Monterrey in the 
state of Nuevo Leon. The facility represents a $6.9 million 
capital investment for the company.

On March 11, 1994, Hecla completed its acquisition of 
Equinox Resources Ltd. The key assets acquired are the Rosebud 
gold project in Pershing County, Nevada, and a 47 percent 
joint-venture interest in the American Girl gold mine in Impe-
rial County, California. As of December 31, 1993, the Rosebud 
deposit contained 512,000 ounces of proven and probable gold 
reserves and has significant exploration and development 
potential. Hecla intends to develop the Rosebud gold project 
upon satisfactory completion of a feasibility study which is 
expected to be finalized by late-1995. Construction could 
begin shortly thereafter, with production commencing as early 
as the fourth quarter of 1996. The feasibility study will 
assess the property's potential to produce between 70,000 and 
80,000 ounces of gold annually.

Hecla's share of the 1994 production from the Ameri-
can Girl mine will be approximately 30,000 ounces of gold. The 
mine has sufficient ore reserves to last until mid-1995, when 
mining is expected to start at the adjacent Oro Cruz gold 
project. Both are managed by MK Gold through a joint-venture 
arrangement. The Equinox acquisition also brings Hecla nearly 
30 other exploration projects, most of which are being explored 
by joint-venture partners in the United States, Canada and 
Bolivia.

Hecla Mining Company has its headquarters in Coeur 
d'Alene, Idaho. During its 103-year history, Hecla has been a 
leading U.S. producer of silver and lead, and more recently, a 
significant supplier of gold and industrial minerals.
