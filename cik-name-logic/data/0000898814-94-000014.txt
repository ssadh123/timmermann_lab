ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

H. F. Ahmanson & Company (the "Company"), the parent company
of Home Savings of America, FSB ("Home Savings"), reported net income of
$28.5 million, or $.14 per fully diluted common share, for the quarter
ended December 31, 1993 compared to $15.5 million, or $0.10 per fully
diluted common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 1992. For the
year ended December 31, 1993, the Company reported a net loss of
$159.6 million, or $1.69 per fully diluted common share, which was
largely attributable to bulk sales in the first and second quarters of
$1.3 billion of delinquent loans and additions to reserves. In 1992,
the Company had net earnings of $204.1 million, or $1.60 per fully
diluted common share. The Company's results in the quarter and year
ended December 31, 1993 included several nonrecurring items, including
an extraordinary charge of $21.6 million resulting from the early
retirement of approximately $325 million of Home Savings' 10-1/4%
Subordinated Notes due December 5, 1996.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Net interest income in the fourth
quarter of 1993 was $318.8 million, compared to $336.3 million in the
fourth quarter of 1992. The average effective net spread was 2.75% in
the fourth quarter of 1993, compared to 2.98% in the fourth quarter of
1992. The decline in net interest income was largely attributable to a
reserve of $17.8 million established for the cancellation of certain
interest rate swaps and recorded as a reduction to interest income on
loans in December 1993 due to the early prepayment of related loans. In
addition, a narrowing of the net interest margin contributed to the
decline in net interest income. Net interest income for the year ended
December 31, 1993 totaled $1.34 billion, compared to $1.36 billion in
1992. For the year ended December 31, 1993, the average effective net
spread was 2.90%, compared to 3.02% in 1992. The reserve for
cancellation of certain interest rate swaps had the effect of reducing
the average effective net spread by 15 basis points in fourth quarter of
1993 and four basis points for all of 1993. For purposes of Home
Savings' Thrift Financial Report to the Office of Thrift Supervision,
however, interest adjustments related to interest rate swaps are
included in interest expense and the reserve therefore had the effect of
increasing Home Savings' average cost of interest-bearing liabilities
reported on that basis by 45 basis points for the month of
December 1993.

During the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company provided $47.9
million for possible loan losses. During the year ended December 31,
1993, the Company provided $575.0 million.

Other income increased $14.3 million in the fourth quarter of
1993 from the amount reported in the fourth quarter of 1992 and
decreased $111.9 million in the year ended December 31, 1993 from the
amount reported in 1992. The increase in the fourth quarter was
primarily attributable to the settlement of a lawsuit and sale of the
Company's credit card operations, offset by a charge of $34.4 million to
strengthen reserves for real estate development operations, principally
for two commercial projects in Northern California. The reduction in
other income for the year was attributable to increases in the reserves
for real estate development operations.

Other expenses increased in the fourth quarter and the year
ended December 31, 1993 due mainly to the costs associated with
disposition of foreclosed properties, certain restructuring costs, and
the costs of additional personnel necessary to administer delinquent
real estate loans. General and administrative expenses as a percentage
of average assets were 1.76% in the fourth quarter of 1993 and 1.66% for
the year ended December 31, 1993. In addition, in the fourth quarter of
1993, as part of its restructuring efforts, the Company wrote off
$12.4 million in goodwill associated with its operations in Ohio.

ASSET QUALITY. At December 31, 1993, nonperforming assets
totaled $960.3 million, or 1.89% of total assets, as compared to $2.2
billion, or 4.61% of total assets, as of December 31, 1992. Troubled
debt restructurings totaled $100.8 million at December 31, 1993.

Net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 1993 totaled
$52.1 million and were $590.7 million for all of 1993 (including
$378.1 million related to bulk sales of nonperforming loans). The loan
loss reserve was $438.8 million at December 31, 1993. The reserve for
foreclosed real estate was $66.5 million at December 31, 1993. The
reserves for losses on nonperforming assets equaled 49.2% of
nonperforming assets at December 31, 1993, compared to 21.2% at December
31, 1992.

During the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company sold
$200.8 million of foreclosed properties, comprised of $124.6 million of
single-family residences and $76.2 million of major properties. During
the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company sold $831.3 million of
foreclosed real estate, comprised of $591.8 million of single-family
residences, and $239.5 million of major properties. At December 31,
1993, the Company had $179.9 million in foreclosed properties, compared
to $453 million at December 31, 1992.

Real estate development assets, net of reserves, totaled
$443.7 million at December 31, 1993, compared to $674.3 million at
December 31, 1992. The reserves for real estate development operations
totaled $341.7 million, or 43.5% of gross real estate assets, at
December 31, 1993, compared to $154.7 million, or 18.7% of gross real
estate assets, at December 31, 1992.

The Company originated $3.6 billion in loans in the fourth
quarter of 1993, compared to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 1992.
Mortgage loan originations totaled $11.6 billion in 1993. In addition,
the Company purchased $1 billion of adjustable rate mortgages ("ARMs")
in the first quarter of 1993. Of total loan originations in 1993, 86%
were single family mortgages and 77% were ARMs. Mortgage refinances
accounted for 60.5% of the Company's total loan originations in 1993.

CAPITAL. Throughout 1993, the Company took several steps to
improve its capital position. In February, the Company sold
approximately $195 million of its Depositary Shares, representing
interests in the Company's 8.40% Series C Preferred Stock The net
proceeds of the Series C Preferred Stock offering were contributed to
Home Savings as equity. In August, the Company issued $287.5 million of
its Depositary Shares, representing interests in the Company's 6% Series
D Preferred Stock. The Company contributed $141 million of the net
proceeds of Series D Preferred Stock offering to Home Savings. In
November, Home Savings issued $250 million of 6% Subordinated Notes due
November 1, 2000 to replace, in part, the approximately $325 million of
10-1/4% Subordinated Notes due December 5, 1996 that were retired early.

Home Savings exceeds all current and fully phased-in federal
capital requirements. The capital ratios of Home Savings of America at
December 31, 1993, were:

</TABLE>

At December 31, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, resulting in an increase in
the Company's equity of $21.5 million.

The Company is presently communicating with borrowers and has
sent lending personnel and appraisers into the area damaged by the
earthquake that struck California on January 17, 1994. However, it is
still too early to assess the extent of possible loss.
