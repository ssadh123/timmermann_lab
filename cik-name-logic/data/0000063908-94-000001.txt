McDONALD'S ANNOUNCES $1 BILLION COMMON STOCK BUYBACK

Oak Brook, IL -- McDonald's Corporation announced today that it

plans to purchase up to $1 billion of its common stock within the next

three years, primarily from excess cash flow.

Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Jack M. Greenberg said,

"We believe that common share repurchase is an excellent means of

improving returns for common shareholders and have repurchased $2.2

billion of our common stock over the past 10 years. We expect to fund

this share repurchase program largely from excess cash flow, while

maintaining a strong equity base to support the future growth of our

worldwide business. Share repurchase is a very effective method of

enhancing shareholder value within our current operating structure and

we remain committed to enhancing common shareholder returns."

McDonald's recently announced its intention to step up expansion

and will add between 900 and 1,200 restaurants in 1994 and in each of

the next several years, with approximately two-thirds of the locations

outside of the U.S. Lower worldwide average development costs coupled

with improved operations have enabled the Company to control capital

expenditures and fund expansion through cash flow over the past

several years.

McDonald's is the leading foodservice retailer in the global

consumer marketplace, with nearly 14,000 restaurants in 70 countries.

More than 80 percent of McDonald's restaurant businesses are locally

owned and operated by independent entrepreneurs. <PAGE>
