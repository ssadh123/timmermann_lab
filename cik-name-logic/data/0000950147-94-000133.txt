Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On November 18, 1994, Continental Homes Holding Corp. (the "Company")
consummated the acquisition of Heftler Realty Co., a Florida Corporation
("Heftler"). The acquisition was effected pursuant to a Stock Purchase
Agreement (the "Agreement") between Herbert Heftler, Monica Heftler, Roger
Heftler, Joel Kovin, Thomas Iglesias, Jack Shell, and Candice Sharpsteen
(collectively "Seller") and the Company.

Under the terms of the Agreement, the total consideration given to
Seller was $28,500,000 in cash paid at closing. The sources of funds used
for the acquisition were funds generated from operations and borrowings
under the Company's existing lines of credit with Bank One, Arizona N.A. and
Norwest Bank. The consideration was determined pursuant to arms-length
negotiations between the Company and Seller.

In 1993, Heftler ranked as the third largest builder in Dade County,
Florida and the 11th largest builder in Broward County, Florida both in
terms of revenues and units closed. Since its founding almost fifty years
ago, Heftler has built and sold more that 27,000 homes in 15 states and

2. Purchase and Sale of Purchased Shares.

A. Basic Transaction. On and subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Buyer agrees to purchase from the Seller, and the
Seller agrees to sell to the Buyer, all of the Purchased Shares for the
consideration specified below in this Section 2.

B. Purchase Price. The total consideration (the "Purchase Price")
for the sale, transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Purchased Shares to
the Buyer and the covenant not to compete set forth in Section 6(e) is the
sum of $28,500,000. The Purchase Price shall be payable by application of
the Good Faith Deposits (as defined in this Section 2) to payment of the
Purchase Price at Closing, with the balance of the Purchase Price to be paid
to Seller at Closing by means of a completed Federal Funds transfer of
immediately available funds to such bank and account within the continental
United States of America designated by the Seller to the Buyer in writing at
least five business days prior to the Closing Date.

C. Good Faith Deposit. Upon execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Seller and Buyer, Buyer will deposit $100,000 with Mershon,
Sawyer, Johnston, Dunwody & Cole as escrow agent ("Escrow Agent"), which
amount shall be placed in an interest bearing escrow account at such
federally insured financial institution as Seller and Buyer may mutually
agree and designate to Escrow Agent. Such amount (inclusive of interest)
("Initial Deposit") shall be refunded to Buyer if at any time during the Due
Diligence Period (as defined below in this Section 2) Buyer shall determine,
in its sole discretion, that Buyer is not satisfied with the results of its
due diligence and shall give written notice to Seller and Escrow Agent that
Buyer is declining to proceed with the transaction herein contemplated or
Seller shall breach or terminate this Agreement. If no such notice is given
on or before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, the Initial Deposit
shall not be refundable to Buyer except as otherwise provided herein, and
the Buyer shall thereupon deliver to Escrow Agent an additional $400,000
deposit to bind the transaction herein contemplated, which additional
deposit shall also be placed into the interest bearing escrow account
("Second Deposit"). The Initial Deposit and the Second Deposit, inclusive
of all interest earned thereon, are herein referred to collectively as the
"Good Faith Deposit". If the Closing shall fail to occur through no fault
or breach of Buyer, the Good Faith Deposit shall be refundable in full to
Buyer upon written demand of Buyer to Escrow Agent. If the Closing shall
occur, the Good Faith Deposit shall be applied to the payment of the
Purchase Price. If the Closing shall fail to occur as a result of Buyer's
breach of this Agreement, the Good Faith Deposit shall be paid to and
retained by Seller as agreed and liquidated damages, and not as a penalty,
as Seller's sole and exclusive remedy hereunder. The parties recognize and
agree that Seller's damages upon Buyer's default would be substantial but
are not ascertainable with any degree of certainty, and the parties have
therefore determined that forfeiture of the Good Faith Deposit to Seller is
a fair and reasonable provision for liquidated damages.

The parties hereto agree to execute and deliver to Escrow Agent an Escrow
Agreement, substantially on the foregoing terms and with such additional
provisions as the Escrow Agent may reasonably require, upon the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and further agree to thereafter timely
provide Escrow Agent with such written instructions as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to carry out the foregoing terms. In all events,
the Escrow Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to institute
an interpleader action if any conflict, dispute or claim shall arise
concerning the Good Faith Deposit or any part thereof. The Escrow Agent
shall have no liability for its acts or omissions in the performance of its
duties as Escrow Agent unless the same shall be judicially determinated to
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. The parties acknowledge
that the Escrow Agent is counsel to Buyer but is acting solely in a
ministerial capacity with respect to the Good Faith Deposit at the request
of and as an accommodation to the parties. The parties knowingly and
voluntarily waive any claim of conflict against the Escrow Agent with
respect to the Good Faith Deposit, the Escrow Agreement herein contemplated
and the Escrow Agent's performance thereunder.

D. Diligence Period. Buyer shall be afforded the right to conduct
such due diligence reviews and inspections of the Company, the Assets, the
Joint Venture and matters pertaining thereto as Buyer shall, in its sole
discretion, deem expedient for a period ("Due Diligence Period") ending on
November 2, 1994. Seller agrees to fully cooperate with Buyer and will use
its best efforts to cause the Company, its employees and all others to
cooperate with Buyer in all due diligence reviews Buyer may wish to conduct.
Buyer shall have the absolute right to terminate this Agreement and receive
a refund of the Initial Deposit for any reason whatsoever by giving written
notice of termination to Seller and Escrow Agent on or before expiration of
the Due Diligence Period; and upon such termination neither Seller nor Buyer
shall any further rights or obligations under this Agreement.

E. The Closing. The closing of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Mershon
Sawyer in Miami, Florida, commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time on or before
November 30, 1994 or such date as the Buyer and the Seller may mutually
determine, or on such other date to which the Closing may be extended as
provided below in the following sentence (the date on which Closing actually
occurs is herein called the "Closing Date"). If all conditions to Closing
have been accomplished or waived, except that the waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act shall not have expired or been terminated, then Buyer
or Seller may elect to extend the Closing Date to a date no later than
December 31, 1994 (the "Outside Closing Date").

F. Deliveries at the Closing. At the Closing, (i) the Seller will
deliver to the Buyer the various certificates, instruments, and documents
referred to in Section 7(a) below, (ii) the Buyer will deliver to the Seller
the various certificates, instruments, and documents referred to in Section
7(b) below, (iii) the Seller will deliver to the Buyer stock certificates
representing all of the Purchased Shares, endorsed in blank, or accompanied
by duly executed assignment documents, with the signatures thereon
guaranteed by a commercial bank located in Dade County, Florida selected by
the Seller and reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, (iv) Seller and Buyer
will execute and deliver a joint written instruction to Escrow Agent to
disburse the Good Faith Deposit to the order of Seller, and (v) the Buyer
will deliver to the Seller the balance of the Purchase Price specified in
Section 2(b) above.

G. Dividends for Taxes of Seller. At the Closing, the Seller will
cause the Company (i) to estimate the book income before tax for the Company
for the period January 1, 1994 through the Closing Date, (ii) to pay to the
Seller a dividend in an amount equal to 39.6% of such income for that
period, which dividend shall not be duplicative of any dividend paid prior
to the Closing Date, and (iii) pay to the Seller a dividend representing the
Seller's deferred personal federal income taxes for 1993 in the amount of
$481,000.00 which dividend shall not be duplicative of any dividend paid to
the Seller prior to the Closing Date.

3. Representations and Warranties of the Buyer. The Buyer
represents and warrants to the Seller that the statements contained in this
Section 3 are correct and complete as of the date of this Agreement and will
be correct and complete as of the Closing Date (as though made then and as
though the Closing Date were substituted for the date of this Agreement
throughout this Section 3).

A. Organization, Power. Buyer is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate
and lease its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted. The copy of the Certificate of Incorporation of Buyer certified
by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the copy of the By-
Laws of Buyer certified by the Secretary of Buyer attached hereto as Exhibit
D are true and correct.

B. Authorization of Transaction. The Buyer has full power and
authority (including full corporate power and authority) to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. This
Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Buyer,
enforceable in accordance with its terms and conditions. The Buyer need not
give any notice to, make any filing with, or obtain any authorization,
consent, or approval of any government or governmental agency in order to
lawfully and effectively consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for the filing required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

C. Brokers' Fees. The Buyer has not engaged any broker, finder, or
agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for
which the Seller could become liable or obligated.

D. Investment. The Buyer is not acquiring the Purchased Shares
with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof
within the meaning of the Securities Act. Buyer understands and
acknowledges that the Purchased Shares have not been, and will not be
registered under the Securities Act, or the state securities or Blue Sky
laws of any jurisdiction, and that the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement has not been reviewed by, passed on or submitted to any federal or
state agency or commission. Buyer understands that its acquisition of the
Purchased Shares is intended to be exempt from registration under the
Securities Act. Buyer will not sell or otherwise transfer the Purchased
Shares without registration under the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws or relying on an exemption therefrom, and fully understands
and agrees that it must bear the economic risks of its purchase for an
indefinite period of time because, among other reasons, the Purchased Shares
have not been registered under the Securities Act or under the securities
laws of any state and, therefore, cannot be resold, pledged, assigned,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless the Purchased Shares are
subsequently registered under the Securities Act and under the applicable
securities laws of the appropriate states or unless an exemption from such
registration is available.

E. Noncontravention of the Buyer. Except where it will not have a
Material Adverse Effect, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Buyer nor the consummation by Buyer of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (A) violate any constitution, statute, regulation,
rule, injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling, charge, or other
restriction of any government, governmental agency, or a court, to which
Buyer is subject or any provision of its charter or bylaws, or (B) conflict
with, or result in a breach of, constitute a default under, result in the
acceleration of, create in any party the right to accelerate, terminate,
modify, or cancel, or require any notice under any agreement, contract,
lease, license, instrument, or other arrangement, to which Buyer is a party
or by which it is bound or to which any of its assets is subject.

4. Representations and Warranties of the Seller. The Seller
represents and warrants to the Buyer that the statements contained in this
Section 4 are correct and complete as of the date of this Agreement and will
be correct and complete as of the Closing Date (as though made then and as
though the Closing Date were substituted for the date of this Agreement
throughout this Section 4), except as set forth in the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Seller to the Buyer on the date hereof, initialed by the
parties and attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Disclosure Schedule"). Each
item in the Disclosure Schedule that is an exception to the representations
and warranties set forth in this Section 4 must reference at least one
particular lettered and numbered paragraph of this Section 4 to which such
exception applies. The mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document
or other item in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein, it being
necessary for Seller to give some explanation of the way in which the
document or other item constitutes an exception, unless that is obvious.
The Seller need not disclose any item more than once as long as such item is
disclosed in an appropriate Section of the Disclosure Schedule. Seller
warrants that the Disclosure Schedule is arranged in paragraphs
corresponding to the lettered and numbered paragraphs contained in this
Section 4. If prior to Closing Seller becomes aware of information that
makes any disclosure set out in the Disclosure Schedule inaccurate,
incomplete, or misleading, Seller shall promptly give written notice to
Buyer of such information, and such written notice shall be an amendment to
the Disclosure Schedule if Seller's notice expressly states that the notice
is an amendment to the Disclosure Schedule. Without the prior consent of
Buyer, Seller shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Company to,
intentionally act or fail to act so as to cause an effect that would require
an amendment to the Disclosure Schedule except for such amendments as might
be necessitated by the operations of the Company in the Ordinary Course of
Business. Any amendment of the Disclosure Schedule must be accepted in
writing by Buyer as a condition precedent to the Buyer's obligations
hereunder except for such amendments as might be necessitated by the
operations of the Company in the Ordinary Course of Business.

A. Authorization of Transaction. The Seller has full power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform the Seller's
obligations hereunder. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable in accordance with its terms

need not give any notice to, make any filing with, or obtain any
authorization, consent, or approval of any government or governmental agency
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

B. Noncontravention of the Seller. Except where it will not have a
Material Adverse Effect, neither the execution and the delivery by Seller of
this Agreement, nor the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will (A) violate any constitution, statute, regulation,

restriction of any government, governmental agency, or court to which the
Seller is subject or (B) conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a
default under, result in the acceleration of, create in any party the right

Payment, and further acknowledges that said Payment shall not be paid by the

beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. The
Joint Venture has not filed and has never been required to file Tax Returns. No
claim is being made by any authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or the
Joint Venture does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation
by that jurisdiction. There are no Security Interests on any of the assets of
any of the Company or the Joint Venture that arose in connection with any

paid or owing to any creditor, stockholder, owner, or other third party.
The Company and the Joint Venture have withheld and paid all Taxes required

any employee or independent contractor.

iii. Neither Seller, the Company nor the Joint Venture expects any
authority to assess any additional taxes for any period for which tax
returns have been filed that are not specifically provided for in the
Financial Statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Seller warrants that the Company has no liability for any built-in gains tax
under Code Sec. 1374 resulting from the sale of property during any of the
Company's S Corporation years through the short period ending on the Closing
Date. There is no dispute or claim concerning any Tax Liability of the
Company or the Joint Venture either (A) claimed or raised by any authority
in writing or (B) as to which any of the Seller, the directors and officers
(and employees responsible for Tax matters) of the Company and owners or
manager of the Joint Venture has Knowledge. Except as shown on the
Disclosure Schedule, the Seller has delivered to the Buyer correct and
complete copies of all federal income Tax Returns, examination reports, and

make any payments that will not be deductible under Code Sec. 280G. The
Company has not been a United States real property holding corporation
within the meaning of Code Sec. 897(c)(2) during the applicable period
specified in Code Sec. 897(c)(1)(A)(ii). The Company has disclosed on its
federal tax returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a
substantial understatement of federal income tax within the meaning of Code
Sec. 6662. The Company is not a party to any Tax allocation or sharing
agreement. The Company (A) has not been a member of an Affiliated Group
filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return or (B) has no Liability for
the Taxes of any Person under Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise.

vii. Section 4(k) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
following information with respect to the Company and the Joint Venture as of

8. Remedies; Indemnifications.

A. General. Prior to Closing, if Buyer is in material default of
this Agreement, Seller's sole remedy shall be to receive the Good Faith
Deposit as liquidated damages pursuant to Section 2(c) above. After
Closing, if the Buyer, after ten (10) days' written notice and opportunity
to cure, is in material default under this Agreement, the Seller shall be
entitled to all rights and remedies available to Seller at law or in equity
including, without limitation, the right to seek specific performance of
Buyer's obligations hereunder. Before or after Closing, if the Seller,
after ten (10) days' notice and opportunity to cure, is in material default
under this Agreement, the Buyer shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available to Buyer at law or in equity including, without limitation, the
right to seek specific performance of the Seller's obligations hereunder.
Seller acknowledges that monetary damages would not adequately compensate
Buyer for Seller's breach or default hereunder.

B. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All of the
representations, warranties and indemnities of the parties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue in full force and
effect thereafter through the earlier of: (i) expiration of the applicable
statutes of limitations shall have expired for claims which may be brought
hereunder and for claims in respect of which a party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder may be brought; or (ii) seven (7) years from the
Closing Date.

C. Post-Closing Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the
Buyer. After Closing, and provided that Buyer or the Company makes a
written claim for indemnification against the Seller pursuant to Section
10(g) below, the Seller agrees to indemnify the Buyer, the Buyer's officers,
directors, employees and agents and the Company and hold each of them
harmless from any claim, loss, liability, cost or expense (including
reasonable attorney's fees and court costs at all levels) (collectively,
"Losses") incurred by the Buyer or the Company occurring or resulting from:
(i) any breach of any warranty, representation or covenant by the Seller
contained in this Agreement (or the allegation of facts by a third party
which if true would constitute a breach by the Seller); (ii) the non-
performance by the Seller hereunder; (iii) claims of whatever nature
(including, without limitation, claims for personal injury, wrongful death
or property damage) against the Company (including, without limitation, the
Company in its capacity as a general partner of the Joint Venture) or any of
the Assets based upon facts, circumstances, causes of action or occurrences
arising prior to the Closing, except for such facts, circumstances, causes
of action and occurrences as have been specifically, properly and accurately
disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule or in the Financial Statements; or (iv)
any Tax imposed on the Seller, the Company or the Joint Venture for all
periods prior to the Closing Date or on the Seller or the Company for any
built-in-gain under Code Section 1376 resulting from the sale of property
during any of the Company's S corporation years through the short period
ending on the Closing Date.. The preceding clause (iv) is intended to
impose strict liability to indemnify the Buyer and the Company with respect
to any Loss suffered by the Buyer or the Company for any Tax imposed on
Seller, the Company or the Joint Venture for all periods prior to the
Closing Date or on the Seller or the Company for any built-in gain under
Code Sec. 1374 resulting from the sale of property during any of the
Company's S corporation years through the short period ending on the Closing
Date, even though Seller may not have breached any representation or
warranty contained in Section 4(k) by reason of Seller's lack of knowledge
with respect to those representations and warranties.

The foregoing notwithstanding, the Seller shall have no obligation to
indemnify the Buyer or the Company for: (i) any matter referenced in (i),
(ii), or (iii) in the immediately preceding paragraph until one or both of
the Buyer and the Company have suffered Losses in excess of the aggregate
amount of $100,000.00 as a result thereof (after which point the Seller's
obligation to indemnify for such matters shall be unqualified); (ii) any
Loss occurring or resulting from any product warranty claim by a purchaser
of a housing unit, or from injury to an individual or property, of less than
$1,000.00, provided that, if any Loss occurring or resulting from any
product warranty claim by a purchaser of a housing unit, or from injury to
an individual or property, shall be in the amount of $1,000.00 or more, only
the amount, if any, of each such Loss in excess of $1,000.00 shall be
counted towards the $100,000.00 limitation stated in the immediately
preceding clause (i); and (iii) any Loss occurring or resulting from any
matter disclosed in Section 4 of the Disclosure Schedule if such matter has
been properly and accurately disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule, . The
limitations set forth in this paragraph shall not be applicable with respect
to the indemnification contemplated by Clause (iv) (regarding Taxes) in the
immediately preceding paragraph or with respect to any breach by Seller (or
the allegation of facts by a third party which, if true, would constitute a
breach by Seller) of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in
Section 4(w) (regarding employee benefit plans).

If any third party shall notify the Buyer or the Company with respect to any
matter which may give rise to a claim for indemnification or if the Buyer or
the Company shall incur a Loss for which indemnification may be provided
under this Section 8 (each an "Indemnified Claim"), then the Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be, shall notify the Seller and any insurance
carrier providing applicable coverage of the Indemnified Claim. If the
carrier under any insurance policy applicable to the Indemnified Claim
denies coverage, then the Indemnified Claim shall be defended in accordance
with Section 8(e).

If any third party may be responsible for an Indemnified Claim, then the
Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall seek recovery of the
Indemnified Claim from such third party by appropriate proceedings
diligently pursued. If all or any portion of the Indemnified Claim cannot
be recovered from any such third party (or from an applicable insurance
carrier) by appropriate proceedings diligently pursued, then the Seller
shall pay such Indemnified Claim subject to the provisions of this Section
8(c).

If Buyer has given all notices of an Indemnified Claim to Seller as required
by this Section 8, then, in the event Seller shall otherwise become liable
for such Indemnified Claim under this Section 8, the obligation for
indemnification shall not be barred by any statute of limitations or by the
survival period provided in this Section 8; provided, further that Buyer
shall have notified Seller that such Indemnified Claim is still pending
within ninety (90) days prior to the end of such survival period; and,
provided further, that demand for payment upon Seller is made within ninety
(90) days after the obligation of the Seller to indemnify such Indemnified
Claim becomes final.

D. Post-Closing Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the
Seller. If after Closing, in the event the Buyer breaches or has breached
(or in the event any third party alleges facts that, if true, would mean the
Buyer has breached) any of its representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained herein, and, provided that the Seller makes a written
claim for indemnification against the Buyer pursuant to Section 10(g) below
within the survival period for such claim, then the Buyer agrees to
indemnify the Seller from and against the entirety of any Loss (including
any Loss the Seller may suffer after the end of any applicable survival
period) occurring or resulting from the breach (or the alleged breach);
provided, however, that the Buyer shall not have any obligation to indemnify
the Seller from and against any Loss occurring or resulting from the breach
of any representation, or warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein
until the Seller has suffered Losses by reason of any such breach or
breaches in excess of the aggregate amount of $100,000 (after which point
the Buyer will be obligated to indemnify the Seller from and against further
Loss).

E. Matters Involving Third Parties. Subject to Sections 8(c) and
8(d) above:

i. If any third party shall notify the Seller or the Buyer
(the "Indemnified Party") with respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim")
which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against any other party (the
"Indemnifying Party") under this Section 8, then the Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; provided, however,
that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying
Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless
(and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced.

ii. Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the
Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (A) the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within 15 days
after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim that
the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against
the entirety of any Loss the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party
Claim, (B) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party will have the financial resources to defend against the
Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, (C)
the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief that could have a Material Adverse
Effect, (D) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third
Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party,
likely to establish a precedential custom or practice materially adverse to
the continuing business interests of the Indemnified Party, and (E) the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively
and diligently.

iii. So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense
of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 8(e)(ii) above, (A) the
Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense
and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified
Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
or with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld unreasonably) and (C) the
Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably) unless the
judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages by
one or more of the Indemnifying Parties and does not impose an injunction or
other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party that could have a Material
Adverse Effect.

iv. In the event any of the conditions in Section 8(e)(ii) above
is or becomes unsatisfied however, (A) the Indemnified Party may defend against,
and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to, the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any
consent from, (but shall advise) any Indemnifying Party in connection
therewith), (B) the Indemnifying Parties will reimburse the Indemnified Party
promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party
Claim (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), and (C) the
Indemnifying Parties will remain responsible for any Loss the Indemnified Party
may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or
caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Section
8.

F. Insurance. For seven (7) years from and after the Closing Date,
the Buyer shall cause the Company to maintain each type of insurance
coverage in the amount maintained by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement so long as such type of coverage is available from a recognized
commercial insurance carrier selected by the Buyer and accepted by the
Seller (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld). If such
coverage is unavailable and cannot be obtained as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, then Buyer shall notify Seller sixty (60)
days (or as soon as is otherwise practical if Buyer has not been notified of
such unavailability before sixty (60) days prior to the termination of such
coverage) prior to the termination of the existing insurance policy at that
time. Further, in the event Buyer dissolves the Company or otherwise causes
the Company to cease to exist as an entity, Buyer will thereafter for the
remainder of the period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date cause the
Company to be included as a named insured on Buyer's insurance policies so
that the intent and effect of this Section 8(f) remains unchanged. If any
claim that would give rise to indemnification under this Section 8 during
such seven year period is still pending at the end of such seven year
period, Buyer shall be responsible to maintain the insurance required herein
until all such claims are disposed of.

G. Other Indemnification Provisions. The Seller will not make any
claim for indemnification against the Company or the Joint Venture by reason
of the fact that Seller was a director, officer, employee, or agent of
either such entity or was serving at the request of the Company or the Joint
Venture as a partner, trustee, director, officer, employee, or agent of
another entity (whether such claim is for judgments, damages, penalties,
fines, costs, amounts paid in settlement, losses, expenses, or otherwise and
whether such claim is pursuant to any statute, charter document, bylaw,
agreement, or otherwise) with respect to any action, suit, proceeding,
complaint, claim, or demand brought by the Buyer against the Seller (whether
such action, suit, proceeding, complaint, claim, or demand is pursuant to
this Agreement, applicable law, or otherwise).

9. Termination.

A. Termination of Agreement. The parties may terminate this
Agreement as provided below:

i. the Buyer and the Seller may terminate this Agreement by
mutual written consent at any time prior to the Closing;

ii. the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written

satisfied by the Closing Date or the Outside Closing Date; and

iii. the Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written

Florida.

Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
the Buyer and the Seller. No waiver by any party of any default,

representation, warranty, or covenant.

LETTER OF CREDIT AND LOAN FACILITY.

i Loan Facility.

i Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Bank agrees to make Advances to Borrower from time to time on or
before the Termination Date, provided that the aggregate amount of Advances
outstanding from time to time shall not exceed the Available Commitment.
Proceeds of Advances may be used only for the purpose described in Sections
3.2.2 and 5.1.6. Advances shall be on a revolving basis. Advances repaid
may be re-borrowed subject to the terms and the conditions herein and any
re-borrowing shall be deemed a refinancing of amounts repaid. Although the
outstanding principal of the Note may be zero from time to time, the Loan
Documents shall remain in full force and effect until the Commitment
terminates, the Letters of Credit have expired or are drawn in full, all
drafts drawn or drawn and accepted under all Letters of Credit have been
paid in full, and all Obligations are paid and performed in full. If monies
are being held in the Cash Collateral Account at any time, Bank shall be
entitled to apply such monies to the outstanding balance of the Advances.
Upon occurrence of an Event of Default or an Unmatured Event of Default,
Bank, in its absolute and sole discretion and without notice, may suspend
the commitment to make Advances. In addition, upon occurrence of an Event
of Default, Bank, in its absolute and sole discretion and without notice,
may terminate the commitment to make Advances. The obligation of Borrower
to repay all Advances is evidenced by the Note.

` Borrower acknowledges that Bank is entering into this
Agreement in reliance upon, and in connection with, the acquisition by CHHC
of all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock in Borrower. If CHHC
does not acquire such stock on or before the earlier of (i) two (2) Business
Days after Bank executes this Agreement or (ii) December 30, 1994 (the
earlier of such dates is referred to as the "Automatic Expiration Date"),
then (A) Bank will have no further obligation to make Advances hereunder,
and the Commitment will terminate automatically, and (B) Borrower will pay
to Bank in immediately available funds on or before the Automatic Expiration
Date, all principal, interest, and other amounts owed by Borrower to Bank in
connection with the Loan Documents. Upon receipt of such funds, Bank will
execute, record and file as applicable Deeds of Full Release and
Reconveyance and Terminations of Financing Statements as reasonably
necessary in order to release the Collateral. Upon such payment by
Borrower, Borrower will have no further liability to Bank under the Loan
Documents, except the Environmental Agreements.

ii Conversion Period. The Conversion Date shall occur

(a) on the calendar date or anniversary date thereof set forth in
the definition of Conversion Date in Section 2; or

(b) if Borrower's quarterly financial statements submitted to
Bank pursuant to Section 6.3.1.2 show Operating Losses for two (2)
consecutive fiscal quarters, then unless Bank in its sole and absolute
discretion agrees otherwise, the Conversion Date shall automatically
occur and the Conversion Period shall automatically commence, effective
as of the first day of the first Calendar Month immediately following
the second such fiscal quarter.

From and after the Conversion Date, the Commitment Amount shall be reduced
on the first day of each quarter-annual period (a "Reduction Date") as
follows:

Commitment Remaining
Period Reduction Commitment
- - ------ ---------- ----------

3 Calendar Months after
Conversion Date $2,500,000 $7,500,000

6 Calendar Months after
Conversion Date $2,500,000 $5,000,000

9 Calendar Months after
Conversion Date $2,500,000 $2,500,000

Termination Date $2,500,000 $0

iii Acceleration of Conversion Date upon the Occurrence of a
Material Adverse Change. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Bank may, in its absolute and sole discretion, accelerate the
Conversion Date immediately upon the occurrence of a Material Adverse
Change, and commence the Conversion Period and the reductions in the
Commitment Amount set forth in Section 3.1.2. Bank may exercise its right
to cause the Conversion Date to occur pursuant to this Section 3.1.3
pursuant to a written notice to Borrower setting forth the accelerated
Conversion Date, which notice may be given by Bank at any time after the
occurrence of a Material Adverse Change and Bank's failure to exercise such
right with respect to a Material Adverse Change shall not be deemed to waive
Bank's rights pursuant to this Section 3.1.3 with respect to any other
Material Adverse Change whether similar or dissimilar. If Bank exercises
its right pursuant to this Section 3.1.3, Borrower shall not be entitled to
a refund of any fees previously paid and shall continue to be obligated to
pay all fees accruing from and after the Conversion Date; provided, however,
with respect to fees paid by Borrower in advance on the date hereof pursuant
to Section 3.4.1, the portion of such fees attributable to the period
commencing on the accelerated Conversion Date and ending on the regularly
scheduled Conversion Date shall be credited by Bank against any fees payable
by Borrower pursuant to Section 3.4.1 or Section 3.4.2 during the Conversion
Period.

iv Voluntary Reductions in Commitment Amount. At any time
during the Conversion Period, Borrower may elect to reduce the Commitment
Amount in amounts greater than those set forth in Section 3.1.2; provided,
however, Borrower shall have provided Bank written notice of Borrower's
desire to reduce the Commitment Amount, and Borrower shall have paid to Bank
any amount payable pursuant to Section 3.5 after giving effect to the
reduction in the Commitment Amount. Any such additional reductions shall be
applied toward the amount of any subsequent scheduled reductions.

ii Letters of Credit.

i Issuance of Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable Letter of Credit Agreements
and subject to the policies, procedures, and requirements of Bank in effect
from time to time for issuance of Letters of Credit (including, without
limitation, payment of letter of credit fees), Bank agrees to issue from
time to time, after CHHC acquires the stock of Borrower (as described in
Section 3.1.1) and on or before the Termination Date, Letters of Credit upon
request by and for the account of Borrower, provided that as to each
requested Letter of Credit Borrower has delivered to Bank a completed and
executed Letter of Credit Agreement, and provided further that (i) the date
that is the Standard Number of Days after the last date for payment of
drafts drawn or drawn and accepted under the requested Letter of Credit is
before twelve (12) months after the Termination Date, and (ii) the
expiration date of each Letter of Credit shall be on or before one year
after the date the Letter of Credit is issued. The issuance fee for a
Letter of Credit will be one percent (1%) of the Letter of Credit
Subcommitment amount, payable prior to, and as a condition of, issuance.
Each reference in this Agreement to "issue" or "issuance" or other forms of
such words in relation to Letters of Credit shall also include any extension
or renewal of a Letter of Credit. Upon occurrence of an Event of Default or
an Unmatured Event of Default, Bank, in its absolute and sole discretion and
without notice, may suspend the commitment to issue Letters of Credit. In
addition, upon occurrence of an Event of Default, Bank, in its absolute and
sole discretion and without notice, may terminate the commitment to issue
Letters of Credit.

ii Issuance Procedure. To obtain a Letter of Credit, Borrower
shall complete and execute a Letter of Credit Agreement and submit it to the
letter of credit department of Bank and to the address of Bank specified on
the first page of this Agreement. In no event shall Bank have any
obligation to act upon an oral request for a Letter of Credit, or any
request that otherwise does not conform to Bank's policies and procedures.
Upon receipt of a completed and executed Letter of Credit Agreement, Bank
will process the application in accordance with the policies, procedures,
and requirements of Bank then in effect. If the application meets the
requirements of Bank and is within the policies of Bank then in effect, and
meets the regulatory requirements applicable thereto, Bank will issue the
requested Letter of Credit.

iii Reimbursement of Bank for Payment of Drafts Drawn or Drawn
and Accepted Under the Letter of Credit. The obligation of Borrower to
reimburse Bank for payment by Bank of drafts drawn or drawn and accepted
under a Letter of Credit shall be as provided in the Letter of Credit
Agreement. Bank will notify Borrower of payment by Bank of a draft drawn or
drawn and accepted under a Letter of Credit and of the Reimbursement Amount
and will give Borrower the election (i) to pay the Reimbursement Amount
pursuant to the respective Letter of Credit Agreement or (ii) to pay the
Reimbursement Amount by Bank making an Advance, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and applying the proceeds of the Advance to pay
the Reimbursement Amount. If Borrower does not communicate to Bank its
election within two (2) Business Days after notification by Bank of payment
of the draft or acceptance, then Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to
pay the Reimbursement Amount by Bank making an Advance hereunder, provided
that if the terms and conditions in this Agreement for an Advance hereunder
are not satisfied, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to pay the
Reimbursement Amount pursuant to the Letter of Credit Agreement. The
Advance to pay the Reimbursement Amount will be dated the date that Bank
pays the respective draft or acceptance and will accrue interest from and
after such date.

If Borrower is to pay the Reimbursement Amount pursuant to the Letter
of Credit Agreement, Borrower shall also pay to Bank interest on the
Reimbursement Amount from and including the date Bank pays the respective
draft or acceptance at the Variable Rate (as defined in the Note) until the
Reimbursement Amount and such interest are paid in full, provided that if
Borrower fails to pay the Reimbursement Amount and accrued interest thereon
within five (5) days after notification by Bank to Borrower of payment of
the respective draft or acceptance, interest thereafter will accrue at the
Default Rate (as such term is defined in the Note). Such interest shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year and accrue on a daily basis for the
actual number of days elapsed.

Notwithstanding the above, if Borrower elects or is deemed to have
elected to pay the Reimbursement Amount pursuant to the Letter of Credit
Agreement and fails to pay the Reimbursement Amount and interest thereon
within five (5) days after notification by Bank to Borrower, Bank, in its
absolute and sole discretion and without notice to Borrower and regardless
of whether the terms and conditions in this Agreement for such Advances are
satisfied, may make an Advance under this Agreement in the amount of the
Reimbursement Amount and accrued interest thereon and apply the proceeds of
such Advance to pay the Reimbursement Amount and accrued interest.

iv Limits on Letters of Credit. Anything in the Loan Documents to
the contrary notwithstanding, the sum from time to time of (i) the aggregate
amount of outstanding and undrawn Letters of Credit, (ii) the aggregate
amount of outstanding and unpaid drafts drawn and accepted under Letters of
Credit, (iii) the aggregate amount of unpaid Reimbursement Amounts, and (iv)
the amount of outstanding and unpaid Advances shall not exceed the sum of
(A) the Available Commitment and (B) the aggregate of the Letter of Credit
Subcommitment amounts. In addition, the sum from time to time of the
amounts described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) shall not exceed twenty-
five percent (25%) of the Commitment Amount.

iii Advances.

i Method for Advances and Letters of Credit. A Letter of
Credit may be issued and Advances may be made by Bank at the written request
of the Person or Persons designated in Section 1. Such Person or Persons
are hereby authorized by Borrower to direct the disposition of the proceeds
of Advances and to request Letters of Credit until written notice of the
revocation of such authority is received from Borrower by Bank and Bank has
had a reasonable time to act upon such notice. Bank shall have no duty to
monitor for Borrower or to report to Borrower the use of Letters of Credit
or proceeds of Advances.

ii Use of Advances. Advances shall be used only to pay interest
and fees due under the Loan Documents (including without limitation
Reimbursement Amounts due Bank) and to pay or reimburse Borrower for costs,
expenses, and fees actually incurred by Borrower in connection with the
acquisition of Raw Land, Improved Lots, or Units, the construction of
Improvements, the construction of Units, and other costs incurred by
Borrower in the ordinary course of Borrower's business, as Bank may approve
in its reasonable discretion.

iii Determination of Amount of Advances. The Available
Commitment, the Maximum Allowed Advance for each parcel of Raw Land, each
Improved Lot, and each Unit, the Unit Collateral Value, and the amount of
each Advance shall be determined by Bank based upon: (i) the Borrowing Base
Report and the Collateral Certificate most recently submitted by Borrower
(adjusted to reflect Collateral sold, Reclassification Adjustments, Term
Adjustments and other adjustments and limitations pursuant to this
Agreement), (ii) Bank's inspections made pursuant to Sections 6.13 and 6.18
(as such inspections may result in any adjustments to reflect any variance
between (A) the Borrowing Base Report and the Collateral Certificate, and
(B) the results of such inspections), and (iii) such other information as
Bank may reasonably require in order to verify such amounts.
Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the
contrary, Bank may withhold from any Advance the amount of Florida
documentary stamp or intangible tax due on such Advance, and pay the same
directly to the taxing authority. Nothing herein shall limit or impair any
obligation of Borrower for payment of such taxes arising under any Loan
Document, applicable hereof, or otherwise, if Bank shall fail to do so.

iv Term Periods. Each parcel of Raw Land, Improved Lot and Unit
shall constitute Eligible Collateral only during the applicable Term
therefor set forth below; provided, however, that in no event shall any Term
exceed the Termination Date:

` Raw Land Term. A parcel of Raw Land will constitute
Eligible Collateral for not more than the Raw Land Term commencing on the
date an Advance is first made against Eligible Collateral that includes such
parcel; provided, however, any parcel of Raw Land remaining in Eligible
Collateral after the Conversion Date shall be subject to a Term Adjustment
for purposes of determining the Maximum Allowed Advance. The Raw Land Term
will be determined by Bank in its reasonable discretion and established at
the time the parcel of Raw Land first constitutes Eligible Collateral.

` Improved Lot Term. An Improved Lot will constitute
Eligible Collateral for not more than the Improved Lot Term commencing on
the date an Advance is first made against Eligible Collateral that includes
such Improved Lot. The Improved Lot Term will be determined by Bank in its
reasonable discretion and established at the time the Improved Lot first
constitutes Eligible Collateral. Bank may elect to establish, in Bank's
reasonable discretion, a Minimum Lot Takedown Requirement with respect to
the Subdivision in which the Improved Lot is located and measure the
Improved Lot Term for all Improved Lots in such Subdivision in the
aggregate, based on the Minimum Lot Takedown Requirement. If the Minimum
Lot Takedown Requirement for a Subdivision is not satisfied during any
fiscal quarter, then the Improved Lot Term will be deemed to have expired
with respect to the number of Improved Lots (to be designated by Bank) in
such Subdivision equal to the Lot Takedown Deficit for such Subdivision for
such fiscal quarter.

` Presold Unit. A Presold Unit may constitute Eligible
Collateral for not more than twelve (12) Calendar Months from the date an
Advance is first made against Eligible Collateral that includes such Presold
Unit; provided, however, any Presold Unit remaining as Eligible Collateral
for more than nine (9) Calendar Months from the date an Advance is first
made against Eligible Collateral that includes such Presold Unit shall be
subject to a Term Adjustment for purposes of determining the applicable
Maximum Allowed Advance.

` Spec Unit. A Spec Unit may constitute Eligible
Collateral for not more than twelve (12) Calendar Months from the date an
Advance is first made against Eligible Collateral that includes such Spec
Unit; provided, however, (i) any Spec Unit remaining as Eligible Collateral
for more than six (6) Calendar Months from the date an Advance is first made
against Eligible Collateral that includes such Spec Unit shall be subject to
a Term Adjustment for purposes of determining the applicable Maximum Allowed
Advance, and (ii) any Spec Unit remaining as Eligible Collateral for more
than nine (9) Calendar Months from the date an Advance is first made against
Eligible Collateral that includes such Spec Unit shall be subject to a Term
Adjustment for purposes of determining the applicable Maximum Allowed
Advance.

` Model Unit. A Model Unit may constitute Eligible
Collateral for not more than thirty (30) Calendar Months from the date an
Advance is first made against Eligible Collateral that includes such Model
Unit; provided, however, (i) any Model Unit remaining as Eligible Collateral
for more than eighteen (18) Calendar Months from the date an Advance is
first made against Eligible Collateral that includes such Model Unit shall
be subject to a Term Adjustment for purposes of determining the applicable
Maximum Allowed Advance; and (ii) any Model Unit remaining as Eligible
Collateral for more than twenty-one (21) Calendar Months from the date an
Advance is first made against Eligible Collateral that includes such Model
Unit shall be subject to a Term Adjustment for purposes of determining the
applicable Maximum Allowed Advance.

v Intentionally Omitted.

vi Classification and Reclassification of Units. Bank may
classify or reclassify Raw Land, Improved Lots and Units as to type from
time to time, or change Borrower's proposed classification of any and all
Raw Land, Improved Lots and Units, provided that such reclassified Raw Land,
Improved Lot or Unit meets the requirements set forth herein for that type
of Collateral. At any time a parcel of Raw Land, Improved Lot or Unit is
reclassified as to type, such reclassification shall give rise to a
Reclassification Adjustment to the Maximum Allowed Advance applicable to
such Collateral. In no event shall a reclassification change the
commencement date of any Unit Term.

vii Release of Raw Land, Improved Lots and Units at Request of
Borrower. So long as no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, Borrower may request releases of Raw Land,
Improved Lots or Units from the lien and encumbrance of a Deed of Trust from
time to time; provided, however, Bank shall be under no obligation to
release any Raw Land, Improved Lot or Unit unless each of the following
conditions precedent is satisfied:

(i) in the case of any Raw Land, Improved Lot or Unit that is
being released for the purpose of sale, (A) Borrower shall have
paid to Bank, from Borrower's own funds (including Net Sales
Proceeds), the greater of (X) the applicable Maximum Allowed
Advance or (Y) the Net Sales Proceeds; provided, however, that if
more than one Improved Lot is sold to a single purchaser, then the
release price shall be 130% of the aggregate Maximum Allowed
Advances for such Improved Lots; (B) Borrower shall have delivered
to Bank a closing report pursuant to Section 6.3.3; and (C) both
before and after giving effect to such release and any payments to
be made pursuant to clause (i)(A) of this sentence, the
outstanding Advances do not exceed the Available Commitment and
Borrower has made any payments then required pursuant to
Section 3.5; or

(ii) with respect to releases for purposes other than sale,
both before and after giving effect to such release, the
outstanding Advances do not exceed the Available Commitment and
Borrower has made any payments required pursuant to Section 3.5,
and Borrower shall have paid to Bank, from Borrower's own funds,
an amount equal to the Maximum Allowed Advance for such parcel of
Raw Land, Improved Lot or Unit; and

(iii) Borrower shall have satisfied the conditions precedent
for releases set forth in the Deed of Trust encumbering the
property to be released.

Any amounts payable to Bank under subparagraph (i) and (ii), including,
without limitation, Net Sales Proceeds, shall be applied to the outstanding
principal balance of all Advances and, if no unpaid Advances are then
outstanding, for deposit to the Cash Collateral Account.

viii Extraordinary Events Affecting Raw Land, Improved Lots or
Units. Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, Raw Land,
Improved Lots, and Units at any time constituting Eligible Collateral may be
declared by Bank to no longer be Eligible Collateral:

` Material Damage, Destruction, or Condemnation. Any Unit
or Improvements are materially damaged or destroyed, or any Raw Land,
Improved Lot or Unit becomes subject to any condemnation proceeding.

` Default Regarding Title Insurance. The requirements of
the Loan Documents for title insurance with respect to any Collateral are
not satisfied.

ix Advances During Conversion Period. Borrower may continue to
request Advances and Letters of Credit during the Conversion Period. Such
Advances and Letters of Credit may be made by Bank pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

iv Fees. As additional consideration for the Commitment, Borrower
agrees to pay to Bank (subject to the provisions hereof and of the other
Loan Documents limiting the charging, collection and receipt of interest to
the maximum amount permitted by applicable law) the following fees, from
Borrower's own funds, which shall be earned by Bank on the date due under
the Loan Documents and shall be non-refundable to Borrower:

i Commitment and Other Fees.

` Commitment Fee. A fee for the Commitment at the annual
rate set forth in Section 1, computed for the period commencing on the date
hereof and ending on the scheduled Conversion Date, and which shall be
payable as follows: $62,500.00 payable on or before the date hereof, and
$62,500.00 payable on or before November 30, 1995.

` Extension Fee. In addition to the Commitment Fee, as a
condition precedent to any extension of the Conversion Date (and without in
any way obligating Bank to extend the Conversion Date, which is intended to
be in the absolute and sole discretion of Bank), Borrower shall pay to Bank
a fee determined by Bank in its absolute and sole discretion.

` Quarterly Loan Fee. On the Conversion Date and on the
last day of each three (3) month period thereafter, Borrower shall pay to
Bank a Quarterly Loan Fee at the rate specified in Section 1 on the
Commitment amount then in effect, after giving effect to any reductions
thereof pursuant to Sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.4.

ii Unused Commitment Fee. An Unused Commitment Fee computed at
the rate per annum set forth in Section 1 on a portion of the unused
Commitment Amount, calculated from the date hereof and payable monthly in
arrears. For each month (or portion thereof) the Unused Commitment Fee
shall be equal to: (i) seventy-five percent (75%) of the Commitment Amount
(as in effect at the beginning of such month) minus (ii) the "average
monthly outstandings" for the month (or portion thereof) with respect to
which the unused commitment is being computed, with the resulting number
multiplied by (iii) one-twelfth (1/12th) of the rate per annum set forth in
Section 1.

As used herein, "average monthly outstandings" means the sum of the
outstanding Loan balance at the end of each calendar day during the month
(or portion thereof) for which the Unused Commitment Fee is being computed,
divided by the number of days in that month (or portion thereof). If the
Unused Commitment Fee is being computed for less than a full month, the
percentage used in clause (iii) above shall be computed on a daily basis for
the number of days for which the fee is being computed. Such fee shall
continue to payable during the Conversion Period, until the Termination
Date.

iii Attorneys' Costs, Expenses, and Fees. Attorneys' costs,
expenses, and fees for Bank's counsel as provided in the Loan Documents,
payable on or before the date hereof and during the term of the Commitment,
from time to time upon the presentation by Bank of statements therefor.

iv Appraisal Fees, Title Insurance Premium, and Other Costs,
Expenses, and Fees. Appraisal fees, appraisal review fees, title insurance
premiums, and other costs, expenses, and fees that Borrower is obligated to
pay pursuant to the Loan Documents, including without limitation, all fees
and costs associated with periodic inspections of the Project, in the
amounts specified by Bank, payable on or before the date hereof, and monthly
thereafter during the term of the Commitment; provided, however, that
Borrower shall be obligated to pay the cost of only four (4) periodic
inspections of the Project in any twelve (12) month period.

v Mandatory Prepayments. If for any reason at any time the
outstanding principal amount of Advances exceeds the Available Commitment,
Borrower shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of notice from
Bank, make a payment to Bank in an amount equal to the sum of (i) such
excess principal, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

other Impositions and all utility and services charges, evidence that they
have been paid in full.

the amount approved by Bank. This policy shall permit claims for a period
of not less than three (3) years after the completion of the Project.

vii Additional Insurance. Borrower shall obtain and maintain
such other policies of insurance as Bank may request in writing.

viii Other. All policies for required insurance shall be in
form and substance satisfactory to Bank in its absolute and sole discretion.
Unless otherwise agreed by Bank in advance in its absolute and sole
discretion, required insurance may not be provided under any blanket
insurance policy. All required insurance shall be procured and maintained
in financially sound and generally recognized responsible insurance
companies selected by Borrower and approved by Bank. Such companies must be
authorized to write such insurance in the states of Florida and Arizona.
Each company shall be rated "A" or better by A.M. Best Co., in Bests' Key
Guide, or such other rating acceptable to Bank in Bank's absolute and sole
discretion. All property policies evidencing required insurance shall name
Bank as first mortgagee and loss payee. All liability policies evidencing
required insurance shall name Bank as additional insured. The policies
shall not be cancelable as to the interests of the Bank due to the acts of
Borrower. The policies shall provide for at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice of the cancellation or modification thereof to Bank.

ix Evidence. The original or a certified copy of each
insurance policy or, if acceptable to Bank in its absolute and sole
discretion, certificates of insurance evidencing that such insurance is in
full force and effect, shall be delivered to Bank, together with proof of
the payment of the premiums thereof. At least fifteen (15) days prior to
the expiration of such policies, Borrower shall furnish Bank evidence that
such policy has been renewed or replaced in the form of the original or a
certified copy of the renewal or replacement policy or, if acceptable to
Bank in its absolute and sole discretion, a certificate reciting that there
is in full force and effect, with a term covering at least the next
succeeding calendar year, insurance of the types and in the amounts required
in this Section 6.7.

viii Subordination of Other Indebtedness. The indebtedness of Borrower
described in Section 1 shall be subordinated to the Obligations of Borrower
in a manner satisfactory to Bank. So long as no Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default has occurred, Borrower shall be entitled to repay
such indebtedness in the ordinary course of business.

ix ERISA. Borrower will fund each Defined Benefit Plan and Defined
Contribution Plan (as such terms are defined in ERISA) established or
maintained by Borrower so that there is never an Accumulated Funding
Deficiency (as defined in Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended).

x Appraisals. Bank shall have the right to order Unit Base
Appraisals, Raw Land/If Improved Appraisals and Improved Lot Appraisals from
time to time. Each Appraisal is subject to review and approval by Bank.
Borrower agrees upon demand by Bank to pay to Bank the cost and expense for
such Appraisals and a fee determined by Bank for review of each such
Appraisal by Bank. All FNMA appraisals or other appraisals of Units
accepted by Bank that do not have a specific expiration date shall be
updated at Bank's request. Based on the updated, respective Unit Base
Appraised Value, Raw Land/If Improved Appraised Value and Improved Lot
Appraised Value approved or determined by Bank in its absolute and sole
discretion, Bank shall have the right to revise the Unit Budget and the
Maximum Allowed Advances applicable to any Mandatory Collateral at any time.
If the outstanding principal amount of Advances exceeds the available
Commitment as a result of such revision, then Borrower shall be required to
make a mandatory prepayment to Bank pursuant to Section 3.5.

xi Commencement and Completion. As requested by Bank, Borrower shall
cause construction of Improvements and Units to be prosecuted and completed
in good faith, with due diligence, and without delay. Borrower may commence
construction of Improvements and Units at any time. Each Unit shall be
fully completed and ready for occupancy not later than the respective Unit
Completion Date or shall be excluded from Eligible Collateral on the
respective Unit Completion Date. Borrower shall obtain the issuance of a
permanent certificate of occupancy or other equivalent permit required by
the applicable Governmental Authority and, if requested by Bank, deliver a
copy thereof to Bank on or before the respective Unit Completion Date.
Borrower shall cause Units to be constructed (i) in a good and workmanlike
manner, (ii) in compliance with all applicable Requirements, and (iii),
unless otherwise consented to by Bank in advance in writing in the absolute
and sole discretion of Bank, in accordance with the respective Unit Plans
and Specifications. Upon demand by Bank, Borrower shall correct any defect
in the Units or any departure from any applicable Requirements or, to the
extent not theretofore approved in writing by Bank, the respective Unit
Plans and Specifications. Borrower understands and agrees that inspection
of the Units by or on behalf of Bank, the review by Bank of Draw Requests
and related documents and information, the making of Advances by Bank, any
actions by Bank under Section 6.13, and any other actions by Bank shall not
be a waiver of Bank's right to require compliance with this Section 6.11.

xii Title Insurance. If Title Company pays any claims under any Title
Policies, Borrower will take any and all actions necessary to cause the
total liability under the Title Policies to remain at or to be increased to
the Commitment Amount notwithstanding the payment of such claim or claims,
including without limitation, providing any supplemental Title Policies or
endorsements or reinsurance agreements if requested by Bank, the cost of
which shall be paid by Borrower. Upon payment of any such claims, Borrower
will obtain and provide to Bank any and all documentation reasonably
requested by Bank to ensure that the maximum coverage provided for hereunder
shall not have been diminished as a result of the payment of such claims.

xiii Rights of Inspection; Correction of Defects; Agency. Bank and its
agents, employees, and representatives shall have the right at any time and
from time to time to enter upon the Project in order to inspect the Project.
If Bank, in its judgment, determines that any materials or work do not
conform with the respective Unit Plans and Specifications or with any
applicable Requirements or are otherwise not in conformity with sound
building practice, Bank shall have the right to stop the work and to order
replacement or correction of any such materials or work regardless of
whether or not such materials or work have theretofore been incorporated in
the Units, regardless of whether Bank's representatives have previously
inspected such work or materials, and regardless of whether Bank has
previously made Advances to pay for such work or materials. Borrower shall
promptly make such replacement or correction. Inspection by Bank or by
Bank's inspectors of the Project or the Units is for the sole purpose of
protecting the security of Bank and is not to be construed as a
representation by Bank that there has been compliance with the Unit Plans
and Specifications or the applicable Requirements or that the Units are free
of defects in materials or workmanship. Borrower may make or cause to be
made such other independent inspections as Borrower may desire for its own
protection. Borrower hereby appoints and authorizes Bank, as Borrower's
agent and attorney-in-fact, to record any notices of completion, cessation
of labor, and other notices that Bank determines to be necessary to record
to protect any interest of Bank under the Loan Documents. This agency and
power of attorney is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. Based on
any such inspections, Bank shall have the right in its absolute and sole
discretion to revise the Unit Budget and the Maximum Allowed Advances
applicable to any Raw Land, Improved Lot or Unit at any time. If the
outstanding principal amount of advances exceeds the Available Commitment as
a result of such revision, then Borrower shall be required to make a
mandatory prepayment to Bank pursuant to Section 3.5.

xiv Miscellaneous. Any inspections or determinations made by Bank or
lien waivers, receipts, or other agreements, documents, and instruments
obtained by Bank are made or obtained solely for Bank's own benefit and not
in any way for the benefit or protection of Borrower. Bank may accept and
rely on any information from Architect, any other Person providing labor,
materials, or services for Improvements or Units, Borrower, or any other
Person as to labor or materials furnished or incorporated in the
Improvements or Units and the cost and payment therefor and as to all other
matters relating to construction of Improvements or the Units and the
Project without the necessity of verifying such information. Bank has no
obligation to Borrower to ensure compliance by Architect or any other Person
in carrying out construction of the Improvements or Units.

xv Verification of Costs. Bank shall have the right at any time and
from time to time to review and verify all costs, expenses, and fees in each
Unit Budget. Based on its review and verification of costs, expenses, and
fees in each Unit Budget, Bank shall have the right to adjust any and all
such budgeted amounts.

xvi Use of Proceeds of Advances. Borrower shall use proceeds of
Advances only for the purposes described in Sections 3.3.2 and 5.1.6.

xvii Cross-Collateralization. At Bank's request at any time and from
time to time, Borrower agrees to execute and deliver such additional
agreements, documents, and instruments as Bank determines to be necessary or
appropriate so that all Collateral shall also secure any or all (as
determined by Bank) other obligations of Borrower to Bank and/or so that any
or all property, interests in property, and rights to property selected by
Bank securing other obligations of Borrower to Bank also secure the
Obligations. Borrower agrees to pay all costs, expenses, and fees incurred
by Bank in connection with any and all such cross-collateralization requests
by Bank (including, without limitation, taxes, costs, expenses, and fees of
Bank's attorneys).

xviii Lender's Inspector(s). Borrower agrees that during construction of
Units, Bank shall have the right to employ an outside inspector or
inspectors who shall review as agent for Bank all construction activities
undertaken in regard to Units and who shall prepare reports of such reviews.
Alternatively, Bank may elect to have employees of Bank perform such reviews
and prepare such reports. In addition, the employees of Bank will review
the inspection reports of any outside inspector(s), will review Draw
Requests, will perform other activities related to Draw Requests, and will
perform other activities in administering and monitoring the Advances.

xix Further Assurances. Borrower shall promptly execute, acknowledge,
and deliver such additional agreements, documents, and instruments and do or
cause to be done such other acts as Bank may reasonably request from time to
time to better assure, preserve, protect, and perfect the interest of Bank
in the Collateral and the rights and remedies of Bank under the Loan
Documents.

xx Costs and Expenses of Borrower's Performance of Covenants and
Satisfaction of Conditions. Borrower will perform all of its obligations
and satisfy all conditions under the Loan Documents at its sole cost and
expense.

xxi Payment of Net Sales Proceeds. Borrower shall, upon the closing of
a sale of any Unit, Improved Lot or parcel of Raw Land, pay to Bank for
application to the outstanding unpaid aggregate amount of Advances
hereunder, an amount equal to the Net Sales Proceeds from such sale and, if
applicable, any Shortage. To the extend that such Net Sales Proceeds are
held by Title Company or any other Person, Borrower shall take all action
requested by Bank to cause such Net Sales Proceeds to be paid directly to
Bank. If Borrower collects or receives any such Net Sales Proceeds,
Borrower shall forthwith, upon receipt, transmit and deliver the same to
Bank, in the form of cash. Any such amounts which may be so received by
Borrower will not be commingled with any other of Borrower's funds or
property, but will be held separate and apart from Borrower's own funds or
property and upon express trust for Bank until delivery is made to Bank.

xxii Financial Covenants. Borrower shall maintain, at all times:

i Tangible Net Worth. Tangible Net Worth in an amount not less
than $24,000,000.00 as of November 30, 1994, and increasing thereafter
during each fiscal quarter (with the first such fiscal quarter commencing
December 1, 1994) by an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of Borrower's
net profit after tax, as shown on Borrower's quarterly financial statements
delivered to Bank pursuant to Section 6.3.1.2 for the immediately preceding
fiscal quarter.

ii Debt to Tangible Net Worth Ratio. A Debt to Tangible Net
Worth Ratio of not more than 1.4 to 1.

iii Spec and Model Limit. An inventory of Spec Units and Model
Units that in the aggregate does not exceed the number of Presold Units.

xxiii Construction and Sales Records. Borrower shall, at all
times, maintain complete and accurate records of Borrower's construction and
sales activities and shall, upon prior notice thereof by Bank, permit Bank
to review such records upon request by Bank at any time and from time to
time during regular business hours. Such records shall include, without
limitation, (i) any and all documents, instruments, contracts and agreements
relating to the construction or sale of Units or Improvements entered into
by Borrower with or for the benefit of purchasers, contracts,
subcontractors, or other Persons, as applicable, (ii) lien waivers and
releases with respect to all construction in place, (iii) requests for
disbursement and voucher submitted by contracts, subcontractors, or other
Persons, and (iv) all permits, licenses and approvals necessary for the
continuation and completion of construction.

BORROWER NEGATIVE COVENANTS. Until the Commitment terminates in full and
the Obligations are paid and performed in full, Borrower agrees that, unless
Bank otherwise agrees in writing in Bank's absolute and sole discretion:

i Corporate, Limited Liability Company, and Partnership Restrictions.
If Borrower is a corporation, a limited liability company, or a partnership,
Borrower shall not issue any capital stock or other securities of or any
limited liability company interest or partnership interest in Borrower or
grant any option, right-of-first-refusal, warrant, or other right to
purchase any capital stock or other securities of or any limited liability
company interest or partnership interest in Borrower, except to CHHC.
Borrower shall not be dissolved or liquidated. Borrower shall not amend,
modify, restate, supplement, or terminate its certificate of incorporation
or bylaws, its limited liability company operating agreement, or its
partnership agreement, as the case may be. If a corporation, Borrower shall
not reorganize itself or consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or permit any other corporation to be merged into Borrower. If
a limited liability company, Borrower shall not consolidate or merge with
any corporation, any other limited liability company, or any other legal
entity.

ii Change in or Reacquisition of Ownership Interests in Borrower. In
addition to any requirement in any other Loan Document, if Borrower is a
corporation, a limited liability company, or a partnership, Borrower will
not repurchase any capital stock of or any limited liability company
interest or partnership interest in Borrower or any option, right-of-first
refusal, warrant or other right to purchase any capital stock or other
securities of or any limited liability company interest or partnership
interest in Borrower. In addition, Borrower will not suffer to occur or
exist, whether occurring voluntarily or involuntarily, after the date of
this Agreement any change in the legal or beneficial ownership of any
capital stock of or limited liability company interest or partnership
interest in Borrower, without the prior written consent of Bank in its
absolute and sole discretion.

iii Other Indebtedness. Borrower shall not grant a Lien or Encumbrance
on any asset of Borrower as security for any Debt except (i) pursuant to
this Agreement; (ii) the Liens and Encumbrances granted by Borrower to
NationsBank of Florida encumbering property located in Florida and securing
repayment of that promissory note in the original principal amount of
$20,000,000.00, to be executed by Borrower in connection with CHHC's
acquisition of the stock of Borrower, and which will be payable to
NationsBank of Florida; and (iii) Nonrecourse Debt and/or Seller Financing
not to exceed in the aggregate $2,500,000.00 at any time. For purposes of
this Section 7.3, Debt specifically includes any indebtedness of Borrower
subordinated to the Obligations of Borrower pursuant to Section 6.8.

BANK'S OBLIGATIONS TO BORROWER ONLY AND DISCLAIMER BY BANK. No Person,
other than Borrower and Bank, shall have any rights hereunder or be a third-
party beneficiary hereof. Bank is not a joint venturer or a partner with
Borrower. Prior to an Event of Default and thereafter until Bank elects in
writing to assume specific obligations of Borrower, Bank shall not be
obligated to any Person providing labor, materials, or other services for
the Project and payment of funds from Advances directly to any such Persons
shall not give or be a recognition of any third-party beneficiary status.

PUBLICITY. Bank shall have the right to place one or more signs on the
Lots at location(s) visible from public street(s) indicating that Bank has
provided financing for the Project.

NO BROKERS. Except as disclosed by Borrower to Bank in writing prior to
the date of this Agreement, each of Borrower and Bank represent and warrant
to the other that it knows of no broker's or finder's fee due in respect of
the transaction described in this Agreement and that it has not used the
services of a broker or a finder in connection with this transaction.

PROVISIONS IN THE NOTE GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT. This Agreement is subject
to certain terms and provisions in the Note, to which reference is made for
a statement of such terms and provisions.

ASSUMED NAMES. Borrower acknowledges that Borrower sometimes does
business under the name Heftler Homes. For purposes of the Loan Documents,
"Borrower" shall mean Heftler Realty Co. and Heftler Realty Co. doing
business under each and all of the assumed names for Borrower described in
this Section 12.

COUNTERPART EXECUTION. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same document. Signature pages may be
detached from the counterparts and attached to a single copy of this
Agreement to physically form one document.

COMPLETE AGREEMENT. The written Loan Documents represent the final
agreement and reflect the reasonable expectations of the parties and may not
be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous, or subsequent oral
agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral agreements between
the parties.

CHOICE OF LAW. The Loan Documents shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Arizona, without giving effect to conflict of laws principles,
except that the laws of the State of Florida shall govern the creation,
attachment, perfection, priority, and foreclosure of liens on the Collateral
located in Florida, and except to the extent such laws are preempted by
applicable federal laws.

SAVINGS CLAUSE. This Agreement and all of the other Loan Documents are
intended to be performed in accordance with, and only to the extent
permitted by, all applicable usury laws. If any provision hereof or of any
of the other Loan Documents or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance shall, for any reason and to any extent, be invalid or
unenforceable, neither the application of such provision to any other person
or circumstance nor the remainder of the instrument in which such provision
is contained shall be affected thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest
extent permitted by law. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the
intent of the holder hereof to at all times comply with the usury and other
applicable laws now or hereafter governing the interest payable on the
indebtedness evidenced by the Note. If at any time from any circumstance
whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof shall render usurious, or if
the applicable law is ever revised, repealed or judicially interpreted so as
to render usurious, any amount called for under the Note, this Agreement, or
under any of the other Loan Documents, or contracted for, charged, taken,
reserved or received with respect to the indebtedness evidenced by the Note,
or if Bank's exercise of the option to accelerate the maturity of the Note,
or if any prepayment by Borrower results in Borrower having paid any
interest in excess of that permitted by law, then it is the express intent
of Borrower and Bank that all excess amounts theretofore collected by Bank
be credited on the principal balance of the Note (or, if the Note and all
other indebtedness arising under or pursuant to the other Loan Documents
have been paid in full, refunded to Borrower), and the provisions of the
Note and the other Loan Documents immediately be deemed reformed and the
amounts thereafter collectable hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the
necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the
then applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount
otherwise called for hereunder or thereunder. All sums paid, or agreed to
be paid, by Borrower for the use, forbearance, detention, taking, charging,
receiving or reserving of the indebtedness of Borrower to Bank under the
Note or arising under or pursuant to the other Loan Documents shall, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until
payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of such
indebtedness does not exceed the usury ceiling from time to time in effect
and applicable to such indebtedness for so long as such indebtedness is
outstanding. To the extent federal law permits Bank to contract for, charge
or receive a greater amount of interest, Bank will rely on federal law, for
the purpose of determining the Maximum Rate. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, it is
not the intention of Bank to accelerate the maturity of any interest that
has not accrued at the time of such acceleration or to collect unearned
interest at the time of such acceleration.

PROMISSORY NOTE

Principal Amount: $10,000,000.00 Date: November 17, 1994
Home Office, Phoenix, Arizona

PROMISE TO PAY AND INTEREST. For value received, the undersigned
("Borrower"), promises to pay to BANK ONE, ARIZONA, NA, a national banking
association, or order ("Bank") at its above office, or at such other place
as Bank may designate in writing, in lawful money of the United States of
America, the principal sum of TEN MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS
($10,000,000.00), or such lesser amount as shall have been disbursed and is
unpaid as shown on the records of Bank which shall be conclusive as to such
amount, with interest thereon from the date advanced at the applicable rate
from time to time ("Interest Rate") from time to time on each advance
("Advance") under the Loan Agreement of even date herewith between Borrower
and Bank, as amended, modified, extended, renewed, restated, and
supplemented from time to time ("Loan Agreement"), from the date advanced as
follows:

(a) Except to the extent that an Advance bears interest at
the Fixed Rate, as defined herein, pursuant to this Note, interest
shall accrue on the unpaid principal of each Advance at the
Variable Rate. Interest at the Variable Rate shall be computed on
the basis of a 360 day year and accrue on a daily basis for the
actual number of days elapsed.

(b) To the extent Borrower shall elect as provided in this
Note and to the extent not otherwise provided in this Note,
interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal of an Advance at the
Fixed Rate. Interest at the Fixed Rate shall be computed on the
basis of a 360 day year and accrue on a daily basis for the actual
number of days elapsed.

As used in this Note:

"Business Day" means a day of the year on which banks are not required
or authorized to close in Phoenix, Arizona, and, with respect to a Fixed
Rate Advance, a day on which dealings are carried on in the London interbank
market.

"Eurocurrency Liabilities" has the meaning assigned to that term in
Regulation D of the Board of Governors to the Federal Reserve System, as in
effect from time to time.

"Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage" for the Interest Period for each
Fixed Rate Advance means the reserve percentage applicable two (2) Business
Days before the first day of such Interest Period under regulations issued
from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(or any successor) for determining the maximum reserve requirement
(including, but not limited to, any emergency, supplemental, or other
marginal reserve requirement) for a member bank of the Federal Reserve
System in San Francisco with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of
or including Eurocurrency Liabilities (or with respect to any other category
of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the Interest
Rate on Fixed Rate Advances is determined) having a term equal to such
Interest Period.

"Fixed Rate" means the rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) two and
one-half percent (2.5%) per annum, and (ii) the rate per annum obtained by
dividing (A) the rate of interest determined by Bank, based on Telerate
System reports or such other source as may be selected by Bank, to be the
"London Interbank Offered Rate" at which deposits in United States dollars
are offered by major banks in London, England, one (1) Business Day before
the first day of the respective Interest Period by (B) a percentage equal to
one hundred percent (100%) minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage for
the period equal to such Interest Period.

"Fixed Rate Advance" means an Advance that bears or is requested to
bear interest at the Fixed Rate.

"Interest Period" means, for each Fixed Rate Advance, the period
commencing on the date of such Fixed Rate Advance and ending on the last day
of the period selected by Borrower pursuant to the provisions herein and,
thereafter, each subsequent period commencing on the last day of the
immediately preceding Interest Period and ending on the last day of the
period selected by Borrower pursuant to the provisions herein. The duration
of each Interest Period shall be 30, 60, 90, or 120 days, as selected by
Borrower (A), for a new Advance, in the request for a Fixed Rate Advance or
(B), for an outstanding Advance, in the request for a Fixed Rate Advance to
continue bearing interest at the Fixed Rate; provided, however, that:

(i) Interest Periods commencing on the same date shall be of
the same duration;

(ii) Whenever the last day of any Interest Period
would otherwise occur on a day other than a Business Day, the last
day of such Interest Period shall be extended to occur on the next
succeeding Business Day, provided that if such extension would
cause the last day of such Interest Period to occur in the next
following calendar month, the last day of such Interest Period
shall occur on the next preceding Business Day; and

(iii) No Interest Period with respect to any Advance shall
extend beyond the Maturity Date.

"Regulatory Change" means any change effective after the date of this
Note in United States federal, state, or foreign law, regulations, or rules
or the adoption or making after such date of any interpretation, directive,
or request applying to a class of banks including Bank, of or under any
United States federal, state, or foreign law, regulation or rule (whether or
not having the force of law) by any court or governmental or monetary
authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof.

"Variable Rate" means the rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) one-
half of one percent (.5%) per annum, and (ii) the rate per annum most
recently publicly announced by Bank, or its successors, in Phoenix, Arizona,
as its "prime rate," as in effect from time to time. The Variable Rate will
change on each day that the "prime rate" changes. The "prime rate" is not
necessarily the best or lowest rate offered by Bank, and Bank may lend to
its customers at rates that are at, above, or below its "prime rate."

"Variable Rate Advance" means an Advance that bears or that is
requested to bear interest at the Variable Rate.

Each request for an Advance under the Loan Agreement shall, in addition
to complying with the other requirements in the Loan Agreement, (i) specify
the date and amount of the requested Advance, (ii) specify whether the
Advance shall be an Advance that bears interest at the Variable Rate or
shall be an Advance that bears interest at the Fixed Rate, and (iii) if the
Advance is to bear interest at the Fixed Rate, (A) specify the Interest
Period, (B) be delivered to Bank at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
date of the requested Advance, (C) be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 with
integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof, and (D), when added to the
number of previous Advances bearing interest at the Fixed Rate, not cause
the aggregate number of all outstanding Advances bearing interest at the
Fixed Rate to exceed three (3). Any Advance not complying with the
foregoing requirements for an Advance bearing interest at the Fixed Rate
shall bear interest at the Variable Rate.

If Borrower desires that a Fixed Rate Advance continue to bear interest
at the Fixed Rate after the end of an existing Interest Period, Borrower
shall deliver to Bank a notice making such election and specifying the new
Interest Period. If Borrower does not deliver such notice within such time,
then after the existing Interest Period the Fixed Rate Advance shall become
a Variable Rate Advance and shall bear interest at the Variable Rate.

Borrower may on any Business Day, upon written notice to and received
by Bank not later than 12:00 p.m. (Phoenix, Arizona local time) (i) on the
second Business Day, in the case of any conversion of a Variable Rate
Advance into a Fixed Rate Advance and (ii) on the first Business Day in the
case of any conversion of a Fixed Rate Advance into a Variable Rate Advance,
prior to the date of the proposed conversion, convert any Advance of one
type into an Advance of the other type; provided, however, that any
conversion of a Fixed Rate Advance (A) shall only be made on the last day of
the applicable Interest Period, (B) shall be made only as to an Advance in a
minimum amount of $1,000,000 with integral multiples of $500,000 in excess
thereof, and (C) shall not result after such requested conversion in the
aggregate number of Fixed Rate Advances exceeding three (3). Each such
notice of a conversion shall specify the date of such conversion and the
Advance(s) to be converted.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Loan Documents to the contrary,
Bank shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part
of any Advance in any manner it sees fit; provided, however, that for the
purposes of this Note, all determinations hereunder shall be made as if Bank
had actually funded and maintained each Fixed Rate Advance during the
Interest Period therefor through the purchase of deposits having a maturity
corresponding to the last day of the Interest Period and bearing an interest
rate equal to the Fixed Rate for such Interest Period.

If, due to any Regulatory Change, there shall be any increase in the
cost to Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding, or maintaining Fixed
Rate Advances (including, without limitation, any increase in any applicable
reserve requirement), then Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by
Bank, pay to Bank such amounts as Bank may reasonably determine to be
necessary to compensate Bank for any additional costs that Bank reasonably
determines are attributable to such Regulatory Change and Bank will notify
the Borrower of any Regulatory Change that will entitle Bank to compensation
pursuant to this paragraph as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within 90 days after Bank obtains knowledge thereof; provided, however, that
if Bank fails to give such notice within 90 days after it obtains knowledge
of such a Regulatory Change, Bank shall, with respect to compensation
payable in respect of any costs resulting from such Regulatory Change, only
be entitled to payment for costs incurred from and after the date that Bank
does give such notice. Bank will furnish to Borrower a certificate setting
forth in reasonable detail the basis for the amount of each request by Bank
for compensation under this paragraph. Determinations by Bank of the
amounts required to compensate Bank shall be conclusive, absent manifest
error. Bank shall be entitled to compensation in connection with any
Regulatory Change only for costs actually incurred by Bank.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Loan Documents, if Bank shall
notify Borrower that as a result of a Regulatory Change it is unlawful for
Bank to make Advances at the Fixed Rate, or to fund or maintain Fixed Rate
Advances, (i) the obligations of Bank to make Advances at the Fixed Rate and
to convert Advances to the Fixed Rate shall be suspended until Bank shall
notify Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
exist, and (ii) in the event such Regulatory Change makes the maintenance of
Advances at the Fixed Rate unlawful, Borrower shall forthwith prepay in full
all Fixed Rate Advances then outstanding, together with interest accrued
thereon and all amounts in connection with such prepayment specified in the
paragraph in this Note titled "PREPAYMENT," unless Borrower, within five (5)
Business Days of notice from Bank, converts all Fixed Rate Advances then
outstanding into Variable Rate Advances pursuant to the conversion
procedures in this Note and pays all amounts in connection with such
prepayments or conversions specified in the paragraph in this Note titled
"PREPAYMENT."

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Loan Documents, if prior to
the commencement of any Interest Period, Bank shall determine (i) that
United States dollar deposits in the amount of any Fixed Rate Advance to be
outstanding during such Interest Period are not readily available to Bank in
the London interbank market, or (ii) by reason of circumstances affecting
the London interbank market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the Fixed Rate for such Interest Period in the manner
prescribed above in the definition of "Fixed Rate," then Bank shall promptly
give notice thereof to Borrower and the obligation of Bank to create,
continue, or effect by conversion any Fixed Rate Advance in such amount and
for such Interest Period shall terminate until United States dollar deposits
in such amount and for the Interest Period shall again be readily available
in the London interbank market and adequate and reasonable means exist for
ascertaining the Fixed Rate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the contract rate shall
exceed the Maximum Rate, thereby causing the interest on this Note to be
limited to the Maximum Rate, then any subsequent reduction in the contract
rate shall not reduce the rate of interest on this Note below the Maximum
Rate until the total amount of interest accrued on this Note equals the
amount of interest which would have accrued on this Note if the contract
rate had at all times been in effect. The term "Maximum Rate," as used
herein, shall mean at the particular time in question the maximum rate of
interest which, under applicable law, may then be charged on this Note. If
such maximum rate of interest changes after the date hereof and this Note
provides for a fluctuating rate of interest, the Maximum Rate shall be
automatically increased or decreased, as the case may be, without notice to
Borrower from time to time as of the effective date of each change in such
maximum rate.

All accrued interest shall be due and payable on December 1, 1994, and
continuing on the same day of each successive month thereafter until that
date that is twelve (12) months after the Conversion Date (the "Maturity
Date"); the "Conversion Date" shall have the meaning set forth in the Loan
Agreement. Prior to the Maturity Date, principal shall be due and payable
as provided in the Loan Agreement, including, without limitation, Section
3.4 thereof. All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Loan Agreement. On the
Maturity Date, Borrower shall pay to Bank the unpaid principal, all accrued
and unpaid interest, and all other amounts ("Other Amounts") payable by
Borrower to Bank under the Loan Documents.

Principal shall bear interest at the Interest Rate from the date of
disbursement until the due date thereof, whether due by acceleration or
otherwise. Principal, interest, and Other Amounts not paid when due and any
judgment therefor shall bear interest from its due date or the judgment
date, as applicable, until paid at a rate ("Default Rate") equal to the
lesser of (i) the sum of (A) four percent (4%) per annum and (B) the
Variable Rate; or (ii) the Maximum Rate, if any, and such interest shall be
immediately due and payable.

All interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and
accrue on a daily basis for the actual number of days elapsed. Borrower
agrees to pay an effective rate of interest that is the sum of (i) the
interest rate provided herein and (ii) any additional rate of interest
resulting from any other charges or fees paid or to be paid in connection
herewith that are determined to be interest or in the nature of interest;
provided, however, that in no event shall the amounts payable under clause
(i) and (ii) exceed the Maximum Rate.

APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. At the option of Bank, payments shall be applied
to principal, interest, and Other Amounts in such order as Bank shall
determine. This Note evidences a revolving line of credit. Amounts paid or
prepaid hereunder may be reborrowed in accordance with the Loan Agreement.

PREPAYMENT. Except as to payments due under this paragraph with respect to
payment or conversion of a Fixed Rate Advance on a day other than the last
Business Day in the Interest Period for such Fixed Rate Advance, Borrower
may prepay the outstanding principal balance hereof in whole or in part at
any time prior to the Maturity Date without penalty or premium as stated in
such notice by Borrower; provided, however, that if any payment of all or
any portion of a Fixed Rate Advance shall be made other than on the last day
of the Interest Period for such Fixed Rate Advance for any reason
(including, without limitation, any optional or required prepayment and any
acceleration of the Maturity Date) then, anything in the Loan Documents to
the contrary notwithstanding, Borrower shall pay to Bank contemporaneously
with such prepayment, a payment equal to any losses, costs, or expenses that
Bank may reasonably incur as a result of such prepayment, including, without
limitation, any loss (including, without limitation, loss of anticipated
profits), cost, or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by Bank to fund or maintain
such Fixed Rate Advance. Borrower agrees to also make a payment under the
immediately preceding sentence upon each conversion of a Fixed Rate Advance
to a Variable Rate Advance on a date other than the last Business Day of the
Interest Period for such Fixed Rate Advance to be determined as if the
amount so converted had been prepaid on the date of conversion. The
obligations of Borrower and the rights of Bank under this paragraph shall
survive payment and performance of the obligations of the Loan Parties under
the Loan Documents and shall remain in full force and effect without
termination. Bank will furnish to Borrower a certificate setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the amount of each request by Bank for
payment under this paragraph. The determination by Bank of amounts due
under this paragraph shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

LATE CHARGE. If any payment of principal and/or interest is not received by
Bank within fifteen (15) days after its due date, then, in addition to the
other rights and remedies of Bank, a late charge of four percent (4%) of the
amount due and unpaid will be charged to Borrower without notice to
Borrower, such late charge to be immediately due and payable; provided,
however, that the obligation to pay a late charge shall be subject to the
provisions hereof limiting the charging, collection and receipt of interest
to the Maximum Rate.

NO COUNTERCLAIMS, DEDUCTIONS, ETC. All payments and other obligations of
Borrower under the Loan Documents will be made and performed without
counterclaim, deduction, defense, deferment, reduction, or set-off.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT. Each of the following shall be an event of default
("Event of Default"):

Failure by any Loan Party to pay when due any amount
payable by such Loan Party under any of the Loan Documents or
failure by Borrower to pay when due any other indebtedness of
Borrower to Bank and, in each case, the continuation of such
failure for fifteen (15) days after the due date.

Failure by any Loan Party to comply with Sections 6.22,
7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 of the Loan Agreement.

other Event of Default under this Note) and the continuation of
such failure for thirty (30) days after notice thereof from Bank
(or such shorter period as may otherwise be set forth in the Loan
Documents).

Any representation or warranty made by any Loan Party in
any of the Loan Documents or otherwise or any information
delivered by any Loan Party to Bank in obtaining or hereafter in
connection with the credit evidenced by this Note is materially
incomplete, incorrect, or misleading as of the date made or
delivered.

Bank believes in good faith that a Material Adverse
Change has occurred after the date of the financial statements and
other information provided by any Loan Party in obtaining the
credit evidenced by this Note. "Material Adverse Change" means
any change in the assets, business, financial condition,
operations, or results of operations of any Loan Party or any
other event or condition that in the reasonable opinion of Bank is
(i) reasonably likely to affect the likelihood of performance by
any Loan Party of any of the obligations in the Loan Documents,
(ii) reasonably likely to affect the ability of any Loan Party to
perform any of the obligations in any of the Loan Documents, (iii)
reasonably likely to affect the legality, validity, or binding
nature of any of the obligations in the Loan Documents or any
lien, security interest, or other encumbrance securing any of the
obligations under the Loan Documents, or (iv) reasonably likely to
affect the priority of any lien or encumbrance securing any of the
obligations in the Loan Documents.

Any Loan Party (i) is unable or admits in writing such
Loan Party's inability to pay such Loan Party's monetary
obligations as they become due, (ii) makes a general assignment
for the benefit of creditors, or (iii) applies for, consents to,
or acquiesces in, appointment of a trustee, receiver, or other
custodian for such Loan Party or any or all of the property of
such Loan Party, or in the absence of such application, consent,
or acquiescence by such Loan Party a trustee, receiver, or other
custodian is appointed for such Loan Party or any or all of the
property of such Loan Party.

Commencement of any case under the Bankruptcy Code
(Title 11 of the United States Code) or commencement of any other
bankruptcy, arrangement, reorganization, receivership,
custodianship, or similar proceeding under any federal, state, or
foreign law by or against any Loan Party.

The dissolution or liquidation of any Loan Party; the
consolidation or merger of any Loan Party with any other Person;
or the taking of any action by any Loan Party toward a
dissolution, liquidation, consolidation, or merger.

Any Loan Party or any other person on behalf of any Loan
Party claims that any Loan Document is not legal, valid, binding,
and enforceable against any Loan Party, that any lien, security
interest, or other encumbrance securing any of the obligations
under the Loan Documents is not legal, valid, binding, and
enforceable, or that the priority of any lien, security interest,
or other encumbrance securing any of the obligations in the Loan
Documents is different than the priority represented and warranted
in the Loan Documents.

The occurrence of any condition or event that is a
default or is designated as a default, an event of default, or an
Event of Default in any other Loan Document or in any agreement,
document, or instrument relating to any other indebtedness of

of the issued and outstanding shares of stock in Borrower.

reasonably acceptable to Bank to issue to Bank, within two (2)

and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank concerning CHHC's
acquisition of Borrower's stock as described in Paragraph 14 and
concerning the loan documents executed in connection with this

business days after the date of this Note, a Certificate in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank concerning certain
Indentures executed by CHHC.

RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF BANK. Upon occurrence of an Event of Default, Bank
may, at its option, in its absolute and sole discretion, and without demand
or notice, (i) declare the obligations in the Loan Documents to be
immediately due and payable, whereupon the obligations in the Loan Documents
shall be immediately due and payable, and (ii) exercise any or all other
rights and remedies of Bank concurrently or consecutively in such order as
Bank elects. The rights and remedies of Bank shall be cumulative and non-
exclusive. Delay, discontinuance, or failure to exercise any right or
remedy of Bank shall not be a waiver thereof, or of any other right or
remedy of Bank, or of the time of the essence provision. Exercise of any
right or remedy of Bank shall not cure or waive any Event of Default or
invalidate any act done in response to any Event of Default.

LIMIT ON LIABILITY OF BANK. In exercising rights and remedies, neither Bank
nor any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, or representative
of Bank shall have any liability for any injury to the assets, business,
operations, or property of Borrower or any other liability to Borrower,
other than for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

SURVIVAL. The representations, warranties, and covenants of the Loan
Parties in the Loan Documents shall survive the execution and delivery of
the Loan Documents and the making of advances to Borrower.

INTEGRATION, ENTIRE AGREEMENT, CHANGE, DISCHARGE, TERMINATION, WAIVER,
APPROVAL, CONSENT, ETC. The Loan Documents contain the complete
understanding and agreement of Borrower and Bank and supersede all prior
representations, warranties, agreements, arrangements, understandings, and
negotiations. No provision of the Loan Documents may be changed,
discharged, supplemented, terminated, or waived except in a writing signed
by the parties thereto. Delay or failure by Bank to insist on performance
of any obligation when due or compliance with any other term or condition in
the Loan Documents shall not operate as a waiver thereof or of any other
obligation, term, or condition or of the time of the essence provision.
Acceptance of late payments shall not be a waiver of the time of the essence
provision, the right of Bank to require that subsequent payments be made
when due, or the right of Bank to declare an Event of Default if subsequent
payments are not made when due. Any approval, consent, or statement that a
matter is satisfactory by Bank under the Loan Documents must be in writing
executed by Bank and shall be construed to apply only to the person(s) and
facts specifically set forth in the writing.

BINDING EFFECT. The Loan Documents shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of Bank and the Loan Parties and their successors and assigns
and the executors, legal administrators, personal representatives, heirs,
devisees, and beneficiaries of the Loan Parties; provided, however, that the
Loan Parties may not assign any of their rights or delegate any of their
obligations under the Loan Documents and any purported assignment or
delegation shall be void. Bank may from time to time in its absolute and
sole discretion assign it rights and delegate its obligations under the Loan
Documents, in whole or in part, without notice to or consent by any Loan
Party (including, without limitation, participations). In addition to any
greater or lesser limitation provided by law, no Loan Party shall assert
against any assignee of Bank any claims or defenses such Loan Party may have
against Bank, except claims and defenses arising under the Loan Documents.

COSTS, EXPENSES, AND FEES. Borrower agrees to pay on demand all external
and internal costs, expenses, and fees (including, without limitation, as
applicable, inside and outside attorneys, paralegals, document clerks and
specialists, appraisal, appraisal review, environmental assessment,
environmental testing, environmental cleanup, other inspection, processing,
title, filing, and recording costs, expenses, and fees) of Bank (i) in the
negotiation, execution, delivery, and modification of the Loan Documents,
(ii) in the making of advances, in the monitoring the activities of
Borrower, and otherwise in administering the credit evidenced by this Note,
(iii) in enforcement of the Loan Documents and exercise of the rights and
remedies of Bank, (iv) in defense of the legality, validity, binding nature,
and enforceability of the Loan Documents and the perfection and priority of
the liens and encumbrances granted in the Loan Documents, (v) in gaining
possession of, holding, repairing, maintaining, preserving, and protecting
the property ("Collateral") securing the obligations in the Loan Documents,
(vi) in selling or otherwise disposing of the Collateral, (vii) otherwise in
relation to the Loan Documents, the Collateral, or the rights and remedies
of Bank under the Loan Documents or relating to the Collateral, and (viii)
in preparing for the foregoing, whether or not any legal proceeding is
brought or other action is taken. Such costs, expenses, and fees shall
include, without limitation, all such costs, expenses, and fees incurred in
connection with any bankruptcy, receivership, replevin, or other court
proceedings (whether at the trial or appellate level). Borrower agrees, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, to pay interest on such costs,
expenses, and fees at the Default Rate from the date incurred by Bank until
paid in full.

SEVERABILITY. If any provision or any part of any provision of the Loan
Documents is unenforceable, the enforceability of the other provisions or
the other provisions and the remainder of the subject provision,
respectively, shall not be affected and they shall remain in full force and
effect.

CHOICE OF LAW. The Loan Documents shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Arizona, without giving effect to conflict of laws principles,
except that the laws of the State of Florida shall govern the creation,
attachment, perfection, priority, and foreclosure of liens on the Collateral
located in Florida, and except to the extent such laws are preempted by
applicable federal laws.

TIME OF ESSENCE. Time is of the essence with regard to each provision of
the Loan Documents as to which time is a factor.

NOTICES AND DEMANDS. All demands or notices under the Loan Documents shall
be in writing (including, without limitation, telecopy, telegraphic, telex,
or cable communication) and mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed,
cabled, or delivered to the respective party hereto at the address specified
at the end of this paragraph or such other address as shall have been

be effective upon the earlier of (i) actual receipt by the addressee, and

JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS. All obligations in any of the Loan Documents
executed by more than one Loan Party shall be the joint and several
obligations of each such person, and each reference in any Loan Document to
Borrower, Obligor, or Trustor shall be a reference to each such person
individually and all such persons collectively.

COMMUNITY PROPERTY AND SEPARATE PROPERTY OF BORROWER. If Borrower includes
one or more persons who are married to each other or to other persons, each
such person included in Borrower agrees that (i) the Loan Documents executed
by Borrower are made on behalf of the marital community of each person
included in Borrower and his or her spouse, and (ii) Bank may have recourse
against the separate property of each person included in Borrower and the
community property of each such person included in Borrower and his or her
spouse for satisfaction of the obligations of Borrower under the Loan
Documents.

BANK'S RIGHT OF SET-OFF. Borrower grants to Bank (i) the right at any time
and from time to time after an Event of Default, in the absolute and sole
discretion of Bank and without demand or notice to the Borrower, to set-off
and apply deposits (whether certificates of deposit, demand, general,
savings, special, time, or other, and whether provisional or final) held by
Bank for Borrower and any other liabilities or other obligations of Bank to
Borrower ("Deposits, Liabilities, and Obligations") against or to the
obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents, regardless of whether the
Deposits, Liabilities, and Obligations are contingent, matured, or
unmatured, and (ii) a security interest in the Deposits, Liabilities, and
Obligations to secure the obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents.
In addition, Borrower grants to Bank the right upon the occurrence of an
event that with notice, passage of time, or both would be an Event of
Default to segregate all Deposits, Liabilities, and Obligations into an
account or otherwise under the sole control of Bank.

INDEMNIFICATION OF BANK. Borrower agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and
on demand defend Bank and its stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, and representatives for, from, and against any and all damages,
losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation,
costs and expenses of litigation and reasonable attorneys' fees) arising
from any claim or demand in respect of the Loan Documents, the Collateral,
or the transaction described in the Loan Documents and arising at any time,
whether before or after payment and performance of the Obligations in full,
excepting any such matters arising solely from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Bank. The obligations of Borrower and the rights of
Bank under this paragraph shall survive payment and performance of the
Obligations in full and shall remain in full force and effect without
termination.

RESCISSION OR RETURN OF PAYMENTS. If at any time or from time to time,
whether before or after payment and performance of the obligations of the
Loan Parties under the Loan Documents in full, all or any part of any amount
received by Bank in payment of, or on account of, any obligation of the Loan
Parties under the Loan Documents is or must be, or is claimed to be,
avoided, rescinded, or returned by Bank to Borrower or any other Person for
any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, bankruptcy,
insolvency, or reorganization of Borrower or any other Person), such
obligation and any liens, security interests, and other encumbrances that
secured such obligations at the time such avoided, rescinded, or returned
payment was received by Bank shall be deemed to have continued in existence
or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, all as though such payment had
not been received.

NO CONSTRUCTION AGAINST BANK OR BORROWER. The Loan Documents are the result
of negotiations between Borrower and Bank. Accordingly, the Loan Documents
shall not be construed for or against Borrower or Bank, regardless of which
party drafted the Loan Documents or any part thereof.

HEADINGS. The headings at the beginning of each section of the Loan
Documents are solely for convenience and are not part of the Loan Documents.

NUMBER AND GENDER. In the Loan Documents the singular shall include the
plural and vice versa and each gender shall include the other genders.

MULTIPLE CREDIT ACCOMMODATIONS. If from time to time Borrower has more than
one loan or other credit accommodation with Bank, Borrower agrees that,
unless otherwise agreed by Bank and Borrower in writing, (i) the Loan
Documents and the agreements, documents, and instruments evidencing and
relating to such other loan(s) and credit accommodation(s) shall all remain
in effect and neither shall supersede the other, regardless of whether the
Loan Documents and such other agreements, documents, and instruments have
differing terms, conditions, and requirements, and (ii), regardless of any
such differences, Borrower shall comply with all the terms, conditions, and
requirements of the Loan Documents and of such other agreements, documents,
and instruments.

WAIVER OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. Borrower waives, to the full extent
permitted by law, the right to plead any statutes of limitations as a
defense to any or all obligations under the Loan Documents.

WAIVERS BY BORROWER. Borrower (i) waives, to the full extent permitted by
law, presentment, notice of dishonor, protest, notice of protest, notice of
intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, notice of dishonor, and all
other notices or demands of any kind (except notices specifically provided
for in the Loan Documents), and (ii) agrees that Bank may enforce this Note
and any other Loan Documents against any person included in Borrower without
first having sought enforcement against any other Loan Party or any
Collateral.

SAVINGS CLAUSE. This Note and all of the other Loan Documents are intended
to be performed in accordance with, and only to the extent permitted by, all
applicable usury laws. If any provision hereof or of any of the other Loan
Documents or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall,
for any reason and to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, neither the
application of such provision to any other person or circumstance nor the
remainder of the instrument in which such provision is contained shall be
affected thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by
law. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of the holder
hereof to at all times comply with the usury and other applicable laws now
or hereafter governing the interest payable on the indebtedness evidenced by
this Note. If at any time from any circumstance whatsoever, fulfillment of
any provision hereof shall render usurious, or if the applicable law is ever
revised, repealed or judicially interpreted so as to render usurious, any
amount called for under this Note or under any of the other Loan Documents,
or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received with respect to the
indebtedness evidenced by this Note, or if Bank's exercise of the option to
accelerate the maturity of this Note, or if any prepayment by Borrower
results in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by
law, then it is the express intent of Borrower and Bank that all excess
amounts theretofore collected by Bank be credited on the principal balance
of this Note (or, if this Note and all other indebtedness arising under or
pursuant to the other Loan Documents have been paid in full, refunded to
Borrower), and the provisions of this Note and the other Loan Documents
immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectable
hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of
any new document, so as to comply with the then applicable law, but so as to
permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder or
thereunder. All sums paid, or agreed to be paid, by Borrower for the use,
forbearance, detention, taking, charging, receiving or reserving of the
indebtedness of Borrower to Bank under this Note or arising under or
pursuant to the other Loan Documents shall, to the maximum extent permitted
by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout
the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the rate or
amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the usury
ceiling from time to time in effect and applicable to such indebtedness for
so long as such indebtedness is outstanding. To the extent federal law
permits Bank to contract for, charge or receive a greater amount of
interest, Bank will rely on federal law, for the purpose of determining the
Maximum Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or
in any of the other Loan Documents, it is not the intention of Bank to
accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at the time of
such acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the time of such
acceleration.

ARTICLE XI
Bank's Rights and Remedies

The following rights and remedies are available to Bank:

11.1 Acceleration. Upon the occurrence of a Default, the entire
unpaid principal balance of the Loan and all accrued but unpaid interest
thereon and any costs or expenses then due to Bank and any and all other
obligations of Borrower to Bank, shall, at the option of Bank and without
notice to Borrower, become immediately due and payable.

11.2 Completion of Construction. From and after the occurrence of
a Default, Bank shall be entitled to have and use the Plans and the
Construction Documents and, after first having given written notice to the
Architect, the Engineer, or the General Contractor, shall be entitled from
and after such notice to enjoy and enforce all of the rights of Borrower
under the Architect's contract, Engineer's contract, the Plans or the
Construction Contracts. Borrower hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints Bank its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of
substitution in the Approved Projects to complete the Improvements in the
name of Borrower. Borrower hereby empowers Bank as it attorney-in-fact as
follows: (a) to use any funds of Borrower, including any Loan proceeds or
equity deposits which may remain undisbursed hereunder, for the purpose of
completing the Improvements in accordance with the Plans; (b) to make such
additions, changes, modifications, or corrections in, or deviations from,
the Plans as shall be necessary or desirable to complete the Improvements;
(c) to employ such contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects,
engineers, inspectors, or other parties as shall be required for said
purposes; (d) to pay, settle, or compromise all existing bills and claims
which may be liens against the Improvements or as may be necessary or
desirable in the sole discretion of Bank for the completion of the
Improvements or for clearance of title; (e) to direct use of and/or use all
or any part of the labor, materials, supplies and equipment contracted for,
owned by, or under the control of Borrower, whether or not previously
incorporated into the Improvements; (f) to execute all applications and
certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by the
Construction Documents, the Architect's contract, the Engineer's contract,
Plans, or any of the contract documents; (g) to prosecute and defend all
actions or proceedings in connection with the Approved Project or the
construction of the Improvements and take such action and require such
performance as Bank shall deem necessary under any performance or payment
bond; and (h) to do any and every act with respect to construction or
completion of the Improvements or the closing of any permanent financing
which Borrower might do in its own behalf including, without limitation,
execution, acknowledgment, and delivery of all instruments, documents, and
papers in the name of Borrower as may be necessary or desirable in the sole
discretion of Bank. It is further understood and agreed that this power of
attorney which shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest,
cannot be revoked. All sums expended by Bank pursuant hereto shall be
deemed to have been disbursed to Borrower and secured by the Security Docu-
ments, and the other Loan Documents.

11.3 Disputes. Where disputes have arisen which, in the opinion
of Bank, may endanger timely completion of the Improvements or fulfillment
of any condition or covenant herein, Bank may agree to disburse Loan
proceeds for the account of Borrower without prejudice to Borrower's rights,
if any, to recover said proceeds from the party to whom paid. Such
agreement or agreements may take the form which Bank in its discretion deems
proper, including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
agreements to indemnify (on behalf of Borrower and/or for Bank's own
account) any title insurer against possible assertion of lien claims, agree-
ments to pay disputed amounts and the like. All sums paid or agreed to be
paid pursuant to such undertaking shall be advances of Loan proceeds.

11.4 Remedies Cumulative; Nonwaiver. All remedies of Bank
provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents are cumulative and shall
be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies provided for or
available under the other Loan Documents, at law or in equity. The exercise
of any right or remedy by Bank hereunder shall not in any way constitute a
cure or waiver of a Default Condition or a Default hereunder or under the
Loan Documents, or invalidate any act done pursuant to any notice of the
occurrence of a Default Condition or Default, or prejudice Bank in the
exercise of any of its rights hereunder or under any of the other Loan Docu-
ments, unless, in the exercise of said rights, Bank realizes all amounts
owed to it under the Loan Documents.

11.5 No Liability of Bank. Whether or not Bank elects to employ
any or all remedies available to it in the event of an occurrence of a
Default Condition or Default, Bank shall not be liable for the construction
of or failure to construct or complete or protect the Improvements or for
payment of any expense incurred in connection with the exercise or any
remedy available to Bank or for the construction or Completion of the
Improvements or for the performance or nonperformance of any other
obligation of Borrower.

11.6 Security Interest. It is understood and agreed that Bank
shall have and enjoy and is hereby granted a lien on, and a security
interest in, all collateral described in the Mortgage, and including without
limitation, any and all materials (stored on-site or off-site), reserves,
deferred payments, deposits or advance payments for materials (stored on-
site or off-site) undisbursed Loan proceeds, insurance refunds, impound
accounts, refunds for overpayment of any kind, and such lien and security
interest shall constitute additional security for the Indebtedness of
Borrower to Bank, and Bank shall have and possess any and all rights and
remedies of a secured party provided by law with respect to enforcement of
and recovery on its security interest on such items and amounts. In the
event of a conflict between this paragraph and any security interest granted
pursuant to the Mortgage, the Mortgage shall control.

11.7 Cessation of Funding. Upon the occurrence of a Default, Bank
shall have the right to immediately terminate further funding of site
development and construction of all Units then under construction irrespec-
tive of the stage of completion.

conditions contained herein must be in writing and shall not be construed as

Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (J.A.M.S.), and the

city of the Borrower's domicile at time of this Loan Agreement's execution
and administered by J.A.M.S. who will appoint an arbitrator; if J.A.M.S. is
unable or legally precluded from administering the arbitration, then the
American Arbitration Association will serve. All arbitration hearings will

arbitrator shall only, upon a showing of cause, be permitted to extend the

by 12 U.S.C. Sec. 91 or any substantially equivalent state law; or (iii)
limit the right of the Bank hereto (A) to exercise self help remedies such
as (but not limited to) setoff, or (B) to foreclose against any real or

deed of trust or mortgage may be accomplished by any of the following: the
exercise of a power of sale under the deed of trust or mortgage, or by
judicial sale under the deed of trust or mortgage, or by judicial
foreclosure. Neither this exercise of self help remedies nor the
institution or maintenance of an action for foreclosure or provisional or
ancillary remedies shall constitute a waiver of the right of any party,
including the claimant in any such action, to arbitrate the merits of the
controversy or claim occasioning resort to such remedies.

12.13 Disbursement of Loan Funds at Renewal. If, in Bank's
sole and absolute discretion, Bank agrees to extend the Loan, and the
outstanding principal balance of the Loan is less than the original,
principal Loan amount at the time of the extension, then Bank may, in its
sole and absolute discretion, but is not obligated to, disburse sufficient
Loan funds to increase the outstanding principal balance of the Loan up the
original, principal amount of the Loan, provided that Borrower pledges to
Bank as additional security for the Loan liquid collateral in kind and
amount acceptable to Bank in its sole discretion and deposits the same in an
account with Bank. In connection with any such pledge of liquid collateral,
Borrower shall deliver to Bank any original securities or other instruments
evidencing the collateral and shall execute such security agreements,
assignments, powers-of-attorney, stock powers, endorsements, financing
statements or other documentation as Bank may require to establish and
perfect the security interest so granted by Borrower. Nothing contained
herein shall constitute Bank's agreement or commitment to renew the Loan.

THIS AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT made this 16 day of November, 1994,

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, Borrower and Lender have agreed to amend certain terms of the
Loan Agreement between the parties dated August 29, 1994.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the sum of Ten and No/100
($10.00) Dollars and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Article IV, Paragraph 4.20, Loan Fees, shall be amended by the addition
of the following:

In addition to all other amounts due and payable herewith, the Borrower
covenants and agrees to pay to Lender a commitment fee in the amount of
$32,000.00 at closing of the First Loan Modification for the first year of
the initial two (2) year period, and agrees to pay an additional $40,000.00
loan fee on the anniversary date of the Loan. If this First Loan
Modification does not close, then Borrower agrees to pay Lender $16,000.00
as a one-time commitment fee. Borrower further agrees to pay to Lender an
additional commitment fee in the amount of one-half (0.50%) of one
percentage point for each one (1) year extension granted, payable at the
exercise of the extension such that for every year that the Commitment is
outstanding, the Bank shall receive one-half (0.50%) of one percentage
point.

The Letters of Credit issued by Lender under the Loan shall require no
additional commitment fee for the first year of the two (2) year Loan term.
Thereafter, Borrower agrees to pay Lender one half (.50%) of one percent of
the face value of such Letters of Credit on the anniversary date of the
original Closing Date in the event that the commitment fee paid to Lender at
that time excludes Letters of Credit.

2. Article IV, Paragraph 4.25, Miscellaneous, shall be deleted and the
following substituted in its place:

4.25 Miscellaneous. All other Loan Documents or items that are
customarily provided in loan transactions of this type and all other loan
documents or items set forth in the Commitment, as requested by Lender.

3. Article VIII, Paragraph 8.10, Reporting Requirements, Subparagraph (d)
shall be deleted and the following provisions added:

(d) Annually, within ninety (90) days of year end, by August
31st, the Borrower will provide Lender with audited financial statements for
itself, both including and excluding activities related to Arizona real
property set forth on Exhibit "A" attached hereto ("Arizona Property"). Such
audit shall include verification of Borrowing Base asset allocations for
Borrower.

(e) Quarterly, within sixty (60) days of the end of each quarter,
financial statements of Borrower's new parent company, CONTINENTAL HOMES
HOLDING CORP., a Delaware corporation, (hereinafter referred to as
"Continental"), including balance sheet, income statement, and inventory
reports on a project-by-project basis.

(f) Annually, within ninety (90) days of year end, by August
31st, Continental will provide the Lender with current audited financial
statements and such audit shall include consolidating schedules.

(g) Quarterly, within sixty (60) days of each quarter end, the
Borrower will provide Lender with quarterly financial statements for itself,

4. Article VIII, 8.23, Financial Covenants, Paragraphs (a), (b), (e) and

and/or affiliates, shall not at any time be less than $24,000,000.00
effective November ___, 1994, the date upon which the Continental Stock
Purchase Agreement closes.

(b) Ratio of Total Debt to Tangible Net Worth: The "Ratio of
Borrower's Total Debt to Tangible Net Worth", defined as the aggregate of
current liabilities and non-current liabilities (excluding contingent
liabilities) divided by Tangible Net Worth, shall not at any time exceed 1.4
to 1. Borrower's payables to Continental and affiliates will be deducted
from debt when calculating this ratio. Borrower's investments in, and
receivables from Continental and affiliates will be deducted from Tangible
Net Worth when calculating this ratio.

(e) Minimum Tangible Net Worth Floor. Borrower's Minimum Tangible
Net Worth floor of $24,000,000.00 will be increased by fifty (50%) percent
of Net Income After Taxes on earnings subsequent to October 31, 1994.

(f) Additional Debt. No additional debt shall be incurred, except
as follows:

(i) If present, intercompany debt shall be unsecured and
repayment on same shall be prohibited in the event of default. Furthermore,
intercompany debt shall be junior to Lender's debt, and will be repayable
only in the event that Borrower is not in default and is in full compliance
under the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents.

(ii) Lender will allow a $10,000,000.00 credit facility from
Bank One - Arizona ("Bank One") initially for the acquisition and develop-
ment of the Arizona Property which is being sold to Borrower by Continental
in the latter's leveraged purchase of Borrower. Subsequent to use for the
Arizona Property, the Bank One line of credit may be used for Borrower's
future Florida properties only, except that Lender shall have a right of
first refusal to extend credit on any new projects financed by Borrower, and
Lender through this right of first refusal will have the opportunity to
replace the $10,000,000.00 Bank One line of credit through future increases
to the Loan.

5. Article X, Events of Default, Paragraph 10.1, Default, Subparagraphs
10.1(l) and 10.1(m), shall be amended to add the following:

Lender hereby consents to the sale of all of the outstanding
shares of the Borrower to Continental. Said sale shall be in form and
substance as set forth on Exhibit "B" attached hereto and made a part hereof
by reference. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the approval is subject to
Lender's receipt and satisfactory review of the following:

a. Management contracts between Continental and Borrower's key
management;
b. The appraisal upon the Arizona Property;
c. The definitive agreement between Borrower and Continental and
d. Continental's Bond Indentures.

6. In the event the Stock Purchase Agreement with Continental does not
close, then the financial covenants and reporting requirements provided
above will be null and void, and the financial covenants and reporting
requirements will revert back to those contained in the Loan Agreement.

7. The Commitment Letter from Lender to Borrower Dated November 15, 1994
shall be incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

- - --------------
November 16, 1994
Fort Lauderdale, Florida

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, HEFTLER REALTY CO., a Florida corporation, (some-
times hereinafter referred to as the "undersigned" or the "Borrower"),
promises to pay to the order of NationsBank of Florida, N.A., a national
banking association or any subsequent holder of this note ("Bank") at its
principal offices located at 701 West Cypress Creek Road, Suite 101, Fort
Lauderdale, Florida (or at such other place or places as Bank may designate)
the principal sum of TWENTY MILLION and NO/100 DOLLARS ($20,000,000.00) or
so much thereof as may be from time to time outstanding, plus interest
thereon at the Rate hereinafter defined, all in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Promissory Note (the "Note") and in accordance with
the Loan Agreement dated August 29, 1994, and as amended between Borrower
and Bank (the "Loan Agreement"). This Note is secured by a Real Estate
Mortgage, Assignment and Security Agreement dated August 29, 1994, as
amended, filed for record in the Public Records of Dade and Broward County,
Florida (the "Mortgage"), Security Agreements, UCC Financing Statements
filed for record in the Public Records of Dade and Broward County, Florida,
and in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Florida (the
"Financing Statements"), the Loan Agreement and other agreements by and
between Borrower and Bank. The Mortgage, the Financing Statements, the
Letter(s) of Credit issued by Bank for the benefit of Borrower and such
other agreements are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Security
Documents" and the loan evidenced thereby is hereinafter referred to as the
"Loan." Terms used herein but not otherwise defined hereunder are defined
as set forth in the Security Documents or the Loan Agreement. All of the
terms, definitions, conditions and covenants of the Loan Agreement and the
Security Documents are expressly made a part of this Note by reference in
the same manner and with the same effect as if set forth herein at length,
and any holder of this Note is entitled to the benefits of and remedies
provided in the Loan Agreement and the Security Documents. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Note and the Security Documents, Bank shall
advance funds to Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, such
that Borrower may borrow, partially or wholly repay, and reborrow, on a
revolving basis, up to a maximum principal sum equal to the face amount of
this Note at any one time outstanding.

1. Prime Rate. For purposes hereof, "Prime Rate" means the fluctuating
rate of interest per annum established by Bank as its prime lending rate in
effect from time to time whether or not such rate shall be otherwise
published. Such Prime Rate is established by Bank as an index or base rate
and may or may not at any time be the best or lowest rate of interest
offered by Bank.

2. Interest. The outstanding Loan principal balance shall bear interest at
a variable rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate plus one-half of one
percent (0.50%). The interest rate hereunder shall be adjusted daily in
accordance with fluctuations in the Prime Rate. Interest shall be computed
on the basis of a daily amount of interest accruing on the daily outstanding
principal balance during a 360-day year multiplied by the actual number of
days the principal is outstanding during such applicable interest period.
The initial Prime Rate at the time of execution of this Note is 7.75% so the
initial Note rate is 8.25%.

3. Payment of Interest. Interest accrued in accordance with this Note
shall be due and payable monthly, in arrears, on the first day of each month
immediately following the calendar month for which said interest has
accrued. All accrued but unpaid interest and principal shall be due and
payable in full on the Maturity Date, as defined in Paragraph 6 below. All
payments of principal and interest shall be made in lawful currency of the
United States of America which shall be legal tender in payment of all
debts, public and private, at the time of payment.

4. Prepayment. This Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time
without fee, premium or penalty. Any partial prepayment shall be applied in
accordance with paragraph 10 below and shall not postpone the due date of
any subsequent periodic installments or the Maturity Date, or change the
amount of such installments due, unless Bank shall otherwise agree in
writing.

5. Late Charges. Should Borrower fail to pay the installments of interest
or principal (if applicable) on any due date provided for herein or within
ten (10) days thereafter, then Borrower further promises to pay a late
payment charge equal to four percent (4%) of the amount of the unpaid
installment as liquidated compensation to Bank for the extra expense to Bank
to process and administer the late payment, Borrower agreeing, by execution
hereof, that any other measure of compensation for a late payment is
speculative and impossible to compute. This provision for late charges
shall not be deemed to extend the time for payment or be a "grace period" or
"cure period" that gives Borrower a right to cure a Default or Default
Condition. Imposition of late charges is not contingent upon the giving of
any notice or lapse of any cure period provided for in the Mortgage and
shall not be deemed a waiver of any right or remedy of Bank, including
without limitation, acceleration of this Note.

6. Maturity Date. The then outstanding principal balance plus all accrued
but unpaid interest shall be due and payable on August 29, 1996 (the
"Maturity Date").

7. Default. Any failure of Borrower to comply with any term, covenant, or
condition of this Note, including without limitation, Borrower's failure to
pay principal, interest, or expenses when same shall become due or the
existence of any Default Condition or Default under the Security Documents
or Loan Agreement shall be deemed, at the option of Bank, a Default under
this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall have a ten (10) day
grace period as to the payment of interest and other charges.

8. Acceleration. Upon the occurrence of a Default hereunder or under the
terms of any one or more of the Security Documents or the Loan Agreement,
Bank may declare the then outstanding principal and all accrued but unpaid
interest immediately due and payable and upon acceleration and thereafter
this Note shall bear interest at the Default Rate, hereinafter defined,
until all indebtedness evidenced hereby and secured by the Security Docu-
ments has been paid in full. Further, in the event of such acceleration,
the Loan, and all other indebtedness of Borrower to Bank arising out of or
in connection with the Loan shall become immediately due and payable,
without presentation, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby waived by Borrower.

9. Default Rate. After default or maturity or upon acceleration, and
thereafter, the unpaid indebtedness then evidenced by this Note and due
under and secured by the Security Documents shall bear interest at a fixed
rate equal to the lesser of (a) the maximum rate then permitted under
applicable law, or (b) twenty percent (20%) per annum.

10. Application of Payments. All sums received by Bank for application to
the Loan may be applied by Bank to late charges, expenses, costs, interest,
principal, and other amounts owing to Bank in connection with the Loan in
the order selected by Bank in its sole discretion.

11. Expenses. In the event this Note is not paid when due on any stated or
accelerated maturity date, or should it be necessary for Bank to enforce any
other of its rights under this Note, the Loan Agreement, or the Security
Documents, Borrower will pay to Bank, in addition to principal, interest and
other charges due hereunder or under the Loan Agreement or the Security
Documents, all costs of collection or enforcement, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, paralegals' fees, legal assistants' fees, costs and
expenses, whether incurred with respect to collection, litigation,
bankruptcy proceedings, interpretation, dispute, negotiation, trial, appeal,
defense of actions instituted by a third party against Bank arising out of
or related to the Loan, enforcement of any judgment based on this Note, or
otherwise, whether or not a suit to collect such amounts or to enforce such
rights is brought or, if brought, is prosecuted to judgment. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the prevailing party in any litigation arising out of or
related to the Loan shall recover its fees and costs described in this
subparagraph from the non-prevailing party.

12. Waiver. All persons now or at any time liable for payment of this
Note, whether directly or indirectly, including without limitation any
Guarantor, hereby waive presentment, protest, notice of protest and
dishonor. The undersigned expressly consents to any extensions and
renewals, in whole or in part, to the release of any co-makers and any
collateral security or portions thereof, given to secure this Note, and all
delays in time of payment or other performance which Bank may grant, in its
sole discretion, at any time and from time to time without limitation all
without any notice or further consent of Borrower, and any such grant by
Bank shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent delay or any of Bank's
rights hereunder or under the Loan Agreement or the Security Documents.

13. Usury. In no event shall this or any other provision herein or in the
Loan Agreement or Security Documents, permit the collection of any interest
which would be usurious under the laws of the State of Florida. If any such
interest in excess of the maximum rate allowable under applicable law has
been collected, Borrower agrees that the amount of interest collected above
the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, together with interest thereon
at the rate required by applicable law, shall be refunded to Borrower, and
Borrower agrees to accept such refund, or, at Borrower's option, such refund
shall be applied as a principal payment hereunder.

14. Modification. This Note may not be changed orally, but only by an
agreement in writing signed by the Bank and Borrower.

15. Applicable Law. This Note shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida.

16. Notices. All notices or other communications required or permitted to
be given pursuant to the provisions of this Note shall be given in
accordance with the notice provisions of the Mortgage.

17. Successors and Assigns. As used herein, the terms "Borrower" and
"Bank" shall be deemed to include their respective heirs, personal represen-
tatives, successors and assigns.

18. Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions of this
Note shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable,
in whole or in part or in any respect, or in the event that any one or more
of the provisions of this Note operates or would prospectively operate to
invalidate this Note, then and in any of those events, only such provision
or provisions shall be deemed null and void and shall not affect any other
provision of this Note. The remaining provisions of this Note shall remain
operative and in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
prejudiced, or disturbed thereby. In the event any provisions of this Note
are inconsistent with the provisions of the Loan Agreement, the Security
Documents, or any other agreements or documents executed in connection with
this Note, this Note shall control.

19. Captions; Pronouns. Captions are for reference only and in no way
limit the terms of this Note. The pronouns used in this instrument shall be
construed as masculine, feminine, or neuter as the occasion may require.
Use of the singular includes the plural, and vice versa.

20. Business Day. Any reference herein or in the Loan Agreement or
Security Documents to a day or business day shall be deemed to refer to a
banking day which shall be a day on which Bank is open for the transaction
of business, excluding any national holidays, and any performance which
would otherwise be required on a day other than a banking day shall be
timely performed in such instance, if performed on the next succeeding
banking day. Notwithstanding such timely performance, interest shall
continue to accrue hereunder until such payment or performance has been
made.

21. Mandatory Arbitration. Any controversy or claim between or among the
parties hereto including, but not limited to, those arising out of or
relating to this agreement or any related agreements or instruments,
including any claim based on or arising from an alleged tort, shall be
determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration
Act (or if not applicable, the applicable state law), the Rules of Practice
and Procedure for the Arbitration of Commercial Disputes of Judicial
Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (J.A.M.S.), and the "Special Rules"
set forth below. In the event of any inconsistency, the Special Rules shall
control. Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction. Any party to this agreement may bring an action,
including a summary or expedited proceeding, to compel arbitration of any
controversy or claim to which this agreement applies in any court having
jurisdiction over such action.

(a) Special Rules: The arbitration shall be conducted in the city of
the Borrower's domicile at the time of this agreement's execution and
administered by J.A.M.S. who will appoint an arbitrator; if J.A.M.S. is
unable or legally precluded from administering the arbitration, then the
American Arbitration Association will serve. All arbitration hearings will
be commenced within 90 days of the demand for arbitration; further, the
arbitrator shall only, upon a showing of cause, be permitted to extend the
commencement of such hearing for up to an additional 60 days.

(b) Reservations of Rights: Nothing in this agreement shall be deemed
to (i) limit the applicability of any otherwise applicable statutes of
limitation or repose and any waivers contained in this agreement; or (ii) be
a waiver by the Bank of the protection afforded to it by 12 U.S.C. Section
91 or any substantially equivalent state law; or (iii) limit the right of
the Bank hereto (A) to exercise self help remedies such as (but not limited
to) setoff, or (B) to foreclose against any real or personal property
collateral, or (C) to obtain from a court provisional or ancillary remedies
such as (but not limited to) injunctive relief or the appointment of a
receiver. The Bank may exercise such self help rights, foreclose upon such
property, or obtain such provisional or ancillary remedies before, during or
after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding brought pursuant to this
agreement. At Bank's option, foreclosure under a mortgage or deed of trust
may be accomplished by any of the following: the exercise of a power of
sale under the deed of trust or mortgage, or by judicial sale under the deed
of trust or mortgage, or by judicial foreclosure. Neither this exercise of
self help remedies nor the institution or maintenance of an action for
foreclosure or provisional or ancillary remedies shall constitute a waiver
of the right of any party, including the claimant in any such action, to
arbitrate the merits of the controversy or claim occasioning resort to such
remedies.

22. Future Advance. This Note is a consolidation of that certain Promissory
Note (For Revolving Line of Credit) dated August 29, 1994 in the original

dated November 16, 1994 in the original principal amount of Twelve Million
