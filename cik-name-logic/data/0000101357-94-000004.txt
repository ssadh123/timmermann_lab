Item 5. Other Events.

On June 30, 1994, the Registrant reduced its indebtedness (including that 
of its consolidated, 79%-owned subsidiary, Victoria Creations, Inc.) to 
its senior secured lender to the target amount established in its 
previously announced agreement (copy filed with Registrant's Report on 
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1993, incorporated herein by 
reference) with that lender. At that time, in accordance with the 
agreement, the lender accepted, in full satisfaction of the balance 
(approximately $63.4 million) of the Registrant and its subsidiary's 
indebtedness to the lender, a 5% subordinated income note due June 30, 
2019 in the principal amount of $30 million.

The satisfaction of this indebtedness by the Registrant resulted in an 
extraordinary, non-cash gain from retirement of debt in excess of $30 
million, which will be included in the Registrant's statement of 
operations for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.

The Registrant reduced its indebtedness to the targeted amount through the 
previously announced sales of two of the Registrant's operating divisions, 
sales of certain other assets, and a borrowing of approximately $29 
million, directly and through its subsidiary, from another lender. The 
borrowings from the other lender were under secured promissory notes 
totaling $12 million, with the balance borrowed under revolving loan and 
security agreements. These borrowings are secured by substantially all of 
the Registrant and its subsidiary's assets. The notes and agreements are 
for a period of two years from June 30, 1994, may be prepaid without 
premium or penalty and bear interest at the rate of 24% a year. 

The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Exhibits 
listed below in Item 7 which are herein incorporated by reference.

UNITED MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS, INC.

5% Subordinated Note due June 30, 2019

No. 1 June 30, 1994
$30,000,000

UNITED MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS, INC., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation), for value
received, promises to pay to The CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc., a New
York corporation (the "Holder"), the principal sum of THIRTY MILLION
DOLLARS ($30,000,000), together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
if any, on June 30, 2019 in accordance with the provisions set forth below. 
See Article 8 for certain definitions.

1. Interest.

1.1 Payment of Interest. (i) Subject to Section 1.2 hereof,
the Company promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount hereof
(computed on the basis of a 365-day year for the actual number of days
elapsed) at the interest rate per annum of five percent (5%). The Company
shall pay interest, if applicable, annually for the fiscal year ended June
30, on October 15 of each year or on the 105th day after the end of the
fiscal year if the fiscal year of the Company changes (the "Interest Pay-
ment Date"), commencing October 15, 1995. Interest on this Note shall
accrue from July 1, 1994 until this Note is paid in full; provided,
however, that, except as set forth in Section 2.2, no interest shall accrue
during any fiscal year in which Net Earnings (excluding interest expense,
net of any applicable income tax benefits accrued with respect thereto, on
indebtedness other than Senior Indebtedness) does not exceed the Minimum
Amount. The Company shall cause its accountants to provide to the Holder
certification of the calculation of interest and principal at the time of
the determination thereof.

(ii) The Company shall pay interest on any overdue principal
and, to the extent permitted by law, on any installment of interest from
and after the date when due hereunder at two percent (2%) per annum in
excess of the rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time an-
nounced by Chemical Bank at its principal office as the prime rate.

1.2 Interest Contingent. In the event Net Earnings (excluding
interest expense, net of any applicable income tax benefits accrued with
respect thereto, on indebtedness other than Senior Indebtedness) for any
fiscal year exceed the Minimum Amount, the amount of interest which shall
accrue, and which shall be payable on the next Interest Payment Date, shall
be the lesser of (i) the amount which would be due pursuant to Section
1.1(i) hereof and (ii) the excess of Net Earnings (excluding interest
expense, net of any applicable income tax benefits accrued with respect
thereto, on indebtedness other than Senior Indebtedness) over the Minimum
Amount.

2. Payments.

2.1 Method of Payment. The Holder must, as a requirement to
collect any payment of principal hereunder, endorse on the schedule
attached hereto an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of
each payment of principal; provided that the Holder must surrender this
Note to the Company to collect any final amounts due to the Holder on June
30, 2019. Payments of principal shall be made by wire transfer in immedi-
ately available funds to the Holder's account at a bank in the United
States specified by the Holder, or at the option of the Holder at the time
of surrender by such Holder of this Note, by certified check. Payments of
interest shall be made by wire transfer as set forth above. The Company
shall pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at the
time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. 
If a payment date is a Legal Holiday at a place of payment, payment shall
be made at that place on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal
Holiday.

2.2 Additional Payments. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (a) at the end of each fiscal year, interest and principal shall
accrue in an amount equal to the Blocked Amount for such fiscal year, and
(b) such amount shall be payable five days after the date that the restric-
tions preventing such Blocked Amount from being distributed by a subsidiary
to the Company no longer exist.

3. No Transfer. This Note may not be transferred by sale,
pledge, hypothecation or otherwise; provided, however, that the Holder may,
upon at least 10 days prior notice to the Company, assign or sell its
interest hereunder so long as no more than five (5) total Persons (not
including affiliates of the Holder) are Holders hereunder at any given
time. The Holder hereby represents and warrants that it is purchasing this
Note for its own account for investment and not with a view to the distri-
bution hereof or with any present intention of distributing or selling this
Note. The Holder understands that this Note has not been registered under
the United States Securities Act of 1933 and may be resold (which resale is
not now contemplated) only if registered pursuant to the provisions thereof
or if an exemption from registration is available, and that the Company is
not required to so register the Note.

4. Redemption.

4.1 Optional Redemption. This Note shall be redeemable at the
option of the Company at any time and from time to time, in whole or in
part, by giving a written notice of the portion to be redeemed to the
Holder of the Note, such notice to be given on not less than 30 days nor
more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (the "Redemption
Date"). Any portion of this Note to be redeemed pursuant to this Article 4
shall be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof. On and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to
accrue on the portion of this Note so redeemed, unless the Company defaults
in the payment of the redemption price. To the extent there has been a
partial redemption in any fiscal year pursuant to this Section 4.1 and such
partial redemption occurs on a day (the "Partial Redemption Date") other
than June 30, interest for such fiscal year shall be computed on the
principal amount outstanding for the period from the prior June 30 through
such Partial Redemption Date, and on the remaining principal balance for
the period from the Partial Redemption Date through June 30 of such fiscal
year.

4.2 Additional Redemptions. On each Interest Payment Date, the
Company shall pay to the Holder of the Note an amount equal to 20% of the
excess, if any, of Net Earnings over the Minimum Amount. Such payment will
be applied to reduce the principal amount of the Note as of the date such
payment is made.

5. Successor Corporation.

5.1 When Company May Merge, etc. The Company, in a single
transaction or through a series of related transactions, shall not (a)
consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person, or transfer (by
lease, assignment, sale or otherwise) all or substantially all of its
properties and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to
another Person or group of affiliated Persons, or (b) adopt a Plan of
Liquidation, unless, in either case,

(i) either the Company shall be the continuing Person, or
the Person (if other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or into
which the Company is merged or to which all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety (or, in the case of a Plan of Liquidation, one Person to which
assets are transferred) (the Company or such other person, the "Surviving
Person") shall be a corporation organized and validly existing under the
laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia
and shall expressly assume all the obligations of the Company under this
Note; and

(ii) immediately preceding and immediately after giving
effect to such transaction and the assumption of the obligations as set
forth in clause (i) above and the incurrence or anticipated incurrence of
any indebtedness to be incurred in connection therewith, no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. For purposes of
the foregoing, the transfer (by lease, assignment, sale or otherwise) of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more
subsidiaries, the Capital Stock of which constitutes all or substantially
all of the properties and assets of the Company, shall be deemed to be the
transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Company.

5.2 Surviving Person Substituted. Upon any consolidation or
merger or any transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or any adoption of a Plan of Liquidation in accordance with Section
5.1, the Surviving Person formed by such consolidation or into which the
Company is merged or to which such transfer is made (or, in the case of a
Plan of Liquidation, to which assets are transferred) shall succeed to, and
be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company
under this Note with the same effect as if such Surviving Person had been
named as the Company herein.

6. Default and Remedies.

6.1 Event of Default. An "Event of Default" occurs if:

(i) the Company defaults in the payment of interest on this
Note when the same becomes due and payable and the Default continues for a
period of 30 days;

(ii) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal
of this Note when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity,
upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise and the Default continues for a
period of 10 days;

(iii) the Company pursuant to or within the meaning of any
Bankruptcy Law:

(A) commences a voluntary case or proceeding;

(B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in
an involuntary case or proceeding;

(C) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all
or substantially all of its property; or

(D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;

(iv) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or
decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:

(A) is for relief against the Company in an involuntary case or
proceeding;

(B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or for all or any
substantial part of its property; 

(C) orders the liquidation of the Company; 

and in each case the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 30
days; or

(v) the Company fails to perform or observe Section 5.1 of
this Note.

6.2 Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an Event
of Default specified in Sections 6.1(iii) or 6.1(iv)) occurs and is
continuing, the Holder by notice to the Company may declare the principal
of and accrued and unpaid interest on this Note to be due and payable. If
an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.1(iii) or 6.1(iv) occurs, then
the principal of, and accrued but unpaid interest (if any) on, this Note
shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Holder.

6.3 Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Holder may pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law
or in equity to collect the payment of principal of or interest on this
Note or to enforce the performance of any provision of this Note. A delay
or omission by the Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon
an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a
waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive
of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative to the extent
permitted by law.

7. Subordination.

7.1 Notes Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness. The Company
covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance of this Note,
likewise covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner
hereinafter set forth in this Article, the indebtedness represented by this
Note and the payment of the principal of and interest on this Note is
hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment to the
prior payment in full, in cash, of all Senior Indebtedness (including any
interest accruing on Senior Indebtedness For Borrowed Money subsequent to
an event specified in Sections 6.1(iii) or 6.1(iv) whether or not such
interest is an allowed claim enforceable against the Company in a bank-
ruptcy case under Bankruptcy Law).

7.2 Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc. In the
event of (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or any
receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or proceed-
ing in connection therewith, relative to the Company or to its creditors,
as such, or to its assets, or (b) any liquidation, dissolution or other
winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary and whether or
not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, or (c) any assignment for the
benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of assets and liabilities of
the Company, then the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to
receive payment in full, in cash, of all amounts due or to become due on or
in respect of all Senior Indebtedness (including any interest accruing on
Senior Indebtedness For Borrowed Money subsequent to an event specified in
Sections 6.1(iii) or 6.1(iv) whether or not such interest is an allowed
claim enforceable against the Company in a bankruptcy case under Bankruptcy
Law), before the Holder is entitled to receive any payment or distribution
on account of principal of or interest on this Note, and to that end the
holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive, for applica-
tion to the payment thereof, any payment or distribution of any kind or
character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any such
payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of
the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to
the payment of this Note, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of
this Note in any such case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other
winding up or event.

In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section, the Holder shall have received any payment or distribution of
assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property
or securities, including any such payment or distribution which may be
payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness
of the Company being subordinated to the payment of this Note, before all
Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, in cash (including any interest
accruing on Senior Indebtedness For Borrowed Money subsequent to an event
specified in Sections 6.1(iii) or 6.1(iv) whether or not such interest is
an allowed claim enforceable against the Company in a bankruptcy case under
Bankruptcy Law), or payment thereof provided for, then such payment or dis-
tribution shall be held in trust for the holders of Senior Indebtedness
and, upon written notice to the Holder from any holder of Senior Indebted-
ness and pursuant to the directions of any such holder, paid over or deliv-
ered forthwith to the holders of Senior Indebtedness as their interests may
appear, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full, in
cash (including any interest accruing on Senior Indebtedness For Borrowed
Money subsequent to an event specified in Sections 6.1(iii) or 6.1(iv)
whether or not such interest is an allowed claim enforceable against the
Company in a bankruptcy case under Bankruptcy Law), after giving effect to
any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior
Indebtedness.

7.3 [Intentionally Deleted]

7.4 No Payment When Senior Indebtedness in Default.

(a) In the event and during the continuation of any default in
the payment of any Senior Indebtedness For Borrowed Money when due, (b) in
the event that any event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness
For Borrowed Money shall have occurred and be continuing and shall have
resulted in such Senior Indebtedness For Borrowed Money becoming or being
declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have
become due and payable, (c) in the event that any default (other than a
default described in clause (a) or clause (b)) with respect to any Senior
Indebtedness For Borrowed Money) shall have occurred and be continuing per-
mitting the holders of such Senior Indebtedness For Borrowed Money (or a
trustee or agent on behalf of the holders thereof) to declare such Senior
Indebtedness For Borrowed Money due and payable prior to the date on which
it would otherwise have become due and payable or (d) in the event any
judicial proceeding shall be pending with respect to any such default in
payment described in clause (a) or other default described in clause (b) or
(c), then no payment (including any payment which may be payable by reason
of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated
to the payment of this Note) shall be made by the Company on account of the
principal of or interest on this Note or on account of the purchase or
other acquisition of this Note; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Note, any payment which is so
blocked from being made under this Section 7.4 shall accrue and shall be
paid five days after the date that none of the conditions described in
clauses (a) through (d) above shall be continuing.

In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall make any payment to the Holder prohibited by the foregoing provisions
of this Section, then and in such event such payment shall be held in trust
for the holders of Senior Indebtedness For Borrowed Money and, upon written
notice to the Holder from any holder of Senior Indebtedness For Borrowed
Money received by the Holder within 180 days of the making of such payment,
and pursuant to the directions of any such holder, paid over and delivered
forthwith to the holders of Senior Indebtedness For Borrowed Money as their
interests may appear.

7.5 Payment Permitted if No Default. Nothing contained in this
Note shall prevent the Company, at any time except during the pendency of
any case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up, as-
signment for the benefit of creditors or other marshalling of assets and
liabilities of the Company referred to in Section 7.2 or under the condi-
tions described in Section 7.4, from making payments at any time of
principal of or interest on this Note.

7.6 Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness. 
Subject to the payment in full, in cash, of all Senior Indebtedness, the
Holder shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all
indebtedness of the Company, if any, which by its express terms is subordi-
nated to indebtedness of the Company to substantially the same extent as
this Note is subordinated and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to
the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments
and distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Senior
Indebtedness until the principal of and interest on this Note shall be paid
in full. For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to
the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities
to which the Holder would be entitled except for the provisions of this
Article, and no payments pursuant to the provisions of this Article to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness by the Holder shall, as among the Company,
its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holder, be
deemed to be a payment or distribution by the Company to or on account of
the Senior Indebtedness.

If any payment or distribution to which the Holder would other-
wise have been entitled but for the provisions of this Article shall have
been applied, pursuant to the provisions of this Article, to the payment of
all amounts payable under the Senior Indebtedness of the Company, then and
in such case, the Holder shall be entitled to receive from the holders of
such Senior Indebtedness at the time outstanding any payments or distribu-
tions received by such holders of Senior Indebtedness in excess of the
amount sufficient to pay all obligations payable under or in respect of the
Senior Indebtedness of the Company in full, in cash (including any interest
accruing on Senior Indebtedness For Borrowed Money subsequent to an event
specified in Sections 6.1(iii) or 6.1(iv) whether or not such interest is
an allowed claim enforceable against the Company in a bankruptcy case under
Bankruptcy Law).

7.7 Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights. The provisions
of this Article are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the
relative rights of the Holder on the one hand and the holders of Senior
Indebtedness on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Note is intended
to or shall (a) impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than
holders of Senior Indebtedness, if any, and the Holder, the obligation of
the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holder the
principal of and interest on this Note as and when the same shall become
due and payable in accordance with its terms; or (b) affect the relative
rights against the Company of the Holder and creditors of the Company other
than the holders of Senior Indebtedness; or (c) prevent the Holder from
exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default
under this Note, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the
holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive cash, property and securities
otherwise payable or deliverable to the Holder.

7.8 No Waiver of Subordination Provisions. No right of any
present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordina-
tion as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or
impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any
act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any non-
compliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this
Note, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be
otherwise charged with.

Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing
paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from
time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Holder, without
incurring responsibility to the Holder and without impairing or releasing
the subordination provided in this Article or the obligations hereunder of
the Holder to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the
following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the
time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise
amend or supplement in any manner Senior Indebtedness or any instrument
evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is
outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any
property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness;
(iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior
Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights
against the Company and any other Person.

7.9 Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of Liquidating
Agent. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred
to in this Article, the Holder shall be entitled to rely upon (a) any order
or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such
insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, dissolu-
tion, winding up or similar case or proceeding is pending, or (b) a
certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee,
custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other Person
making such payment or distribution, or (c) a certificate or certificates
of any trustee, fiduciary or agent for any holders of Senior Indebtedness,
in each case delivered to the Holder for the purpose of ascertaining the
Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the
holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company,
the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or
distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this
Article.

7.10 Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness on Subordination
Provisions. The Holder by accepting this Note acknowledges and agrees that
the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an
inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness,
whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after
the issuance of this Note, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue
to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of Senior Indebtedness
shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provi-
sions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such
Senior Indebtedness.

7.11 Proof of Claims. In the event that the Company is subject
to any case or proceeding described in Section 7.2 and the Holder fails to
file any proof of claim permitted to be filed in such proceeding with
respect to this Note, then any holder of Senior Indebtedness may file such
proof of claim by the earlier of (i) the expiration of 60 days after any
such holder notifies the Holder in writing of its intention to do so and
(ii) the last day permitted to file such claim.

8. Certain Definitions.

The following terms shall have the respective meanings specified
below.

"Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, United States Code or any
similar federal, state or foreign law for the relief of debtors, as
amended.

($11,000,000) (the "Maximum Amount");

(b) the aggregate outstanding advances pursuant to
Section 2.1.1(a) to exceed Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($8,500,000);

(c) the aggregate outstanding advances pursuant to
Section 2.1.1(b) to exceed Two and One-Half Million Dollars
($2,500,000); or

(d) the aggregate outstanding Combined Revolving
Obligations to exceed Eighteen Million Dollars ($18,000,000) or during
the period of July 1, through November 30 of each year, Twenty Two
Million Dollars ($22,000,000).

2.1.4 Foothill is authorized to make advances under this
Agreement based upon telephonic or other instructions received from anyone
purporting to be an Authorized Officer of Borrower, or without instructions
if pursuant to Section 2.5(c). Borrower agrees to establish and maintain a
single designated deposit account for the purpose of receiving the proceeds
of the advances requested by Borrower and made by Foothill hereunder. Unless
otherwise agreed by Foothill and Borrower, any advance requested by Borrower
and made by Foothill hereunder shall be made to such designated deposit
account. Amounts borrowed pursuant to this Section 2.1 may be repaid and,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, reborrowed at any time
during the term of this Agreement.

2.2 Letters of Credit and Letter of Credit Guarantees.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Foothill agrees to issue commercial or standby letters of credit for the
account of Borrower (each, an "L/C") or to issue standby letters of credit or
guarantees of payment (each such letter of credit or guaranty, an "L/C
Guaranty") with respect to commercial or standby letters of credit issued by
another Person for the account of Borrower in an aggregate face amount not to
exceed the lesser of: (i) the Borrowing Base less the amount of advances
outstanding pursuant to Section 2.1, and (ii) One Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000). Borrower expressly understands and agrees
that Foothill shall have no obligation to arrange for the issuance by other
financial institutions of letters of credit that are to be the subject of L/C
Guarantees. Borrower and Foothill acknowledge and agree that certain of the
letters of credit that are to be the subject of L/C Guarantees may be
outstanding on the Closing Date. Each such L/C (including those that are the
subject of L/C Guarantees) shall have an expiry date no later than sixty (60)
days prior to the date on which this Agreement is scheduled to terminate
under Section 3.3 (without regard to any potential renewal term) and all such
L/Cs and L/C Guarantees shall be in form and substance acceptable to Foothill
in its sole discretion. Foothill shall not have any obligation to issue L/Cs
or L/C Guarantees to the extent that the face amount of all outstanding L/Cs
and L/C Guarantees, plus the amount of advances outstanding pursuant to
Section 2.1, would exceed the Maximum Amount. The L/Cs and the L/C
Guarantees issued under this Section 2.2 shall be used by Borrower,
consistent with this Agreement, for its general working capital purposes or
to support its obligations with respect to workers' compensation premiums or
other similar obligations. If Foothill is obligated to advance funds under
an L/C or L/C Guaranty, the amount so advanced immediately shall be deemed to
be an advance made by Foothill to Borrower pursuant to Section 2.1 and,
thereafter, shall bear interest at the rates then applicable under Section
2.5.

(b) Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, save, defend, and
hold Foothill harmless from any loss, cost, expense, or liability, including
payments made by Foothill, expenses, and reasonable attorneys fees incurred
by Foothill arising out of or in connection with any L/Cs or L/C Guarantees. 
Borrower agrees to be bound by the issuing bank's regulations and
interpretations of any letters of credit guarantied by Foothill and opened to
or for Borrower's account or by Foothill's interpretations of any L/C issued
by Foothill to or for Borrower's account, even though this interpretation may
be different from Borrower's own, and Borrower understands and agrees that
Foothill shall not be liable for any error, negligence, or mistakes, whether
of omission or commission, in following Borrower's instructions or those
contained in the L/Cs or any modifications, amendments, or supplements
thereto. Borrower understands that the L/C Guarantees may require Foothill
to indemnify the issuing bank for certain costs or liabilities arising out of
claims by Borrower against such issuing bank. Borrower hereby agrees to
indemnify, save, defend, and hold Foothill harmless with respect to any loss,
cost, expense (including attorneys fees), or liability incurred by Foothill
under any L/C Guaranty as a result of Foothill's indemnification of any such
issuing bank. 

(c) Borrower hereby authorizes and directs any bank that
issues a letter of credit guaranteed by Foothill to deliver to Foothill all
instruments, documents, and other writings and property received by the
issuing bank pursuant to the letter of credit, and to accept and rely upon
Foothill's instructions and agreements with respect to all matters arising in
connection with the letter of credit and the related application. Borrower
may or may not be the "applicant" or "account party" with respect to such
letter of credit.

(d) Any and all service charges, commissions, fees, and costs
incurred by Foothill relating to the L/Cs guaranteed by Foothill shall be
considered Foothill Expenses for purposes of this Agreement and immediately
shall be reimbursable by Borrower to Foothill. On the first day of each
month, Borrower will pay Foothill a fee equal to two percent (2%) per annum
times the average Daily Balance of the undrawn L/Cs and L/C Guarantees that
were outstanding during the immediately preceding month. Service charges,
commissions, fees, and costs may be charged to Borrower's loan account at the
time the service is rendered or the cost is incurred. 

(e) Immediately upon the termination of this Agreement,
Borrower agrees to either: (i) provide cash collateral to be held by
Foothill in an amount equal to the maximum amount of Foothill's obligations
under L/Cs plus the maximum amount of Foothill's obligations to any Person
under outstanding L/C Guarantees, or (ii) cause to be delivered to Foothill
releases of all of Foothill's obligations under its outstanding L/Cs and L/C
Guarantees. At Foothill's discretion, any proceeds of Collateral received by
Foothill after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default may be held as the cash collateral required by this Section 2.2(e).

2.3 Term Loans. Foothill has agreed to make a term loan to
Borrower in the original principal amount of Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000), to be evidenced by and repayable in accordance with the terms
and conditions of a promissory note (the "Term Note"), of even date herewith,
executed by Borrower in favor of Foothill. Foothill has also agreed to make
a term loan jointly to Borrower and Victoria in the original principal amount
of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), to be evidenced by and repayable in
accordance with the terms of a promissory note (the "Combined Term Note"), of
even date herewith, executed by Borrower and Victoria in favor of Foothill. 
All amounts evidenced by the Term Note and the Combined Term Note shall
constitute Obligations.

2.4 Overadvances. If, at any time or for any reason, the amount
of Obligations owed by Borrower to Foothill pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.2
is greater than either the dollar or percentage limitations set forth in
Sections 2.1 or 2.2 (an "Overadvance"), Borrower immediately shall pay to
Foothill, in cash, the amount of such excess to be used by Foothill first, to
repay non-contingent Obligations and, thereafter, to be held by Foothill as
cash collateral to secure Borrower's obligation to repay Foothill for all
amounts paid pursuant to L/Cs or L/C Guarantees.

2.5 Interest: Rates, Payments, and Calculations.

(a) Interest Rate. All Obligations, except for undrawn L/Cs
and L/C Guarantees shall bear interest, on the average Daily Balance, at the
rate of two percent (2%) per month.

(b) Intentionally omitted.

(c) Payments. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in
arrears on the first day of each month during the term hereof. Borrower
hereby authorizes Foothill, at its option, without prior notice to Borrower,
to charge such interest, Foothill Expenses arising after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default (as and when incurred), and all
installments or other payments due under the Term Note and the Combined Term
Note or other Loan Document to Borrower's loan account, which amounts shall
thereafter accrue interest at the rate then applicable hereunder. Any
interest not paid when due shall be compounded by becoming a part of the
Obligations, and such interest shall thereafter accrue interest at the rate
then applicable hereunder.

(d) Computation. All interest and fees chargeable under the
Loan Documents shall be computed on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360)
day year for the actual number of days elapsed.

(e) Intent to Limit Charges to Maximum Lawful Rate. In no
event shall the interest rate or rates payable under this Agreement, the Term
Note, or the Combined Term Note, plus any other amounts paid in connection
herewith, exceed the highest rate permissible under any law that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable. 
Borrower and Foothill, in executing this Agreement, the Term Note and the
Combined Term Note, intend to legally agree upon the rate or rates of
interest and manner of payment stated within it; provided, however, that,
anything contained herein in the Term Note or in the Combined Term Note to
the contrary notwithstanding, if said rate or rates of interest or manner of
payment exceeds the maximum allowable under applicable law, then, ipso facto
as of the date of this Agreement and the Term Note and the Combined Term
Note, Borrower is and shall be liable only for the payment of such maximum as
allowed by law, and payment received from Borrower in excess of such legal
maximum, whenever received, shall be applied to reduce the principal balance
of the Obligations to the extent of such excess.

2.6 Crediting Payments; Application of Collections. The receipt
of any wire transfer of funds, check, or other item of payment by Foothill
(whether from transfers to Foothill by the Lock Box Banks pursuant to the
Lock Box Agreements or otherwise) immediately shall be applied to
provisionally reduce the Obligations, but shall not be considered a payment
on account unless such wire transfer is of immediately available federal
funds and is made to the appropriate deposit account of Foothill or unless
and until such check or other item of payment is honored when presented for
payment. From and after the Closing Date, Foothill shall be entitled to
charge Borrower for five (5) Business Days of `clearance' at the rate set
forth in Sections 2.5(a) (applicable to advances under Section 2.1) on all
checks or other items of payment that are not in immediately available funds
that are received by Foothill (except for wire transfers of federal funds). 
This five (5) Business Day clearance charge on certain receipts is
acknowledged by the parties to constitute an integral aspect of the pricing
of Foothill's facility to Borrower, and shall apply irrespective of the
characterization of whether receipts are owned by Borrower or Foothill, and
irrespective of the level of Borrower's Obligations to Foothill. Should any
check or item of payment not be honored when presented for payment, then
Borrower shall be deemed not to have made such payment, and interest shall be
recalculated accordingly. Anything to the contrary contained herein
notwithstanding, any wire transfer, check, or other item of payment shall be
deemed received by Foothill only if it is received into Foothill's Operating
Account (as such account is identified in the Lock Box Agreements) on or
before 11:00 a.m. Los Angeles time. If any wire transfer, check, or other
item of payment is received into Foothill's Operating Account (as such
account is identified in the Lock Box Agreements) after 11:00 a.m. Los
Angeles time it shall be deemed to have been received by Foothill as of the
opening of business on the immediately following Business Day.

2.7 Statements of Obligations. Foothill shall render statements
to Borrower of the Obligations, including principal, interest, fees, and
including an itemization of all charges and expenses constituting Foothill
Expenses owing, and such statements shall be conclusively presumed to be
correct and accurate and constitute an account stated between Borrower and
Foothill unless, within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof by Borrower,
Borrower shall deliver to Foothill by registered or certified mail at its
address specified in Section 12, written objection thereto describing the
error or errors contained in any such statements.

2.8 Fees. After the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default, Borrower shall pay to Foothill the following fees: 
Foothill's customary fee of Six Hundred Fifty Dollars ($650) per day per
examiner, plus out-of-pocket expenses for each financial analysis and
examination of Borrower performed by Foothill or its agents; Foothill's
customary appraisal fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per day per
appraiser, plus out-of-pocket expenses for each appraisal of the Collateral
performed by Foothill or its agents.

that is two (2) years from the Closing Date, unless sooner terminated

prior written notice. The foregoing notwithstanding, Foothill shall have the

notice upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default.

3.4 Effect of Termination. On the date of termination, all
Obligations (including contingent reimbursement obligations under any
outstanding L/Cs or L/C Guarantees) immediately shall become due and payable
without notice or demand. No termination of this Agreement, however, shall
relieve or discharge Borrower of Borrower's duties, Obligations, or covenants
hereunder, and Foothill's continuing security interests in the Collateral
shall remain in effect until all Obligations have been fully and finally
discharged and Foothill's obligation to provide advances hereunder is
terminated.

4. CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST.

4.1 Grant of Security Interest. Borrower hereby grants to
Foothill a continuing security interest in all currently existing and
hereafter acquired or arising Collateral in order to secure prompt repayment
of any and all Obligations and in order to secure prompt performance by
Borrower of each of its covenants and duties under the Loan Documents. 
Foothill's security interests in the Collateral shall attach to all
Collateral without further act on the part of Foothill or Borrower. Anything
contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary
notwithstanding, and other than sales of Inventory to buyers in the ordinary
course of business and those actions contemplated by Section 7.4 and
Schedule 7.4, Borrower has no authority, express or implied, to dispose of
any item or portion of the Collateral.

4.2 Negotiable Collateral. In the event that any Collateral,
including proceeds, is evidenced by or consists of Negotiable Collateral,
Borrower shall, immediately upon the request of Foothill, endorse and assign
such Negotiable Collateral to Foothill and deliver physical possession of
such Negotiable Collateral to Foothill.

4.3 Collection of Accounts, General Intangibles, Negotiable
Collateral. Foothill, Borrower, and the Lock Box Banks shall enter into the
Lock Box Agreements, in form and substance satisfactory to Foothill in its
sole discretion, pursuant to which all of Borrower's cash receipts, checks,
and other items of payment (including, insurance proceeds, proceeds of cash
sales, rental proceeds, and tax refunds) will be forwarded to Foothill on a
daily basis. At any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default or after Foothill, in its reasonable judgment, deems
itself insecure, Foothill or Foothill's designee may: (a) notify customers or
Account Debtors of Borrower that the Accounts, General Intangibles, or
Negotiable Collateral have been assigned to Foothill or that Foothill has a
security interest therein; and (b) collect the Accounts, General Intangibles,
and Negotiable Collateral directly and charge the collection costs and
expenses to Borrower's loan account. Borrower agrees that it will hold in
trust for Foothill, as Foothill's trustee, any cash receipts, checks, and
other items of payment (including, insurance proceeds, proceeds of cash
sales, rental proceeds, and tax refunds) that it receives and immediately
will deliver said cash receipts, checks, and other items of payment to
Foothill in their original form as received by Borrower except that Jonathan
Logan sales proceeds will be transferred to the Lock Box weekly.

4.4 Delivery of Additional Documentation Required. At any time
upon the request of Foothill, Borrower shall execute and deliver to Foothill
all financing statements, continuation financing statements, fixture filings,
security agreements, chattel mortgages, pledges, assignments, endorsements of
certificates of title, applications for title, affidavits, reports, notices,
schedules of accounts, letters of authority, and all other documents that
Foothill may reasonably request, in form satisfactory to Foothill, to perfect
and continue perfected Foothill's security interests in the Collateral and in
order to fully consummate all of the transactions contemplated hereby and
under the other the Loan Documents.

4.5 Power of Attorney. Borrower hereby irrevocably makes,
constitutes, and appoints Foothill (and any of Foothill's officers,
employees, or agents designated by Foothill) as Borrower's true and lawful
attorney, with power to: (a) send requests for verification of Accounts; (b)
endorse Borrower's name on any checks, notices, acceptances, money orders,
drafts, or other item of payment or security that may come into Foothill's
possession; (c) at any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, settle and adjust disputes and claims respecting the Accounts
directly with Account Debtors, for amounts and upon terms which Foothill
determines to be reasonable, and Foothill may cause to be executed and
delivered any documents and releases which Foothill determines to be
necessary. The appointment of Foothill as Borrower's attorney, and each and
every one of Foothill's rights and powers, being coupled with an interest, is
irrevocable until all of the Obligations have been fully and finally repaid
and performed and Foothill's obligation to extend credit hereunder is
terminated.

4.6 Right to Inspect. Foothill (through any of its officers,
employees, or agents) shall have the right, from time to time hereafter,
during normal business hours, to inspect Borrower's Books and to check, test,
and appraise the Collateral in order to verify Borrower's financial condition
or the amount, quality, value, condition of, or any other matter relating to,
the Collateral.

5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

Borrower represents and warrants to Foothill as follows:

5.1 No Prior Encumbrances. Borrower has good and indefeasible
title to the Collateral, free and clear of liens, claims, security interests,
or encumbrances, except for Permitted Liens.

5.2 Eligible Accounts. All of Borrower's representations and
warranties in this Section are based upon Borrower's knowledge after
reasonable review in accordance with normal and prudent business practices. 
The Eligible Accounts are, at the time of the creation thereof and as of each
date on which Borrower includes them in a Borrowing Base calculation or
certification, bona fide existing obligations created by the sale and
delivery of Inventory or the rendition of services to Account Debtors in the
ordinary course of Borrower's business, unconditionally owed to Borrower
without defenses, disputes, offsets, counterclaims, or rights of return or
cancellation. Except for Accounts arising from bill and hold sales, the
property giving rise to such Eligible Accounts has been delivered to the
Account Debtor, or to the Account Debtor's agent for immediate shipment to
and unconditional acceptance by the Account Debtor. At the time of the
creation of an Eligible Account and as of each date on which Borrower
includes an Eligible Account in a Borrowing Base calculation or
certification, Borrower has not received notice of actual or imminent
bankruptcy, insolvency, or material impairment of the financial condition of
any applicable Account Debtor regarding such Eligible Account.

5.3 Eligible Inventory. All Eligible Inventory is now and at all
times hereafter shall be of good and merchantable quality, free from defects.

5.4 Location of Inventory and Equipment. The Inventory and
Equipment are not stored with a bailee, warehouseman, or similar party
(without Foothill's prior written consent) and are located only at the
locations identified on Schedule 6.14 or otherwise permitted by Section 6.14.

5.5 Inventory Records. Borrower now keeps, and hereafter at all
times shall keep, correct and accurate records itemizing and describing the
kind, type, quality, and quantity of the Inventory, and Borrower's cost
therefor.

5.6 Location of Chief Executive Office; FEIN. The chief executive
office of Borrower is located at the address indicated in the preamble to
this Agreement and Borrower's FEIN is 13-1426280.

5.7 Due Organization and Qualification. Borrower is duly
organized and existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of
its incorporation and qualified and licensed to do business in, and in good
standing in, any state where the failure to be so licensed or qualified could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
operations, condition (financial or otherwise), finances, or prospects of
Borrower or on the value of the Collateral to Foothill.

5.8 Due Authorization; No Conflict. The execution, delivery, and
performance of the Loan Documents are within Borrower's corporate powers,
have been duly authorized, and are not in conflict with nor constitute a
breach of any provision contained in Borrower's Articles or Certificate of
Incorporation, or By-laws, nor will they constitute an event of default under
any material agreement to which Borrower is a party or by which its
properties or assets may be bound.

5.9 Litigation. There are no actions or proceedings pending by or
against Borrower before any court or administrative agency and Borrower does
not have knowledge or belief of any pending, threatened, or imminent
litigation, governmental investigations, or claims, complaints, actions, or
prosecutions involving Borrower or any guarantor of the Obligations, except
for: (a) ongoing collection matters in which Borrower is the plaintiff; (b)
matters disclosed on Schedule 5.9; and (c) matters arising after the date
hereof that, if decided adversely to Borrower, would not materially impair
the prospect of repayment of the Obligations or materially impair the value
or priority of Foothill's security interests in the Collateral.

5.10 No Material Adverse Change in Financial Condition. All
financial statements relating to Borrower or any guarantor of the Obligations
that have been delivered by Borrower to Foothill have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP and fairly present Borrower's (or such guarantor's, as
applicable) financial condition as of the date thereof and Borrower's results
of operations for the period then ended. There has not been a material
adverse change in the financial condition of Borrower (or such guarantor, as
applicable) since the date of the latest financial statements submitted to
Foothill on or before the Closing Date.

5.11 No Transfer. No transfer of property is being made by
Borrower and no obligation is being incurred by Borrower in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud either present or future
creditors of Borrower.

5.12 Employee Benefits. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.12, each
of the following provisions of this Section 5.12 is true. Each Plan is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA
and the IRC. Each Qualified Plan and Multiemployer Plan has been determined
by the Internal Revenue Service to qualify under Section 401 of the IRC, and
the trusts created thereunder have been determined to be exempt from tax
under Section 501 of the IRC, and, to the best knowledge of Borrower, nothing
has occurred that would cause the loss of such qualification or tax-exempt
status. There are no outstanding liabilities under Title IV of ERISA with
respect to any Plan maintained or sponsored by Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate, nor with respect to any Plan to which Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate contributes or is obligated to contribute which could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of
Borrower. No Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has any Unfunded Benefit
Liability which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition of Borrower. Neither Borrower nor any
ERISA Affiliate has transferred any Unfunded Benefit Liability to a person
other than Borrower or an ERISA Affiliate or has otherwise engaged in a
transaction that could be subject to Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA which
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition of Borrower. Neither Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate
has incurred nor reasonably expects to incur (x) any liability (and no event
has occurred which, with the giving of notice under Section 4219 of ERISA,
would result in such liability) under Sections 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with
respect to a Multiemployer Plan, or (y) any liability under Title IV of ERISA
(other than premiums due but not delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA) with
respect to a Plan, which could, in either event, reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of Borrower. 
Within the past six (6) years, no application for a funding waiver or an
extension of any amortization period pursuant to Section 412 of the IRC has
been made with respect to any Plan. No ERISA Event has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur with respect to any Plan which could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of
Borrower. Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate have complied in all material
respects with the notice and continuation coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the IRC.

5.13 Environmental Condition.

(a) To the Borrower's knowledge, Borrower has not used
Hazardous Materials at or affecting the Real Property in any manner which
violates any Act governing the use, storage, treatment, transportation,
manufacturing, refinement, handling, production, or disposal of Hazardous
Materials where such violation would reasonably be expected to result in a
loss that would have a material adverse effect on Borrower.

2. To the Borrower's knowledge, no prior or current owner,
occupant or operator of the Real Property has used Hazardous Materials at or
affecting the Real Property in any manner which violates any Act governing
the use, storage, treatment, transportation, manufacturing, refinement,
handling, production, or disposal of Hazardous Materials where such violation
would reasonably be expected to result in a loss that would have a material
adverse effect on Borrower.

5.14 Compliance With The ADA.

(a) All of the Real Property is presently used as an
administrative, office, manufacturing, or distribution facility and for other
commercial purposes, and no portions of the Real Property are used as or for
a "public accommodation," within the meaning of the ADA.

(b) To the best of Borrower's knowledge, Borrower has made
all modifications or provided all accommodations which may be required to be
made or provided by Borrower to the Real Property pursuant to the ADA in
order to accommodate the needs and requirements of any disabled persons.

(c) Borrower has received no notice or complaint regarding
any noncompliance with the ADA of any of the Real Property or of Borrower's
employment practices and, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, there has been
no threatened litigation alleging any such noncompliance by Borrower or the
Real Property.

5.15 Reliance by Foothill; Cumulative. Each warranty and
representation contained in this Agreement automatically shall be deemed
repeated with each advance or issuance of an L/C or L/C Guaranty and shall be
conclusively presumed to have been relied on by Foothill regardless of any
investigation made or information possessed by Foothill except to the extent
that Foothill has previously waived any breach hereof as to such warranty. 
The warranties and representations set forth herein shall be cumulative and
in addition to any and all other warranties and representations that Borrower
now or hereafter shall give, or cause to be given, to Foothill.

6. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

Borrower covenants and agrees that, so long as any credit hereunder
shall be available and until full and final payment of the Obligations, and
unless Foothill shall otherwise consent in writing, Borrower shall do all of
the following:

6.1 Accounting System. Borrower shall maintain a standard and
modern system of accounting in accordance with GAAP with ledger and account
cards or computer tapes, discs, printouts, and records pertaining to the
Collateral which contain information as from time to time may be requested by
Foothill. Borrower also shall keep proper books of account showing all
sales, claims, and allowances on its Inventory.

6.2 Collateral Reports. Borrower shall deliver to Foothill, no
later than the tenth (10th) day of each month during the term of this
Agreement, a detailed aging, by total, of the Accounts, a reconciliation
statement, and a summary, by vendor, of all accounts payable, including due
dates of invoices, and any book overdraft. Original sales invoices
evidencing daily sales shall be mailed by Borrower to each Account Debtor
with, at Foothill's request, a copy to Foothill, and, after the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at Foothill's direction,
the invoices shall indicate on their face that the Account has been assigned
to Foothill and that all payments are to be made directly to Foothill. 
Borrower shall deliver to Foothill, as Foothill may from time to time
require, collection reports, sales journals, invoices, original delivery
receipts, customer's purchase orders, shipping instructions, bills of lading,
and other documentation respecting shipment arrangements. Absent such a
request by Foothill, copies of all such documentation shall be held by
Borrower as custodian for Foothill.

6.3 Schedules of Accounts. With such regularity as Foothill shall
require, Borrower shall provide Foothill with schedules describing all
Accounts. Foothill's failure to request such schedules or Borrower's failure
to execute and deliver such schedules shall not affect or limit Foothill's
security interests or other rights in and to the Accounts.

6.4 Financial Statements, Reports, Certificates. Borrower agrees
to deliver to Foothill: (a) as soon as available, but in any event within
forty-five (45) days after the end of each month during each of Borrower's
fiscal years, a company prepared income statement and cash flow statement
covering Borrower's operations during such period; and (b) as soon as
available, but in any event within ninety (90) days after the end of each of
Borrower's fiscal years, financial statements of Borrower for each such
fiscal year, audited by KPMG Peat Marwick or by other independent certified
public accountants reasonably acceptable to Foothill and certified, without
any qualifications (other than going concern or consistency with prior year
in the case of a change of accounting principle), by such accountants to have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP, together with a certificate of such
accountants addressed to Foothill stating that such accountants do not have
knowledge of the existence of any event or condition constituting an Event of
Default, or that would, with the passage of time or the giving of notice,
constitute an Event of Default. Such audited financial statements shall
include a balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and cash flow statement,
and, if prepared, such accountants' letter to management. If Borrower is a
parent company of one or more subsidiaries, or Affiliates, or is a subsidiary
or Affiliate of another company, then, in addition to the financial
statements referred to above, Borrower agrees to deliver financial statements
prepared on a consolidating basis so as to present Borrower and each such
related entity separately, and on a consolidated basis.

Together with the above, Borrower also shall deliver to
Foothill Borrower's Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports, Form 10-K Annual Reports,
and Form 8-K Current Reports, and any other filings made by Borrower with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, if any, as soon as the same are filed, or
any other information that is provided by Borrower to its shareholders, and
any other report reasonably requested by Foothill relating to the Collateral
and financial condition of Borrower.

Each month, together with the financial statements provided
pursuant to Section 6.4(a), Borrower shall deliver to Foothill a certificate
signed by its chief financial officer to the effect that: (i) all reports,
statements, or computer prepared information of any kind or nature delivered
or caused to be delivered to Foothill hereunder have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except for footnotes for monthly statements) and fairly
present the financial condition of Borrower; (ii) Borrower is in timely
compliance with all of its covenants and agreements hereunder; (iii) the
representations and warranties of Borrower contained in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and
as of the date of such certificate, as though made on and as of such date
(except to the extent that such representations and warranties relate solely
to an earlier date); and (iv) on the date of delivery of such certificate to
Foothill there does not exist any condition or event that constitutes an
Event of Default (or, in each case, to the extent of any non-compliance,
describing such non-compliance as to which he or she may have knowledge and
what action Borrower has taken, is taking, or proposes to take with respect
thereto).

Borrower shall have issued written instructions to its
independent certified public accountants authorizing them after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or with
Borrower's cooperation prior thereto, to communicate with Foothill and to
release to Foothill whatever financial information concerning Borrower that
Foothill may request. After the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs all
auditors, accountants, or other third parties to deliver to Foothill, at
Borrower's expense, copies of Borrower's financial statements, papers related
thereto, and other accounting records of any nature in their possession, and
to disclose to Foothill any information they may have regarding Borrower's
business affairs and financial conditions.

6.5 Tax Returns. Borrower agrees to deliver to Foothill copies of
each of Borrower's future federal income tax returns, and any amendments
thereto, within thirty (30) days of the filing thereof with the Internal
Revenue Service.

6.6 Designation of Inventory. Borrower shall now and from time to
time hereafter, but not less frequently than monthly, execute and deliver to
Foothill a designation of Inventory specifying the lower of Borrower's cost
or market value of Borrower's raw materials, work in process, and finished
goods, and further specifying such other information as Foothill may
reasonably request.

6.7 Returns. Returns and allowances, if any, as between Borrower
and its Account Debtors shall be on the same basis and in accordance with the
usual customary practices of Borrower, as they exist at the time of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. If, at a time when no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, any Account Debtor returns any
Inventory of Buffalo, Borrower promptly shall determine the reason for such
return and, if Borrower accepts such return, issue a credit memorandum in the
appropriate amount to such Account Debtor. If, at a time when an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, any Account Debtor returns any
Inventory of Buffalo to Borrower, Borrower promptly shall determine the
reason for such return and, if Foothill consents (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), issue a credit memorandum (with a copy to be sent to
Foothill) in the appropriate amount to such Account Debtor. On a daily
basis, Borrower shall notify Foothill of all returns and recoveries and of
all disputes and claims of which it is aware.

6.8 Title to Equipment. Upon Foothill's request, Borrower
immediately shall deliver to Foothill, properly endorsed, any and all
evidences of ownership of, certificates of title, or applications for title
to any items of Equipment.

6.9 Maintenance of Equipment. Borrower shall keep and maintain
the Equipment in good operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) in accordance with past practices, and make all necessary
replacements thereto so that the value and operating efficiency thereof shall
at all times be maintained and preserved. Borrower shall not permit any item
of Equipment to become a fixture (other than a trade fixture) to real estate
or an accession to other property, and the Equipment is now and shall at all
times remain personal property.

6.10 Taxes. All assessments and taxes, whether real, personal, or
otherwise, due or payable by, or imposed, levied, or assessed against
Borrower or any of its property have been paid, and shall hereafter be paid
in full, before delinquency or before the expiration of any extension period. 
Borrower shall make due and timely payment or deposit of all federal, state,
and local taxes, assessments, or contributions required of it by law, and
will execute and deliver to Foothill, on demand, appropriate certificates
attesting to the payment thereof or deposit with respect thereto. Borrower
will make timely payment or deposit of all tax payments and withholding taxes
required of it by applicable laws, including those laws concerning F.I.C.A.,
F.U.T.A., state disability, and local, state, and federal income taxes, and
will, upon request, furnish Foothill with proof satisfactory to Foothill
indicating that Borrower has made such payments or deposits.

6.11 Insurance.

(a) Borrower, at its expense, shall keep the Collateral
(exclusive of the Real Property) insured against loss or damage by fire,
theft, explosion, sprinklers, and all other hazards and risks, and in such
amounts, as are ordinarily insured against by other owners in similar 
businesses. Borrower also shall maintain business interruption, public
liability, product liability, and property damage insurance, as well as
insurance against larceny, embezzlement, and criminal misappropriation.

(b) Borrower will obtain and maintain (i) insurance of the
type necessary to insure the Improvements and Chattels (as such terms are
defined in the Mortgages), for the full replacement cost thereof, against any
loss by fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, explosion, aircraft, smoke damage,
vehicle damage, earthquakes, elevator collision, and other risks from time to
time included under "extended coverage" policies, in such amounts as Foothill
may require, but in any event in amounts sufficient to prevent Borrower from
becoming a co-insurer under such polices, (ii) combined single limit bodily
injury and property damages insurance against any loss, liability, or damages
on, about, or relating to each parcel of Real Property, in an amount of not
less than Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000); and (iii) such other risk as
Foothill may require. Replacement costs, at Foothill's option, may be
redetermined by an insurance appraiser, satisfactory to Foothill, not more
frequently than once every twelve (12) months at Borrower's cost.

(c) All insurance required herein shall be written by
companies of recognized financial standing, satisfactory to Foothill, which
are authorized to do insurance business in the State of California. Such
insurance shall be in form satisfactory to Foothill, shall with respect to
hazard insurance and such other insurance as Foothill shall specify, name as
the loss payee thereunder Borrower and Foothill, as their interests may
appear, and shall contain a California Form 438BFU (NS) mortgagee
endorsement, or its local equivalent. Every policy of insurance referred to
in this Section shall contain an agreement by the insurer that it will not
cancel such policy except after thirty (30) days' prior written notice to
Foothill and that any loss payable thereunder shall be payable notwith-
standing any act or negligence of Borrower or Foothill which might, absent
such agreement, result in a forfeiture of all or a part of such insurance
payment and notwithstanding (i) occupancy or use of the Real Property for
purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms of such policy, (ii) any
foreclosure or other action or proceeding taken by Foothill pursuant to the
Mortgages upon the happening of an Event of Default, or (iii) any change in
title or ownership of the Real Property.

(d) Original policies or certificates thereof satisfactory to
Foothill evidencing such insurance shall be delivered to Foothill at least
thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the existing or preceding
policies. Borrower shall give Foothill prompt notice of any loss covered by
such insurance and Foothill shall have the right to adjust any loss. 
Foothill shall have the exclusive right to adjust all losses in excess of One
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) payable under any such insurance
policies without any liability to Borrower whatsoever in respect of such
adjustments; provided, however that Foothill will consult with Borrower with
respect of such adjustments and will act in a commercially reasonable manner
in respect thereto. Any monies received as payment for any loss in excess of
One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) under any insurance policy
including, but not limited to, the insurance policies mentioned above, shall
be paid over to Foothill to be applied at the option of Foothill either to
the prepayment of the Obligations without premium, in such order or manner as
Foothill may elect, or shall be disbursed to Borrower under stage payment
terms satisfactory to Foothill for application to the cost of repairs,
replacements or restorations. All restorations shall be effected with
reasonable promptness and shall be of a value at least equal to the value of
the items or property to destroyed prior to such damage or destruction. Upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default, all prepaid premiums shall be the sole
and absolute property of Foothill to be applied by Foothill to the payment of
the Obligations in such order or form as Foothill shall determine.

(e) Borrower shall not take out separate insurance concurrent
in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required to be
maintained under this Section 6.11, unless Foothill is included thereon as
named insured with the loss payable to Foothill under a standard California
438BFU (NS) Mortgagee endorsement, or its local equivalent. Borrower shall
immediately notify Foothill whenever such separate insurance is taken out,
specifying the insurer thereunder and full particulars as to the policies
evidencing the same, and originals of such policies shall immediately
thereafter be provided to Foothill.

6.12 Tangible Net Worth. Tangible Net Worth shall not decrease by
more than Seventeen Million Dollars ($17,000,000) from March 31, 1994 without
giving effect to the sale of Borrower's Seneca/Clarkesville division,
measured on a fiscal quarter-end basis. In calculating the decrease in
Tangible Net Worth the following shall not be included: (a) conversions of
Indebtedness into equity, (b) forgiveness of Indebtedness, and (c) the
issuance of new equity securities by Borrower.

6.13 No Setoffs or Counterclaims. All payments hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents made by or on behalf of Borrower shall be made
without setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of, and without deduction
or withholding for or on account of, any federal, state, or local taxes.

6.14 Location of Inventory and Equipment. Borrower shall keep the
Inventory and Equipment only at the locations identified on Schedule 6.14;
provided, however, that Borrower may amend Schedule 6.14 so long as such
amendment occurs by written notice to Foothill not less than thirty (30) days
prior to the date on which the Inventory or Equipment is moved to such new
location, so long as such new location is within the continental United
States, and so long as, at the time of such written notification, Borrower
provides any financing statements or fixture filings necessary to perfect and
continue perfected Foothill's security interests in such assets and also
provides to Foothill a landlord's waiver in form and substance satisfactory
to Foothill.

6.15 Compliance with Laws. Borrower shall comply with the
requirements of all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and orders of any
governmental authority, including the Fair Labor Standards Act and the ADA.

6.16 Employee Benefits.

(a) Borrower shall deliver to Foothill a written statement by
the chief financial officer of Borrower specifying the nature of any of the
following events and the actions which Borrower proposes to take with respect
thereto promptly, and in any event within ten (10) days of becoming aware of
any of them, and when known, any action taken or threatened by the Internal
Revenue Service, PBGC, Department of Labor, or other party with respect
thereto: (i) an ERISA Event with respect to any Plan; (ii) the incurrence of
an obligation to pay additional premium to the PBGC under Section
4006(a)(3)(E) of ERISA with respect to any Plan; and (iii) any lien on the
assets of Borrower arising in connection with any Plan.

(b) Borrower shall also promptly furnish to Foothill copies
prepared or received by Borrower or an ERISA Affiliate of: (i) at the
request of Foothill, each annual report (Internal Revenue Service Form 5500
series) and all accompanying schedules, actuarial reports, financial
information concerning the financial status of each Plan, and schedules
showing the amounts contributed to each Plan by or on behalf of Borrower or
its ERISA Affiliates for the most recent three (3) plan years; (ii) all
notices of intent to terminate or to have a trustee appointed to administer
any Plan; (iii) all written demands by the PBGC under Subtitle D of Title IV
of ERISA; (iv) all notices required to be sent to employees or to the PBGC
under Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the IRC; (v) all written notices
received with respect to a Multiemployer Plan concerning (x) the imposition
or amount of withdrawal liability pursuant to Section 4202 of ERISA, (y) a
termination described in Section 4041A of ERISA, or (z) a reorganization or
insolvency described in Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA; (vi) the adoption of
any new Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the IRC
by Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate; (vii) the adoption of any amendment to
any Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the IRC, if
such amendment results in a material increase in benefits or Unfunded Benefit
Liability; or (viii) the commencement of contributions by Borrower or any
ERISA Affiliate to any Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the IRC.

6.17 Environmental Condition.

(a) Borrower shall not cause or permit the Real Property to
be used to generate, manufacture, refine, transport, treat, store, handle,
dispose, produce, or process Hazardous Materials except in compliance with
all applicable Acts.

(b) Borrower shall ensure compliance by all owners,
operators, and occupants of the Real Property with all applicable Acts and
will ensure that all such owners, operators and occupants obtain and comply
with any and all required approvals, registrations, or permits.

(c) In the event Foothill reasonably believes that Borrower
has not complied with its obligations in Section 6.17(a) or (b) and that such
suspected noncompliance is reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Collateral or result in a material liability to Borrower, Foothill may
request in writing an explanation of such noncompliance from Borrower. 
Borrower shall provide a detailed written response to Foothill within ten
(10) business days of receiving the request. If such response is not
reasonably satisfactory to Foothill, Foothill may require Borrower to retain
an environmental consultant, who shall be approved in advance and in writing
by Foothill, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, to
investigate the suspected noncompliance. Borrower shall provide Foothill
with a copy of any report by such consultant, and, if the report confirms
Borrower's noncompliance, Borrower shall promptly correct such noncompliance. 
Borrower shall promptly take all actions to Remediate the Real Property which
are required by federal, state, or local governmental agency or political
subdivision or which are reasonably necessary to mitigate a spill or a
violation of any Act, except that Borrower may, in good faith, contest any
requirements before any governmental body or court with jurisdiction. All
such work shall be performed by one or more contractors selected by Borrower
and approved in advance and in writing by Foothill, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Any such actions shall be performed in a good,
safe, and workmanlike manner and in such manner as to minimize any impact on
the business or occupation at the Real Property. Borrower shall pay all
costs in connection with such investigatory and remedial activities,
including but not limited to, all power and utility costs, any and all taxes
or fees that may be applicable to such activities. Borrower shall promptly
provide to Foothill copies of testing results and reports that are generated
in compliance with the above activities. At the conclusion of such actions,
Borrower shall remove all associated equipment, and restore the Real Property
to substantially the same the condition existing prior to the commencement of
Remediation, which shall include, without limitation, the repair of any
surface damage, including paving caused by such investigation or Remediation
hereunder.

(d) The obligations of Borrower and the rights of Foothill
with respect to Hazardous Materials are in addition to and not in
substitution of the obligations of Borrower and the rights of Foothill under
all applicable, federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances
relating to health and safety, and protection of the environment. The
obligations of Borrower and the rights of Foothill, notwithstanding anything
contained herein or in any other document or agreement which may be construed
to the contrary, (i) shall not be subject to any antideficiency laws or
protections, if any, (ii) shall survive (y) a non-judicial sale, judicial
sale or deed or other transaction in lieu of such sale hereunder, and (z) the
repayment of the Obligations. In the event Borrower does not timely perform
any of its obligations with respect to Hazardous Materials, Foothill may
perform such obligations, but is not obligated to, at the expense of Borrower
and such expense shall be added to the Obligations and shall not cure
Borrower's breach under this Agreement.

6.18 Compliance With The ADA.

(a) Borrower shall promptly provide Foothill with copies of
all notices or claims which may be received by Borrower and involving claims
made by any individual, entity or governmental agency as to any alleged
noncompliance of the Real Property with the requirements of the ADA.

(b) Borrower shall observe and comply in all material
respects with all obligations and requirements of the ADA as it applies to
the Real Property, which shall include, without limitation, installing or
constructing all improvements or alterations which may be necessary to cause
the Real Property to be accessible to all persons if the use of any of the
Real Property or any part thereof becomes a "public accommodation," as
defined in the ADA, or in the event additional building improvements are
added or incorporated into the existing improvements, and making any
reasonable accommodations which may be necessary to accommodate the needs or
requirements of any existing or future employee of Borrower.

6.19 Store Openings and Closings. Borrower shall give Foothill
reasonable prior notice of new store openings and closing of its stores.

6.20 Inventory Audits. Borrower shall continue to take physical
counts of its Inventory at least once in each fiscal year. Such physical
inventory taking will be observed by Borrower's independent certified public
accountants to the extent deemed necessary by such accountants.

6.21 Real Property Leases; Consignments. Borrower shall make
timely payment of all rents and other monies payable on real property leases
where Borrower is lessee except for Jonathan Logan stores, or unless such
payments are contested in good faith by Borrower and the failure to pay such
monies could not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect
Borrower or the Collateral. Borrower shall also make timely payments to
consignors of Inventory, if any. In the event that Borrower does not make
any such payments to lessors or consignors, Foothill may, in its discretion,
establish reasonable reserves for delinquent payments.

6.22 Landlord Waivers. Borrower shall use its best efforts to
obtain landlord waivers from the lessors of its Jonathan Logan stores and
other leased locations on or before August 31, 1994.

6.23 Consigned Inventory. Borrower agrees that each Inventory
designation provided under Section 6.6 shall also separately identify and
value all Inventory consigned to Borrower by third Persons. Borrower further
agrees not to include any such consigned Inventory as Eligible Inventory in
any certificate or report provided to Foothill.

7. NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

shall be available and until full and final payment of the Obligations,
Borrower will not do any of the following without Foothill's prior written

materially impair the prospects of repayment of the Obligations by Borrower,
(ii) the net cash proceeds of such refinancings, renewals, or extensions do
not result in an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the
Indebtedness so refinanced, renewed, or extended, (iii) such refinancings,
renewals, refundings, or extensions do not result in a shortening of the
average weighted maturity of the Indebtedness so refinanced, renewed, or
extended, and (iv) to the extent that Indebtedness that is refinanced was
subordinated in right of payment to the Obligations, then the subordination
terms and conditions of the refinancing Indebtedness must be at least as

9. FOOTHILL'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

9.1 Rights and Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default Foothill may, at its election, without notice of its election and
without demand, do any one or more of the following, all of which are
authorized by Borrower:

(a) Declare all Obligations, whether evidenced by this
Agreement, by any of the other Loan Documents, or otherwise, immediately due
and payable;

(b) Cease advancing money or extending credit to or for the
benefit of Borrower under this Agreement, under any of the Loan Documents, or
under any other agreement between Borrower and Foothill;

(c) Terminate this Agreement and any of the other Loan
Documents as to any future liability or obligation of Foothill, but without
affecting Foothill's rights and security interests in the Collateral and
without affecting the Obligations;

(d) Settle or adjust disputes and claims directly with
Account Debtors for amounts and upon terms which Foothill considers
advisable, and in such cases, Foothill will credit Borrower's loan account
with only the net amounts received by Foothill in payment of such disputed
Accounts after deducting all Foothill Expenses incurred or expended in
connection therewith;

(e) Cause Borrower to hold all returned Inventory in trust
for Foothill, segregate all returned Inventory from all other property of
Borrower or in Borrower's possession and conspicuously label said returned
Inventory as the property of Foothill;

(f) Without notice to or demand upon Borrower or any
guarantor, make such payments and do such acts as Foothill considers
necessary or reasonable to protect its security interests in the Collateral. 
Borrower agrees to assemble the Collateral if Foothill so requires, and to
make the Collateral available to Foothill as Foothill may designate. 
Borrower authorizes Foothill to enter the premises where the Collateral is
located, to take and maintain possession of the Collateral, or any part of
it, and to pay, purchase, contest, or compromise any encumbrance, charge, or
lien that in Foothill's determination appears to conflict with its security
interests and to pay all expenses incurred in connection therewith. With
respect to any of Borrower's owned premises, Borrower hereby grants Foothill
a license to enter into possession of such premises and to occupy the same,
without charge, for up to one hundred twenty (120) days in order to exercise
any of Foothill's rights or remedies provided herein, at law, in equity, or
otherwise;

(g) Without notice to Borrower (such notice being expressly
waived), and without constituting a retention of any collateral in
satisfaction of an obligation (within the meaning of Section 9505 of the
Code), set off and apply to the Obligations any and all (i) balances and
deposits of Borrower held by Foothill (including any amounts received in the
Lock Boxes), or (ii) indebtedness at any time owing to or for the credit or
the account of Borrower held by Foothill;

(h) Hold, as cash collateral, any and all balances and
deposits of Borrower held by Foothill, and any amounts received in the Lock
Boxes, to secure the full and final repayment of all of the Obligations;

(i) Ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain, repair,
prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and sell (in the manner provided for
herein or in the Mortgages) the Collateral. Foothill is hereby granted a
license or other right to use, without charge, Borrower's labels, patents,
copyrights, rights of use of any name, trade secrets, trade names,
trademarks, service marks, and advertising matter, or any property of a
similar nature, as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production
of, advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and Borrower's rights
under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to Foothill's
benefit;

(j) Sell the Collateral at either a public or private sale,
or both, by way of one or more contracts or transactions, for cash or on
terms, in such manner and at such places (including Borrower's premises) as
Foothill determines is commercially reasonable. It is not necessary that the
Collateral be present at any such sale;

(k) Foothill shall give notice of the disposition of the
Collateral as follows:

(1) Foothill shall give Borrower and each holder of a
security interest in the Collateral who has filed with Foothill a written
request for notice, a notice in writing of the time and place of public sale,
or, if the sale is a private sale or some other disposition other than a
public sale is to be made of the Collateral, then the time on or after which
the private sale or other disposition is to be made;

(2) The notice shall be personally delivered or mailed,
postage prepaid, to Borrower as provided in Section 12, at least five (5)
days before the date fixed for the sale, or at least five (5) days before the
date on or after which the private sale or other disposition is to be made;
no notice needs to be given prior to the disposition of any portion of the
Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or
that is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market. Notice to Persons
other than Borrower claiming an interest in the Collateral shall be sent to
such addresses as they have furnished to Foothill;

(3) If the sale is to be a public sale, Foothill also
shall give notice of the time and place by publishing a notice one time at
least five (5) days before the date of the sale in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county in which the sale is to be held;

(l) Foothill may credit bid and purchase at any public sale;
and

(m) Any deficiency that exists after disposition of the
Collateral as provided above will be paid immediately by Borrower. Any
excess will be returned, without interest and subject to the rights of third
Persons, by Foothill to Borrower.

9.2 Remedies Cumulative. Foothill's rights and remedies under
this Agreement, the Loan Documents, and all other agreements shall be
cumulative. Foothill shall have all other rights and remedies not
inconsistent herewith as provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. No
exercise by Foothill of one right or remedy shall be deemed an election, and
no waiver by Foothill of any Event of Default shall be deemed a continuing
waiver. No delay by Foothill shall constitute a waiver, election, or
acquiescence by it.

9.3 Foreclosure Not A Discharge. Foreclosure shall not operate as
a discharge to Borrower's Obligations to Foothill as to Hazardous Materials
and the indemnity provisions in Section 11; and in the event Borrower tenders
a deed in lieu of foreclosure for all or part of the Real Property, Borrower
shall deliver such property to Foothill (or its designee) free of any and all
Hazardous Materials. The indemnity provisions in Section 11 shall not be
discharged or affected in any way by foreclosure or by Foothill's acceptance
of a deed in lieu thereof, and the same shall continue for a period equal to
the longest living child born in Los Angeles County on January 1, 1994, plus
twenty-one (21) years.

10. TAXES AND EXPENSES REGARDING THE COLLATERAL.

If Borrower fails to pay any monies (whether taxes, rents,
assessments, insurance premiums, or otherwise) due to third Persons, or fails
to make any deposits or furnish any required proof of payment or deposit, all
as required under the terms of this Agreement or the Mortgages, then, to the
extent that Foothill reasonably determines that such failure by Borrower
could have a material adverse effect on Foothill's interests in the
Collateral, in its discretion and upon five (5) days prior notice to
Borrower, Foothill may do any or all of the following: (a) make payment of
the same or any part thereof; (b) set up such reserves in Borrower's loan
account as Foothill deems necessary to protect Foothill from the exposure
created by such failure; or (c) obtain and maintain insurance policies of the
type described in Section 6.12, and take any action with respect to such
policies as Foothill deems prudent. Any such amounts paid by Foothill shall
constitute Foothill Expenses. Any such payments made by Foothill shall not
constitute an agreement by Foothill to make similar payments in the future or
a waiver by Foothill of any Event of Default under this Agreement. Foothill
need not inquire as to, or contest the validity of, any such expense, tax,
security interest, encumbrance, or lien and the receipt of the usual official
notice for the payment thereof shall be conclusive evidence that the same was
validly due and owing.

11. WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

11.1 Demand; Protest; etc. Borrower waives demand, protest, notice
of protest, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment,
notice of any default, nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise,
settlement, extension, or renewal of accounts, documents, instruments,
chattel paper, and guarantees at any time held by Foothill on which Borrower
may in any way be liable.

11.2 Foothill's Liability for Collateral. So long as Foothill
complies with its obligations, if any, under Section 9207 of the Code,
Foothill shall not in any way or manner be liable or responsible for: (a)
the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b) any loss or damage thereto occurring
or arising in any manner or fashion from any cause; (c) any diminution in the
value thereof; or (d) any act or default of any carrier, warehouseman,
bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person. All risk of loss, damage, or
destruction of the Collateral shall be borne by Borrower.

11.3 Indemnification. Borrower agrees to defend, indemnify, save,
and hold all Indemnified Persons harmless against: (a) all obligations,
demands, claims, and liabilities claimed or asserted by any other Person
arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any other Loan Document including, but not limited to, those claimed by
any broker or finder unless such obligations, demands, claims or liabilities
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Person; (b) all Losses, in any way suffered, incurred, or paid as a result of
or in any way, arising out of, following, or consequential to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless
such Losses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnified Person; and (c) all Losses suffered or incurred, regardless of
negligence, whether as a holder of security interests in Real Property, as
mortgagee in possession, or as successor in interest to Borrower as owner of
the Real Property by virtue of foreclosure or acceptance of a deed or other
transaction in lieu of foreclosure, or after partial or total reconveyance of
the mortgage, arising from, in respect of, as a consequence of (whether
foreseeable or unforeseeable) or in connection with the use, storage,

Materials at or related to the Real Property whether or not originating or
emanating from the Real Property. This provision shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

and each of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and
representatives) to use reasonable precautions to keep confidential in
accordance with its customary business practices, any non-public information
supplied to it by the Borrower, provided that nothing herein shall limit the

any request for disclosure and use reasonable efforts to provide the Borrower

information or an order providing for the handling of such information in a
confidential matter.

Foothill Expenses arising after the occurrence and during the continuance of

Maker, the status of the other Maker and of all circumstances which bear
upon the risk of nonpayment. Absent a written request from either Maker

by the Holder from either Maker.

(g) The Holder shall render to United Merchants and
Manufacturers, Inc., on behalf of Makers, one statement of the Loan
Account, which shall be deemed to be an account stated as to each Maker
and which will be deemed correct and accepted by each Maker unless the
Holder receives a written statement of exceptions from either Maker within
thirty (30) days after such statement has been rendered by the Holder. 
Each Maker hereby expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Holder
shall have no obligation to account separately to such Maker.

(h) Each Maker expressly agrees and acknowledges
that the Holder shall have no responsibility to inquire into the correctness
of the apportionment or allocation of or any disposition by either of the
Makers of (i) the loan evidenced by this Note, or (b) any of the interest,
expenses and other items charged to the Loan Account pursuant to this
Agreement. Such loan, all interest and expenses and other items shall be
made for the collective, joint, and several account of the Makers and shall
be charged to the Loan Account.

(i) Each Maker agrees and acknowledges that the
administration of this Note on a combined basis, as set forth herein, is
being done as an accommodation to Makers and at their request, and that
the Holder shall incur no liability to either of the Makers as a result
thereof. To induce Foothill to do so, and in consideration thereof, each of
the Makers hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Holder harmless from
and against any and all liability, expense, loss, damage, claim of damage,
or injury, made against the Holder by either of the Makers or by any
other person or entity, arising from or incurred by reason of such
administration of this Note.

to Foothill's security interests in such Inventory.

(b) Anything to the contrary in Section 2.1(a) above
notwithstanding, Foothill may reduce its advance rates based upon Eligible
Accounts or Eligible Inventory without declaring an Event of Default if it
determines, in its reasonable discretion, that there is a material impairment
of the prospect of repayment of all or any portion of the Obligations or a
material impairment of the value or priority of Foothill's security interests
in the Collateral.

(c) Foothill shall have no obligation to make advances
hereunder to the extent they would cause:

(i) the outstanding advances under this
Section 2.1 to exceed Thirteen Million Dollars ($13,000,000) or Sixteen
Million Dollars ($16,000,000) for the period of July 1 through

or Twenty Two Million Dollars ($22,000,000) for the period of July 1
through November 30 of each year.

(d) Foothill is authorized to make advances under this
Agreement based upon telephonic or other instructions received from

instructions if pursuant to Section 2.5(c). Borrower agrees to establish
and maintain a single designated deposit account for the purpose of

loan jointly to Borrower and UM&M in the original principal amount of Two
Million Dollars ($2,000,000), to be evidenced by and repayable in accordance

date herewith, executed by Borrower and UM&M in favor of Foothill. All
amounts evidenced by the Combined Term Note shall constitute Obligations.

2.4 Overadvances. If, at any time or for any reason, the
amount of Obligations owed by Borrower to Foothill pursuant to Section 2.1
is greater than either the dollar or percentage limitations set forth in
Section 2.1 (an "Overadvance"), Borrower immediately shall pay to Foothill,
in cash, the amount of such excess to be used by Foothill to repay
Obligations.

2.5 Interest: Rates, Payments, and Calculations.

(a) Interest Rate. All Obligations shall bear interest,
on the average Daily Balance, at the rate of two percent (2%) per month.

(b) Intentionally omitted.

occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (as and
when incurred), and all installments or other payments due under the
Combined Term Note, any note or other Loan Document to Borrower's loan
account, which amounts shall thereafter accrue interest at the rate then
applicable hereunder. Any interest not paid when due shall be
compounded by becoming a part of the Obligations, and such interest shall
thereafter accrue interest at the rate then applicable hereunder.

(d) Computation. All interest and fees chargeable
under the Loan Documents shall be computed on the basis of a three
hundred sixty (360) day year for the actual number of days elapsed.

(e) Intent to Limit Charges to Maximum Lawful Rate. 
In no event shall the interest rate or rates payable under this Agreement
or the Combined Term Note, plus any other amounts paid in connection
herewith, exceed the highest rate permissible under any law that a court
of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable. 
Borrower and Foothill, in executing this Agreement and the Combined Term
Note, intend to legally agree upon the rate or rates of interest and manner
of payment stated within it; provided, however, that, anything contained
herein or in the Combined Term Note to the contrary notwithstanding, if
said rate or rates of interest or manner of payment exceeds the maximum
allowable under applicable law, then, ipso facto as of the date of this
Agreement and the Combined Term Note, Borrower is and shall be liable
only for the payment of such maximum as allowed by law, and payment
received from Borrower in excess of such legal maximum, whenever
received, shall be applied to reduce the principal balance of the Obligations
to the extent of such excess.

2.6 Crediting Payments; Application of Collections. The
receipt of any wire transfer of funds, check, or other item of payment by
Foothill (whether from transfers to Foothill by the Lock Box Bank pursuant
to the Lock Box Agreements or otherwise) immediately shall be applied to
provisionally reduce the Obligations, but shall not be considered a payment
on account unless such wire transfer is of immediately available federal
funds and is made to the appropriate deposit account of Foothill or unless
and until such check or other item of payment is honored when presented
for payment. From and after the Closing Date, Foothill shall be entitled to
charge Borrower for five (5) Business Days of `clearance' at the rate set
forth in Sections 2.5(a) (applicable to advances under Section 2.1) on all
checks or other items of payment that are not in immediately available
funds that are received by Foothill (except for wire transfers of federal
funds). This five (5) Business Day clearance charge on certain receipts
is acknowledged by the parties to constitute an integral aspect of the
pricing of Foothill's facility to Borrower, and shall apply irrespective of
the characterization of whether receipts are owned by Borrower or Foothill,
and irrespective of the level of Borrower's Obligations to Foothill. Should
any check or item of payment not be honored when presented for payment,
then Borrower shall be deemed not to have made such payment, and
interest shall be recalculated accordingly. Anything to the contrary
contained herein notwithstanding, any wire transfer, check, or other item
of payment shall be deemed received by Foothill only if it is received into
Foothill's Operating Account (as such account is identified in the Lock Box
Agreements) on or before 11:00 a.m. Los Angeles time. If any wire
transfer, check, or other item of payment is received into Foothill's
Operating Account (as such account is identified in the Lock Box
Agreements) after 11:00 a.m. Los Angeles time it shall be deemed to have
been received by Foothill as of the opening of business on the immediately
following Business Day.

2.7 Statements of Obligations. Foothill shall render
statements to Borrower of the Obligations, including principal, interest,
fees, and including an itemization of all charges and expenses constituting
Foothill Expenses owing, and such statements shall be conclusively
presumed to be correct and accurate and constitute an account stated
between Borrower and Foothill unless, within thirty (30) days after receipt
thereof by Borrower, Borrower shall deliver to Foothill by registered or
certified mail at its address specified in Section 12, written objection
thereto describing the error or errors contained in any such statements.

filings, security agreements, chattel mortgages, pledges, assignments,
endorsements of certificates of title, applications for title, affidavits,
reports, notices, schedules of accounts, letters of authority, and all other
documents that Foothill may reasonably request, in form satisfactory to
Foothill, to perfect and continue perfected Foothill's security interests in
the Collateral and in order to fully consummate all of the transactions
contemplated hereby and under the other the Loan Documents.

4.5 Power of Attorney. Borrower hereby irrevocably makes,
constitutes, and appoints Foothill (and any of Foothill's officers, employees,
or agents designated by Foothill) as Borrower's true and lawful attorney,
with power to: (a) send requests for verification of Accounts; (b) endorse
Borrower's name on any checks, notices, acceptances, money orders, drafts,
or other item of payment or security that may come into Foothill's
possession; (c) at any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, settle and adjust disputes and claims respecting the Accounts
directly with Account Debtors, for amounts and upon terms which Foothill
determines to be reasonable, and Foothill may cause to be executed and
delivered any documents and releases which Foothill determines to be
necessary. The appointment of Foothill as Borrower's attorney, and each
and every one of Foothill's rights and powers, being coupled with an
interest, is irrevocable until all of the Obligations have been fully and
finally repaid and performed and Foothill's obligation to extend credit
hereunder is terminated.

4.6 Right to Inspect. Foothill (through any of its officers,
employees, or agents) shall have the right, from time to time hereafter,
during normal business hours, to inspect Borrower's Books and to check,
test, and appraise the Collateral in order to verify Borrower's financial
condition or the amount, quality, value, condition of, or any other matter
relating to, the Collateral.

5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. 

Borrower represents and warrants to Foothill as follows:

5.1 No Prior Encumbrances. Borrower has good and
indefeasible title to the Collateral, free and clear of liens, claims, security
interests, or encumbrances, except for Permitted Liens.

5.2 Eligible Accounts. All of Borrower's representations and
warranties in this Section are based upon Borrower's knowledge after
reasonable review in accordance with normal and prudent business
practices. The Eligible Accounts are, at the time of the creation thereof
and as of each date on which Borrower includes them in a Borrowing Base
calculation or certification, bona fide existing obligations created by the
sale and delivery of Inventory or the rendition of services to Account
Debtors in the ordinary course of Borrower's business, unconditionally
owed to Borrower without defenses, disputes, offsets, counterclaims, or
rights of return or cancellation. Except for Accounts arising from bill and
hold sales, the property giving rise to such Eligible Accounts has been
delivered to the Account Debtor, or to the Account Debtor's agent for
immediate shipment to and unconditional acceptance by the Account Debtor. 
At the time of the creation of an Eligible Account and as of each date on
which Borrower includes an Eligible Account in a Borrowing Base
calculation or certification, Borrower has not received notice of actual or
imminent bankruptcy, insolvency, or material impairment of the financial
condition of any applicable Account Debtor regarding such Eligible Account.

5.3 Eligible Inventory. All Eligible Inventory is now and at
all times hereafter shall be of good and merchantable quality, free from
defects.

5.4 Location of Inventory and Equipment. The Inventory
and Equipment are not stored with a bailee, warehouseman, or similar party
(without Foothill's prior written consent) and are located only at the
locations identified on Schedule 6.15 or otherwise permitted by Section 6.15.

5.5 Inventory Records. Borrower now keeps, and hereafter
at all times shall keep, correct and accurate records itemizing and
describing the kind, type, quality, and quantity of the Inventory, and
Borrower's cost therefor.

5.6 Location of Chief Executive Office; FEIN. The chief
executive office of Borrower is located at the address indicated in the
preamble to this Agreement and Borrower's FEIN is 05-0301429.

5.7 Due Organization and Qualification. Borrower is duly
organized and existing and in good standing under the laws of the state
of its incorporation and qualified and licensed to do business in, and in
good standing in, any state where the failure to be so licensed or qualified
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise), finances, or
prospects of Borrower or on the value of the Collateral to Foothill.

5.8 Due Authorization; No Conflict. The execution, delivery,
and performance of the Loan Documents are within Borrower's corporate
powers, have been duly authorized, and are not in conflict with nor
constitute a breach of any provision contained in Borrower's Articles or
Certificate of Incorporation, or By-laws, nor will they constitute an event
of default under any material agreement to which Borrower is a party or
by which its properties or assets may be bound.

5.9 Litigation. There are no actions or proceedings pending
by or against Borrower before any court or administrative agency and
Borrower does not have knowledge or belief of any pending, threatened,
or imminent litigation, governmental investigations, or claims, complaints,
actions, or prosecutions involving Borrower or any guarantor of the
Obligations, except for: (a) ongoing collection matters in which Borrower is
the plaintiff; (b) matters disclosed on Schedule 5.9; and (c) matters arising
after the date hereof that, if decided adversely to Borrower, would not
materially impair the prospect of repayment of the Obligations or materially
impair the value or priority of Foothill's security interests in the
Collateral.

5.10 No Material Adverse Change in Financial Condition. All
financial statements relating to Borrower or any guarantor of the
Obligations that have been delivered by Borrower to Foothill have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present Borrower's (or such
guarantor's, as applicable) financial condition as of the date thereof and
Borrower's results of operations for the period then ended. There has not
been a material adverse change in the financial condition of Borrower (or
such guarantor, as applicable) since the date of the latest financial
statements submitted to Foothill on or before the Closing Date.

5.11 No Transfer. No transfer of property is being made by
Borrower and no obligation is being incurred by Borrower in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud either present or
future creditors of Borrower.

5.12 Employee Benefits. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.12,
each of the following provisions of this Section 5.12 is true. Each Plan is
in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
ERISA and the IRC. Each Qualified Plan and Multiemployer Plan has been
determined by the Internal Revenue Service to qualify under Section 401
of the IRC, and the trusts created thereunder have been determined to be
exempt from tax under Section 501 of the IRC, and, to the best knowledge
of Borrower, nothing has occurred that would cause the loss of such
qualification or tax-exempt status. There are no outstanding liabilities
under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Plan maintained or sponsored
by Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate, nor with respect to any Plan to which
Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate contributes or is obligated to contribute
which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the financial condition of Borrower. No Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA
has any Unfunded Benefit Liability which could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of Borrower. 
Neither Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has transferred any Unfunded
Benefit Liability to a person other than Borrower or an ERISA Affiliate or
has otherwise engaged in a transaction that could be subject to Sections
4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA which could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition of Borrower. Neither
Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred nor reasonably expects to
incur (x) any liability (and no event has occurred which, with the giving
of notice under Section 4219 of ERISA, would result in such liability) under
Sections 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a Multiemployer Plan, or
(y) any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than premiums due but not
delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA) with respect to a Plan, which
could, in either event, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition of Borrower. Within the past six (6)
years, no application for a funding waiver or an extension of any
amortization period pursuant to Section 412 of the IRC has been made with
respect to any Plan. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur with respect to any Plan which could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of
Borrower. Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate have complied in all material
respects with the notice and continuation coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the IRC.

5.13 Reliance by Foothill; Cumulative. Each warranty and
representation contained in this Agreement automatically shall be deemed
repeated with each advance and shall be conclusively presumed to have
been relied on by Foothill regardless of any investigation made or
information possessed by Foothill. The warranties and representations set
forth herein shall be cumulative and in addition to any and all other
warranties and representations that Borrower now or hereafter shall give,
or cause to be given, to Foothill.

6. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

Borrower covenants and agrees that, so long as any credit
hereunder shall be available and until full and final payment of the
Obligations, and unless Foothill shall otherwise consent in writing, Borrower
shall do all of the following:

6.1 Accounting System. Borrower shall maintain a standard
and modern system of accounting in accordance with GAAP with ledger and
account cards or computer tapes, discs, printouts, and records pertaining
to the Collateral which contain information as from time to time may be
requested by Foothill. Borrower also shall keep proper books of account
showing all sales, claims, and allowances on its Inventory.

6.2 Collateral Reports. Borrower shall deliver to Foothill, no
later than the tenth (10th) day of each month during the term of this
Agreement, a detailed aging, by total, of the Accounts, a reconciliation
statement, and a summary, by vendor, of all accounts payable, including
due dates of invoices, and any book overdraft. Original sales invoices
evidencing daily sales shall be mailed by Borrower to each Account Debtor
with, at Foothill's request, a copy to Foothill, and, after the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at Foothill's direction,
the invoices shall indicate on their face that the Account has been
assigned to Foothill and that all payments are to be made directly to
Foothill. Borrower shall deliver to Foothill, as Foothill may from time to
time require, collection reports, sales journals, invoices, original delivery
receipts, customer's purchase orders, shipping instructions, bills of lading,
and other documentation respecting shipment arrangements. Absent such
a request by Foothill, copies of all such documentation shall be held by
Borrower as custodian for Foothill.

6.3 Schedules of Accounts. With such regularity as Foothill
shall require, Borrower shall provide Foothill with schedules describing all
Accounts. Foothill's failure to request such schedules or Borrower's failure
to execute and deliver such schedules shall not affect or limit Foothill's
security interests or other rights in and to the Accounts.

6.4 Financial Statements, Reports, Certificates. Borrower
agrees to deliver to Foothill: (a) as soon as available, but in any event
within forty-five (45) days after the end of each month during each of
Borrower's fiscal years, a company prepared income statement and cash
flow statement covering Borrower's operations during such period; and (b)
as soon as available, but in any event within ninety (90) days after the
end of each of Borrower's fiscal years, financial statements of Borrower for
each such fiscal year, audited by KPMG Peat Marwick or by other
independent certified public accountants reasonably acceptable to Foothill
and certified, without any qualifications (other than going concern or
consistency with prior year in the case of a change of accounting
principle), by such accountants to have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP, together with a certificate of such accountants addressed to Foothill
stating that such accountants do not have knowledge of the existence of
any event or condition constituting an Event of Default, or that would,
with the passage of time or the giving of notice, constitute an Event of
Default. Such audited financial statements shall include a balance sheet,
profit and loss statement, and cash flow statement, and, if prepared, such
accountants' letter to management. If Borrower is a parent company of one
or more subsidiaries, or Affiliates, or is a subsidiary or Affiliate of another
company, then, in addition to the financial statements referred to above,
Borrower agrees to deliver financial statements prepared on a consolidating
basis so as to present Borrower and each such related entity separately,
and on a consolidated basis.

Together with the above, Borrower also shall deliver to
Foothill Borrower's Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports, Form 10-K Annual Reports,
and Form 8-K Current Reports, and any other filings made by Borrower
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, if any, as soon as the same
are filed, or any other information that is provided by Borrower to its
shareholders, and any other report reasonably requested by Foothill
relating to the Collateral and financial condition of Borrower.

Each month, together with the financial statements
provided pursuant to Section 6.4(a), Borrower shall deliver to Foothill a
certificate signed by its chief financial officer to the effect that: (i) all
reports, statements, or computer prepared information of any kind or
nature delivered or caused to be delivered to Foothill hereunder have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for footnotes for monthly
statements) and fairly present the financial condition of Borrower;
(ii) Borrower is in timely compliance with all of its covenants and
agreements hereunder; (iii) the representations and warranties of Borrower
contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true and
correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such certificate,
as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent that such
representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date); and (iv)
on the date of delivery of such certificate to Foothill there does not exist
any condition or event that constitutes an Event of Default (or, in each
case, to the extent of any non-compliance, describing such non-compliance
as to which he or she may have knowledge and what action Borrower has
taken, is taking, or proposes to take with respect thereto).

Borrower shall have issued written instructions to its
independent certified public accountants authorizing them after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or with
Borrower's cooperation prior thereto, to communicate with Foothill and to
release to Foothill whatever financial information concerning Borrower that
Foothill may request. After the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs all auditors,
accountants, or other third parties to deliver to Foothill, at Borrower's
expense, copies of Borrower's financial statements, papers related thereto,
and other accounting records of any nature in their possession, and to
disclose to Foothill any information they may have regarding Borrower's
business affairs and financial conditions.

6.5 Tax Returns. Borrower agrees to deliver to Foothill
copies of each of Borrower's future federal income tax returns, and any
amendments thereto, within thirty (30) days of the filing thereof with the
Internal Revenue Service.

6.6 Guarantor Reports. Borrower agrees to cause UM&M to
deliver its annual financial statements at the time when Borrower provides
its audited financial statements to Foothill and copies of all federal income
tax returns as soon as the same are available and in any event no later
than thirty (30) days after the same are required to be filed by law.

6.7 Designation of Inventory. Borrower shall now and from
time to time hereafter, but not less frequently than monthly, execute and
deliver to Foothill a designation of Inventory specifying the lower of
Borrower's cost or market value of Borrower's raw materials, work in
process, and finished goods, and further specifying such other information
as Foothill may reasonably request.

6.8 Returns. Returns and allowances, if any, as between
Borrower and its Account Debtors shall be on the same basis and in
accordance with the usual customary practices of Borrower, as they exist
at the time of the execution and delivery of this Agreement. If, at a time
when no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any Account
Debtor returns any Inventory to Borrower, Borrower promptly shall
determine the reason for such return and, if Borrower accepts such
return, issue a credit memorandum in the appropriate amount to such
Account Debtor. If, at a time when an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, any Account Debtor returns any Inventory to Borrower,
Borrower promptly shall determine the reason for such return and, if
Foothill consents (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), issue
a credit memorandum (with a copy to be sent to Foothill) in the
appropriate amount to such Account Debtor. On a daily basis, Borrower
shall notify Foothill of all returns and recoveries and of all disputes and
claims of which it is aware.

6.9 Title to Equipment. Upon Foothill's request, Borrower
immediately shall deliver to Foothill, properly endorsed, any and all
evidences of ownership of, certificates of title, or applications for title to
any items of Equipment.

6.10 Maintenance of Equipment. Borrower shall keep and
maintain the Equipment in good operating condition and repair (ordinary
wear and tear excepted) in accordance with past practices, and make all
necessary replacements thereto so that the value and operating efficiency
thereof shall at all times be maintained and preserved. Borrower shall not
permit any item of Equipment to become a fixture (other than a trade
fixture) to real estate or an accession to other property, and the
Equipment is now and shall at all times remain personal property.

6.11 Taxes. All assessments and taxes, whether real, personal,
or otherwise, due or payable by, or imposed, levied, or assessed against
Borrower or any of its property have been paid, and shall hereafter be
paid in full, before delinquency or before the expiration of any extension
period. Borrower shall make due and timely payment or deposit of all
federal, state, and local taxes, assessments, or contributions required of it
by law, and will execute and deliver to Foothill, on demand, appropriate
certificates attesting to the payment thereof or deposit with respect
thereto. Borrower will make timely payment or deposit of all tax payments
and withholding taxes required of it by applicable laws, including those
laws concerning F.I.C.A., F.U.T.A., state disability, and local, state, and
federal income taxes, and will, upon request, furnish Foothill with proof
satisfactory to Foothill indicating that Borrower has made such payments
or deposits.

6.12 Insurance.

(a) Borrower, at its expense, shall keep the Collateral
insured against loss or damage by fire, theft, explosion, sprinklers, and all
other hazards and risks, and in such amounts, as are ordinarily insured
against by other owners in similar businesses. Borrower also shall
maintain business interruption, public liability, product liability, and
property damage insurance, as well as insurance against larceny,
embezzlement, and criminal misappropriation.

(b) All insurance required herein shall be written by
companies of recognized financial standing, satisfactory to Foothill, which
are authorized to do insurance business in the State of California. Such
insurance shall be in form satisfactory to Foothill, shall with respect to
hazard insurance and such other insurance as Foothill shall specify, name
as the loss payee thereunder Borrower and Foothill, as their interests may
appear, and shall contain a California Form 438BFU (NS) mortgagee
endorsement, or its local equivalent. Every policy of insurance referred
to in this Section shall contain an agreement by the insurer that it will not
cancel such policy except after thirty (30) days' prior written notice to
Foothill and that any loss payable thereunder shall be payable notwith-
standing any act or negligence of Borrower or Foothill which might, absent
such agreement, result in a forfeiture of all or a part of such insurance
payment.

(c) Original policies or certificates thereof satisfactory
to Foothill evidencing such insurance shall be delivered to Foothill at least
thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the existing or preceding
policies. Borrower shall give Foothill prompt notice of any loss covered by
such insurance and Foothill shall have the right to adjust any loss. 
Foothill shall have the exclusive right to adjust all losses in excess of One
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) payable under any such
insurance policies without any liability to Borrower whatsoever in respect
of such adjustments; provided, however that Foothill will consult with
Borrower with respect of such adjustments and will act in a commercially
reasonable manner in respect thereto. Any monies received as payment for
any loss in excess of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) under
any insurance policy including, but not limited to, the insurance policies
mentioned above, shall be paid over to Foothill to be applied at the option
of Foothill either to the prepayment of the Obligations without premium, in
such order or manner as Foothill may elect, or shall be disbursed to
Borrower under stage payment terms satisfactory to Foothill for application
to the cost of repairs, replacements or restorations. All restorations shall
be effected with reasonable promptness and shall be of a value at least
equal to the value of the items or property to destroyed prior to such
damage or destruction. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all
prepaid premiums shall be the sole and absolute property of Foothill to be
applied by Foothill to the payment of the Obligations in such order or form
as Foothill shall determine.

(d) Borrower shall not take out separate insurance
concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required
to be maintained under this Section 6.12, unless Foothill is included
thereon as named insured with the loss payable to Foothill under a
standard California 438BFU (NS) Mortgagee endorsement, or its local
equivalent. Borrower shall immediately notify Foothill whenever such
separate insurance is taken out, specifying the insurer thereunder and full
particulars as to the policies evidencing the same, and originals of such
policies shall immediately thereafter be provided to Foothill.

6.13 Tangible Net Worth. Tangible Net Worth shall not
decrease by more than Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000) from March 31,
1994, measured on a fiscal quarter-end basis. In calculating the decrease
in Tangible Net Worth the following shall not be included: (a) conversions
of Indebtedness into equity, (b) forgiveness of Indebtedness, and (c) the
issuance of new equity securities by Borrower.

6.14 No Setoffs or Counterclaims. All payments hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents made by or on behalf of Borrower shall
be made without setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of, and without
deduction or withholding for or on account of, any federal, state, or local
taxes.

6.15 Location of Inventory and Equipment. Borrower shall
keep the Inventory and Equipment only at the locations identified on
Schedule 6.15; provided, however, that Borrower may amend Schedule 6.15
July 12, 1994 so long as such amendment occurs by written notice to
Foothill not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the
Inventory or Equipment is moved to such new location, so long as such
new location is within the continental United States, and so long as, at the
time of such written notification, Borrower provides any financing
statements or fixture filings necessary to perfect and continue perfected
Foothill's security interests in such assets and also provides to Foothill a
landlord's waiver in form and substance satisfactory to Foothill.

6.16 Compliance with Laws. Borrower shall comply with the
requirements of all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and orders of any
governmental authority, including the Fair Labor Standards Act and the
ADA.

6.17 Employee Benefits.

(a) Borrower shall deliver to Foothill a written
statement by the chief financial officer of Borrower specifying the nature
of any of the following events and the actions which Borrower proposes to
take with respect thereto promptly, and in any event within ten (10) days
of becoming aware of any of them, and when known, any action taken or
threatened by the Internal Revenue Service, PBGC, Department of Labor,
or other party with respect thereto: (i) an ERISA Event with respect to
any Plan; (ii) the incurrence of an obligation to pay additional premium to
the PBGC under Section 4006(a)(3)(E) of ERISA with respect to any Plan;
and (iii) any lien on the assets of Borrower arising in connection with any
Plan.

(b) Borrower shall also promptly furnish to Foothill
copies prepared or received by Borrower or an ERISA Affiliate of: (i) at
the request of Foothill, each annual report (Internal Revenue Service Form
5500 series) and all accompanying schedules, actuarial reports, financial
information concerning the financial status of each Plan, and schedules
showing the amounts contributed to each Plan by or on behalf of Borrower
or its ERISA Affiliates for the most recent three (3) plan years; (ii) all
notices of intent to terminate or to have a trustee appointed to administer
any Plan; (iii) all written demands by the PBGC under Subtitle D of Title
IV of ERISA; (iv) all notices required to be sent to employees or to the
PBGC under Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the IRC; (v) all written
notices received with respect to a Multiemployer Plan concerning (x) the
imposition or amount of withdrawal liability pursuant to Section 4202 of
ERISA, (y) a termination described in Section 4041A of ERISA, or (z) a
reorganization or insolvency described in Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA;
(vi) the adoption of any new Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the IRC by Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate; (vii) the
adoption of any amendment to any Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA
or Section 412 of the IRC, if such amendment results in a material increase
in benefits or Unfunded Benefit Liability; or (viii) the commencement of
contributions by Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate to any Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the IRC.

6.18 Consigned Inventory. Borrower agrees that each
Inventory designation provided under Section 6.7 shall also separately
identify and value all Inventory consigned to third Persons.

7. NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

Borrower covenants and agrees that, so long as any credit
hereunder shall be available and until full and final payment of the
Obligations, Borrower will not do any of the following without Foothill's
prior written consent:

or otherwise become or remain, directly or indirectly, liable with respect
to any Indebtedness, except:

Combined Term Note;

(b) Indebtedness set forth in the latest financial
statements of Borrower submitted to Foothill on or prior to the Closing
Date;

(c) Indebtedness secured by Permitted Liens; and

(d) refinancings, renewals, or extensions of
Indebtedness permitted under clauses (b) and (c) of this Section 7.1 (and
continuance or renewal of any Permitted Liens associated therewith) so
long as: (i) the terms and conditions of such refinancings, renewals, or
extensions do not materially impair the prospects of repayment of the
Obligations by Borrower, (ii) the net cash proceeds of such refinancings,
renewals, or extensions do not result in an increase in the aggregate
principal amount of the Indebtedness so refinanced, renewed, or extended,
(iii) such refinancings, renewals, refundings, or extensions do not result
in a shortening of the average weighted maturity of the Indebtedness so
refinanced, renewed, or extended, and (iv) to the extent that Indebtedness
that is refinanced was subordinated in right of payment to the Obligations,
then the subordination terms and conditions of the refinancing
Indebtedness must be at least as favorable to Foothill as those applicable
to the refinanced Indebtedness.

7.2 Liens. Create, incur, assume, or permit to exist, directly
or indirectly, any lien on or with respect to any of its property or assets,
of any kind, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income or
profits therefrom, except for Permitted Liens (including liens that are
replacements of Permitted Liens to the extent that the original
Indebtedness is refinanced under Section 7.1(e) and so long as the
replacement liens secure only those assets or property that secured the
original Indebtedness).

outstanding at any one time, directly or indirectly make or acquire any
beneficial interest in (including stock, partnership interest, or other
securities of), or make any loan, advance, or capital contribution to, any
Person.

9. FOOTHILL'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

9.1 Rights and Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default Foothill may, at its election, without notice of its election and
without demand, do any one or more of the following, all of which are
authorized by Borrower:

(a) Declare all Obligations, whether evidenced by this
Agreement, by any of the other Loan Documents, or otherwise, immediately
due and payable;

(b) Cease advancing money or extending credit to or
for the benefit of Borrower under this Agreement, under any of the Loan
Documents, or under any other agreement between Borrower and Foothill;

(c) Terminate this Agreement and any of the other
Loan Documents as to any future liability or obligation of Foothill, but
without affecting Foothill's rights and security interests in the Collateral
and without affecting the Obligations;

(d) Settle or adjust disputes and claims directly with
Account Debtors for amounts and upon terms which Foothill considers
advisable, and in such cases, Foothill will credit Borrower's loan account
with only the net amounts received by Foothill in payment of such
disputed Accounts after deducting all Foothill Expenses incurred or
expended in connection therewith;

(e) Cause Borrower to hold all returned Inventory in
trust for Foothill, segregate all returned Inventory from all other property
of Borrower or in Borrower's possession and conspicuously label said
returned Inventory as the property of Foothill;

(f) Without notice to or demand upon Borrower or any
guarantor, make such payments and do such acts as Foothill considers
necessary or reasonable to protect its security interests in the Collateral. 
Borrower agrees to assemble the Collateral if Foothill so requires, and to
make the Collateral available to Foothill as Foothill may designate. 
Borrower authorizes Foothill to enter the premises where the Collateral is
located, to take and maintain possession of the Collateral, or any part of
it, and to pay, purchase, contest, or compromise any encumbrance, charge,
or lien that in Foothill's determination appears to conflict with its security
interests and to pay all expenses incurred in connection therewith. With
respect to any of Borrower's owned premises, Borrower hereby grants
Foothill a license to enter into possession of such premises and to occupy
the same, without charge, for up to one hundred twenty (120) days in
order to exercise any of Foothill's rights or remedies provided herein, at
law, in equity, or otherwise;

(g) Without notice to Borrower (such notice being
expressly waived), and without constituting a retention of any collateral in
satisfaction of an obligation (within the meaning of Section 9505 of the
Code), set off and apply to the Obligations any and all (i) balances and
deposits of Borrower held by Foothill (including any amounts received in
the Lock Boxes), or (ii) indebtedness at any time owing to or for the credit
or the account of Borrower held by Foothill;

(h) Hold, as cash collateral, any and all balances and
deposits of Borrower held by Foothill, and any amounts received in the
Lock Boxes, to secure the full and final repayment of all of the Obligations;

(i) Ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain,
repair, prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and sell (in the manner
provided for herein) the Collateral. Foothill is hereby granted a license
or other right to use, without charge, Borrower's labels, patents,
copyrights, rights of use of any name, trade secrets, trade names,
trademarks, service marks, and advertising matter, or any property of a
similar nature, as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production of,
advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and Borrower's rights under
all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to Foothill's benefit;

(j) Sell the Collateral at either a public or private
sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or transactions, for cash
or on terms, in such manner and at such places (including Borrower's
premises) as Foothill determines is commercially reasonable. It is not
necessary that the Collateral be present at any such sale;

(k) Foothill shall give notice of the disposition of the
Collateral as follows:

(1) Foothill shall give Borrower and each holder
of a security interest in the Collateral who has filed with Foothill a written
request for notice, a notice in writing of the time and place of public sale,
or, if the sale is a private sale or some other disposition other than a
public sale is to be made of the Collateral, then the time on or after which
the private sale or other disposition is to be made;

(2) The notice shall be personally delivered or
mailed, postage prepaid, to Borrower as provided in Section 12, at least
five (5) days before the date fixed for the sale, or at least five (5) days
before the date on or after which the private sale or other disposition is
to be made; no notice needs to be given prior to the disposition of any
portion of the Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline speedily
in value or that is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market. 
Notice to Persons other than Borrower claiming an interest in the Collateral
shall be sent to such addresses as they have furnished to Foothill;

(3) If the sale is to be a public sale, Foothill also
shall give notice of the time and place by publishing a notice one time at
least five (5) days before the date of the sale in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county in which the sale is to be held;

(l) Foothill may credit bid and purchase at any public
sale; and

(m) Any deficiency that exists after disposition of the
Collateral as provided above will be paid immediately by Borrower. Any
excess will be returned, without interest and subject to the rights of third
Persons, by Foothill to Borrower.

9.2 Remedies Cumulative. Foothill's rights and remedies
under this Agreement, the Loan Documents, and all other agreements shall
be cumulative. Foothill shall have all other rights and remedies not
inconsistent herewith as provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. 
No exercise by Foothill of one right or remedy shall be deemed an election,
and no waiver by Foothill of any Event of Default shall be deemed a
continuing waiver. No delay by Foothill shall constitute a waiver, election,
or acquiescence by it.

10. TAXES AND EXPENSES REGARDING THE COLLATERAL.

If Borrower fails to pay any monies (whether taxes, rents,
assessments, insurance premiums, or otherwise) due to third Persons, or
fails to make any deposits or furnish any required proof of payment or
deposit, all as required under the terms of this Agreement or the
Mortgages, then, to the extent that Foothill reasonably determines that
such failure by Borrower could have a material adverse effect on Foothill's
interests in the Collateral, in its discretion and upon five (5) days prior
notice to Borrower, Foothill may do any or all of the following: (a) make
payment of the same or any part thereof; (b) set up such reserves in
Borrower's loan account as Foothill deems necessary to protect Foothill
from the exposure created by such failure; or (c) obtain and maintain
insurance policies of the type described in Section 6.12, and take any
action with respect to such policies as Foothill deems prudent. Any such
amounts paid by Foothill shall constitute Foothill Expenses. Any such
payments made by Foothill shall not constitute an agreement by Foothill to
make similar payments in the future or a waiver by Foothill of any Event
of Default under this Agreement. Foothill need not inquire as to, or
contest the validity of, any such expense, tax, security interest,
encumbrance, or lien and the receipt of the usual official notice for the
payment thereof shall be conclusive evidence that the same was validly due
and owing.

11. WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

11.1 Demand; Protest; etc. Borrower waives demand, protest,
notice of protest, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and
nonpayment, notice of any default, nonpayment at maturity, release,
compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of accounts, documents,
instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees at any time held by Foothill on
which Borrower may in any way be liable.

11.2 Foothill's Liability for Collateral. So long as Foothill
complies with its obligations, if any, under Section 9207 of the Code,
Foothill shall not in any way or manner be liable or responsible for: (a)
the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b) any loss or damage thereto occurring
or arising in any manner or fashion from any cause; (c) any diminution in
the value thereof; or (d) any act or default of any carrier, warehouseman,
bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person. All risk of loss, damage, or
destruction of the Collateral shall be borne by Borrower.

11.3 Indemnification. Borrower agrees to defend, indemnify,
save, and hold all Indemnified Persons harmless against: (a) all
obligations, demands, claims, and liabilities claimed or asserted by any
other Person arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any other Loan Document including, but not limited to,
those claimed by any broker or finder unless such obligations, demands,
claims or liabilities result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Indemnified Person, and (b) all Losses in any way suffered,
incurred, or paid as a result of or in any way arising out of, following, or
consequential to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Loan Document unless such Losses result from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. This provision shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

12. NOTICES.

demands by any party relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be in writing and (except for financial statements and other
informational documents which may be sent by first-class mail, postage
prepaid) shall be personally delivered or sent by registered or certified

counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile shall be equally as effective

15.11Confidentiality. Foothill agrees (on behalf of itself and
each of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and representatives) to
use reasonable precautions to keep confidential in accordance with its
customary business practices, any non-public information supplied to it by
the Borrower, provided that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of any

writing. In connection with any potential disclosure under (i) or (iii)
above, Foothill agrees that it will promptly advise the Borrower of any
request for disclosure and use reasonable efforts to provide the Borrower

order to allow the Borrower to obtain an injunction or stay to the release
of such information or an order providing for the handling of such
information in a confidential matter.

such payment. Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any other Foothill

Foothill Expenses arising after the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default.

NEWS FROM...

UNITED MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS, INC.

1650 Palisade Avenue Teaneck, NJ 07666 201-837-1700

For Immediate Release July 5, 1994

United Merchants and Manufacturers, Inc. (the "Company") 
reported that, in accordance with its previously announced 
agreements entered into in November 1993 with its principal 
secured lender, it had succeeded in reducing its indebtedness to 
the lender to the targeted amount as of June 30, 1994. In 
accordance with the agreements, the lender has accepted, in full 
satisfaction of the balance (approximately $63.4 million) of the 
Company's indebtedness to the lender, a long-term subordinated 
income note in the principal amount of $30 million as detailed 
in the agreement. The satisfaction of this indebtedness by the 
Company will result in an extraordinary, non-cash gain from 
retirement of debt in excess of $30 million, which will be 
included in the Company's statement of operations for its fiscal 
year ended June 30, 1994. 

The Company reduced its indebtedness to the targeted amount 
through the previously announced sales of two of the Company's 
operating divisions, sales of certain other assets, and a 
borrowing of approximately $29 million, directly and through a 
subsidiary, from another lender under a senior loan and 
collateral agreement. The borrowing from the new lender is 
secured by substantially all of the Company's assets. 

United Merchants and Manufacturers, Inc. is a diversified 
company engaged principally in the manufacture and distribution 
of textiles and related products and the design, manufacture and 
distribution of accessories. The Company operates 54 discount 
outlet stores that sell the Company's and other manufacturers 
products.
