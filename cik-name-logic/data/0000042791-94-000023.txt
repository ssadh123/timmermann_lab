ITEM 2. Acquisition of Assets

Goulds Pumps, Inc. ("Goulds") completed the previously
announced acquisition of all shares of Pumpenfabrik Ernst
Vogel, AG ("Vogel"), the leading pump manufacturer in
Austria with 1993 sales of $60 million. Established in
1909, Vogel has manufacturing facilities in Austria with
sales branches throughout Austria and in Germany, Poland,
and Hungary.

The value of the transaction is approximately $51
million, including approximately $34 million of debt
which is being assumed. The Company borrowed
approximately $17 million from the Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce to fund the transaction. The transaction is
not expected to be dilutive to earnings per share in 1995
and will contribute positively thereafter.

The Company believes that the Vogel acquisition is
consistent with its strategic direction. It provides the
Company with a market leadership position in Austria and
considerably strengthens the product portfolios of the
Water Technologies Group and Industrial Products Group
throughout Europe, including Central Europe.

Vogel sells under three principal brand names in Austria
and in the countries to which it exports. Vogel Pumps is
its main brand name and constitutes an excellent line of
water pumps providing important upper end synergy with
the Company's existing Goulds Pumps Europe-Lowara water
pump line which experienced excellent sales growth within
Europe, and abroad. The product line sold under the
Ochsner brand name provides a significant increase in the
product offering and market presence for Goulds'
industrial market position in Europe and is expected to
provide important industrial pump synergies. The product
line sold under the Pantucek brand offers complete
mechanical and electrical packages for municipal sewage
systems and has significant potential in Central Europe
and good demand in Western Europe.

To the Stockholders of Pumpenfabrik Ernst Vogel Ges.m.b.H.
Stockerau, Austria

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Pumpenfabrik Ernst Vogel GmbH and the wholly owned subsidiaries
Pantucek Klaranlagen GmbH, AVIS Werbung GmbH and VOGEL
Umwelttechnik GmbH as of March 31, 1994 and the related statements
of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Pumpenfabrik Ernst Vogel GmbH and subsidiaries as of
March 31, 1994 and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with

resolving to transform the Company into a stock corporation on
the basis of the balance sheet as of March 31, 1994. The

shares and 1,450 shares, respectively represented by interim
certificates, two for each of the Sellers. The interim
certificates shall be numbered 1 to 6 ("the Interim
Certificates") .

herewith buy from the Sellers the 2,900 shares ln VOGEL-PUMPEN
with a nominal value of ATS 10,000.00 ten thousand Austrian
schillings) each, as issued after the transformation of VOGEL-
PUMPEN, thus, in the aggregate, shares with a nominal value of
ATS 29,000,000.00 (twenty-nine million Austrian schillings),
corresponding to 100% of the entire capital stock of VOGEL-
PUMPEN, together with all rights and obligations attaching to
such shareholdings ("the Shares").

The Purchasers purchase the Shares in the following
proportion:

Goulds Pumps GmbH purchases 2,897 shares, and

Goulds Pumps Ltd purchases 3 shares.

2.3 The Shares are represented by the Interim Certificates which
will be assigned and transferred to the Purchasers. The
transfer and assignment of the Shares to the Purchasers and
the payment of the Purchase Price to the Sellers shall take
place on the Closing Date and shall be subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

2.4 The contracting parties have agreed to schedule the closing on
or before December 5, 1994. If a delay occurred, neither
contracting party shall be bound by this Share Purchase
Agreement any longer (except as set forth herein), unless (i)
the parties mutually agree on an extension of the above time
period and/or on the determination of another day as Closing
Date or (ii) the failure to implement is attributable to one
side preventing the fulfillment of a condition in violation of
<F50>
the principle of acting in good faith or to one side's 
failure to do everything that is reasonably necessary or
required to make such fulfillment of a condition possible, in
which case the non-defaulting side may opt, by notice in
writing, to maintain this Agreement in full force and effect
and to insist on the performance of the other side's
contractual obligations. 

In case of non-implementation of the share purchase as
aforesaid, the Purchasers shall promptly destroy any and all
records, and copies thereof, obtained from the VOGEL-PUMPEN
Companies in the course of its review of the VOGEL-PUMPEN
Companies, including but not limited to the due diligence
review, and any notes and other documents made in the course
of or as a result of such review and/or based on information
received from the Sellers and/or the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies in
connection with the contemplated purchase of the Shares. The
Purchasers shall, furthermore, not make use of any
confidential information obtained from the Sellers, the VOGEL-
PUMPEN Companies and/or their advisors because of or in
connection with such share purchase.
<F50>
SECTION III
PURCHASE PRICE

3.1 The purchase price for 100 % of the Shares shall be ATS
184,980,595.00 (one hundred eighty four million nine hundred
eighty thousand five hundred ninety five Austrian schillings)
( "the Purchase Price") and shall be paid on or before the
Closing Date clear and free of any deductions, withholdings or
setoffs, in cash, by banker's check or in any other manner
agreed to by the Sellers, as follows:

(a) ATS 159,220,595.00 (one hundred fifty-nine million two
hundred twenty thousand five hundred ninety-five Austrian
schillings). This portion of the Purchase Price shall be
paid by the Purchasers on or before the Closing Date to
the Sellers in the following amounts:

(1) Ing. Gerhard Vogel ATS 39,805,148.75 (25 %)
(2) Hermine Vogel ATS 39,805,148.75 (25 %)
(3) Lauermann Familien- ATS 79,610,297.50 (50 %)
Privatstiftung

(b) ATS 25,760,000.00 (twenty-five million seven hundred
sixty thousand Austrian schillings) shall be remitted by
the Purchasers on or before the Closing Date to the
escrow account with the Escrow Agent ("the Escrow
Account") set up in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

The agreement of the parties on the Purchase Price was based
on the assumption that payment of the Purchase Price will be
made with a value date not later than September 30, 1994. 
Consequently, if the closing does not take place on or before
September 30, 1994 the Purchase Price shall bear interest at
a rate per annum equal to the Secondary Market Rate for
"Einmalemissionen" as monthly published by the Austrian
National Bank under item 5.4 of the "Statistische
Monatsberichte" and which shall accrue as from the
aforementioned value date until November 30, 1994, inclusive,
such interest to be paid at the same time as the Purchase
Price and pursuant to sub-section a) above.

The Purchasers shall be jointly and severally liable for the
payment of the Purchase Price.

3.2 The parties hereto shall sign and execute the Escrow Agreement
prior to the Closing Date on mutually acceptable terms and
conditions.
<F50>
The portion of the Purchase Price on the Escrow Account shall
be due and payable as set forth in sub-section 5.6.

Interest accruing on the Escrow Account shall be due to the
Sellers pro rata their present shareholdings in the Company
and shall be paid to them promptly upon crediting of same to
the Escrow Account.

The parties, acting in good faith, shall agree on a form of
investment of the amount from time to time credited to the
Escrow Account that takes into account both the interest of
the Sellers to maximize the amount of interest and the
interest of the Purchasers to be reimbursed without undue
delay any justified claim for breach of the Sellers'
Warranties.

The Sellers shall be free to substitute any amount to be paid
from the Escrow Account to the Purchasers pursuant to the
provisions of sub-section 5.6 by funds in an equal amount from
other sources in which case a corresponding amount shall be
released, and paid to them, from the Escrow Account
immediately upon maturity of funds on the Escrow Account that
have been invested for a fixed period of time and that
therefore were not immediately available for settlement of a
justified claim of the Purchasers.

<F50>
SECTION IV
BUSINESS OPERATIONS UNTIL THE CLOSING DATE

4.1 For the time between the signing of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, the Sellers, in their capacity as sole
shareholders of VOGEL-PUMPEN, or as the case may be, as
managing directors or members of the managing boards of the
VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies, undertake to procure that the business
operations of all VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies shall remain in each
and every aspect (in particular as regards personnel,
finance, accounting, etc.) within the scope of the business
operations undertaken until the signing date and within the
scope of the operations typical of an enterprise of the
VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies (except for the divesting of the
FRIGOPOL Business and the consequences arising therefrom).
None of the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies shall enter into legal
transactions or other business transactions going beyond that
scope without having obtained the Purchasers' prior written
consent, it being agreed that the Purchasers will not
unreasonably withhold their consent. In particular, but
without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, any of 
the following matters require the prior consent of the
Purchasers:

4.1.1 any shareholders' resolution, be it adopted at a
shareholders' meeting of any of the VOGEL-PUMPEN
Companies or by means of a written vote;

4.1.2 any hidden or open distribution of profits;

4.1.3 the alienation or encumbrance of assets of any of 
the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies, unless such assets are
not of a material value;

4.1.4 the issuance of guarantees or undertakings of
indemnification in excess of ATS 2,000,000.00;

4.1.5 the conclusion of legal transactions going beyond
the ordinary scope of business, involving an amount
of more than ATS 2,000,000.00;

4.1.6 the conclusion of long-term contracts that cannot
be terminated legally at six months' notice
maximum, without material adverse legal
consequences for the VOGEL-PUMPEN Company
concerned;

4.1.7 the acquisition and alienation as well as any other
disposition of shares and investments of whatever
kind, including, without being limited to, shares
<F50>
and investments in corporations, partnerships,
joint ventures, funds, trusts, foundations or the
like;

4.1.8 the borrowing of money for a term exceeding 12
months or ATS 2,000,000.00;

4.1.9 the appointment of general agents or "Hand-
lungsbevollmachtigte" (persons holding a commercial
power of attorney pursuant to sec. 54 of the
Austrian Commercial Code), or the promising of
executive positions in any of the VOGEL-PUMPEN 
Companies to present employees or newly recruited
persons;

4.1.10 the giving of notice to, dismissal of, or approval
of the termination by mutual agreement of,
employees of any of the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies who
are essential for the normal conduct of business
and who cannot be easily replaced within a short
period of time;

4.1.11 the hiring of employees except under the terms and
conditions usually agreed to by the VOGEL-PUMPEN
Companies;

4.1.12 the conclusion of agreements with the works council
or interest groups;

4.1.13 the acquisition, alienation or encumbrance of real
property;

4.1.14 the termination or violation of any significant
business relationship or contract involving an
amount in excess of ATS 2,000,000.00;

4.1.15 the agreement, conditionally or otherwise, to do
any of the acts referred to in sub-sections 4.1.1
through 4.1.14.

4.2 If and when a matter or issue arises that would require the
Purchasers' consent pursuant to sub-section 4.1, the Sellers
shall notify the Purchasers thereof without delay and, if the
Purchasers refuse to consent to the act or measure proposed by
the Sellers, the Sellers shall refrain therefrom and/or shall
procure that the VOGEL-PUMPEN Company concerned does not take
such act or measure (either). The Purchasers shall give or
deny their consent as aforesaid within a reasonable time. The
Sellers shall be authorized, however, to take any action
necessary to prevent disadvantages for any of the VOGEL-PUMPEN
Companies, if the urgency of the matter does not allow to wait
<F50>
for the Purchasers' response or if such response is not given
in time ("deemed consent of the Purchasers").

4.3 The Sellers shall immediately notify the Purchasers in writing
of any matter or issue which arises or becomes known to the
Sellers between the date of the signing hereof and the Closing
Date and which constitutes, or would constitute after the
Closing Date, a breach of the Sellers Warranties or of other
representations, warranties, undertakings or obligations
assumed in this Agreement.

4.4 The Sellers shall procure that the Frigopol Business will
effectively be divested on or prior to the Closing Date by
contribution of the Frigopol Business into Frigopol
Kaltemaschinen GmbH and subsequent sale of the shares in such
company to one or more of the Sellers against a consideration
of ATS 1.00. The contractual arrangements in this connection
shall provide that all present and future liabilities related
to the Frigopol Business shall be assumed by Frigopol
Kaltemaschinen GmbH, except as explicitly set forth herein.
The Sellers herewith warrant that the shareholders of Frigopol
Kaltemaschinen GmbH shall provide such company with sufficient
financing in order to enable such company to meet at all times
its obligations to indemnify VOGEL-PUMPEN against any and all
liabilities arising from the Frigopol Business. For the
avoidance of doubt the liability of the Sellers out of the
above warranty shall not be subject to any of the limits on
liability set forth in Section 5. The Purchasers shall cause
VOGEL-PUMPEN to enable the Sellers and/or their advisors to
assume the defence of any claims. The provisions of sub-
section 5.6 shall apply mutatis mutandis.

In view of the difficulty to identify exactly those supplies
already made from third party suppliers that are attributable
to the Frigopol Business, the parties have agreed that the new
owner of the Frigopol Business shall assume and repay loans
presently extended to the Company in an amount equal to the
value of supplies made and remaining unpaid, attributable to
the Frigopol Business, and that the Company will continue to
assume, and will settle, the corresponding claims of the
suppliers. The details thereof are set out in Annex 1.1.a. The
Sellers shall therefore indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and the Purchasers against any loss, costs and
expenses resulting from a breach of the undertaking to assume
and repay the loans as aforesaid, and the Purchasers shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and/or the new owner
of the Frigopol Business against any loss, costs and expenses
resulting from a breach of the Company' s obligation to 
<F50>
finally settle the aforesaid suppliers' claims without any
recourse of either the Company or the Purchasers to the
Sellers and/or the new owner of the Frigopol Business.

Following the divesting of the Frigopol Business the Company
shall continue to perform and/or undertake certain services,
works and supplies for the Frigopol Business to the extent and
basically within the scope such services, works and supplies
have been performed so far (e.g., accounting services). The
Company will charge for such services, works and supplies at
cost, without adding a profit margin, provided that (a)
services shall be provided at cost (i.e., costs of
personnel) up to a maximum amount of ATS 1,000,000.00 per
calendar year and (b) works and supplies (e.g., supply of
engines, manufacturing works = "Lohnarbeit") shall be
performed at cost on the same basis presently existing and as
defined in Annex 1.1.a up to a maximum amount of ATS
9,000,000.00 and for a maximum period until December 31, 1995.
Services, supplies and works in excess of the above limits
shall be performed and/or undertaken at market rates. The
details will be set out in an agreement to be entered into by
the Company and the new owner of the Frigopol Business with
the approval of the Purchasers, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld. Said agreement will also deal with the
time period during which said services will be performed.
<F50>

performance by the Purchasers of this Agreement and the

hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Purchasers and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Purchasers, enforceable against
the Purchasers in accordance with its terms;

c) neither the execution nor the performance of this
Agreement violates (i) the applicable articles of
association or any other applicable legal provisions;

the Sellers or the Purchasers; or (iii) a contract or
other legal instrument to which the Sellers or the

<F50>
5.2 In connection with the sale of the Shares agreed upon herein
the Sellers represent and warrant vis-a-vis the Purchasers as
set forth below:

a) The Sellers and/or the respective VOGEL-PUMPEN Company
hold(s) exclusive and unrestricted title, free from any
encumbrances, to the Shares and all direct and indirect
shareholdings of VOGEL-PUMPEN in the VOGEL-PUMPEN
Companies on the day of the signing of this Agreement and
also on the Closing Date. All said Shares or share
quotas and shareholdings have been fully paid up either
in cash or in kind. As of the Closing Date, VOGEL-PUMPEN
directly or indirectly holds 100 % of the shares in
Ochsner Prozebtechnik GmbH, Linz. The Company holds only
a 76 % participation in Ochsner Prozebtechnik GmbH & Co
KG in Liqu..

There are no rights or claims of third parties whatsoever
pertaining to any of the aforementioned shares nor are
there any preemptive rights of take-over, rights to
conversion, options or other rights similar to these from
an economic or legal point of view as regards the VOGEL-
PUMPEN Companies.

b) All VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies are enterprises duly
established and validly existing under the law of their
incorporation, except those companies that are in the
process of being liquidated and dissolved.

c) The Financial Statements have been established in
accordance with generally accepted Austrian accounting
principles ("AGAAP") as specified by the Accounting
Principles (Annex 1.1.c); they are complete and correct. 
The valuation of the items of property and liabilities
reported in the balance sheets are correct, accurately
reflect the value of the assets and liabilities of the
VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies and are in accordance with the
uniformly applied AGAAP and the Accounting Principles. 
As of March 31, 1994, there exist in particular no
liabilities that should have been included in the
Financial Statements pursuant to AGAAP and the Accounting
Principles, but effectively have not been accounted for. 
The Sellers do not warrant, for the avoidance of doubt,
the collectibility of any accounts receivable or the
merchantability of the particular items of the assets or
the inventory nor the proper valuation of the inventory.
<F50>
d) Since the balance sheet date, i.e., March 31, 1994, until
the Closing Date there have been no material adverse
changes in the consolidated net asset value of the VOGEL-
PUMPEN Companies and in the financial standing of the
VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies so that the continuity of the
companies as regards their property structure, capital
structure and operating profit is and will be ensured. 
This warranty does not include, however, for the
avoidance of doubt, negative consequences, if any, for
the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies resulting from the
notification of the public of the intent of the Sellers
to sell, and of the Purchasers to buy, the Shares nor the
costs and expenses incurred by any or all of the VOGEL-
PUMPEN Companies in connection with the preparation,
negotiation and signing of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt it is agreed that the difference
between the consolidated net asset value resulting from
the Financial Statements and the consolidated net asset
value resulting from the interim financial statements as
per July 31, 1994 does not constitute a material adverse
change in the above meaning.

e) No distribution of profits has been made since March 31,
1994 until the date of the signing hereof. 

f) The VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies are owners of the entire
moveable and immovable property appearing in the
Financial Statements, to which the individual VOGEL-
PUMPEN Companies hold free and unrestricted title and
which are not encumbered with any rights of third
parties, except for the charges and encumbrances listed
in Annex 5.2.f.

g) All plant and equipment of the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies are
in an useable state of repair, normal wear and tear since
the time of the Purchasers' inspection of such plant and
equipment excepted.

h) There are no claims of third parties vis-a-vis the VOGEL-
PUMPEN Companies, except for claims that have arisen in
the ordinary and regular course of business and which
were correspondingly taken into account in the Financial
Statements on the basis of the AGAAP and the Accounting
Principles, nor have such extraordinary claims of third
parties arisen between March 31, 1994 and the date of the
signing hereof, except as listed in Annex 5.2.h. All
agreements in existence as of the Closing Date between
any of the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies and a company
<F50>
controlled by any of the Sellers have been concluded on
an arm's length basis, except as disclosed in Annex
5.2.h. In view of the provisions of sub-section 4.4
above, the foregoing warranty does not apply, however,
with respect to the Frigopol Business and/or the new
owner thereof.

i) Until the date of the signing hereof, the VOGEL-PUMPEN
Companies have timely and accurately filed and provided
all returns and information to be made and given under
the applicable tax laws or requested from the tax
authorities and have properly taken them into account in
the Financial Statements. All taxes that are assessed on
an annual basis and that are attributable to the fiscal
years preceding or ending on March 31, 1994 either have
been paid or have been sufficiently reserved for in the
Financial Statements. As of the Closing Date there
remain no taxes unpaid that are payable as a one-time
payment (e.g., documentary stamp taxes, capital transfer
taxes), except for taxes of this kind that become payable
as a result of transactions permitted to be undertaken or
carried on pursuant to the provisions of Section IV.
above.

j) The VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies have obtained from the
authorities all permits and approvals required for their
operation. Those permits and approvals validly exist.

The VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies have complied with all orders,
requests or decrees issued to them by any competent
authority under environmental protection law. None of
the Sellers is aware of any proceedings for compliance
with or violation of applicable environmental protection
laws and regulations and none is aware that any such
proceedings are threatening. All permits and approvals
under applicable environmental protection laws necessary
for the operation of the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies have been
obtained and validly exist. To the extent a VOGEL-PUMPEN
Company incurs costs for preventive measures and/or
clean-up costs ("Sicherungs- und Sanierungsaufwand") due
to environmental regulations, the Sellers shall bear
and/or reimburse to the respective company 50 % (fifty
percent) of such costs up to a maximum of ATS
11,000,000.00 (eleven million Austrian schillings).

As regards the real estates EZ 201 and EZ 679, which are
still registered in the name of Ochsner Prozesbtechnik
GmbH & Co KG in Liqu., the declaration by 
<F50>
Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberosterreich reg. GenmbH, dated
May 4th, 1994, to hold such company harmless, inter alia,
against the clean-up of contaminations is a validly
existing obligation of Raiffeisenlandesbank
Oberosterreich reg. GenmbH.

k) As of the date of the signing hereof there are no labor-
law agreements, including plant or other agreements with
employees' representatives or trade unions (except
applicable collective bargaining agreements), other than
those listed in Annex 5.2.k. Annex 5.2.k also lists all
fringe benefit and pension schemes.

l) Prior to the signing of this Agreement, the Sellers
disclosed or granted inspection of all contracts relating
to the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies which are of essential
impact on the business operations of the individual
companies.

m) All VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies have insurance, including
product liability insurance, in such amount and covering
such risks as is necessary for their operation.

n) Apart from the proceedings outlined in Annex 5.2.n, there
are no proceedings before courts, arbitral tribunals or
administrative authorities pending, or threatened against
the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies that involve an amount or
value in excess of ATS 500,000 per case.

o) The VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies hold good an valid title
and/or licences to the industrial property rights,
including, without being limited to, patents, trademarks,
rights in design and copyrights, that are necessary to
conduct their business as presently conducted. Licences
have been granted to any or all of the VOGEL-PUMPEN
Companies with respect to the patents held by certain
Sellers which licences shall survive the Closing Date for
an indefinite period of time and shall be without
obligation to the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies to pay royalties
to the respective Seller.

With respect to those VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies that are in the
process of being liquidated and dissolved, the above
representations and warranties are given with the proviso that
they shall apply with respect to such companies only to the
extent reasonably practicable, taking into account their
present state of liquidation.
<F50>
5.3 The Purchasers' remedies in case of a breach of any
representation or warranty expressly or impliedly given or
made by the Sellers hereunder shall be limited to a subsequent
corresponding reduction, and refund, of the Purchase Price. 
Any liability of the Sellers for breach of any or all of the
Sellers' Warranties shall therefore be limited, in the
aggregate, to an amount equal to the Purchase Price.

In the event of a violation of any of the Sellers' Warranties,
the Sellers shall refund an amount to the Purchasers which
would be necessary to indemnify and hold the affected VOGEL-
PUMPEN Company/Companies harmless against any damage or loss
suffered by it in consequence of the breach of any of the
Sellers' Warranties, such amount(s) not to exceed, however,
the claim limit as defined in sub-section 5.5 below. Tax
benefits arising to that VOGEL-PUMPEN Company in consequence
of the non-observance of such Sellers' Warranties shall be
deducted from the loss or damage incurred, unless the tax
benefit will consist in the deferral of such tax only. 
Consequently, in case the profit for tax purposes would be
increased, in particular as a result of a tax audit, then such
profit shall be set off against tax loss carry forwards, if
any. Should a tax audit result in the request of the tax
authorities to capitalize certain expenses and should, as a
consequence thereof, such capitalizations lead to the
possibility of depreciations in the succeeding years, any
payments requested by the tax authorities at the outcome of
the tax audit as a result of such capitalizations shall not be
deemed to be liabilities of the Sellers under the tax
warranty, but shall be borne by the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies.

The Sellers shall not be under any liability whatsoever in
respect of any claim in relation to a breach of any of the
Sellers' Warranties:

a) if and to the extent that a claim arises from a voluntary
act or transaction carried out after the Closing Date by
any VOGEL-PUMPEN Company or the Purchasers, unless such
act or transaction is based on a legally binding
obligation by the respective VOGEL-PUMPEN Company entered
into on or prior to the Closing Date; or 

b) if and to the extent that a claim arises from an act or
omission compelled by law after the Closing Date or as a
result of the passing of an enactment or other government
regulation with retrospective effect or of the
introduction of or of any changes in law or of any
changes in the prevailing interpretation of the law after
the Closing Date; or

<F50>
c) if and to the extent that a claim arises from any matter
or thing either provided for or required by this
Agreement or an act or omission by or occurring at the
written request or with the prior written consent of the
Purchasers or from a change of accounting policy or
practise of the Purchasers or any VOGEL-PUMPEN Company or
an act or omission permitted to be done by any of the
VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies as a consequence of the
Purchasers' consent within the meaning of the provisions
of sub-section 4.2 above; or

d) to the extent that the damage or loss which is the
subject of the claim has been or is made good or is
otherwise compensated for without cost to the Purchasers
or any VOGEL-PUMPEN Company.

e) to the extent that the damage or loss became apparent
during the Purchasers' financial due diligence and is
reflected in the interim financial statements as per July
31, 1994 and served as argument for reducing the Purchase
Price during the final negotiations, the burden of proof
being with the Sellers.

Unless otherwise provided herein, all representations and
warranties contained herein are valid both on the date of
signing hereof and on the Closing Date. Deviations on the
Closing Date from the date of the signing hereof shall be
permissible to the extent the measure leading to such
different fact situation was taken with the Purchasers' actual
written consent or was permitted to be done pursuant to the
provisions of sub-section 4.2 above.

5.4 Unless specifically stipulated otherwise, the claims of the
Purchasers under the Sellers' Warranties shall become statute-
barred eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, with the
exception of (a) claims due to tax liabilities, if any, of the
VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies pursuant to sub-section 5.2 (i) above
("the Tax Warranty"), and (b) the environmental warranty
pursuant to sub-section 5.2.(j) above ("the Environmental
Warranty").

The warranty period for the claims under the Tax Warranty
shall expire thirty-six (36) months following the date of
filing of the last of the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies' income tax
returns for the fiscal year 1993/94, it being understood that
(i) the above tax warranty will cover the results of any
<F50>
tax audit officially initiated (or notified in advance
pursuant to sec. 148 para 5 Federal Tax Procedure Code) prior
to the lapse of the above 36-months period, regardless of the
termination of such audit and the ensuing proceedings, if any,
provided that the Purchasers notify the Sellers of the
commencement of such tax audit prior to the lapse of such
period and (ii) the management of the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies
shall be free to determine the time for filing the above
income tax returns, irrespective of past practice.

The warranty period for claims under the Environmental
Warranty shall expire five (5) years after the Closing Date.

The Purchasers must raise their claims (together with
reasonable substantiation) in writing within 60 (sixty) days
after discovering a fact which gives raise to a claim, but in
any case before the end of the warranty period and must,
furthermore, initiate arbitration proceedings within a further
period of twelve months if no agreement with the Sellers is
reached on such claims in order not to have their claims
statute-barred.

5.5 Claim limit:

The sellers shall not be jointly, but only severally liable
for any claims raised by the Purchasers out of this Agreement,
each seller pro rata its present shareholding in the Company.

The aggregate liability of the Sellers taken together shall be
limited (i) to 14 % (fourteen percent) of ATS 184,000,000.00,
i. e., ATS 25,760,000.00, for claims duly notified to the
Sellers within twelve months following the Closing Date, and
(ii) to 7 % (seven percent) of ATS 184,000,000.00 i.e.,
12,880,000.00, for claims duly notified to the Sellers after
the twelfth, but on or before the last day of the eighteenth
month immediately following the Closing Date, it being
understood that the aggregate liability of the Sellers with
respect to both categories of claims as aforesaid shall not
exceed ATS 25,760,000.00. Notwithstanding the above, the
above claim limit shall not apply to claims relating to
unrestricted title to the Shares and the existence of the
VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies (sub-sections 5.2.a and b) and the tax
warranty pursuant to sub-section 5.2(i) above where the
aggregate maximum liability shall be the ATS 184,000,000.00. 
When calculating the above limit, the claims not having such
a limit shall not be taken into consideration.

<F50>
Furthermore, the above claim limit of 14%/7% shall not apply 
to claims under the Environmental Warranty, where the claim
limit shall be 5.5% of ATS 184,000,000.00, i.e., ATS
10,120,000.00. For the avoidance of doubt, claims under the
Environmental Warranty shall be dealt with separately, as far
as the Claim Limit is concerned, from other claims for breach
of warranties. Consequently, the claim limit for those two
kinds of claims shall be separate.

No claim shall be brought against the Sellers nor shall the
Sellers be liable to the Purchasers in respect of a breach of
any of the Sellers' Warranties unless the aggregate amount of
the liability of the Sellers for all such claims exceeds ATS
1,200,000.00 and then in respect of just the excess over ATS
1,200,000.00.

The above provisions shall, however, not apply with respect to
claims under the Environmental Warranty where no minimum
threshhold is applicable.

5.6 Any claims of the Purchasers for breach of the Sellers'
Warranties (except for claims under the Environmental
Warranty) shall as a rule be satisfied from the portion of the
Purchase Price deposited on the Escrow Account pursuant to
sub-section 3.1 (b). Consequently, the Escrow Account shall
not secure claims under the Environmental Warranty and the
release of funds on the Escrow Account (as specified below)
shall not be prevented or impaired by any claim under the
Environmental Warranty or by any dispute with respect to such
claims. Each claim of the Purchasers must be reasonably
substantiated. The Purchasers shall provide the Sellers and,
at their request, their advisors will all information they may
reasonably request in order to ascertain the validity of such
claims. The Purchasers shall, furthermore, grant the Sellers
and their advisors all access to the books and records of the
VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies that they may reasonably request in
order to examine such claims. At the request of the Sellers,
the Purchasers shall enable the Sellers and/or their advisors
to assume the defence of any claims and in any proceedings
brought against the VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies and which are the
subject of a claim for breach of the Sellers' Warranties, in
particular tax proceedings, and to file any submissions and
appeals that the Sellers and/or their advisors may deem
advisable or appropriate. The Purchasers shall cause the
VOGEL-PUMPEN Companies to sign and execute any and all
documents, including but not limited to powers of attorney to
the Sellers and/or their advisors, deemed necessary or
advisable by the Sellers in this respect.
<F50>
The Sellers shall notify the Purchasers within a reasonable
time whether and to which extent they accept a claim raised by
the Purchasers. With respect to any amount accepted by the
Sellers to be justified, the Sellers shall issue a
confirmation in writing which confirmation shall be deemed to
be the authorization for the Escrow Agent to release and
disburse such amount to the Purchasers from the portion of the
Purchase Price remaining on the Escrow Account.

At the end of 54-week period immediately following the Closing
Date the Escrow Agent shall release, and pay to the Sellers in
proportion to their present shareholding in the Company, from
the portion of the Purchase Price initially deposited on the
Escrow Account an amount equal to the balance of (a) 50 % of
such initially deposited amount and (b) the aggregate of the
amounts with respect to which the Escrow Agent has received
(i) a written confirmation by the Sellers agreeing to release
to the Purchasers a specified amount in settlement of a
justified claim of the Purchasers or (ii) written evidence
that the Purchasers have duly notified the Sellers of a claim
in such amount for breach of the Sellers' Warranties.

At the end of a 18-month plus two weeks period immediately
following the Closing Date the Escrow Agent shall release, and
pay to the Sellers in proportion to their present shareholding
in the Company, from the portion of the Purchase Price
initially deposited on the Escrow Account and remaining after
the lapse of the above 54-week period, an amount equal to the
balance of (a) such remaining amount and (b) the aggregate of
the amounts with respect to which the Escrow Agent has
received (i) a written confirmation by the Sellers agreeing to
release to the Purchasers a specified amount in settlement of
a justified claim of the Purchasers or (ii) written evidence
that the Purchasers have duly notified the Sellers of a claim
in such amount for breach of the Sellers' Warranties.

Any amounts corresponding to amounts with respect to which the
Escrow Agent has received evidence of a duly notified claim by
the Purchasers shall continue to be held in escrow until the
Escrow Agent either has received written confirmation from the
Sellers agreeing to release a specified amount to the
Purchasers or, but not later than 31 months immediately
following the Closing Date, reasonably satisfactory evidence
that the Purchasers have initiated arbitration proceedings
pursuant to this Agreement for a specified amount. Any
amounts with respect to which the Escrow Agent shall not have
received a confirmation or evidence as aforesaid shall be
released by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers after the lapse of
a 31-month plus one week period following the Closing Date in
proportion to the present shareholdings of the Sellers in the
Company.
<F50>
Any amounts retained by the Escrow Agent as a consequence of
its notification of the initiation of arbitration proceedings
shall either be paid to the Purchasers upon presentation of a
final arbitral award confirming that the Purchasers' claims
were justified, and in the amount set forth in such award, or,
alternatively, to the Sellers upon presentation of a final
arbitral award rejecting the Purchasers' claims in whole or in
part (in the latter case only with respect to such amount not
awarded to the Purchasers) in proportion to their present
shareholdings in the Company.

Any acceptance by the Sellers of a claim raised by the
Purchasers and/or any confirmation to release an amount to the
Purchasers from the Escrow Account shall be deemed validly
given only if duly signed by all the Sellers (or their
successors in law).

The fees and expenses of the escrow Agent for maintaining and
operating the Escrow Account and for performing the
obligations set forther herein and in the Escrow Agreement
shall be borne one half by the Purchasers and one half by the
Sellers.

In case arbitration proceedings with respect to a claim of the
Purchasers are commenced and an arbitral award rendered in
such proceedings and such award challenged on the ground of
Sec. 595 (1) fig.7 of the Austrian Code of Civil Procedure,
("Wiederaufnahmsklage") such action shall not be a cause for
not releasing any amounts remaining on the Escrow Account to
the Sellers if such amounts were due to them pursuant to such
arbitral award.
<F50>
SECTION VI

It is in the joint interest of the contracting parties that the
Sellers, insofar as they have been involved in the management of

payments due to the existing managing directors shall be paid to

All disputes between or among the parties to this Agreement
and/or the legal successors of the parties arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited
