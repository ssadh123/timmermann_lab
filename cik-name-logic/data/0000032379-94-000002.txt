MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Elizabethtown Water Company and Subsidiary 

The water utility operations of Elizabethtown Water Company 
(Elizabethtown or Company) and its subsidiary The Mount Holly Water 
Company (Mount Holly), the consolidated entity being referred to herein 
as Elizabethtown Water Company (Elizabethtown Water Company), presently 
constitute the major portion of E'town Corporation's (E'town) assets and 
earnings. E'town, a New Jersey holding company, is the parent company 
of Elizabethtown Water Company and E'town Properties, Inc. The 
following analysis sets forth significant events affecting the financial 
condition at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of operations 
for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 for Elizabethtown
Water Company.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Capital Expenditures Program

Capital expenditures were $32.5 million during 1993. Capital 
expenditures for the three-year period ending December 31, 1996, are 
estimated to be $193.0 million.

Elizabethtown's construction program includes additional mains and 
storage facilities necessary to serve customers who were added during 
the last several years. In addition, Elizabethtown anticipates 
upgrading its existing surface water treatment plant by rehabilitating 
certain components and adding facilities designed to maximize its 
capacity. These projects are designed to ensure the plant's compliance 
with proposed water quality and other environmental regulations.

Elizabethtown's estimated capital expenditures through 1996 include 
$96.5 million, excluding an Allowance for Funds Used During Construction 
(AFUDC), for construction of a new water treatment plant, the Canal Road 
Water Treatment Plant (Plant), near its existing plant. The Plant is 
scheduled to be completed in 1996. The Plant, which will have a rated 
production capacity of 40 million gallons per day, is necessary to meet 
existing and anticipated customer demands and to replace groundwater 
supplies withdrawn from service as a result of more restrictive water 
quality regulations and groundwater contamination. 

In August 1993, the Board of Regulatory Commissioners (BRC) 
approved a stipulation (1993 Plant Stipulation) signed by the parties 
to the Company's petition relating to the Plant. The 1993 Plant 
Stipulation states that the Plant is necessary and that the Company's 
estimate regarding the Plant's cost, at that time of $87 million, and 
construction period were reasonable. The 1993 Plant Stipulation authorizes 
the Company to levy a rate surcharge if the Company's pre-tax interest 
coverage ratio for any 12-month historical period drops below 2.0 times. 
The surcharge would 

-1-

equal 20% of the Company's gross interest expense for the prior 12 
months, adjusted for revenue taxes. The surcharge would go into effect 
at the same time as the Company's next base rate increase after the 
coverage ratio falls below 2.0 times, but in no event prior to
January 1, 1995. Also, the surcharge would remain in effect for
12 months and could be extended by the BRC for up to six additional 
months. The 1993 Plant Stipulation also provides that the rate of 
return on common stockholder's equity used to calculate the rate for 
the equity component of the AFUDC for the Plant will be 1.5% less than 
the rate of return on common stockholder's equity established in the 
Company's most recent base rate case. The authorized rate of return 
on common stockholder's equity is currently 11.5%.

Elizabethtown has accepted a bid, based upon competitive bidding, 
from a general contrator and intends to sign a contract for the 
construction of the Plant which is estimated to cost approximately 
$96.5 million, excluding AFUDC. The Company has notified all parties to 
the 1993 Stipulation of this revised cost of the Plant. 

Also included in the capital program is $12.2 million for new 
wells, treatment facilities and transmission lines to augment Mount 
Holly's water supplies. Such projects are necessary for Mount Holly to 
comply with recent state legislation requiring Mount Holly and other 
water purveyors located in a particular area in southern New Jersey to 
obtain additional sources of water to replace portions of their existing 
supplies.

Capital Resources

During 1993, Elizabethtown Water Company financed 28.2% of its 
capital expenditures from internally generated funds (after payment of 
common stock dividends). The balance was funded from (i) capital 
contributions from E'town from the sale of common stock, (ii) the 
remaining proceeds of various New Jersey Economic Development Authority 
(NJEDA) tax-exempt bond issues from prior years and (iii) short-term 
bank debt on an interim basis.

For the three-year period ending December 31, 1996, Elizabethtown 
Water Company estimates that 16% of its capital expenditures will be 
financed with internally generated funds (after the payment of common 
stock dividends). The balance will be financed with a combination of 
capital contributions from E'town from the proceeds from the sale of 
E'town common stock, long-term debentures, proceeds of tax-exempt NJEDA 
bonds and short-term borrowings under a revolving credit agreement (see 
below), on an interim basis. The NJEDA has granted preliminary approval 
for the financing of almost all of Elizabethtown's major projects over 
the next three years, including the Plant. Elizabethtown expects to 
pursue tax-exempt financing to the extent that final allocations are 
granted by the NJEDA.

-2-

On May 17, 1993, E'town issued 575,000 shares of common stock for 
net proceeds of $16.6 million. The net proceeds were used to 
fund equity contributions to Elizabethtown of $11.0 million in May 1993 
and $2.8 million in September 1993. Elizabethtown used a portion of 
such contributions to repay $7.0 million of short-term bank debt 
incurred for construction expenditures and invested the balance on a 
short-term basis until needed for construction expenditures.

During 1993, E'town raised $6.0 million from the sale of common 
stock issued under its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan 
(DRP). Such proceeds were used to fund equity contributions to 
Elizabethtown primarily for Elizabethtown's capital expenditures.

On November 9, 1993, Elizabethtown issued $50 million of 7 1/4% 
Debentures due November 1, 2028. The proceeds of the issue were used to 
redeem $30 million of the Company's 8 5/8% Debentures due 2007 and 
$20 million of the Company's 10 1/8% Debentures due 2018. The aggregate 
redemption premiums of $2.7 million were paid from general Company 
funds.

During 1994, E'town Corporation expects to issue approximately 
500,000 shares of common stock, through a public offering prior to
June 30, 1994, to finance additional equity contributions to 
Elizabethtown. Proceeds from all stock issued under E'town's DRP will 
continue to fund additional equity contributions to Elizabethtown.

Elizabethtown is negotiating a committed revolving credit 
agreement, which is expected to be in place by April 1994, with an agent 
bank and up to five additional participating banks to replace its 
existing uncommitted lines of credit. The agreement will provide up to 
$60 million in revolving short-term notes to provide sufficient 
short-term financing for the Company to fund, together with other 
monies, its $193.0 million capital program. The agreement will allow the 
Company to borrow, repay and reborrow up to $60 million for the first 
three years, after which time the Company may convert any outstanding 
balances to a five-year fully amortizing term loan. The agreement will
further provide that among other covenants, the Company must maintain a 
ratio of common and preferred equity to total capitalization of not less 
than 35% and a pre-tax interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.

December 31, 1992 and 1991

In April 1992, E'town issued 500,000 shares of common stock for net 
proceeds of $12.7 million. Proceeds of the issue funded an $11.0 
million capital contribution to Elizabethtown. Also, E'town funded 
additional equity contributions of

-3-

$4.2 million to Elizabethtown from E'town's DRP. During 1992, 
Elizabethtown issued $15 million of 8% Debentures to repay short-term 
bank debt, of which, $9 million was incurred to repay Elizabethtown's
4 7/8% Debentures due February 1, 1992, and the remainder was incurred 
to finance construction expenditures.

On February 14, 1991, E'town issued 523,700 shares of common stock 
for net proceeds of $11.6 million. Proceeds of the issue funded an 
$8 million capital contribution to Elizabethtown. Also, E'town funded 
additional equity contributions of $1.8 million to Elizabethtown from 
E'town's DRP. During 1991, Elizabethtown issued $27.5 million of 8 3/4% 
Debentures to retire $25 million of 11 1/8% Debentures and, through the 
NJEDA, issued a total of $25.5 million of tax-exempt debentures with interest 
rates of 6.6% and 6.7% to refinance $10.5 million of tax-exempt 8.20% 
Debentures and $15 million of 6.20% NJEDA Notes.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings Applicable to Common Stock for 1993 were $13.8 million as 
compared to $11.1 million for 1992. The increase in net income resulted 
from higher levels of outdoor water use due to abnormally hot and dry 
summer weather. Also, rate increases received in March of 1993 and 
1992, enabled the Company to cover higher levels of operating and 
financial expenses in 1993 without adversely affecting net income. 
Summer water use in excess of what management believes to be normal 
contributed approximately $1.8 million. Assuming a return to normal 
weather patterns in 1994, the Company expects that earnings for 1994 
will be less than earnings realized in 1993.

Earnings Applicable to Common Stock for 1992 were $11.1 million, as 
compared to $10.3 million for 1991. The increase resulted primarily 
because the Company realized $3.3 million from the rate increase granted 
in March 1992, which was partially offset by increased expenses. 

Operating Revenues increased $10.8 million or 12.1% in 1993. Of this 
increase, $4.8 million relates to the combined effect of the rate 
increases of $5.0 million and $4.0 million effective March 1993 and 
1992, respectively. Also, sales to retail customers increased $3.8 
million and sales to other water systems increased $1.2 million due to 
hot, dry summer weather.

Operating Revenues increased $ $3.1 million or 3.6% in 1992 primarily 
because of the rate increase effective March 1992. Retail water 
consumption dropped by $1.5 million in 1992 due to relatively wet summer 
weather. However, lower consumption by retail customers was partially 
offset by an increase in sales to other water systems of $.4 million.

-4-

Operation Expenses increased by $3.5 million or 10.0% in 1993 primarily 
due to increases in the quantity of power and raw water purchased to 
meet higher than normal summer loads. Also, the unit costs of power and 
purchased water increased, as did labor costs and the cost of medical 
and other benefits.

Operation Expenses increased $1.9 million or 4.9% in 1992. Increases in 
labor, the price of purchased water and worker's compensation premiums 
were partially offset by a reduction in hospitalization premiums.

Maintenance Expenses increased less than $.1 million or .2% in 1993 and 
$.3 million or 5.7% in 1992 due to fluctuations in routine maintenance 
at various operating facilities.

Depreciation Expense increased $.6 million or 9.5% in 1993 and $.4 million 
or 6.3% in 1992 due to additional depreciable plant being placed in 
service during those periods.

Revenue Taxes increased $1.4 million or 12.8% in 1993 and $.4 million or 
3.4% in 1992 due to additional taxes on the higher revenues explained 
above.

Real Estate, Payroll and Other Taxes increased $.1 million in 
1993 due to increased payroll taxes resulting from labor cost increases. 
Real Estate, Payroll and Other Taxes increased by $.1 million in 1992.

Federal Income Taxes increased $1.8 million or 31.2% in 1993 and
$.2 million or 3.6% in 1992 due to the changes in the components of 
taxable income discussed herein. The increase in 1993 also includes
$.2 million due to the change in the federal statutory tax rate from 34% 
to 35%. 

Other Income increased in total by $.1 million in 1993. Other Income 
increased due to a gain on the sale of land in August 1993, of $.1 
million. A decrease in the equity component of AFUDC of $.2 million 
resulted from the timing of construction expenditures. Other increases 
of $.2 million resulted from various miscellaneous items. Federal 
income taxes, as a result of all of the above, increased $.1 million.

In 1992 Other Income increased in total by $.4 million. Other 
Income in 1992 includes an equity component of AFUDC of $.6 million. 
Federal income taxes, as a result of the above, increased $.2 million.

Total Interest Charges increased $.8 million or 7.7% in 1993, due 
primarily to an increase in interest for long-term debt issued in 
September 1992 and a reduction in earnings from NJEDA trust funds due to 
reduced trust fund balances. These items were partially offset by lower 
interest on short-term debt due to reduced borrowings.

-5-

Total Interest Charges decreased $.4 million or 3.6% in 1992 due to 
the net effect of (i) new long-term debt issued in September 1992, 
(ii) lower interest costs as a result of long-term debt refinancing and 
(iii) lower levels of short-term debt balances and their related rates. 

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Earnings for Elizabethtown Water Company for the next several years will
be primarily affected by weather and customer usage, the magnitude and 
timing of capital expenditures, the rate of growth of revenues and 
expenses and the adequacy and timeliness of regulatory relief.
Elizabethtown and Mount Holly believe that they have sufficient 
surface and well water supplies to meet their customers' needs and that 
they are, and will remain, in compliance with all water quality 
standards. Nonetheless, governmental water quality and service 
regulations will require Elizabethtown and Mount Holly to make 
significant investments in water treatment, transmission and storage 
facilities including, most significantly, the Plant. This capital 
program will require regular external financing and rate relief for the 
next several years.

Because Elizabethtown expects its rate base to grow more quickly 
than pumpage over the next several years, Elizabethtown anticipates 
filing for a rate increase in 1994, and regularly thereafter, so that it 
may have the opportunity to realize satisfactory returns on equity. 
Adequate equity returns will enable Elizabethtown to continue to attract 
external capital to finance improvements necessary to maintain safe and 
adequate service.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Elizabethtown Water Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and 
statements of consolidated capitalization of Elizabethtown Water Company 
and its subsidiary as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related 
statements of consolidated income, shareholder's equity, and cash flows 
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, 
in all material respects, the financial position of Elizabethtown Water 
Company and its subsidiary at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, 
in 1993 the Company changed its method of accounting for postretirement 
benefit costs and income taxes to conform with Statements of Financial 
Accounting Standards Numbers 106 and 109, respectively.

ELIZABETHTOWN WATER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION

Elizabethtown Water Company (Elizabethtown or Company) and its wholly 
owned subsidiary, The Mount Holly Water Company (Mount Holly), the 
consolidated entity referred to herein as Elizabethtown Water Company 
(Elizabethtown Water Company), is a wholly owned subsidiary of E'town 
Corporation (E'town or Corporation). E'town, a New Jersey holding 
company, is the parent company of Elizabethtown Water Company and 
E'town Properties, Inc.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include Elizabethtown and its 
subsidiary, Mount Holly. Significant intercompany accounts and 
transactions have been eliminated. Elizabethtown and Mount Holly are 
regulated water utilities and follow the Uniform System of Accounts, 
as adopted by the New Jersey Board of Regulatory Commissioners (BRC).

Utility Plant and Depreciation

Income is charged with the cost of labor, materials and other expenses 
incurred in making repairs and minor replacements and in maintaining 
the properties. Utility plant accounts are charged with the cost of 
improvements and major replacements of property. When depreciable 
property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost thereof, plus 
the cost of removal net of salvage, is charged to accumulated 
depreciation.

Depreciation generally is computed on a straight-line basis at 
functional rates for various classes of assets. The provision for 
depreciation, as a percentage of average depreciable property, 
was 1.74% for 1993 and 1.72% for 1992 and 1991.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

Elizabethtown capitalizes, as an appropriate cost of utility plant, an 
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC), which represents 
the cost of financing major projects during construction. AFUDC is 
added to the construction cost of the project and included in rate 
base and then recovered in rates during the project's useful life. 
AFUDC is comprised of a debt component, credited to Interest Charges,
and an equity component, credited to Other Income, in the Statements of 
Consolidated Income. (See Note 8). The equity component considers the 
increased reliance on equity contributions to Elizabethtown from E'town's 
stock sales. Such equity contributions have become an integral part of
the financing of Elizabethtown's construction program. AFUDC totaled
$837,234, $1,215,916 and $391,936 for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

-14-

Revenues

Revenues are recorded based on the amounts of water delivered to 
customers through the end of each accounting period. This includes an 
accrual for unbilled revenues for water delivered from the time meters 
were last read to the end of the respective accounting periods.

Federal Income Taxes

Elizabethtown water Company files a consolidated federal tax return with 
E'town and E'town properties Inc. Deferred income taxes are provided for 
timing differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and 
financial statement purposes to the extent permitted by the BRC. 

Elizabethtown and Mount Holly account for prior years' investment tax 
credits by the deferral method, which amortizes the credits over the 
lives of the respective assets. 

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards (SFAS) 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." (See 
Note 3).

Customer Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of 
Construction

Customer Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of 
Construction represent capital provided by developers for main 
extensions to new real estate developments. Some portion of Customer 
Advances for Construction is refunded based upon the revenues that the 
new developments generate. Contributions in Aid of Construction are 
Customer Advances for Construction that are no longer subject to 
refund.

Postretirement Benefits

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS 106, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." (See 
Note 10).

Funds Held by Trustee for Construction Expenditures

Proceeds from New Jersey Economic Development Authority financings are 
held in trust until such time as qualified project expenditures are 
incurred. Income received from the investment of the trust fund 
assets is recorded as an offset to the related interest expense. 

Cash Equivalents

Elizabethtown Water Company considers all highly liquid debt 
instruments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be 
cash equivalents for purposes of the Statements of Consolidated Cash 
Flows.

-15-

Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 
current year presentation.

3. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The computation of federal income taxes and the reconciliation of the 
tax provision computed at the federal statutory rate (35% in 1993, 34% 
in 1992 and 1991) with the amount reported in the Statements of 
Consolidated Income follow: 
1993 1992 1991 
----------------------
(Thousands of Dollars) 

Tax expense at statutory rate ....... $7,962 $6,178 $5,777 

Items for which deferred taxes 
are not provided:
Capitalized interest ............... (2) (3) 16

------ ------ ------
Total provision .................... $7,917 $6,021 $5,630
====== ====== ====== 

Effective January 1, 1993, Elizabethtown Water Company adopted SFAS 
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS 109 establishes new 
accounting rules that change the manner in which income tax expense is 
determined for accounting purposes. SFAS 109 utilizes a liability 
method under which deferred taxes are provided at the enacted 
statutory rate for all temporary differences between financial 
statement earnings amounts and the tax basis of existing assets or 
liabilities. 
In connection with the adoption of SFAS 109, Elizabethtown Water 
Company recorded additional deferred taxes for water utility temporary 

-16-

differences not previously recognized. The increased deferred tax 
liability was offset by a corresponding asset representing the future 
revenue expected to be recovered through rates based on established 
regulatory practice permitting such recovery. The increased deferred 
tax liability totaled $25,352,412 at January 1, 1993 and $26,643,663 
at December 31, 1993.

In accordance with SFAS 109, deferred tax balances have been reflected 
at E'town's current consolidated federal income tax rate, which 
is 35%. The increase in the statutory tax rate, retroactive to 
January 1, 1993, from 34% to 35%, is the result of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1993, which was passed by Congress on 
August 2, 1993. The increase in the statutory tax rate resulted in 
the recognition of additional federal income tax expense of $168,798 
and an additional deferred federal income tax liability of $100,744.

The net deferred income tax liability as of December 31, 1993 is 
comprised of the following:

1993 
---------------------- 
(Thousands of Dollars)

Deferred tax assets.......................... $ 3,804 
Deferred tax liabilities..................... (59,759)
--------
Net deferred income tax liabilities.......... $(55,955)
======== 

The tax effect of significant temporary differences representing 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1993
is as follows:

1993 
---------------------- 
(Thousands of Dollars)

Water utility plant-net...................... $(49,582)
Taxes recoverable............................ (9,326)
Investment tax credit........................ 3,098
Pension expenditures......................... (351)
Other-net.................................... 206
--------
Net deferred income tax liabilities.......... $(55,955)
======== 

4. CAPITALIZATION

Cumulative Preferred Stock - Redeemable

Elizabethtown's $8.75 Cumulative Preferred Stock has optional 
redemption privileges beginning in 1994 at $108.75 per share, which 
diminish annually until 2009, when redemption is at par ($100). 
Beginning in December 1994, sinking fund payments of $600,000 are 
required annually through 2018. 

-17-

Elizabethtown proposes to issue 120,000 shares of $100 par value 
Cumulative Preferred Stock in March 1994. The proceeds of the issue 
will be used to redeem $12,000,000 of the Company's $8.75 Cumulative 
Preferred Stock. The redemption premium of $1,050,000 will be paid 
from general Company funds. 

Long-term Debt

Elizabethtown's long-term debt indentures restrict the amount of 
retained earnings available to Elizabethtown to pay cash dividends 
(which is the primary source of funds available to the Corporation for 
payment of dividends on its common stock) or acquire Elizabethtown's 
common stock, all of which is held by E'town. At December 31, 1993, 
$12,831,414 of Elizabethtown's retained earnings were restricted under 
the most restrictive indenture provision. Therefore, $34,155,071 of 
consolidated retained earnings were unrestricted.

On November 9, 1993, Elizabethtown issued $50,000,000 of 7 1/4% 
Debentures due November 1, 2028. The proceeds of the issue were used 
to redeem $30,000,000 of the Company's 8 5/8% Debentures due 2007 and 
$20,000,000 of the Company's 10 1/8% Debentures due 2018. The 
aggregate redemption premiums of $2,681,000 were paid from general 
Company funds.

On September 16, 1992, Elizabethtown issued $15,000,000 of 8% Debentures 
due September 1, 2022. The proceeds of this issue were used to repay 
short-term bank debt, of which $9,000,000 was incurred to repay 
Elizabethtown's 4 7/8% Debentures on their February 1, 1992 maturity date 
and the remainder was incurred to finance construction expenditures. 

5. LINES OF CREDIT

Elizabethtown has existing uncommitted lines of credit with several 
banks aggregating $34,000,000 for which compensating balances are 
maintained. Information relating to bank borrowings and compensating 
balances is as follows: 
1993 1992 1991 
----------------------------
(Thousands of Dollars) 

Maximum amount outstanding.......... $7,000 $27,500 $23,000
Average monthly amount outstanding.. 2,062 $15,457 $16,371
Average interest rate at year end... (A) 4.1% 5.6%
Compensating balances at year end... $ 195 $ 205 $ 230
Weighted average interest rate based
on average daily balances.......... 3.8% 4.6% 6.8%
(A) No outstanding bank borrowings at year end.

Elizabethtown is negotiating a committed revolving credit agreement, 
which is expected to be in place by April 1994, with an agent bank and 
up to five additional participating banks to replace its existing 
uncommitted lines of credit discussed above. The agreement provides up 

-18-

to $60,000,000 in revolving short-term notes to provide sufficient 
short-term financing for the Company to fund, together with other 
monies, its capital program, which is estimated to be $192,981,000 
through 1996. The agreement wil allow the Company to borrow, repay 
and reborrow up to $60,000,000 for the first three years, after which 
time the Company may convert any outstanding balances to a five-year, 
fully amortizing term loan. The agreement will further provide that 
among other covenants, the Company must maintain a ratio of common 
and preferred equity to total capitalization of not less than 35% 
and a pre-tax interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.

6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying amounts and the estimated fair values, as of 
December 31, 1993 and 1992 of financial instruments issued by 
Elizabethtown Water Company are as follows:

1993 1992 
---------------------

Estimated fair value.............. 155,097 148,179

(1) Fair value approximates the carrying amount.

(2) Estimated fair values are based upon quoted market prices for 
similar securities.

7. DEFERRED CHARGES AND CREDITS

Abandonments

The abandonment cost of a small filter plant has been deferred and
is being amortized for ratemaking purposes over a 10-year period ending
in 1995.

Waste Residual Management

The costs of the waste residual management programs are being amortized
over three-year periods for ratemaking purposes. 

No return is being earned on either of the above unamortized deferred 
charge balances.

-19-

Emergency Water Projects

The 1984 assessment for Elizabethtown's proportionate share of the
cost of emergency water projects is being recovered through rates and
amortized over a 10-year period. 

Unamortized Debt Expenses

Costs incurred in connection with the issuance or redemption of 
long-term debt have been deferred and are being amortized over the lives 
of the respective issues. 

8. REGULATORY MATTERS

Rates

In August 1993, the BRC approved a stipulation (1993 Plant Stipulation)
signed by the parties to the Company's petition relating to the Canal 
Road Water Treatment Plant (Plant). The 1993 Plant Stipulation states 
that the Plant is necessary and that the Company's estimates regarding 
the Plant's cost, at that time of $87,000,000, and construction period 
are reasonable. The 1993 Plant Stipulation authorizes the Company to 
levy a rate surcharge if the Company's pre-tax interest coverage ratio 
for any 12 month historical period drops below 2.0 times. The surcharge 
would equal 20% of the Company's gross interest expense for the prior 
12 months, adjusted for revenue taxes. The surcharge would go into 
effect at the same time as the Company's next base rate increase after 
the coverage ratio falls below 2.0 times, but in no event prior to 
January 1, 1995. Also, the surcharge would remain in effect for 
12 months and could be extended by the BRC for up to six additional 
months. The 1993 Plant Stipulation also provides that the rate of 
return on common stockholder's equity used to calculate the rate for 
the equity component of the AFUDC for the Plant will be 1.5% less than 
the rate of return on common stockholder's equity established in the 
Company's most recent base rate case. The authorized rate of return 
on common stockholder's equity is currently 11.5%.

On January 4, 1994, Elizabethtown filed with the BRC for a Purchased 
Water Adjustment Clause, a procedure established by BRC Rules, which 
would allow Elizabethtown to recover in rates $529,291 for the 
increase in the cost of purchased water from the New Jersey Water 
Supply Authority (NJWSA) without a complete rate case. The NJWSA has 
given notice that effective July 1, 1994, it will increase charges for 
water from $220.47 to $232.65 per million gallons. The Company 
expects the BRC to render a decision prior to July 1994.

On March 18, 1993, the BRC approved a stipulation (1993 Stipulation) 
for a rate increase of $5,000,000, effective as of that date. The 
1993 Stipulation contains a provision allowing for the deferral of 
expenses, calculated under SFAS 106, for postretirement benefits 
accrued that are in excess of the cash benefits paid. Recovery of 

-20-

such deferrals will be considered in future rate cases. (See 
Note 10). 

On March 18, 1992, the BRC approved a stipulation for a rate increase
of $4,050,000, effective as of that date.

Main Extension Refunds

In a case captioned Van Holten, et al v. Elizabethtown Water Company 
(Van Holten), several developers petitioned the BRC in 1984 and 1985 
seeking an Order which would require Elizabethtown to refund to the 
developers all of their on-site and off-site customer advances for 
construction. For on-site mains, Elizabethtown received a final BRC 
decision in September 1987, requiring refunds in accordance with the 
BRC's suggested refund formula, which was less than the amounts 
requested by the developers. For the off-site mains, the developers 
were denied any refund. The developers appealed the BRC decision to 
the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court (Appellate 
Division), which in October 1988 upheld the decision of the BRC. 

Since 1986, additional petitions dealing with this issue have been 
filed by other developers. In these additional proceedings, all 
parties have agreed to abide by the final decision of the New Jersey 
Supreme Court in the Van Holten case. For all customer advances, 
Elizabethtown has and will continue to make the refunds in accordance 
with the BRC's suggested refund formula.

In response to an appeal of the 1988 Appellate Division decision, in 
August 1990, the New Jersey Supreme Court (Court) rendered a decision 
upholding the BRC's authority to implement what the BRC had 
established as an appropriate refund formula in the Van Holten case. 

The BRC's suggested formula provides for a refund of 2 1/2 times the 
annual revenues for each metered connection. Although the Court ruled 
that the BRC has the jurisdiction to determine what is an appropriate 
refund formula, it remanded the case to the BRC to further develop the 
record on why the BRC deemed the 2 1/2 times formula to be appropriate 
in the Van Holten case. 

In June 1991, the BRC issued an Order on Remand reaffirming the 2 1/2 
times annual revenue formula. Addressing the reasonableness of this 
formula, the BRC indicated in its decision that the 2 1/2 times 
formula fairly allocates the costs of the main extensions among the 
developers, Elizabethtown and the rate payers. Again, developers 
appealed the Order on Remand to the Appellate Division, and in 
December 1992, the Appellate Division remanded the matter to the BRC 
for more complete findings and statements of reasons in support of its 
decision.
By Order dated January 19, 1994, the BRC again deemed the 2 1/2 times 
formula to be appropriate in the Van Holten case. In addition to the 
previous rationale it gave for employing this formula in this case, 

-21-

the BRC indicated that on a per-customer basis, the initial cost of 
the extension was, in most instances, far higher than Elizabethtown's 
average cost of plant invested for existing customers at the time 
petitions were filed in 1984. Therefore, a full refund would clearly 
result in a significant subsidization of the developers by 
Elizabethtown's existing customers. The BRC concluded that such a 
subsidization would be unjust and unreasonable.

On February 23, 1994, the developers appealed the January 19, 1994
BRC Order on Remand to the Appellate Division.

The maximum potential refund for the Van Holten case, and all 
subsequently filed cases, is approximately $3,000,000, which would be 
capitalized and, therefore, would not have a material adverse effect 
on earnings. Management believes the final outcome of this matter 
will be favorable and no additional refunds will be necessary.

9. COMMITMENTS

Elizabethtown is obligated, under a contract that expires in 2013, to 
purchase from the NJWSA a minimum of 37 billion gallons of water 
annually. The Company purchases additional water from the NJWSA on an 
as-needed basis. Effective July 1, 1994, the annual cost under the 
contract will be $8,661,559. The total cost of water purchased from 
the NJWSA, including additional water purchased on an as-needed basis, 
was $8,819,212, $7,827,058 and $7,527,662 for 1993, 1992 and 1991, 
respectively.

The following is a schedule by years of future minimum rental payments 
required under noncancelable operating leases with terms in excess of 
one year at December 31, 1993:
1993 
---------------------- 
(Thousands of Dollars)

1994........................................ $ 832
1995........................................ 785
1996........................................ 780
1997........................................ 720 
1998........................................ -0-
------
Total....................................... $3,117
====== 

Rent expense totaled $789,636, $719,624 and $740,801 for 1993, 1992 
and 1991, respectively.

Capital expenditures through 1996 are estimated to be $192,981,000 for
Elizabethtown's and Mount Holly's utility plant.

Elizabethtown has accepted a bid, based upon competitive bidding, from 
a general contractor and intends to sign a contract for the 
construction of the Plant, which is estimated to cost approximately 

-22-

$96,530,000, excluding AFUDC. The Company has notified all parties 
to the 1993 Plant Stipulation of this revised cost of the Plant. The 
Plant will take approximately 2 1/2 years to construct, beginning in the 
spring of 1994. The Company has recorded $6,825,354 as construction 
costs on the Plant as of December 31, 1993.

10. PENSION PLAN AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Elizabethtown has a trusteed, noncontributory Retirement Plan (Plan),
which covers most employees. Under the Company's funding policy,
Elizabethtown Water Company makes contributions that meet the minimum
funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974. The components of the net pension credits are as follows: 

1993 1992 1991 
----------------------
(Thousands of Dollars)

Service cost-benefits earned during the year .. $ 899 $ 843 $ 780
Interest cost on projected benefit obligation . 1,973 1,836 1,715
Return on Plan assets ......................... (1,409) (970) (5,677)
Net amortization and deferral ................. (1,658) (2,235) 3,051 
------ ------ ------
Net pension credit ............................ $ (195) $ (526) $ (131) 
====== ====== ====== 

Plan assets are invested in publicly traded debt and equity securities.
The reconciliations of the funded status of the Plan to the amounts 
recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are presented below:

1993 1992 
--------------------- 
(Thousands of Dollars)

Market value of Plan assets ..................... $33,032 $32,710 
Actuarial present value of Plan benefits: ------- -------

Accumulated benefit obligation .................. 20,935 17,027
Projected increases in compensation levels ...... 6,541 6,799

Unrecognized transition asset ................... (2,689) (2,955) 
------- -------
Prepaid pension expense.......................... $ 1,003 $ 808 
======= ======= 

-23-

The assumed rates used in determining the actuarial present value of the 
projected benefit obligations were as follows:

1993 1992 
----- -----
Discount rate ................................... 7.00% 8.50%
Compensation increase ........................... 5.50% 7.50%
Rate of return on Plan assets ................... 8.50% 8.50%

Elizabethtown and Mount Holly provide certain health care and life 
insurance benefits for substantially all of their retired employees. 
Effective January 1, 1993, Elizabethtown Water Company adopted SFAS 106, 
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." 
Under SFAS 106, the costs of such benefits are accrued for each year the 
employee renders service, based on the expected cost of providing such 
benefits to the employee and the employee's beneficiaries and covered 
dependents rather than expensing these benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis 
for retired employees. Based upon an independent actuarial study, the 
transition obligation, which Elizabethtown Water Company has not funded, 
was $7,214,736 as of January 1, 1993. The transition obligation is being 
amortized over 20 years. The following table details the unfunded 
postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1993:

1993 
--------------------- 
(Thousands of Dollars)

Retirees......................................... $3,133
Fully eligible plan participants................. 5,403 
------
Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.... 8,536
Unrecognized net gain............................ (677)
Unrecognized transition obligation............... (6,854)
------
Accumulated postretirement benefits.............. $1,005
====== 

The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1993, and for 1993, 
was 12%. This rate decreases linearly each successive year until it 
reaches 5% in 2003, after which the rate remains constant. The assumed 
discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation at December 31, 1993, and for 1993, was 7.0% and 8.5%, 
respectively. A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care 
cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation as of January 1, 1993, and net 
postretirement service cost and interest cost by approximately $924,000
and $140,000, respectively. 

-24-

Based upon an independent actuarial study, the annual postretirement cost 
calculated under SFAS 106 for 1993 is as follows:

1993 
---------------------- 
(Thousands of Dollars)
Service cost - benefits earned 
during the year.................................. $ 249
Interest cost on accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation................ 602
Amortization of transition obligation.............. 361
------
Total............................................ 1,212
Deferred amount for regulated
companies pending recovery....................... (1,005)
------
Net postretirement benefit expense................. $ 207
====== 

The Company recognized as an expense (on a pay-as-you-go basis)
$252,000 for both 1992 and 1991 for postretirement health care and life 
insurance benefits.

The rate increase for the 1993 Stipulation includes as an allowable 
expense, only the pay-as-you-go portion of postretirement benefits. The 
1993 Stipulation allows Elizabethtown to defer the amount accrued in
excess of the pay-as-you-go portion, for consideration in future rate
cases. In addition, in a separate proceeding, Mount Holly had
petitioned the BRC for permission to defer the amount accrued in excess
of the pay-as-you-go portion of its expenses calculated under SFAS 106,
and consequently, has been granted such authority. Generally accepted
accounting principles permit this regulatory treatment, provided
deferrals are not accumulated for a period of more than five years.
As of December 31, 1993, the amount that has been deferred is
$1,004,556. Recovery of deferred postretirement costs will be
requested in Elizabethtown's and Mount Holly's next base rate case.
Management believes that Elizabethtown and Mount Holly will recover the
deferred postretirement costs in future rates.

11. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company enters into various transactions with E'town and E'town 
Properties, Inc. Elizabethtown provides administrative and accounting 
services to these affiliates which are billed on a monthly basis. These 
amounts totaled $246,442, $236,839 and $227,665 for 1993, 1992 and 1991, 
respectively. In addition, various expenditures are made to vendors which 
are common to the entities. Each entity absorbs its proportionate share
of the costs. The most significant of these items is rent which totaled 
$31,749, $33,600 and $31,608 for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
