ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On December 15, 1994, Kemper Corporation's ("Kemper") wholly owned
subsidiary, Kemper Asset Holdings, Inc. ("KAHI") and five money market
mutual funds (each a "Fund," and collectively, the "Funds") entered into a
Put and Call Agreement (the "Agreement") respecting $198 million in
principal amount of County of Orange, California 1994-95 Taxable Notes due
7/10/95 -- floating rate (the "Notes") owned in the aggregate by the Funds.
Kemper guaranteed KAHI's obligations under the Agreement (the "Guaranty").
Kemper Financial Services, Inc. ("KFS"), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Kemper Financial Companies, Inc. ("KFC"), is each Fund's investment adviser
and manager. KFC is more than 96% owned by Kemper on a fully converted
basis.

Reference is made to the Agreement and the Guaranty for a description of
their respective terms and conditions. A copy of the Agreement and the
Guaranty is filed as Exhibit 10 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

The Board of Trustees of each Fund has directed each Fund to exercise its
rights under the Agreement to require KAHI to purchase the Notes on the Put
Date (as defined in the Agreement) unless, prior to the Put Date, the
Agreement and Guaranty have been replaced by a credit enhancement (i.e., a
letter of credit or similar instrument) from a Qualified Party (as defined
in the Agreement).

The Agreement will result in a $198 million increase in Kemper's
off-balance-sheet commitments at year-end 1994. Kemper is currently
evaluating what, if any, impact the Orange County and Orange County
Investment Pool bankruptcy filings will have on Kemper's consolidated
results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 1994.

WHEREAS, the County of Orange, California, has filed a petition under
Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Code"); and

WHEREAS, Kemper, KAHI and each of the Funds desire that the Funds and
their shareholders be protected with respect to all interest and principal
called for by the terms of the Notes;

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
agree:

1. Each Fund, on the Put Date (as hereinafter defined) shall have the
unconditional right to require KAHI to purchase at par, plus accrued
interest compounded monthly (without considering any limitations which may

4

be imposed on such accrual under the Code), all or part of the Notes then
held by such Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such
Fund(s) may exercise such right by giving written notice to KAHI and Kemper
not later than 5:00 p.m. (Central time) on the business day prior to such
Put Date; provided that prior to March 14, 1995 no Fund shall deliver any
such notice unless Kemper shall fail to maintain a private short term debt
rating of "Duff 1") by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. ("Duff & Phelps").
Such Fund(s) shall tender and KAHI shall purchase and pay for the Notes
being acquired by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00
noon (Central time) on such Put Date. As used herein, the term "Put Date"
shall mean (a) March 15, 1995 or (b) any earlier date on which Kemper shall
fail to maintain a private short term debt rating of "Duff 1" by Duff &
Phelps.

2. KAHI shall have the unconditional right to require each Fund to
sell to KAHI, at the greater of (a) par plus accrued interest compounded
monthly (without considering any limitations which may be imposed on such
accrual under the Code) or (b) market, all or such part of the Notes held
by such Fund as KAHI shall designate at any time and from time to time
prior to March 15, 1995. KAHI may exercise its rights under this Paragraph
by giving written notice to such Fund(s) not later than 5:00 p.m. (Central
time) on the business day immediately preceding the date of purchase
designated by KAHI. Such Fund(s) shall tender and KAHI shall purchase and
pay for the Notes or such portion thereof as KAHI shall have elected to
purchase by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon
(Central time) on such date of purchase.

3. Each Fund may, at any time and from time to time prior to March
15, 1995, sell the Notes or any part thereof to any other person. Upon any
such sale any rights and/or obligations of KAHI under Paragraphs 1 and 2
above with respect to the sold Notes shall be extinguished.

4. Each Fund hereby assigns to KAHI any and all actions, claims and
other rights of every kind and nature (other than for principal and
interest and such Fund's right under Paragraph 1 above) related in any way
to any Notes, including without limitation such Fund's purchase of any
Notes, that such Fund sells to KAHI pursuant to Paragraph 1 or 2 above,
including without limitation any rights and other claims under federal or
state securities laws, under the Code and under any other laws. KAHI
hereby accepts such assignment.

5. All decisions by any Fund to exercise or not exercise its right
under Paragraph 1 above, or to sell all or any part of the Notes to other
persons under Paragraph 3 above, shall require the approval of a majority
of the trustees of such Fund who are not interested persons (as defined in
the Investment Company Act of 1940) of the Fund.

6. This Agreement shall terminate at such time as all obligations of
KAHI under Paragraph 1 above shall have been satisfied or shall have
expired, or at such earlier time as KAHI shall have acquired all of the

5

Notes in accordance with the terms hereof, provided that the assignment
provided for in Paragraph 4 shall survive any such termination. This
Agreement shall also terminate with respect to any Notes at such time as
the Fund holding such Notes has been (a) paid any interest due (without
considering any limitations on accrual which may be imposed under the
Code), compounded monthly, and (b) provided an irrevocable letter of credit
or similar instrument issued by a Qualified Party that unconditionally
obligates such Qualified Party to pay such Fund the principal amount of and
all accrued interest (without considering any limitations which may be
imposed on such accrual under the Code) on such Notes when due thereafter
under the terms thereof if not so paid by the issuer of such Notes. As
used in the preceding sentence, the term "Qualified Party" means a party
not affiliated with KAHI or Kemper but rated by the Requisite NRSROs in the
highest category for Short-term obligations (as the terms "Requisite
NRSROs" and "Short-term" are defined in Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940).

7. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding
upon, the parties hereto and shall not be assignable by either party. This
Agreement may be amended only by a writing signed on behalf of all
parties.

8. Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices or consents
required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed delivered if delivered in person or if sent by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, by facsimile or similar
transmission, or by overnight delivery, as follows, unless such address is
changed by written notice hereunder:

under this Agreement shall apply only to the Portfolio indicated above, and
