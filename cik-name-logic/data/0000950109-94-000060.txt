RIGGS NEWS RELEASE

(LETTERHEAD OF RIGGS NATIONAL CORPORATION APPEARS HERE)

For Immediate Release, Thursday, January 13, 1994

RIGGS NATIONAL RECORDS PROFITABLE FOURTH QUARTER;
NONPERFORMING ASSETS DECLINE SUBSTANTIALLY

Riggs National Corporation, Washington, D.C.'s leading banking company,
achieved earnings of $3.081 million, or $.09 per share, for the fourth quarter
of 1993. The company also recorded a decline of $60 million in nonperforming
assets during the three-month period, reducing nonperforming assets to the
lowest level in more than three years.

Fourth-quarter results reflected a significant improvement from the $24.1
million loss for the fourth quarter of 1992 and compare with net income of
$2.962 millon for the third quarter of 1993. The provision for loan losses for
the fourth quarter was $2.1 million, compared with a provision of $27.3 million
for the year-earlier period.

Joe L. Allbritton, chairman and chief executive officer of Riggs National
Corporation, said, "We have now achieved two important objectives of the
financial restructuring plan: returning Riggs to profitability and increasing
the equity capital."

Paul M. Homan, president and chief executive officer of The Riggs National
Bank of Washington, Riggs National Corporation's principal subsidiary, added:
"Riggs made significant strides during the fourth quarter in improving earnings
and capital adequacy. Just as important, asset quality also continued to
improve. Nonperforming assets declined by $60 million during the quarter,
reflecting an excellent collection effort on the part of our dedicated staff and
improving economic conditions in our major markets in the U.S. and the U.K. We
are confident the return to profitability, the new capital of $132.3 million and
the favorable asset quality trends should provide the necessary foundation to
permit the continued successful implementation of the financial restructuring
plan during 1994."

For full-year 1993, Riggs reported a net loss of $94.2 million, compared
with a loss of $21.1 million for 1992. The 1993 loss stemmed from losses
incurred during the first half of the year. The full-year provision for loans
losses was $69.3 million; provisions, writedowns and other expenses related to
other real estate owned totaled $12.9 million; and restructuring charges,
including the cost of implementing "BankStart '93," Riggs's strategic program to
improve efficiency, totaled $34.6 million.

Approximately half of the 1993 provision for loan losses and other real
estate owned expenses related to loans originated in the United Kingdom, and the
remainder related primarily to domestic commercial real estate loans. These
negative factors were partially offset by securities gains of $24.1 million. 
For 1992, provisions for loan losses totaled $52.1 million; provisions,
writedowns and other expenses related to other real estate owned totaled $15.7
million; and securities gains totaled $34.2 million.

Nonperforming assets of $213 million at year-end 1993 stood $60 million
below the $273 million at September 30, 1993, and $94 million below the $307
million total at year-end 1992. More than half of the fourth-quarter reduction
resulted from repayments. As a percentage of total assets, nonperforming assets
stood at 4.46 percent at year-end 1993, down from 6.04 percent a year earlier.

Fourth-quarter net recoveries of $1.5 million compared with net charge-offs
of $16.0 million for the like 1992 period. Full-year net charge-offs of $66.4
million compared with $68.4 million for 1992. The reserve for loan losses at
year-end was $86.5 million, or 3.42 percent of loans, compared with $84.2
million, or 3.86 percent of loans, at December 31, 1992.

At December 31, 1993, Riggs's Tier I to risk-based capital ratio was 10.72
percent, up from 8.31 percent a year earlier, and compared with the Federal
Reserve Board minimum requirement of 4.00 percent. The total capital to
risk-based asset ratio was 16.76 percent, up from 14.70 percent at year-end
1992, and compared with the minimum requirement of 8.00 percent. The leverage
ratio at year-end was 6.03 percent, up from 4.60 percent a year earlier; Federal
Reserve Board guidelines require a minimum of 3.00 percent for the most highly
rated bank holding companies, and an additional 1.00 percent to 2.00 percent for
all others. All capital ratios for each of Riggs's subsidiary banks at year-end
exceeded all minimum regulatory requirements.

Riggs National Corporation is a Washington, D.C.-based multibank holding
company, with banks in Washington, D.C., Virginia, Maryland, The United Kingdom
and France. Riggs serves the metropolitan Washington area with 34 locations in
the District of Columbia, 17 in Virginia and 11 in Maryland.
