FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

BURLINGTON NORTHERN AND SANTA FE AGREE TO MERGE

FORT WORTH, TEXAS and SCHAUMBURG, ILLINOIS, June 30, 1994 -- Burlington 
Northern Inc. (BN) and Santa Fe Pacific Corporation (Santa Fe) jointly announced
today that they have signed a definitive agreement providing for the merger of 
the two companies, subject to receiving approval from the Interstate Commerce 
Commission (ICC). The combination will create a rail network covering the 
midwestern and western United States and provide shippers with single-line 
service connecting all principal West Coast ports with major midwestern and 
western markets and with ports and markets in the Southeast.

Santa Fe shareholders will receive 0.27 of a share of Burlington Northern 
common stock for each Santa Fe share. Separately, Santa Fe announced today that 
it will distribute to its shareholders on September 30, 1994, the remaining 
stock which it owns in Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp. This dividend will be paid 
prior to the merger with BN and is not dependent on the merger. Both 
transactions are expected to be tax-free to shareholders.

Upon completion of the merger, Burlington Northern will change its name to 
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation and the railroads will be called The 
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company. Gerald Grinstein, Burlington 
Northern's chairman and chief executive officer, will be chairman of the merged 
company. Robert D. Krebs, chairman, president and chief executive officer of 
Santa Fe, will be president and chief executive officer of the new company.

"The combination of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe is a predominantly 
end-to-end merger that will benefit shippers and the public," Mr. Grinstein 
said. "There is very little overlap between our two rail systems.

"The merged BN/Santa Fe network will provide single-line service across the 
key transcontinental corridor from Central and Southern California to the 
Southeastern gateways of Memphis and Birmingham. It will provide Midwestern 
grain shippers with new single-line access to the West Coast and Gulf ports, and
it will enhance shipping options to Canadian and Mexican gateways," he said.

Mr. Grinstein said that shippers prefer single-line service because it is more
efficient, gives them one point of contact, and eliminates the costs and delays 
associated with interchanging traffic from one carrier to another. Enhanced 
single-line service also will open new markets for shippers.

"This merger will create a strong, new rail carrier with a diversified traffic
base and excellent financial prospects. For example, Santa Fe's strength in 
intermodal traffic will complement BN's strength in coal and grain," said Mr. 
Krebs.

"This will benefit employees, customers, shareholders and the communities where 
both railroads operate."

"The combination of BN and Santa Fe will help U.S. industries compete more 
effectively in world markets by linking the heartland more closely with the West
Coast and Gulf Coast ports, thereby providing better access to Pacific Rim 
nations and other trading partners," Mr. Krebs said.

The merger has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies. It
is subject to approval by the shareholders of both companies at special meetings
to be scheduled as soon as possible. The companies will file their merger
application with the ICC later this year and ask the ICC to rule on the merger
on an expedited basis. While the ICC is reviewing the merger, BN and Santa Fe
will operate as independent companies, each headquartered in its current city
and operating under the direction of its current board and management.

"We expect the merger to result in substantial cost savings through 
operational improvements, increased traffic densities, reduced administrative 
costs and elimination of duplicative functions," said Mr. Krebs.

Burlington Northern is being advised by Lazard Freres & Co., which has 
rendered a fairness opinion to BN's Board of Directors, and Davis Polk & 
Wardwell. Santa Fe's advisors are Goldman, Sachs & Co., which has rendered a 
fairness opinion to Santa Fe's Board of Directors, and Mayer Brown & Platt.
