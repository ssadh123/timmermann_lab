Item 5. Other Events.

On April 7, 1994, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
vacated and reversed the judgment of the U.S. District Court in the Lone Star
Case (as described in the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 1993). The appeals court panel remanded the case for a new
trial, allowing Lone Star to amend its complaint to assert claims for double or
treble damages under Massachusetts law. A retrial of the case would re-open
all issues of liability and damages pled by Lone Star, and would also include
the new claims under Massachusetts law. The Registrant plans to file a
petition asking the Fourth Circuit to reconsider its decision.
