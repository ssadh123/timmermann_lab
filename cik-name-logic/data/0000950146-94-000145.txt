ANNEX II

[Form of letter of Price Waterhouse
to be delivered pursuant to Section 7(d)] 

Pursuant to Section 7(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants shall 
furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that: 

(i) They are independent certified public accountants with respect to the 
Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the applicable 
published rules and regulations thereunder; 

(ii) In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary 
financial information and schedules (and, if applicable, financial forecasts 
and/or pro forma financial information) examined by them and included or 
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus 
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting 
requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related 
published rules and regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have 
made a review in accordance with standards established by the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the unaudited consolidated 
interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial 
information, financial forecasts and/or condensed financial statements 
derived from audited financial statements of the Company for the periods 
specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of 
which have been furnished to the representatives of the Underwriters (the 
"Representatives"); 

(iii) They have made a review in accordance with standards established by 
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the unaudited 
condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and 
consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Prospectus as indicated 
in their reports thereon copies of which have been separately furnished to 
the Representative and on the basis of specified procedures including 
inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial 
and accounting matters regarding whether the unaudited condensed consolidated 
financial statements referred to in paragraph (vi)(A)(i) below comply as to 
form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of 
the Act and the related published rules and regulations, nothing came to 
their attention that caused them to believe that the unaudited condensed 
consolidated financial statements do not comply as to form in all material 
respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the 
related published rules and regulations; 

(iv) The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the 
consolidated results of operations and financial position of the Company for 
the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus and included or 
incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 
10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the corresponding amounts 
(after restatement where applicable) in the audited consolidated financial 
statements for such five fiscal years which were included or incorporated by 
reference in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years; 

(v) They have compared the information in the Prospectus under selected 
captions with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K and on the basis 
of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing came to their 
attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe 
that this information does not conform in all material respects with the 
disclosure requirements of Items 301, 302 and 503(d) respectively, of 
Regulation S-K; 

(vi) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an examination in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a 
reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred 
to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of 
the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the 
Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial 
statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, inquiries 
of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial 
and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be 
specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to 
believe that: 

(A) (i) the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, 
consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows 
included in the Prospectus and/or incorporated by reference in the Company's 
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do 
not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting 
requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related 
published rules and regulations thereunder or (ii) any material modifications 
should be made to the unaudited consolidated statements of income, 
consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of cash flows included 
in the Prospectus or included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q 
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, for them to be in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles;

included in the Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding items in the 
unaudited consolidated financial statements from which 
such data and items were derived, and any such unaudited data and items were 
not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the 
corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements 
included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 
10-K for the most recent fiscal year; 

(C) the unaudited financial statements which were not included in the 
Prospectus but from which were derived the unaudited condensed financial 
statements referred to in Clause (A) and any unaudited income statement data 
and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus and referred to in Clause 
(B) were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis 
for the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in 
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year; 

(D) any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements 
included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to 
form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of 
the Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro 
forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in 
the compilation of those statements; 

(E) as of a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of 
such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated capital stock 
(other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock 
appreciation rights, upon earn-outs of performance shares and upon 
conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on 
the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in 
the Prospectus), or any increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the 
Company and its subsidiaries or any increases in any items specified by the 
Representatives, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest 
balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, except 
in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus 
discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; 
and 

(F) for the period from the date of the latest financial statements 
included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus to the specified date 
referred to in Clause (E) there were any decreases in consolidated net 
revenue or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in 
any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with the 
comparable period in the preceding year and with any other period of 
corresponding length specified by the Representatives, except in each case 
for increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or 
may occur or which are described in such letter; and 

(vii) In addition to the audit referred to in their report(s) included or 
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the limited procedures, 
inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in 
paragraphs (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) above, they have carried out certain 
specified procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, 
percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives which 
are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its 
subsidiaries, which appear in the Prospectus (excluding documents 
incorporated by reference) or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, 
the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in documents 
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, 
and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial 
information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries 
and have found them to be in agreement. 

All references in this Annex II to the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to 
the Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as 
defined in the Underwriting Agreement as of the date of the letter delivered 
on the date of the Underwriting Agreement and to the Prospectus as amended or

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series 
shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of the 
series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect 
provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) 
the entire indebtedness of this Security and (b) certain restrictive 
covenants, in each case upon compliance by the Company with certain 
conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, 
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations 
of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each 
series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and 
the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority 
in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each 
series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions 
permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of 
the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the 
Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the 
Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past 
defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent 
of waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding 
upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any 
Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange 
herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or 
waiver is made upon this Security.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this 
Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the 
Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of 
and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and 
rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations 
therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registerable in the 
Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of

principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, 
duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in 
form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly 
executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in 
writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of 
like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate 
principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or 
transferees.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form 
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple 
thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain 
limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are 
exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this 
series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as 
requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of 
transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum 
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in 
connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of 
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the 
Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered 
as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be 
overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall 
be affected by notice to the contrary.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
