FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NL INDUSTRIES, INC. SETTLES LITIGATION
AGAINST LOCKHEED CORPORATION

HOUSTON, TX...February 24, 1994...NL Industries, Inc. announced today that
it has settled its pending lawsuit against Lockheed Corporation and Lockheed's
directors. Under the settlement, Lockheed paid NL $27 million in cash. In
connection with the settlement, NL and Lockheed agreed to dismiss the pending
proceedings and to release all claims that each may have against the other.

NL stated that the litigation arose out of NL's claims, among others, that
Lockheed had violated the federal securities laws by making false an misleading
statements about its employee stock ownership plan that impacted the value of
the Lockheed stock formerly owned by NL. The jury concluded in December 1992
verdict that Lockheed violated the antifraud provisions of the federal
securities laws and awarded NL $30 million. Both companies appealed.

NL's Chairman, Harold C. Simmons, expressed satisfaction with the
resolution of the disputes with Lockheed and its management.

NL Industries, Inc., a producer of titanium dioxide pigments and specialty
chemicals, is headquartered in Houston, Texas. NL's common stock is traded on
the New York and Pacific Stock Exchanges under the symbol "NL".
