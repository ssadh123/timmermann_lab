GRACE REPORTS 17 PERCENT INCREASE IN SECOND QUARTER PER
SHARE OPERATING EARNINGS BEFORE REINSTATED ASBESTOS CHARGE

BOCA RATON, Fla., July 26, 1994 -- W. R. Grace & Co. reported an
increase of 17 percent in per share net operating earnings for the second
quarter of 1994, before a reinstated $200 million after-tax charge for asbestos
litigation.

Grace's net operating earnings per share were 70 cents in the current
quarter, compared to 60 cents per share a year ago. Including the asbestos
charge, the Company reported a net loss of $134.3 million or $1.43 per share in
the second quarter of 1994, compared to a net loss of $51.1 million or 57 cents
per share a year ago. The 1993 net loss reflected an after-tax charge of $105
million related to discontinued operations.

Sales for the second quarter rose 13 percent to $1,237 million, compared
to $1,094 million a year ago.

"Improved operating earnings were achieved by both specialty chemicals
and health care, primarily as the result of strong volume gains, and every
region was a solid contributor," said J. P. Bolduc, president and chief

executive officer. "Consistent with our focus on delivering strong, sustainable
earnings growth from our core businesses, we remain dedicated to the process of
lowering costs and improving productivity, and we are continuing to absorb costs
associated with these efforts. These activities will both strengthen our
competitive position and improve the quality of results for the future," he
added.

For the first six months of 1994, operating earnings per share were
$1.10, a 16 percent increase from the $.95 per share posted for the 1993 first
half. Including the special charges in both periods, the first half showed a
net loss of $96.1 million or $1.03 per share, compared with a net loss in the
1993 first half of $22.8 million or 26 cents per share. Six months sales rose
11 percent to $2,314 million from $2,080 million reported last year.

Pretax earnings from specialty chemicals rose 18 percent to $79.0
million in the second quarter in spite of a $6 million provision for additional
costs associated with streamlining European operations. Packaging,
construction, catalysts and silica products, and water treatment all contributed
to the increased earnings based on volume gains from nearly every region.
Container earnings were essentially flat.

Pretax earnings from health care businesses rose 24 percent to $57.9
million with strong support from both domestic and international dialysis
services as well as the homecare division. The medical products group continued
below year-ago levels, but improved versus the previous quarter.

Grace is the world's largest specialty chemicals company and holds a
leadership position in specialized health care.
