Item 5. Other Events.

On April 19, 1994 Advanta Corp. announced record
quarterly earnings for the first quarter 1994 with net income
of $24.9 million and earnings per share of $.61, increases of
54% and 36%, respectively, over the $16.1 million and $.45
per share results for the first quarter 1993. Earnings for
the fourth quarter 1993 totalled $23.0 million or $.56 per
share. From March 1993, the Company's portfolio of managed
receivables increased by $1.6 billion or 44% to $5.4 billion
at March 31, 1994. First quarter 1994 earnings per share
incorporate a 14% increase in the average number of common
shares outstanding versus the first quarter 1993. Earnings
per share for all periods reflect the October 15, 1993 three-
for-two stock split.

Highlights for the first quarter include the following items:

Average managed credit card receivables posted a 51%
increase compared to a year ago.

The managed credit card 30+ day delinquency rate fell to
2.3%, from 2.4% in the fourth quarter 1993 and 3.5% in
the first quarter last year. This rate is the Company's
lowest level in over 4 years.

The charge-off rate on managed credit cards declined to
2.7%, compared to 2.9% for the fourth quarter of 1993
and 4.1% a year ago.

The Company added over 225,000 new credit card accounts
during the quarter compared to 125,000 in the first
quarter of 1993.

Return on equity remained healthy at 27.8% for the
quarter.

The managed net interest margin for the quarter fell to
7.38% from 7.64% in the fourth quarter, and 7.74% in the
comparable period of 1993 due to introductory pricing on
credit cards.

The operating expense ratio for the quarter fell 27
basis points from the fourth quarter to 3.68%, and was
down from 4.33% the same quarter last year.
