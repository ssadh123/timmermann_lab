FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

MELLON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 1993 RESULTS

. Corporation Earns $1.50 Per Share In Fourth Quarter 1993,
Up 36 Percent From Pro Forma Results in Fourth Quarter 1992

. Nonperforming Assets Decrease by $53 Million, or 13 Percent, 
in Fourth Quarter; NPAs Decrease $254 Million, or 43 
Percent, For Year

. Fee Revenue Increases 48 Percent in Fourth Quarter; Fee 
Revenue For Full Year Surpasses $1 Billion for First Time

PITTSBURGH, January 13, 1994 -- Mellon Bank Corporation today reported 
net income of $114 million, or $1.50 per common share, in the fourth 
quarter of 1993. These results compare with pro forma fully taxed net 
income of $76 million, or $1.10 per common share, in the fourth quarter 
of 1992.

For the full year 1993, the Corporation's net income, excluding a 
restructuring charge and securities gains, was $420 million, or $5.59 
per common share. This compares with pro forma fully taxed net income 
in 1992 of $307 million, or $4.63 per common share. Including the 
restructuring charge and securities gains, the Corporation's full year 
1993 net income and net income per common share were $361 million and 
$4.63, respectively.

"Our strong fourth quarter results capped an exceptionally successful 
and productive year for Mellon," said Frank V. Cahouet, Mellon 
chairman, president and chief executive officer. "In addition to 
sustaining earnings momentum in our core businesses and further 
improving credit quality, we continued to secure the Corporation's 
position in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. 
Completion of The Boston Company transaction and our announcement of a 
planned merger with The Dreyfus Corporation have established Mellon as 
a banking institution unique in its character and capabilities. Thanks 
to another outstanding effort by all the people of Mellon, we enter 
1994--our 125th year in business--looking eagerly and confidently 
toward the future."

The Corporation's 1992 fourth quarter and full year results were 
affected favorably by the Corporation's tax position at that time. The 
Corporation returned to fully taxed status in 1993, as all remaining 
tax benefit carryforwards were exhausted in late 1992. Including tax 
benefits of $29 million, the Corporation's net income in the fourth 
quarter of 1992 was $105 million, or $1.62 per common share. For the 
full year 1992, the Corporation's net income and net income per common 
share, including tax benefits of $130 million, were $437 million and 
$6.96 per common share, respectively.

Fourth Quarter 1993

Compared with the fourth quarter of 1992, the Corporation's fourth 
quarter 1993 results reflected higher net interest revenue and fee 
revenue, as well as a lower provision for credit losses, offset in part 
by higher operating expense.

Net interest revenue for the quarter increased to $339 million, up
12 percent from $301 million in the fourth quarter of 1992. The 
increase was due primarily to The Boston Company and Meritor 
acquisitions. Fee revenue increased to $342 million, up 48 percent 
from $232 million in the prior-year period. The sharp increase in fee 
revenue was due primarily to the effect of The Boston Company 
acquisition.

Operating expense for the fourth quarter was $471 million, compared 
with $381 million in the prior-year period. The increase resulted 
primarily from the effect of The Boston Company acquisition and the 
December 1992 acquisition of Meritor Savings Bank, offset in part by a 
decrease in the net expense of acquired property. Operating expense in 
the fourth quarter 1992 included an $18 million restructuring charge 
related to the Meritor acquisition.

The provision for credit losses was $25 million in the fourth quarter 
of 1993, down from $35 million in the prior-year period. Net credit 
losses were $22 million, compared with $83 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1992. Nonperforming assets were $341 million at Dec. 31, 
1993, down $53 million, or 13 percent, from $394 million at Sept. 30, 
1993.

Annualized return on assets and return on common shareholders' equity 
were 1.26 percent and 14.62 percent, respectively, in the fourth 
quarter of 1993, compared with pro forma fully taxed returns on assets 
and common shareholders' equity of 1.00 percent and 12.41 percent, 
respectively, in the fourth quarter of 1992.

Full Year 1993

Compared with 1992, the Corporation's 1993 results reflected increases 
in net interest revenue and fee revenue, as well as a lower provision 
for credit losses, offset in part by higher operating expense and lower 
gains on the sale of securities.

Net interest revenue for the year increased to $1.307 billion, up
13 percent from $1.154 billion in 1992, principally reflecting The 
Boston Company and Meritor acquisitions. Fee revenue increased to 
$1.189 billion, up 41 percent from $844 million in 1992. The increase 
was due primarily to The Boston Company acquisition. Gains on the sale 
of securities were $87 million in 1993, compared with $121 million in 
1992.

Operating expense for 1993 was $1.858 billion, compared with $1.449 
billion in 1992. The increase was principally attributable to The 
Boston Company and Meritor acquisitions, including the $175 million 
restructuring expense related to The Boston Company acquisition.

The provision for credit losses was $125 million in 1993, down from 
$185 million in 1992. Net credit losses in 1993 were $139 million, 
compared with $277 million in 1992. The reserve as a percentage of 
nonperforming loans was 297 percent at Dec. 31, 1993, up from
152 percent at Dec. 31, 1992. Nonperforming assets totaled
$341 million at Dec. 31, 1993, down 43 percent from $595 million at 
Dec. 31, 1992.

Return on assets and return on common shareholders' equity in 1993, 
excluding the effect of the securities gains and the restructuring 
expense related to The Boston Company, were 1.21 percent and 14.06 
percent, respectively. These ratios compare with pro forma fully taxed 
return on assets and return on common shareholders' equity of 1.03 
percent and 13.58 percent, in 1992.

With assets of approximately $36 billion, Mellon Bank Corporation is a 
major bank holding company. Through its subsidiaries, it provides 
wholesale, middle market and retail banking, as well as numerous 
fee-based products including trust and investment, cash management and 
mortgage banking.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
- ------------------------

AFCO CREDIT CORPORATION ACQUISITION
- -----------------------------------

On December 21, 1993, the Corporation completed the acquisition of AFCO Credit
Corporation (AFCO) and CAFO, Inc., the insurance premium financing subsidiaries
of The Continental Corporation. The Corporation paid $100 million in cash at
closing, with a contingent payment over five years of up to $78 million based on
loan originations during the first five years after the purchase. AFCO is a
subsidiary of Mellon Bank, N.A. and CAFO is a subsidiary of Mellon Bank Canada. 
Goodwill and intangibles created by this acquisition totaled $60 million. AFCO
and CAFO's combined total assets at December 31, 1993 were $1.2 billion,
consisting almost entirely of collateralized commercial loans.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
</TABLE>
The 12% improvement in net interest revenue in the fourth quarter of 1993,
compared with the fourth quarter of 1992, primarily reflected a higher level of
interest-earning assets resulting from the second quarter 1993 acquisition of
The Boston Company and the December 1992 Meritor branch acquisition. A
reduction in nonperforming assets also contributed to the improved net interest
revenue compared with the prior-year period. Partially offsetting these positive
factors was the impact on net interest revenue and the net interest margin from
the reduction in higher-yielding securities that were sold in the first quarter
of 1993 as part of the financing plan and balance sheet restructuring related to
the acquisition of The Boston Company.

The improvement in net interest revenue in the full year of 1993 principally
resulted from the same factors responsible for the fourth quarter increase, as
well as the negative impact of a higher level of long term debt issued in
connection with The Boston Company acquisition.

(a) Excludes net credit losses on segregated assets.

Credit quality expense, defined as the provision for credit losses plus the net
expense of acquired property, was $34 million lower in the fourth quarter of
1993, compared with the prior-year period, reflecting continuing improvement in
the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the lower level of real estate
acquired. Net credit losses decreased $61 million compared with the fourth
quarter of 1992 primarily resulting from lower commercial real estate net credit
losses.

Credit quality expense was $184 million for the full year of 1993, down $96
million compared with the full year of 1992. Net credit losses in the full year
of 1993 were down by $138 million resulting from lower net credit losses in each
loan category, with commercial real estate net credit losses decreasing by $94
million.

</TABLE>

Fee revenue increased by $110 million, or 48%, in the fourth quarter of 1993,
compared with the fourth quarter of 1992, primarily reflecting $109 million of
fee revenue attributable to The Boston Company. Excluding the effect of all
acquisitions and divestitures and certain favorable one-time accrual adjustments
made in the fourth quarter of 1992, fee revenue increased 9% in the fourth
quarter of 1993, compared with the fourth quarter of 1992.

The $104 million improvement in trust and investment management fees in the
fourth quarter of 1993 resulted principally from $97 million of these fees
earned at The Boston Company. The $8 million decrease in cash management and
deposit transaction charges, compared with the fourth quarter of 1992, was the
result of a $13 million one-time accrual adjustment in the fourth quarter of
1992 partially offset by increased volume.

Information services fees decreased $4 million compared with the prior-year
period, primarily as a result of a $5 million one-time accrual adjustment in the
fourth quarter of 1992 as well as the Corporation's completed sale of two
information services businesses on December 1, 1993. The two businesses sold
generated monthly revenues of approximately $7 million.
Partially offsetting the decrease in information services fees was revenue

generated by a Canadian stock transfer company, the acquisition of which was
completed in the second quarter of 1993.

The increase in foreign currency and securities trading in the fourth quarter of
1993 was attributable to foreign exchange fees earned, primarily from global
custody customers, at The Boston Company.

Fee revenue in the full year of 1993 was up $345 million, or 41%, from the full
year of 1992, primarily reflecting $252 million of fee revenue attributable to
The Boston Company. Excluding the full year impact of all acquisitions and
divestitures and the fourth quarter 1992 one-time accrual adjustments, fee
revenue increased 11% compared with the full year of 1992. Gains on sales of
securities from the available for sale portfolio for the full year of 1993 were
$87 million. These sales were undertaken as part of the financing plan and
balance sheet restructuring related to the acquisition of The Boston Company.

Operating expense before the net expense of acquired property and restructuring
expense increased by $132 million, or 40%, in the fourth quarter of 1993,
compared with the fourth quarter of 1992. The increase was primarily the result
of $93 million of expense attributable to The Boston Company, as well as
expenses associated with the acquisition of the Meritor branches. In addition,
the fourth quarter of 1993 included nonrecurring expenses of approximately $13
million related to winding down certain data processing operations that were not
part of the fourth quarter sale.

The increase in average full-time equivalent staff level, compared with the
prior-year quarter, primarily reflected the addition of the employees of The
Boston Company and the Meritor branches. The acquisition of The Boston Company
contributed approximately 3,200 to the average full-time equivalent staff in the
fourth quarter of 1993.

Operating expense before the net expense of acquired property and restructuring
expense increased by $306 million in the full year of 1993 compared with the
prior-year period. The increase was primarily the result of $228 million of
expense attributable to The Boston Company, as well as expenses of the Meritor
branches.

A restructuring charge of $175 million pretax, or $112 million after-tax, was
recorded in the first quarter of 1993 to reflect management's estimate of
restructuring costs associated with the integration of The Boston
<PAGE>

Mellon Reports Earnings

Page 12

Company. This charge included estimates of additional loan loss reserve,
systems conversion costs, staff related expenses, legal and consulting
expenses and other restructuring charges. Restructuring expenses for the
full year of 1992 include $18 million related to the Corporation's fourth
quarter Meritor branch acquisition and $18 million recorded in the
third quarter related to the Corporation's expense reduction program.

INCOME TAXES
- ------------

The Corporation returned to a fully taxable status in 1993 as all remaining tax
benefit carryforwards were exhausted in late 1992. The provision for income
taxes totaled $239 million in the full year of 1993, for an effective tax rate
of approximately 40%, compared with $55 million in the full year of 1992. 
Without the availability of unrecognized tax benefits to offset federal income
taxes, the Corporation's provision for income taxes in the full year of 1992
would have been $185 million.

New tax legislation was enacted during the third quarter of 1993 that resulted
in a net benefit for the Corporation. As a result of this legislation, the
Corporation revalued its net federal deferred tax asset at the new statutory tax
rate and is permitted to deduct the amortization of certain intangibles. 
Primarily as a result of the deductibility of certain intangibles amortization,
the Corporation's fourth quarter effective tax rate of 38.5% was lower than the
full year rate of approximately 40%. It is currently anticipated that the
ongoing effective tax rate will be approximately 38.5%.

Nonperforming assets totaled $341 million at December 31, 1993, a decrease of
$53 million, or 13%, compared with September 30, 1993. Nonperforming commercial
real estate assets, which include nonperforming commercial real estate loans and
real estate acquired net of the reserve, decreased by $32 million during the
quarter primarily as a result of sales and repayments. Other domestic
nonperforming loans decreased by $14 million during the quarter, primarily as a
result of repayments and returns to accrual status.

Nonperforming assets decreased by $254 million, or 43%, compared with December
31, 1992, primarily due to the $200 million reduction in nonperforming
commercial real estate assets. These reductions resulted primarily from sales,
returns to accrual status and credit losses. Other domestic nonperforming loans
decreased $65 million in 1993 primarily due to repayments and credit losses. 
The $32 million increase in nonperforming consumer mortgages, compared with
December 31, 1992, primarily reflects additions from The Boston Company. The
$20 million decrease in other assets acquired resulted from asset sales and
write-downs.

(a) Assets acquired in the Meritor branch acquisition that are classified as
nonaccrual.

(b) Represents the FDIC loss sharing arrangement of 80% of the first $60
million of net credit losses and 95% of the remaining balance of segregated
assets. At December 31, 1993, the entire balance of segregated assets was
insured at the 95% rate as the $60 million credit loss threshold was met in
the first quarter of 1993. Total net credit losses on segregated assets,
before FDIC loss sharing, were $4 million and $97 million in the fourth
quarter and full year of 1993, respectively.

(c) This reserve is not included in the reserve for credit losses.

The $72 million decrease in segregated assets in 1993 resulted primarily from
credit losses, returns to accrual status and repayments.

</TABLE>
(a) Excludes reserve for segregated assets.

The ratio of reserve as a percentage of nonperforming loans continues to
indicate strong reserve coverage, increasing to 297% at December 31, 1993,
from 251% at September 30, 1993, and 152% at December 31, 1992. The increase in
the reserve at December 31, 1993, compared with September 30, 1993, is due, in
part, to $9 million of reserves acquired in the December 21, 1993, AFCO
acquisition.

(b) Estimated.
(c) The book value per common share assumes full conversion of the Series D
preferred stock to common stock. Accordingly, this includes the additional
paid-in capital on the Series D preferred stock because this paid-in
capital has no liquidation preference over the common stock.

The increase in the Corporation's common shareholders' equity in the fourth
quarter of 1993, compared with September 30, 1993, was primarily the result of
earnings retention, partially offset by the acquisition of treasury stock. The
decrease in total shareholders' equity in the fourth quarter of 1993, compared
with September 30, 1993, resulted from the redemption of the $68 million of
Series B preferred stock on December 1, 1993. The decrease in the Corporation's
capital ratios from September 30, 1993, primarily resulted from the impact of a
higher total asset level, including the goodwill and intangibles, following the
AFCO acquisition on December 21, 1993.

On November 16, 1993, the Corporation announced a 47% increase in its quarterly
common stock dividend, to $.56 per share, from $.38 per share. The increased
dividend is payable on February 15, 1994.
