ITEM 5. Other Events.

NYNEX Corporation (the "Company") had a net loss of $394.1 million, 
or ($.95) per share in 1993, compared with net income of 
$1,311.2 million, or $3.20 per share, in 1992.

The 1993 results include after-tax charges of $1.6 billion. 
$1.4 billion of these charges were for business restructuring, 
primarily related to efforts to redesign operations to improve 
efficiency and customer service, including consolidation of work 
locations and lease terminations, retraining employees, relocation 
expenses, systems re-engineering, and other incremental costs 
associated with work force reductions, including $700 million 
after-tax for severance and postretirement medical costs for 
employees leaving the Company through 1996. The Company expects to 
reduce its work force by approximately 16,800 employees by the end 
of 1996. Included in the after-tax charges is $121.7 million for 
the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, 
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", effective 
January 1, 1993, and $49 million for the reversal of deferred 
pension costs at New York Telephone Company, as ordered by the New 
York State Public Service Commission.

Operating revenues were $13,407.8 million for 1993, up 1.7 percent 
from $13,182.5 million for 1992. Operating expenses in 1993 were 
$13,074.5 million. Excluding the effect of business restructuring 
and other charges, operating expenses for 1993 increased 2.1 percent 
from 1992.

The Company's operating revenues and operating income by segment for 
the year ended December 31, 1993 are as follows:

There were 16,129,747 access lines in service at December 31, 1993, 
an increase of 2.7 percent over the same period last year. The 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges, which reflects the effect of the 
restructuring charges, was .42 for the year ended December 31, 1993.

On February 17, 1994, the Board of Directors of the Company approved 
a special pension enhancement to the NYNEX Management Pension 
Plan. Eligible management employees who choose to retire through 
December 31, 1996 will be credited with an additional six years 
toward their age and six years toward their length of service for 
the purpose of determining pension eligibility and benefits. This 
enhancement, which will be offered at different times through 1996 
according to local force requirements, is expected to help the 
Company reduce the management portion of its work force. Any 
additional charges related to the pension enhancement will be 
recorded through 1996 as employees choose to retire under the plan.
