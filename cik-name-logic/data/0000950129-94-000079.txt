FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NL ANNOUNCES 1993 RESULTS

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- February 9, 1994 -- NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE:NL) announced a
net loss for 1993 of $109.8 million, or $2.16 per share, on sales of $805
million compared to a net loss in 1992 of $76.4 million, or $1.50 per share, on
sales of $893 million. NL's net loss for the fourth quarter of 1993 was $49.6
million, or $.97 per share, on sales of $183 million compared to $17.3 million,
or $.34 per share, on sales of $199 million for the fourth quarter of 1992.
The 1993 fourth quarter results include an extraordinary loss of $27.8 million,
or $.55 per share, related to early extinguishment of debt, and a gain of $1.2
million, or $.02 per share, resulting from a change in the Company's method of
accounting for marketable securities. The full year 1992 results include
charges of $31.8 million, or $.62 per share, relating to accounting changes for
postretirement benefits and income taxes.

Operating income of Kronos' titanium dioxide pigments ("TiO2") business for
1993 declined $45.8 million compared with 1992 as the effects of continued
depressed TiO2 selling prices and lower production levels were only partially
offset by the reduction in start- up costs of Kronos' Louisiana plant, which
commenced production in March 1992. In October 1993, Kronos completed the
formation of the manufacturing joint venture with Tioxide Group Ltd. which owns
and operates the Louisiana plant previously owned by Kronos. The formation of
the joint venture resulted in an approximately 12% decrease in Kronos' total
attainable TiO2 production capacity; however, the remaining capacity is
approximately 10% higher than Kronos' 1993 sales volume.

Kronos' operating income in the fourth quarter of 1993 declined $16.6 million
as the effects of lower average prices in the fourth quarter of 1993 compared
with the 1992 period and lower production levels were only partially offset by
higher sales volume. Although Kronos' average selling prices in the fourth
quarter of 1993 were approximately 7% lower than the comparable 1992 period,
average selling prices in the fourth quarter of 1993 were approximately 3%
higher than in the third quarter of 1993 and average TiO2 prices at the end of
the year approximated 1993 average prices. The increase in fourth quarter
average selling prices reflects improved pricing in Europe partially offset by
slightly lower prices in North America.

Rheox's operating income for 1993 and the fourth quarter of 1993 was lower than
the comparable 1992 periods primarily as a result of unfavorable changes in
foreign exchange rates and slightly higher operating costs.

Interest and dividend income for the fourth quarter and full year 1993 declined
from the comparable 1992 periods due to lower funds available for investment.

Interest expense in 1993 and for the fourth quarter was lower than the
comparable 1992 periods as the effects of lower levels of indebtedness and
lower Deutsche mark interest rates were only partially offset by higher
interest rates on the Company's newly- issued $350 million Senior Notes.
Proceeds from the Senior Notes were used to pay down approximately $342 million
of the existing DM indebtedness, and the repayment terms of the remaining DM
indebtedness were extended. Interest expense in calendar 1992 reflected the
benefit of $8.5 million of capitalized interest related to the Louisiana plant.

Income tax expense differs from a normally expected rate primarily because of
losses in certain countries, including principally the U.S. and Germany, for
which no benefit is currently available.

NL Industries, Inc., a major international producer of titanium dioxide
pigments and specialty chemicals, is headquartered in Houston, Texas.
