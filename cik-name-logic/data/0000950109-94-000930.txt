DAUPHIN DEPOSIT TO ACQUIRE EASTERN MORTGAGE SERVICES

Harrisburg, PA, May 26, 1994...Dauphin Deposit Corporation announced 
today that it will acquire all of the stock of Eastern Mortgage Services, Inc.
(EMS), a closely held mortgage banking company headquartered in Trevose, 
Pennsylvania.

According to the definitive agreement, Dauphin will pay approximately $20
million in cash for EMS, subject to closing valuations and adjustments. The 
transaction is expected to close in early July, pending various state and 
regulatory approvals as well as approvals by investors for whom EMS services 
approximately $687,000,000 of first mortgage loans on residential property. 
EMS does no commercial mortgage lending.

EMS, primarily serving the eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey markets, 
originated $917,000,000 of first mortgages in 1993, of which 65% were 
purchase money mortgages. Its servicing portfolio grew by 73% last year.

shareholders, will continue in the position of CEO of EMS after the 
acquisition.

Mr. William J. King, chairman and chief executive officer of Dauphin, 
said, "We are pleased to add this quality mortgage banking company as Dauphin
continues to grow and expand. EMS will strengthen and strategically broaden 
Dauphin's mortgage operations, primarily into new markets contiguous to our 
trading area. EMS is in the right geography and a good size for us. We see 
many synergies from this combination, among them: investment opportunities in 
mortgages, an expanded geographic market area, lower cost of financing for EMS 
and improved information systems technologies."

Mr. Bank said, "We are excited by the opportunities that the new capital 
and technologies will bring to EMS. We believe this will enable us to expand 
our market share and our servicing portfolio. We also feel that this 
combination will allow us to broaden our product offering and market 
penetration while improving service to the Dauphin customer base."

Dauphin Deposit Corporation, headquartered in Harrisburg, PA, is the 
leading independent bank holding company in Central Pennsylvania and is the 
parent company of Dauphin Deposit Bank and Trust Company, which includes the
