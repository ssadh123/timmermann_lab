COMMERCIAL CREDIT COMPANY
Current Report on Form 8-K

Item 5. Other Events
------------

Commercial Credit Company (the "Registrant") has filed registration
statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission, registering debt
securities that the Registrant may issue from time to time. In order to
update the information incorporated by reference into those registration
statements the Registrant is including in this Current Report on Form 8-K the
following information regarding legal proceedings, which otherwise would be
filed as part of the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
second quarter of 1994, as well as certain information regarding the
Registrant's results of operations for the three-month and six-month periods
ended June 30, 1994.

In May and June 1994, three purported class action lawsuits were filed 
against the Company and its subsidiaries Commercial Credit Corporation, 
Voyager Guaranty Insurance Company and American Health and Life Insurance 
Company. Two of such actions, Erkins v. First Franklin Financial Corp., 
et al. and Lawrence v. Commercial Credit Corp., et al., were filed in the
Circuit Court, Jefferson County, Alabama. The third action, Princess Nobels 
v. Associates Corporation of North America, was filed in the U.S. District 
Court for the Middle District of Alabama. The suits allege, among other 
things, that the Company's subsidiaries charged excessive premiums on credit
life insurance, credit property insurance and nonfiling insurance, and that
as a result, the Company and its subsidiaries violated various federal and 
state laws and regulations. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, 
compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount. The Company 
believes it has meritorious defenses to these actions and intends to contest
the allegations.

Results of Operations
---------------------

The net income of Commercial Credit Company (the "Company") for the three
months and six months ended June 30, 1994 was $56.2 million and $108.8
million, respectively, compared to $62.7 million and $124.0 million,
respectively, in the corresponding 1993 periods. The Company's income before
income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles for the three months and six months ended June 30, 1994
was $91.8 million and $179.0 million, respectively, compared to $100.6
million and $214.5 million, respectively, in the corresponding 1993 periods. 
The Company's revenues for the three months and six months ended June 30,
1994 were $392.5 million and $776.8 million, respectively, compared to $378.8
million and $768.5 million, respectively, in the corresponding 1993 periods. 

Net income for the six months ended June 30, 1993 includes an after-tax
charge of $2.4 million related to a change in accounting for post-retirement
benefits (FAS No. 106) and an after-tax charge of $3.4 million related to a
change in accounting for postemployment benefits (FAS No. 112) adopted during
the fourth quarter of 1993 with retroactive application to January 1, 1993. 

At June 30, 1994 the Company had total debt consisting of savings accounts,
certificates and deposits of $70.3 million, short-term borrowings of $2,574.3
million and long-term debt of $3,726.0 million. In addition the Company's
total stockholder's equity at June 30, 1994 was $1,101.2.

<PAGE>

Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges
----------------------------------

The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the six months ended
June 30, 1994 was 1.86. This ratio has been computed by dividing earnings
available for fixed charges by fixed charges. For the purpose of this ratio
earnings available for fixed charges consist of pre-tax income from
continuing operations adjusted for undistributed equity earnings and minority
interest and fixed charges; and fixed charges consist of interest expense and
that portion of rentals deemed representative of the appropriate interest
factor.
