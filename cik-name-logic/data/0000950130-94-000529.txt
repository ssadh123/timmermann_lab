6-3/8% NOTE DUE MARCH 30, 1999

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company,
issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of April 1, 1983, as
amended and restated (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and
Chemical Bank (successor by merger to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company),
Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee
under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto
reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights thereunder of
the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and the terms upon
which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.

The Notes are not subject to redemption by the Company prior to maturity.

If an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the
Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of 66-2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the
Securities at the time Outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, of each series
affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders
of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each
series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of
each series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the
Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.
Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and
binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any
Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or
in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon
this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the
Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute
and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note, at the
time, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth
therein and on the face hereof, the transfer of this Note may be registered on
the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Note for
registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough
of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed
by, the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and
thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same
aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. As provided in the
Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein and on the face
hereof, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of
Notes in authorized denominations as requested by the Holder surrendering the
same. If (x) any Depository is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as
Depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the Company within 60
days, (y) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order to
the effect that this Note shall be exchangeable or (z) an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes, this Note shall be
exchangeable for Notes in definitive form of like tenor and of an equal
aggregate principal amount, in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples
thereof. Such definitive Notes shall be registered in such name or names as the
Depository shall instruct the Trustee. If definitive Notes are so delivered,
the Company may make such changes to the form of this Note as are necessary or
appropriate to allow for the issuance of such definitive Notes.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the
Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the
Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the
Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have
the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.
World Financial Center

New York, New York 10281-1220

Gentlemen:

As your counsel, we have examined a copy of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (hereinafter called the
"Company"), certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. We
are familiar with the corporate proceedings had in connection with the proposed
issuance and sale by the Company to the Underwriters named in the Terms
Agreement referred to below, pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated January
14, 1994 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, Merrill Lynch & Co.,
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and the other
firms named therein, as supplemented by the Terms Agreement dated March 15, 1994
(the "Terms Agreement") among the Company, MLPF&S, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, Kidder, Peabody & Co.
Incorporated, PaineWebber Incorporated, Prudential Securities Incorporated and
<PAGE>

Salomon Brothers Inc, of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the
Company's 6-3/8% Notes due March 30, 1999 (the "Notes"). We have also examined
a copy of the Indenture between the Company and Chemical Bank (successor by
merger to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company), as Trustee, dated as of April 1,
1983, as amended and restated (the "Indenture"), and the Company's Registration
Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 33-51489) relating to the Notes (the
"Registration Statement").

Based upon the foregoing and upon such further investigation as we deemed
relevant in the premises, we are of the opinion that:

1. The Company has been duly incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware.

2. The Notes have been duly and validly authorized by the Company and when
the Notes have been duly executed and authenticated in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor as set forth in the
Underwriting Agreement, as supplemented by the Terms Agreement, the Notes will
constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company in accordance
with their terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws relating to or affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights or by general equity principles.

We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration
Statement and as an exhibit to the Current Report of the Company on Form 8-K
dated March 30, 1994.
Very truly yours,
