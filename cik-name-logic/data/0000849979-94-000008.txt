Item 5. OTHER EVENTS

A fire occurred on April 6, 1994 in the Registrant's
Strip Steel Department causing extensive damage to the No. 9 Tandem
Mill, a cold rolling facility. The fire, however, was confined to
the top level of the mill, and as such, it appears the basement,
oil cellars, and computer room were not affected. Ten people
suffered minor injuries. No other facilities sustained damage
impairing their continued operation.

The Registrant has determined to rebuild the Tandem Mill
as quickly as possible. All electrical work and piping will need
to be replaced. The finishing stands did not appear to suffer
damage. Roof dismantling and replacement began April 10, 1994. 
The No. 9 Tandem was custom built in 1975; accordingly, some
replacement parts may not be readily available and may need to be
manufactured. An estimate is not currently available on the length
of time the No. 9 Tandem will be out of operation. 

The No. 9 Tandem supplied steel coils to the Registrant's
tin mill for further processing. In order to adjust the production
of remaining units, the Registrant's No. 7 and No. 8 Tandem Mills
will run additional turns to handle cold rolling with the No. 7
Tandem running tin plate and the No. 8 Tandem running sheet
products. With the No. 9 Tandem offline, the Registrant estimates
approximately 20% of its production may be affected. 

Reflecting the need for reduced manpower, layoffs of
hourly workers began on April 10, 1994, with 241 workers affected. 
The Registrant expects to review its manpower situation on a weekly
basis and make adjustments accordingly. 

The Registrant's accident investigation committee and
OSHA have not yet released reports on the incident. The Registrant
maintains insurance coverage for both property damage and business
interruption. No estimates have yet been completed on any
insurance claims or the cost of reconstructing the facility.
