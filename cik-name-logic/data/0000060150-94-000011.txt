DALLAS--March 22, 1994--Lomas Financial Corporation (NYSE: LFC)
today stated that it has retained Salomon Brothers Inc to assist Lomas
in evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder values.
The Company is considering various options, including the possibility
of merging with or being acquired by another institution. Salomon's
engagement was primarily in response to several recent expressions of
interest by third parties.
Jess Hay, chairman and chief executive officer of Lomas, said,
"Although the board of directors believes that Lomas has excellent
potential for creating value for its stockholders as an independent
company, we feel the current situation in our industry provides unique
additional possibilities for growth. While Lomas has demonstrated that
it is capable of maintaining the size of its portfolio in the face of
unprecedented high prepayment rates, it nevertheless is true that with
additional capital resources our mortgage and computer businesses
would flourish, thereby potentially increasing value for our
stockholders and concurrently serving the best interests of our
operating businesses, our customers and our employees. What we are
doing is making sure that all such possibilities are explored."
Mr. Hay continued, "We have built an outstanding organization,
with some of the finest people and systems in our industry. Regardless
of which direction we ultimately take, we are very optimistic about
Lomas' future, particularly as the mortgage banking industry appears
to be moving toward a more stable environment in terms of portfolio
runoff rates and mortgage refinancings."
