Form 8-K New York Telephone Company
February 17, 1994

Item 5. Other Events

On February 17, 1994, the Board of Directors of NYNEX Corporation 
approved a special pension enhancement to the NYNEX Management 
Pension Plan. Eligible management employees who choose to retire 
through December 31, 1996 will be credited with an additional six 
years toward their age and six years toward their length of service 
for the purpose of determining pension eligibility and benefits. 
This enhancement, which will be offered at different times through 
1996 according to local force requirements, is expected to help 
New York Telephone Company (the "Company") reduce the management 
portion of its work force.

As previously reported (see the Company's Current Report on 
Form 8-K, date of report January 24, 1994), the Company recorded 
after-tax business restructuring and other charges of $806.0 million 
in the fourth quarter of 1993, including $362 million after-tax for 
severance and post-retirement medical costs for employees leaving 
the Company through 1996. The Company expects to reduce its work 
force by approximately 9,000 employees by the end of 1996. Any 
additional charges related to the pension enhancement will be 
recorded through 1996 as employees choose to retire under the plan.
