COMSAT REPORTS RECORD REVENUES FOR 2ND Q UARTER,
INCREASES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND

BETHESDA, Md. -- COMSAT Corporation today reported record
second quarter 1994 revenues of $207.9 million, including $4.8
million in proceeds from the settlement of business-interruption
insurance claims. Second quarter net income was $21.6 million,
or 46 cents per share, compared to $23.1 million, or 49 cents per
share, for the second quarter of 1993 as restated. Earnings for
second quarter 1994 reflect transaction costs associated with the
merger of Radiation Systems, Inc. of $4.1 million after tax or
eight cents per share.

"Our second quarter results show that we're regaining momentum
after a relatively slow first quarter," said Bruce L. Crockett,
president and CEO of COMSAT Corporation. "We've strengthened our
business by creating COMSAT RSI through completion of the
Radiation Systems merger, and we're seeing a huge increase in our
On Command Video (OCV) business. We remain committed to pursuing
double-digit growth in earnings over restated 1993 results, but
the combination of our performance year-to-date and the merger's
impact on the number of outstanding shares lead us to believe
that actual results may be slightly below that goal."

In the Entertainment segment, COMSAT Video Enterprises revenues
grew 44 percent to $38.5 million in the second quarter compared
to $26.8 million a year ago. Operating income increased more
than eight-fold, from $0.5 million a year ago to $4.7 million --
largely due to increased OCV

installations and the success of the NBA Denver Nuggets
franchise. The total number of installed and backlog hotel rooms
for the OCV service reached 335,000 in the second quarter,
compared to 125,000 for the same period a year ago.

Revenues in the International Communications segment, which
includes COMSAT World Systems (CWS) and COMSAT International
Ventures (CIV), were $63.9 million, or about the same as a year
ago. Increased revenues in CIV were offset by CWS rate cuts
instituted last year. Operating income was down four percent to
$24.3 million -- due to operating losses from new ventures, the
results of the rate cuts, and increased depreciation costs offset
by adjustments associated with INTELSAT's pension plans.

COMSAT Mobile Communications revenues fell slightly to $46.1
million from $47.2 million a year earlier due to rate cuts
instituted last year and a small drop in analog traffic. With
commissioned digital terminals exceeding 2,100, digital traffic
grew 35 percent over last quarter. Operating income was off 17
percent to $9.7 million from $11.7 million a year earlier due to
the decrease in revenues, increased depreciation costs and a
lower share of Inmarsat system revenues.

In the Technology Services segment, which includes COMSAT RSI
and COMSAT Laboratories, revenues in the second quarter were
$61.6 million, compared to $51.3 million for the same period a
year earlier. Without business-interruption insurance proceeds
of $4.8 million in second quarter 1994 and $1.3 million in second
quarter 1993, revenues grew by 13 percent. Operating income was
$4.1 million, the same as a year ago. Excluding $4.3 million in

transaction and integration costs associated with the merger of
Radiation Systems, Inc., and the business-interruption insurance
proceeds, operating income grew $0.7 million over the second
quarter of 1993. The business-interruption insurance proceeds
cover revenue losses resulting from tornado damage to a COMSAT
RSI plant in Florida in 1992.

In other business, the Board of Directors increased the regular
quarterly dividend to 19.5 cents per share, an increase of five
percent, or one cent, payable September 12, 1994, to shareholders
of record August 12, 1994. This is the 96th consecutive
quarterly dividend declared by the corporation.
