IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Corning Incorporated Reports

Second-Quarter Income of $111.4 Million

CORNING, N.Y., June 28 - Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW)

reported today that its 1994 second-quarter net income totaled

$111.4 million, or $0.54 per share, a 14 percent rise over the

second quarter of 1993.

Second quarter sales amounted to $1.1 billion, up 22

percent from the prior year. Approximately half of the sales

increase was due to recent acquisitions, including Damon

Corporation in 1993. Consistent with the first quarter, sales

growth was led by businesses in the company's strongest growth

markets: communications, environment and life sciences.

Equity company results rose 24 percent to $34.0 million,

due primarily to continued improvement from operations at Dow

Corning Corporation and to the elimination of losses from Vitro 

Corning, S.A., which was divested in late 1993.

Board Chairman James R. Houghton said he attributes the

good results to the "combination of a strengthened U. S.

economy which is having a positive impact on all major

businesses, Corning's position in three major growth markets,

and the benefits of ongoing cost-reduction efforts. We

believe this solid broad-based performance will enable us to meet our

financial objectives for the year."

Corning Incorporated is a Fortune 200 company which

reports its financial results in four segments: specialty

materials, communications, laboratory services and consumer

products. For 1993 revenues totaled $4 billion.

Corning Incorporated and Subsidiary Companies
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Quarter 2, 1994

(1) Earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income
less dividends on preferred stock by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. The weighted
average shares outstanding (in thousands) for the second quarter
were 206,268 and 189,776 for 1994 and 1993, respectively, and for
the first half were 204,286 and 189,699 for 1994 and 1993,
respectively. Preferred dividends of $0.5 million and $1.0
million were declared in the second quarter and first half of
1994, respectively, compared with $0.6 million and $1.1 million in
the same periods of 1993.

(2) Depreciation and amortization charged to operations for the
twenty-four weeks ended June 19, 1994, and June 20, 1993, totaled
$154.9 million and $127.4 million, respectively.

(3) In April 1994, Corning sold its Damon clinical laboratory
testing operations in California to Physicians Clinical
Laboratory, Inc., for approximately $51 million in cash. No gain
or loss was recognized as a result of this transaction. The
proceeds from this transaction were used to retire a portion of
the debt incurred in conjunction with the Damon acquisition in
August 1993.

(4) In May 1994, Corning sold its Parkersburg, W.Va., glass-tubing
products plant to Schott Corporation, a subsidiary of the Schott
Group, for $57 million and decided to exit several minor product
lines in the specialty materials segment. The net gain from these
transactions is not material.

(5) In May 1994, Corning and International Technology Corporation
signed a definitive agreement to create a jointly owned company to
provide environmental testing and related services. Under the
terms of the agreement, Corning will transfer the net assets of
its environmental testing laboratory business to the new company
and International Technology will transfer the assets of its IT
Analytical Services business to the new company. As a result of
the transaction, Corning and International Technology will each
own 50 percent of the company. The transaction is expected to
close in the third quarter of 1994. Corning will account for its
investment in the new company using the equity method of
accounting for investments.

(6) In June 1994, Corning acquired all of the outstanding shares
of Maryland Medical Laboratories Inc. and several affiliates for
approximately 4.5 million shares of Corning common stock in a
pooling of interests transaction. Corning's consolidated
financial statements have not been restated because the
acquisition is not material to Corning's financial position or
results of operations.

(7) In June 1994, Corning signed a definitive agreement to acquire
all of the outstanding shares of Nichols Institute in a
transaction to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. Under
terms of the agreement, Corning will exchange newly issued shares
with a value equal to $13 for each Nichols share. The transaction
is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the
second half of 1994. Corning's consolidated financial statements
will not be restated because the acquisition is not material to
Corning's financial position or results of operations.

Non-operating gains and losses

(8)During the first quarter of 1993, Corning recognized a non-
operating gain totaling $4.2 million ($2.6 million after tax).
