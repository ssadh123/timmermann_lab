CHEMICAL COMPLETES OFFER FOR MARGARETTEN

New York, July 1-- Chemical Bank, National Association announced today
that its wholly-owned subsidiary has completed its tender offer for all of 
the outstanding common stock and any and all of the depositary shares 
representing the preferred stock of Margaretten Financial Corporation and 
that all shares that were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the 
expiration of the offer were accepted for payment, with such payment
to be made as promptly as practicable.

As of 12:00 midnight on June 30, 1994, when the offer expired, 
approximately 13,121,070 shares of common stock and 1,522,317 depositary 
shares representing the preferred stock of Margaretten had been tendered 
and not withdrawn, representing approximately 99% and 95% of outstanding 
common shares and depositary shares, respectively.

Shares of common stock and depositary shares not tendered to Chemical in
the tender offer will be converted to cash through a merger. Based on the 
number of shares of common stock and depositary shares tendered, Chemical 
said that it intends to effect such merger later this month by means of a 
"short form" merger under Delaware law, which permits such merger to be 
effected without shareholder approval.
