INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors 
Arvig Telcom, Inc.
Pequot Lakes, Minnesota 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Arvig
Telcom, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for the three years in the period ended December 31, 1992. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of certain
consolidated subsidiaries which statements reflect total assets of
$17,292,330 and $16,855,506 as of December 31, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, and total revenues of $24,212,075 for 1992, $15,951,992 for
1991, and $10,293,488 for 1990. Those statements were audited by other
auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar
as it relates to the amounts included for those consolidated subsidiaries,
is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of the other auditors,
the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Arvig Telcom, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1992, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

ARVIG TELCOM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. Description of Business - Arvig Telcom, Inc. owns and operates two
independent telecommunications companies, Arvig Telephone Company and
Bridge Water Telephone Company; one inter-exchange telecommunications
carrier, U.S. Link, Inc; one cable television company, Interlakes Cable
Vision, Inc.; one cellular telephone investing company, Arvig Cellular,
Inc.; and two support service companies, North Country Data, Ltd. and
Velstar Systems, Inc. In addition, U.S. Link, Inc. owns another inter-
exchange telecommunications carrier, ABT Long Distance Service and Arvig
Telephone Company owns a finance support company, Arvig Finance, Inc.

B. Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles including certain accounting
practices prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and
the state regulatory commission in Minnesota.

C. Cash Equivalents - For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the
Company considers all temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.
These temporary cash investments are highly liquid debt securities held
for cash management purposes that have insignificant risk of changes in
value. Temporary cash investments at December 31, 1992 and 1991 totaled
$1,175,674 and $446,994, respectively.

D. Property and Depreciation - Property and equipment are recorded at
original cost. Additions, improvements or major renewals are capitalized.
If telecommunication or cable television plant assets are sold, retired or
otherwise disposed of, the cost plus removal costs less salvage, is
charged to accumulated depreciation. Any gains or losses on other
property retirements are reflected in the current year operations.

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated
service or remaining useful lives. Depreciation expense was $3,545,760 in
1992, $3,735,961 in 1991, and $3,663,936 in 1990. During 1990, the
Company reduced the life for certain central office equipment in order to
depreciate the remaining balance of the central office equipment by
December 31, 1991. This resulted in $537,000 of additional depreciation
expense in 1991 and 1990. Composite depreciation rates are as follows:

1992 1991 1990
------- ------ ------
Telecommunications Plant 7.0% 8.5% 8.2%
Cable Television Plant 7.3 7.4 6.6
Other Property 17.5 13.1 10.6

E. Inventories - Materials and supplies are recorded at average cost.
Merchandise for resale inventories are recorded at the lower of average
first-in, first-out cost or market. Inventories consisted of the
following:
1992 1991
-------- ---------

Materials and Supplies $ 91,752 $159,445
Merchandise for Resale 253,520 288,645
-------- ---------

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

F. Investments - Cellular partnerships and the investment in Northern
Fiber, Inc. are recorded on the equity method of accounting, which
reflects original cost and recognition of the Company's share of income or
losses from the investments. Other investments are recorded at cost which
approximates market value. 

G. Revenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized when earned. Telephone
network access and long-distance services are furnished jointly with other
companies. Local exchange companies access charges are billed to long
distance toll carriers based on interstate tariffs filed with the FCC by
the National Exchange Carrier Association, and state tariffs filed with
the state regulatory body. Access charge revenues and settlements are
based on cost studies and on average schedules. Revenues based on cost
studies are estimated pending finalization of the studies.

H. Income Taxes and Investment Credit - Income taxes are provided based on
income reported in the financial statements. Deferred income taxes are
provided to reflect the effect of the recognition of revenue and expense
in different periods for financial and tax reporting purposes. Investment
tax credits have been deferred and reduce income tax expense over the
estimated service lives of the related assets.

I. Intangible Assets - The Company is amortizing intangible assets using
the following periods:

Noncompete Covenants 3-5 Years
Excess of Cost Over Net Assets

NOTE 7 - NOTES PAYABLE

The Company has a sixty-month revolving line of credit from the RTFC which
enables the Company to borrow up to $900,000. The obligations on the line
are unsecured and require quarterly interest payments at the prevailing
bank prime rate plus 1.5%. The agreement also requires that the loan
balances be reduced to zero for at least five consecutive business days at
least once a year. There have been no borrowings on this line of credit.

In 1991 and part of 1992, the Company had another line of credit with
identical terms for $3,500,000. The Company had borrowed $2,000,000
against this line of credit, and in 1992 it refinanced the $2,000,000 with
the RTFC mortgage note discussed in Note 6. At that time, this line of
credit was terminated. 

The Company had an unsecured note payable to Alexandria Long Distance
Company due in variable monthly payments until December 31, 1992. The
balance as of December 31, 1992 and 1991 was $-0- and $59,374.

NOTE 8 - EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering employees who meet
certain age and service requirements. The benefits are based upon years

NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES AND INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS

Differing depreciation methods used for financial statement reporting and
income tax reporting result in timing differences between income reported
for tax and financial statement purposes. Other timing differences are
created by differing tax and financial statement treatment of deferred
retirements, interest charged to construction, cellular partnership
losses, and certain expense accruals.

The provision for income tax expense consists of the following:

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109 "Accounting for
Income Taxes", effective in 1993, amends the income tax accounting rules.
Under existing rules, deferred income taxes are provided at the tax rates
in effect for the year in which timing differences originate and are not
adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates. The new standard, however,
will require that deferred income tax balances be adjusted for changes in
the income tax rates. The adoption of Statement No. 109 will not have a
material effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

ARVIG TELCOM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. The consolidated financial statements included herein have
been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have
been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although the Company believes that the
disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. It is suggested that these consolidated financial
statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto included in the
Company's latest annual report.

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring
items) necessary to present fairly the financial position as
of September 30, 1993, and the results of operations and cash
flows for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 and 1992.
The results of operations for the nine months ended September
30, 1993 and 1992, are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.

2. Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). SFAS 109 requires companies to record
all deferred tax liabilities or assets for the deferred tax
consequences of all temporary differences. Additionally, the
statement requires that deferred tax balances be adjusted to
reflect new tax rates when they are enacted into law. The
cumulative effect of the implementation of SFAS 109 on years
prior to 1993 is estimated to have no material effect on net
income. Income tax expense for 1993 reflects the new method
of accounting; income tax expense for 1992 has not been
restated. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109 did not
materially effect net income or income tax expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 1993.

3. On December 14, 1993, Telephone and Data Systems, Inc., an
Iowa corporation (TDS), Arvig Acquisition Corp., a Minnesota
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of TDS (TDS Sub.) and
Arvig Telcom, Inc. signed an agreement and plan of merger
providing for the merger of the TDS Sub into the Company,
which would result in the Company becoming a wholly-owned
subsidiary of TDS. The agreement and plan of merger includes
certain closing conditions precedent to consummation of the
transaction.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To The Board of Directors 
Vernon Telephone Company, Inc.
P.O. Box 900, 1 Curtis Road
Vernon, New York 13476

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vernon
Telephone Company, Inc. as of June 30, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for
the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards and the Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller
General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

At the present time, the Company does not have continuing property records
for their telephone plant in service and the related studies of
depreciation reserves. When these records are available it will then be
possible to determine if any major changes should be made to the net
carrying value of such telephone plant, as explained in Note 2 of the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, except for any adjustment to the net carrying value of
telephone plant in service as discussed in the preceding paragraph, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Vernon Telephone Company,
Inc. at June 30, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
-------------------------------------------

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
-------------------------------------------

General

The Company maintains its accounts in accordance with the Uniform
Systems of Accounts prescribed for telephone companies by the New
York State Public Service Commission (PSC). The accounting policies
conform to generally accepted accounting principles as applied to New
York State public utilities giving effect to the rate making and
accounting practices and policies of the PSC. A summary of
significant accounting policies is described in this note.

Consolidation
--------------

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned, non-regulated subsidiary, Vernon
Cellular, Inc. This subsidiary was sold on April 15, 1993 and the
results of its operations is included in these financial statements
up to that date. All material intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Material and Supplies Inventory
-------------------------------

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the moving weighted average method.

Property, Plant and Equipment
-----------------------------

Property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred;
expenditures that extend an asset's life are capitalized. Upon
retirement of telephone plant, the cost is removed from the asset
account and the accumulated depreciation reserve. Cost of removal of
telephone plant, net of salvage, is charged to the accumulated
depreciation reserve.

Depreciation
------------

Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Total depreciation charged to operations for the years ended June 30,
1993 and 1992 amounted to $249,794 and $275,531, respectively.
Depreciation rates were changed on certain categories of plant
effective January 1, 1993, resulting in a decrease in annual accruals
of approximately $26,000.

Capitalization of Certain Expenses
----------------------------------

The Company has consistently followed the practice of capitalizing
certain costs related to construction, including pension, payroll,
payroll related costs and significant costs of capital incurred
during construction.

Federal Income Tax
------------------

The Company uses the normalization method of accounting for
federal income tax reductions resulting from timing differences in
the recognition of certain income and expenses for tax and book
purposes. These differences result mainly from accelerated
depreciation.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
VERNON TELEPHONE COMPANY, INC.
-------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
-------------------------------------------

Excess deferrals resulting from the reduction in tax rates due to
TRA-86 are to be normalized and will be amortized over the remaining
life of the asset generating the deferral at an average deferral
rate. This will result in these excess deferrals being taken into
income as timing differences are reversed.

Investment tax credits have been normalized and are being amortized
to income over the average life of the related telephone plant and
other equipment.

Toll Settlements
----------------

Toll and access revenues are often pooled by telephone companies on
a national and a state wide basis and are apportioned back to the
companies based upon cost to provide services. This process is known
as "toll settlements".

The computations are very complex, and on a routine basis these
toll settlement are adjusted for previous quarters and years. When
calculations are changed, the companies are notified of a
"retroactive" toll settlement (plus or minus) which applies to
previously reported periods. Retroactive toll settlements may have a
material effect on current net income.

It is industry practice to record retroactive toll settlements in
the years discovered rather than restating previous year's net
income. There are no known material unrecorded retroactive toll
settlements as of the balance sheet date.

Reserve for Uncollectibles
--------------------------

The Company uses the reserve method to record the write-off of
uncollectibles. The reserve balance is determined principally by an
analysis of prior years net write-offs. The balances as of June 30,
1993 and 1992 were $26,047 and $15,237, respectively.

2. TELEPHONE PLANT IN SERVICE
--------------------------

The Telephone plant in service is stated at values reflected per
the Company's books, which is principally cost. The Company
presently does not have continuing property records and related
depreciation reserve studies which may affect the net carrying value
of telephone plant in service. When the records are available, the
Company intends to report any material adjustments resulting
therefrom as either a prior period adjustment of retained earnings,
or, if permitted by the New York State Public Service Commission, as
an adjustment of depreciation charges to future operations.
The telephone plant in service at June 30, 1993 and 1992 is as
follows:

1993 1992
--------------- ------------

Land and buildings $ 446,644 $ 444,652
Central office equipment 1,340,646 1,422,937

3. LONG-TERM DEBT
--------------

At June 30, 1993, the Company had outstanding first mortgage notes
under an agreement with the Rural Electrification Administration (REA)
and the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) as follows:

Rural Electrification Administration
------------------------------------

5% note due March 25, 2011, requiring quarterly
principal and interest payments of $28,275 $ 1,403,264

5% note due March 25, 2011, requiring monthly
principal and interest payments of $2,249 $ 890,944

principal and interest payments of $6,064 230,245
------------
$ 1,933,718

Less: Current Maturities (61,916)
------------
Total Long-Term Debt $ 1,871,802
============

Quarterly payments of principal and interest are paid currently on
the above advanced funds. Principal payments for the 12 month periods
ending June 30 on the above advanced funds over the next five years are
as follows:

1994 61,916
1995 65,263
1996 68,795
1997 72,525
1998 76,463

These mortgage notes are collateralized by all of the telephone
plant.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
VERNON TELEPHONE COMPANY, INC.
-------------------------------
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
-------------------------------------------

The first mortgage agreement contains certain restrictions on
dividends and stock redemptions. All requirements were compiled with
at June 30, 1993, and under the most restrictive of such agreements,
none of the retained earnings at that date were available for
dividends.

4. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
------------------

The provision for federal income taxes for the years ended June 30,
1993 and 1992 consisted of amortization of deferred investment tax
credits of $4,492 for both years. There was no other operating federal
income tax expense recorded due to the operating losses for both years.

Deferred federal income taxes have been provided on the gain on the
sale of the Company's subsidiary. This deferral amounts to $2,056,079
and it will reverse when the stock the company received is sold or
otherwise disposed of. This amount has been netted against the gain on
the sale.

The Company has a net operating loss carryforward as of December 31,
1992 of $225,634 available for 1993 and future years. If not used, the
carryovers will expire at December 31 of the following years:

2004 $ 2,467 2006 $108,685
2005 109,947 2007 4,535

There are also investment tax credit carryforwards as of December 31,
1992 amounting to $42,742. These will begin to expire in 1996, if not
used up to that date.

5. NOTES PAYABLE

The Company has a note payable in the amount of $361,923 with Siemans
Stromberg-Carlson as of June 30, 1993. This is a demand note bearing
interest at 2.5% above the three month London Interbank Offered Rate
("LIBOR"). It is payable within 180 days upon demand or until such
demand, at $2,195 a month including interest. The interest rate at
June 30, 1993 was 5.875% and the note is secured by certain machinery
and equipment of the Company.

The Company also has a note payable in the amount of $150,000 with
Oneida Savings Bank. This is a 30 day note maturing on July 15, 1993.
The interest rate at June 30, 1993 was 8% and the note is secured by
shares of stock held by the principal stockholder.

6. CASH FLOW STATEMENT
-------------------

The Company considers all checking and savings accounts and liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to
be "cash equivalents". The following is a list of interest and federal
income tax payments for the years ending June 30, 1993 and 1992:

1993 1992
------------ --------------

Interest $ 125,101 $131,181
Federal Income Taxes -- --

7. PREFERRED STOCK

8. PENSION PLAN
-------------

The Company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
covering substantially all employees. The funding policy of this
trusteed plan is currently to invest in Government and Corporate
Bonds, Loans and Insurance Policies. The pension plan year end is
December 31.

The Company records as net pension cost its required funding
contribution to the plan for the year. Net pension cost for the plan
for the years ending June 30, 1993 and 1992 amounted to $48,162 and
$59,853, respectively. This is the amount of pension expense used for
rate making purposes, as required by the New York State Public Service
Commission.

Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require pension
costs for defined benefit plans to be determined in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87 (SFAS 87). Due to
the New York State Public Service Commission's position and Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, the Company has not adopted
SFAS 87. Had pension expense been determined in accordance with SFAS
87, it would not have varied materially from the amount recorded on the

10. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD YET TO BE ADOPTED
------------------------------------------------------

Accounting for Income Taxes under SFAS No. 109
----------------------------------------------

Accounting For Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109) was issued in February,
1992 and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1992. This statement supersedes SFAS No. 96 and subsequent
pronouncements dealing with this issue and it generally provides for
a liability approach towards accounting for income taxes. It will
require certain reclassifications and accounting for income taxes.
It will require certain assets and liabilities to reflect the impact
of the establishment of certain assets and liabilities to reflect the
impact of regulatory requirements. This change in accounting will
not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.

11. GAIN ON SALE OF SUBSIDIARY
--------------------------

The Company sold its investment in its wholly-owned subsidiary,

with Vernon Telephone Company, Inc. receiving 162,726 shares of
Rochester Telephone Corporation common stock. New York State taxes
are currently due, while Federal income taxes are due upon the future
sale or other disposition of the stock. The gain recorded is net of
the provision for New York State taxes of $295,712 and deferred
Federal income taxes of $2,056,079.

12. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
----------------

Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company settled a lawsuit
that had been pending concerning a prior proposed sale of the
Company's interest in its cellular investment. An agreement was
reached whereby the Company will receive approximately $360,000 to
settle this suit and there will be no further action in this claim.
This will be recorded in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1994.

13. NONCASH INVESTING AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS
