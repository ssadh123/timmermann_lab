Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On April 29, 1994, the Registrant acquired DFC Holding
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("DFC"), and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, The Delfield Company ("Delfield"), and Whitlenge
Acquisition Limited ("WAL"), a private company limited by shares
registered in England, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Whitlenge
Drink Equipment Limited ("Whitlenge"). DFC and WAL were formerly
controlled by Onex Corporation, an Ontario corporation, and EJJM, an
Ohio limited partnership of which the sole managing general partner is
Matthew O. Diggs, Jr. 

The acquisitions took place pursuant to the terms and
conditions of (i) a Merger Agreement, dated as of January 11, 1994, as
amended by the First Amendment thereto, dated March 17, 1994 (the
"Merger Agreement"), among the Registrant, Scotsman Acquisition
Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant, DFC,
Delfield, Onex Corporation, Onex DHC LLC, Pacific Mutual Life

Insurance Company, PM Group Life Insurance Co., EJJM, Matthew O.
Diggs, Jr., Timothy C. Collins, W. Joseph Manifold, Charles R.
McCollom, Anita J. Moffatt Trust, Anita J. Moffatt, Remo Panella,
Teddy F. Reed, Robert L. Schafer, Graham E. Tillotson, John A. Tilmann
Trust, John A. Tilmann, Kevin E. McCrone, Michael P. McCrone, Ronald
A. Anderson, and Continental Bank, N.A., providing for the merger (the
"Merger") of Scotsman Acquisition Corporation with and into DFC, and
(ii) a Share Acquisition Agreement, dated as of January 11, 1994, as
amended by the First Amendment thereto, dated March 17, 1994 (the
"Share Acquisition Agreement"), among the Registrant, WAL, Whitlenge,
Onex Corporation, Onex U.S. Investments, EJJM, Matthew O. Diggs, Jr.,
Timothy C. Collins, Graham F. Cook, Christopher R.L. Wheeler, Michael
de St. Paer and John Rushton, providing for the acquisition (the
"Share Acquisition") by Scotsman Drink Limited, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Registrant, of all of the outstanding capital stock
of WAL. The consideration paid for all of the outstanding capital
stock of DFC and WAL in the Merger and the Share Acquisition consisted
of (i) $30.4 million in cash, (ii) 1,200,000 shares of common stock of
the Registrant, and (iii) 2,000,000 shares of Series A $0.62
cumulative convertible preferred stock of the Registrant, with an
aggregate liquidation preference of $22.5 million and which are
convertible, at the initial conversion rate, into 1,525,400 shares of
common stock of the Registrant. 

The amount of the consideration paid was determined on the

basis of negotiations between the Registrant, Onex Corporation and the
former shareholders of DFC and WAL. Funds for the cash portion of the
consideration paid in the Merger and the Share Acquisition were
obtained under a Credit Agreement, dated April 29, 1994, among certain
wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Registrant, the banks named therein,
and The First National Bank of Chicago, as agent, a copy of which was

- 2 - <PAGE>

filed as an exhibit to the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarterly period ended April 3, 1994. 

There was no material relationship between, on the one hand,
Onex Corporation or any of the shareholders of DFC and WAL and, on the
other hand, the Registrant, any affiliate of the Registrant, any
person who was a director or officer of the Registrant prior to the
Merger and the Share Acquisition, or any associate of any such person. 
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, however, Timothy C. Collins
and Matthew O. Diggs, Jr. were appointed directors of the Registrant
following consummation of the Merger and the Share Acquisition. Mr.
Collins was a shareholder of DFC and WAL and is a Managing Director of
an affiliate of Onex, and Matthew O. Diggs, Jr., is the sole managing
general partner of EJJM, a former shareholder of DFC and WAL. Kevin
E. McCrone, the president of Delfield, and Michael de St. Paer, the
managing director of Whitlenge, also became executive officers of the
Registrant following consummation of the Merger and the Share
Acquisition.

Delfield, which is headquartered in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan,
manufactures and sells refrigerated foodservice equipment, primarily
in the United States. Whitlenge, which is located near Birmingham,
England, manufactures and sells drink dispensing equipment, primarily
in the United Kingdom and other countries in Western Europe. The
Registrant intends to continue to operate such businesses and to use,
for such purposes, plant, equipment or physical property acquired in
connection with the acquisition. 

Additional information responsive to this item has been
previously reported in the Registrant's Registration Statement on Form
S-4, as amended (No. 33-52033).

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the three months ended March 31, 1994 and 1993

1. Basis of Presentation

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the DFC Holding Company and its subsidiaries (the "Company"). 
Accounting policies used in the preparation of the quarterly condensed
financial statements are consistent with the accounting policies
described in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 1993. In the opinion of management, the interim
financial statements reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a
fair presentation of the Company's financial position, results of
operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The
results for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
results for the full year. The financial statements should be read in

conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 1993 and the accompanying notes thereto.

3. Contingency

In February 1992, a fire at a hotel is reported to have resulted in
the deaths of several persons, injuries to other persons, and
significant property damage. Lawsuits alleging that a refrigerator
manufactured by the Company was the cause of the fire have been
brought against the Company by several parties, including the hotel
and the estates of three deceased persons.

Management believes that the equipment was manufactured and sold by
the former owner which has indemnified the Company for losses from
certain product liability claims involving that equipment. Management
believes that insurance coverage is adequate to protect it from
significant loss as a result of the fire if, and to the extent that,

- 12 - <PAGE>

the indemnification obligation is not applicable to certain losses or
the former owner is unable to fulfill its indemnification obligation.

<F1> Includes the results of operations of Scotsman, DFC and WAL for
the fiscal year ended January 2, 1994, December 31, 1993 and September
30, 1993, respectively. 

<F2> Net income per share (EPS) excludes the dilutive effect of stock

options outstanding as such effect is immaterial.

<F3> Pro forma weighted average number of common shares outstanding
consists of 7,001 Scotsman shares plus 1,200 common shares issued for
the acquisition plus 1,525 common stock equivalents (2,000 shares of
preferred stock convertible into 1,525 shares of common stock).

<F4> EPS excludes the effect of up to 667 additional shares of common
stock which are contingently issuable as additional purchase price if
the acquired entities achieve certain combined earnings levels in
fiscal year 1994. These earnings levels are based on earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The minimum

- 32 - <PAGE>

level of EBITDA required in fiscal 1994 that would require issuance of
any of the 667 contingent shares is approximately 23% higher than
combined DFC and WAL EBITDA for the fiscal years ended December
31,1993 and September 30, 1993, respectively. If all 667 contingent
shares are issued, approximately $8,340 of additional purchase price
and approximately $209 of additional annual amortization expense will
result. If all of these contingent shares were included in the above
EPS calculation, EPS would have been $.99.

<F5> Represents amortization expense for the period of the allocation
of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the net assets
acquired using a 40 year amortization period and elimination of
management fees paid by DFC and WAL.

<F6> Represents net additional interest expense for the period. 
Consists of additional interest expense on new debt at 7% per annum
($2,124) and reduction of interest expense on refinanced debt ($215).

<F7> Represents the related tax effect of pro forma adjustments.

Notes:
<FN>
<F1> Includes the results of operations of Scotsman for the three
months ended April 3, 1994, and of DFC and WAL for the three months
ended March 31, 1994.

<F2> Net income per share (EPS) includes the dilutive effect of stock

options outstanding.

<F3> Pro forma weighted average number of common shares outstanding
consists of 7,136 Scotsman shares plus 1,200 common shares issued for
the acquisition plus 1,525 common stock equivalents (2,000 shares of
preferred stock convertible into 1,525 shares of common stock).

<F4> EPS excludes the effect of up to 667 additional shares of common
stock which are contingently issuable as additional purchase price if
the acquired entities achieve certain combined earnings levels in
fiscal year 1994. These earnings levels are based on earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The minimum

- 40 - <PAGE>

level of EBITDA required in fiscal 1994 that would require issuance of
any of the 667 contingent shares is higher than combined DFC and WAL
EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 1994 annualized to a
twelve-month basis. If all 667 contingent shares are issued,
approximately $8,340 of additional purchase price and approximately
$52 of additional annual amortization expense for the period will
result. If all of these contingent shares were included in the above
EPS calculation, EPS would have been $.23.

<F5> Represents amortization expense for the period of the allocation
of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the net assets
acquired using a 40 year amortization period and elimination of
management fees paid by DFC and WAL.

<F6> Represents net additional interest expense for the period. 
Consists of additional interest expense on new debt at 7% per annum
($2,124) and reduction of interest expense on refinanced debt ($47).

<F7> Represents the related tax effect of pro forma adjustments.
