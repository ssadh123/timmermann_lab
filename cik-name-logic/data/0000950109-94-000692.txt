This Agreement contemplates a transaction in which the Buyer will purchase

capital stock of the Company in return for cash.

Certain capitalized terms and other terms used herein are defined in Section
-------
13 hereof.
- -- 

Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties, and
covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows:

1. Purchase and Sale of Company Shares.

1.01 Agreement to Sell and Purchase. On and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and in consideration of Buyer's payment to Seller
of the Purchase Price as herein provided, the Buyer agrees to purchase from the
Seller, and the Seller agrees to sell to the Buyer, all Company Shares.

1.02 Preliminary Purchase Price; Closing Payment. In consideration for
Seller's sale and transfer to Buyer of the Company Shares, the Buyer agrees to
pay to the Seller Eight hundred nineteen million dollars ($819,000,000) (the
"Preliminary Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment as herein provided. On a
date not less than three business days prior to the Closing Date, based upon
information available to Seller at such time, Seller shall estimate the Closing
Date Adjustment and the Closing Payment, shall notify Buyer of the respective
amounts thereof and shall provide Buyer a copy of its computation of such
estimated amounts.

1.03 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Mayor, Day,
Caldwell & Keeton, L.L.P., 700 Louisiana, Suite 1900, Houston, Texas 77002,
commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time on March 31, 1994; or in the event all
conditions to Closing have not been satisfied as of such date and the Parties
have not terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 12, on the fifth business
---------- 
day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the 
<PAGE>

obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby 
(other than conditions with respect to delivery of the notice required under 
Section 1.02 above and actions the respective Parties will take at the Closing 
- ------------ 
itself); or at such other place, date and time as the Buyer and the Seller may

amount equal to the excess of the Purchase Price over the Closing Payment. In
the event the Closing Payment is in excess of the Purchase Price, Seller shall,

Date (including those on vacation or leave of absence) (hereinafter
"Transferred Employees") with benefits under employee benefit plans
sponsored by the Buyer substantially the same as those applicable to
Buyer's employees employed in similar capacities subject to this Section
-------
5.04. In that connection, Buyer shall amend its employee benefit plans to
---- 
the extent necessary or appropriate to credit Tranferred Employees under
Buyer's employee benefit plans for their period of employment with the
Company or its predecessors (but only to the extent that any such
predecessor employment was recognized under the parallel Plan(s)
maintained by, contributed to or participated in by the Company or the
Seller as of the Closing Date).

(2) On and after the Closing Date, except as specifically provided
in subsections (a), (d), (h), (i), (j), (k), (m), (n), and (p) of this
Section 5.04, neither the Buyer nor the Company nor any of their
------------ 
Affiliates shall be responsible or liable for any payment or benefit under

Transferred Employees who continue in the employment of the Company or the
Buyer as of the 90th day following the Closing Date shall be eligible to

purpose under the Seller Pension Plan or the Seller Thrift Plan,

benefit pension plan to be amended prior to its adoption by the Company to
provide that benefits accrued under the Buyer's tax-qualified defined
benefit pension plan by Transferred Employees shall be offset by any
benefit accrued under the Seller Pension Plan in order to prevent the
payment of duplicate benefits with respect to any year of service, and to
otherwise accomplish the intent and purpose of this Section 5.04(d).
--------------- 
Promptly after receipt of a written request from the Buyer or the Company,
the Seller shall cause the Buyer or the Company to be provided any

Employee's indebtedness, or (ii) the distribution of the entire balance
in the Transferred Employee's account, the Buyer or the Company shall

6. Tax Agreements.

6.01 Income Allocation.

(a) For the taxable year in which the Closing Date occurs, the taxable
income of Company and its subsidiaries for the taxable year (or the
portion thereof) through the Closing Date will be included in the federal
income tax returns of Seller (or the parent responsible for filing
returns), and the taxable income of the Company and its subsidiaries after
the Closing Date will be included in the federal income tax returns of
Buyer (or the consolidated return group in which Buyer is a member). The
allocation of income between the two periods shall be based on a closing
of the Company's books on the Closing Date. If the Closing Date is not 
the last day 

-28-
<PAGE>

of a calendar month, then the taxable income (other than income, gain, or
recapture realized, recognized, or triggered by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) for the calendar month in which the
Closing Date occurs will be prorated between the consolidated federal
income tax returns of Seller and Buyer based on the assumption that such
taxable income for the month was recognized ratably throughout the month.
To the extent any taxable income of Company is attributable to the
interest of the Company in any partnership, the income or loss of the
partnership shall be allocated between the two periods based on an interim
closing of the partnership's books as of the Closing Date (and in the
event the Closing Date is not the last day of a calendar month, then such
allocation shall be prorated in the manner set forth in the preceding
sentence). Each Party is responsible for, and shall indemnify the other
Party and the Company against, the taxes attributable to the income
allocated to it under this Section 6.01. This Section 6.01(a) shall not
------------ --------------- 
apply to the Texas franchise tax liability of the Company or its
subsidiaries for the year in which the Closing Date occurs (or for any
franchise tax liability which is based upon the income of the Company or
its subsidiaries for such year), rather such liability is addressed
exclusively by Section 6.01(b).
--------------- 

(b) With respect to the Texas franchise tax liability of the Company and
its subsidiaries for the year in which the Closing Date occurs (or for any
franchise tax liability which is based upon the income of the Company or
its subsidiaries for such year), the Seller shall have no liability or
responsibility with respect to such tax.

(c) With respect to state and local income taxes other than the Texas
franchise tax, the Company and its subsidiaries shall be responsible for
filing all Tax Returns and paying all taxes due with respect to periods
ending after the Closing Date; provided that to the extent state law
permits or requires a short period return for the period or portion
thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall be responsible
for filing such returns and paying all taxes due with respect to such
period. Seller shall be responsible for filing all state and local income
tax returns and paying all taxes due with respect to periods ending on or
before the Closing Date. Buyer will take such steps as are reasonably
requested by Seller so that Seller will have the authority necessary for
Seller to be able to execute and timely file the tax returns required to
be filed by Seller.

(d) Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer and Company (and its
subsidiaries) harmless from all state and local taxes (other than the
Texas franchise tax), and interest and penalties thereon, attributable to
or arising as a result of the elections under sections 338(g) and
338(h)(10) of the Code referred to in Section 6.05; provided, that for
------------ 
Buyer and Company (and its subsidiaries) to be entitled to indemnification
under this Section 6.01(d), no return will be filed by Buyer or the
--------------- 
Company showing tax, interest or penalties payable and for which
indemnification is sought hereunder, unless at least twenty (20) days
prior to the filing of such return, the return and the calculation of the
indemnification payment is submitted 

-29-
<PAGE>

to Seller for its approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
and the calculation of the indemnification payment is consistent
with the allocation schedule referred to in Section 6.07. Buyer shall
------------ 
indemnify and hold Seller harmless from all state and local income taxes
attributable to operating income of the Company (and its subsidiaries)
with respect to periods or portions thereof ending after the Report Date;
provided, that for Seller to be entitled to indemnification under this
Section 6.01(d), no return will be filed by Seller showing tax, interest
--------------- 
or penalties payable and for which indemnification is sought hereunder,
unless at least twenty (20) days prior to the filing of such return, the
return and the calculation of the indemnification payment is submitted to
Buyer for its approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the
calculation of the indemnification payment is consistent with the
allocation schedule referred to in Section 6.07.
------------ 

6.02 Responsibility for Federal Income Taxes. Subject to Section 6.01,
------------ 
which governs the taxable year in which the Closing Date occurs, (a) Seller is
responsible for all federal income taxes of the Company and its subsidiaries for
periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, including
without limitation all federal income taxes arising as a result of the election
under sections 338(g) and 338(h)(10) of the Code, and (b) Buyer is responsible
for all federal income taxes of the Company and its subsidiaries for periods or
portions thereof beginning after the Closing Date. Seller shall have sole
authority and control to conduct and settle audits, examinations, or other claim
proceedings which arise after the Closing Date but are applicable to periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall not settle without Buyer's
written consent (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld) any audit,
assessment, or claim proceeding against the Company or its subsidiaries with
respect to periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date
which would adversely and materially affect the tax liability of the Company,
its subsidiaries, or the Buyer with respect to periods or portions thereof after
the Closing Date. Buyer shall not, and shall cause Company and its subsidiaries
not to, settle without Seller's written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) any audit assessment or claim proceeding against the
Company or its subsidiaries with respect to periods ending after the Closing
Date which would adversely and materially affect the tax liability of the
Company, its subsidiaries or the Seller with respect to periods prior to the
Closing Date. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of the
resolution of any audits, assessments, claim proceedings or litigation with any
taxing authority in the event such resolution will affect the tax liability or
indemnity obligations of such other Party. Any refund of income taxes shall
belong to the Party responsible for the payment of income taxes for the period
for which the tax refund is paid. If a Party receives a refund or notice from
any taxing authority belonging to the other Party, the receiving Party shall
promptly remit or forward the refund or notice to the other Party. For purposes
of this Section 6.02, income taxes do not include state franchise taxes
------------ 
regardless of whether such taxes are based on or computed with respect to
income.

<PAGE>

6.03 Access to Information. Buyer and Company shall provide access to
Seller and its representatives to the records of Company to enable Seller to
prepare all Tax Returns filed by Seller and to enable Seller to respond to any
audits, inquiries, assessments, or similar items by any taxing authority. Buyer
shall cause the Company to cooperate with Seller, make available its personnel
and provide testimony as shall be reasonably necessary to enable Seller
to defend against any assessments by any taxing authority. Seller shall provide
access to Buyer and the Company and their representatives to the records of the
Company to enable Buyer and the Company to prepare all Tax Returns filed by
Buyer and the Company and its subsidiaries and to enable Buyer and the Company
to respond to any audits, inquiries, assessments or similar items by any taxing
authority. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and the Company and make available
its personnel and provide testimony as shall be reasonably necessary to enable
Buyer and the Company to defend against any assessments by or prosecute any
claims against any taxing authority. Within two hundred forty (240) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause Company to deliver to Seller a completed
copy of the tax information package used by Seller to collect information from
its subsidiaries to enable Seller to prepare and file its consolidated federal
income tax return. The package will include information with respect to the
Company's operations through the Closing Date and shall be based on the
allocation of income set forth in Section 6.01. To the extent Company or Seller
------------ 
cannot provide information required hereunder because certain information is not
available to Company by the due date for the tax information package, the Buyer
shall cause the Company to furnish Seller with such information as soon as it
becomes available to the Company, but in no event later than May 15, 1995.
Until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period (including
extensions thereof of which the Buyer has actual notice), Buyer shall cause the
Company to retain all pertinent tax and accounting records necessary or useful
for determining the tax liability of the Company, the Seller or the affiliated
group that includes the Company for periods prior to and through the Closing
Date, which records shall be the property of the Company.

6.04 Liability for Consolidated Group Income Taxes. If, as a result of
the Company or its subsidiaries being a member of an "affiliated group" for any
period or portion thereof before the Closing (as defined in section 1504(a) of
the Code), liability is imposed on the Company or its subsidiaries under Reg.
(S)1.1502-6 for income taxes, interest or penalties attributable to members of
the affiliated group other than the Company or its subsidiaries, then Seller and
Parent shall indemnify Company and its subsidiaries against such income taxes,
interest, and penalties.

6.05 Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller and Buyer will make a joint
election under sections 338(g) and 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to the
purchase and sale of the Company Shares, which shall be executed in counterpart
and delivered at Closing, and will make similar elections under any state or
local tax laws where such elections are available.

6.06 Conflicts. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
Section 6 and any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this
- --------- 
section shall control. 

-31-
<PAGE>

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11, any indemnifications or
----------
liabilities of the Parties under this Section 6 shall survive until the
---------
expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the taxes involved.

6.07 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the Company's and its subsidiaries' assets in accordance with an
allocation schedule which will be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller at least ten
days prior to the Closing Date; and the Parties agree that for all income and
franchise tax purposes (and, where applicable, financial accounting purposes),
including but not limited to section 338 of the Code, they and their
Affiliates will report consistently with such allocation. Each Party shall
indemnify the other against any income taxes, interest, and penalties
attributable to such Party's failure to report consistently with such
allocation.

7. Title Matters. The procedures to be followed with respect to Buyer's
assertion of Title Defects concerning the Significant Properties and adjustment
or refund of the Purchase Price attributable to such Title Defects shall be as
follows:

7.01 Access to Records. Promptly after execution of this Agreement,
Seller shall cause Company to provide to Buyer and its consultants and advisors
access at all reasonable times to Company's accounting, land, production,
engineering, and other records regarding the Significant Properties for the
purpose of reviewing title to the Significant Properties and reasonable office
space in the Company's offices for such review. To the extent any such records
are in the possession of a co-working interest owner, partner or other third
party and the Company has the right of access thereto, the Company will use its
reasonable efforts (without being obligated to incur expense) to provide Buyer
access to such other records or obtain copies thereof for Buyer's review.

7.02 Notice of Asserted Title Defects. Prior to the expiration of the
period commencing on the execution of this Agreement and ending six (6) months
following the Closing Date (the "Title Examination Period"), Buyer shall
furnish to Seller written notice specifying in reasonable detail each matter
which, in Buyers' opinion, constitutes a Title Defect and which Buyer wishes to
assert as a Title Defect hereunder, together with the Defect Amount estimated by
Buyer for each such asserted Title Defect (each such notice being called a
"Title Defect Notice"). Any Title Defects not asserted by Buyer (a) on or
before 5:00 p.m. on March 23, 1994, with respect to the El Campo, Four League
Bay, Gomez, Alverado or Roleta fields shall be deemed conclusively to be
Permitted Encumbrances with respect to the Significant Properties in such fields
or (b) on or before the expiration of the Title Examination Period with respect
to any other Significant Properties, shall be deemed conclusively to be
Permitted Encumbrances. Furthermore, if (i) on or before March 18, 1994, Buyer
has Knowledge of the verification of the existence of a Title Defect by way of a
title opinion or other written title report obtained or generated and reviewed
by Buyer in connection with its title review conducted pursuant to this Section
-------
7 and in such detail as will enable Buyer to furnish Seller a Title Defect
- - 
Notice with respect to such Title Defect and (ii) Buyer fails to assert such
Title Defect pursuant to this Section 
-------

-32-
<PAGE>

7.02 on or before 5:00 p.m. on March 23, 1994, then such Title Defect shall be
- ---- 
deemed conclusively to be a Permitted Encumbrance with respect to the
Significant Property as to which Buyer had so verified the existence of such
Title Defect on or before March 18, 1994. During the Title Examination Period
following Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
furnish Seller with a Title Defect Notice with respect to a Title Defect
promptly after Buyer has Knowledge of the verification of the existence of
such Title Defect in connection with its title review conducted pursuant to
this Section 7 and in such detail as will enable Buyer to furnish Seller a
---------
Title Defect Notice with respect thereto; provided that, Buyer shall not be
obligated to furnish Seller Title Defect Notices more often than every other
Monday during the Title Examination Period. Failure by Buyer to identify all
Significant Properties (or to identify all portions of a Significant Property)
which are subject to a particular Title Defect in a Title Defect Notice shall
not prevent Buyer from asserting such Title Defect in separate or subsequent
Title Defect Notices, subject to otherwise timely asserting such Title Defect
prior to March 23, 1994, or prior to the expiration of the Title Examination
Period, as applicable.

7.03 Notice in Response to Buyer's Notice. On or before 5:00 p.m. on the
15th day following Seller's receipt of a Title Defect Notice, Seller shall give
written notice to Buyer for each Title Defect asserted in such Title Defect
Notice by Buyer ("Response Notice") as to whether it (a) intends to cure the
asserted Title Defect, (b) disagrees with Buyer's assertion that the Title
Defect exists, (c) disagrees with the Defect Amount estimated by Buyer for such
Title Defect, or (d) takes any combination of the foregoing positions. If
Seller disagrees with Buyer's assertion of the existence of a Title Defect or
the Defect Amount with respect thereto, Seller's Response Notice shall also
specify in reasonable detail Seller's grounds for such disagreement, the Defect
Amount estimated by Seller therefor, or both, as the case may be. Seller's
failure to deliver a timely Response Notice with respect to a Title Defect
asserted in a Title Defect Notice shall be deemed to be an admission of the
existence of such Title Defect, acceptance of Buyer's estimate of the Defect
Amount with respect thereto and a waiver of Seller's rights to cure such Title
Defect.

7.04 Method of Determination of Defect Amounts. Without limiting Seller's
right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect, Defect Amounts for each
asserted Title Defect shall be determined as follows:

(a) If the Title Defect relates to failure of title to the entirety of
the Company's title to a Significant Property, the Defect Amount shall be
the amount set forth as the value for that Significant Property in
Schedule 7.

(b) If the Title Defect results from a lien, security interest, pledge or
collateral assignment upon one or more Significant Properties (or a
portion thereof) which is liquidated in amount, then the Defect Amount
shall be the amount necessary to remove such lien, security interest,
pledge or collateral assignment from the Company's title to such one or
more Significant Properties (or portion thereof).

-33-
<PAGE>

(c) If the Title Defect results from the Company having a lesser NRI in a
Significant Property than the NRI specified therefor in Schedule 7, the
Defect Amount shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the
value for that Significant Property in Schedule 7 by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the reduction in the NRI and the denominator of
which is the NRI specified for such Significant Property in Schedule 7.

(d) If the Title Defect results from the Company having a greater WI in a
Significant Property than the WI specified therefor in Schedule 7, the
Defect Amount shall be equal to the present value (discounted at 10% 
compounded annually) of the increase in Buyer's Projected Costs with 
respect to such Significant Property for the period from and after the 
Report Date which is attributable to such increase in the WI.

(e) If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in
paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d) above, then the Defect Amount shall be a
portion of the value set forth for that Significant Property in Schedule
7, said portion to be equal to the difference between the value of the
Company's title to such Significant Property without such Title Defect and
with such Title Defect (assuming the value without such Title Defect to be
the value set forth in Schedule 7).

(f) If a Title Defect is not effective or does not affect the Company's
title to a Significant Property throughout the entire productive life of
such Significant Property, such fact shall be taken into account in
determining the Defect Amount.

(g) If a Title Defect affects only a portion of a Significant Property
(as contrasted with an undivided interest in the entirety of such
Significant Property) and a portion of the Purchase Price has not been
allocated specifically to such portion of a Significant Property in
Schedule 7, then for purposes of computing the Defect Amount, the Purchase
Price allocated to such Significant Property shall be further allocated
among the portions of such Significant Property in a fair and reasonable
manner taking into account the values set forth in Schedule 7 and Buyer's
Projected Costs.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the aggregate Defect Amounts
attributable to Title Defects relating to a Significant Property for which Buyer
receives an adjustment in the Purchase Price shall never exceed the value of
that Significant Property as set forth in Schedule 7.

7.05 Seller's Option to Retain Significant Property. If on or before
March 23, 1994, Buyer asserts one or more Title Defects with respect to any
Significant Property and the aggregate amount of Buyer's estimated Defect
Amounts with respect to such asserted Title Defects exceeds 50% of the value of
such Significant Property as set forth in Schedule 7 and Seller has accepted
Buyer's estimate of such Defect Amount, then at any time on or 

-34-
<PAGE>

before March 28, 1994, Seller may, at its sole option, elect to cause the
Company to convey to Seller, or to an entity designated by Seller, all of such
Significant Property. Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of its election so
to cause the Company to convey any such Significant Property on or before
March 28, 1994, and if Seller gives such notice, then the Preliminary Purchase
Price shall be reduced in calculating the Closing Payment by the value for
such Significant Property set forth in Schedule 7. If Seller makes such
election, then prior to Closing, by an instrument of assignment or conveyance
which is expressly made without any warranty or representation, express or
implied, as to title, condition or any other matter (but, to the extent
transferable, with subrogation of Seller or such designee to all covenants and
warranties theretofore made by the Company's predecessors in title, except any
subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company), the Company shall convey the title,
if any, which the Company has in all of such Significant Property to Seller
(or to an entity designated by Seller).

7.06 Pre-Closing Adjustment for Uncured Title Defects. If on or before
March 28, 1994, any Title Defect and the Defect Amount as asserted by Buyer are
agreed (or deemed agreed) to by Seller and Seller elects not to attempt (or
waives its right) to cure such Title Defect, as to one or more such Title
Defects, then (i) the sum of Defect Amounts attributable to those Significant
Properties (or portions thereof) for which Seller and Buyer are in agreement (or
deemed to be in agreement) as to both the existence of a Title Defect and the
Defect Amount, but excluding Significant Properties conveyed to Seller (or its
designee) pursuant to Section 7.05, shall be applied to reduce the Available
------------ 
Deductible Amount and (ii) the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be reduced in
calculating the Closing Payment by the amount, if any, by which the amount
available for application pursuant to clause (i) above exceeds the balance of
the Available Deductible Amount immediately prior to the application of such
amount (or a portion thereof) pursuant to clause (i) above.

7.07 Cure of Title Defects. If Seller elects to cure a Title Defect in
accordance with Section 7.03, then Seller shall use reasonable efforts to cure
------------ 
such defect during the Cure Period with respect to such Title Defect. On or
before expiration of the Cure Period with respect to such Title Defect, Seller
shall give Buyer written evidence of any curative actions which in Seller's
determination cure or reduce the Defect Amount of a Title Defect asserted by
Buyer, including an explanation in reasonable detail of any claimed reduction in
the Defect Amount. On or before the expiration of thirty (30) days after the
end of all Cure Periods applicable to Title Defects which Seller attempts to
cure pursuant to this Section 7.07, Buyer shall provide to Seller in writing a
------------ 
list of those Title Defects asserted by Buyer which Seller claims to have cured
pursuant to this Section 7.07 and which Buyer determines have not been cured,
------------ 
together with the revisions, if any, in Buyer's estimates of the Defect Amounts
attributable to such Title Defects after giving effect, if any, to Seller's
curative efforts. For a period of thirty (30) days after Seller's receipt of
Buyer's written list of such uncured Title Defects and revised Defect Amounts,
Seller and Buyer shall attempt to resolve disputes as to such items. During the
Cure Period with respect to a Title Defect, and thereafter until all disputes
regarding such Title Defect and the Defect Amount in respect thereof have been
fully resolved by agreement or arbitration, Buyer and the 

-35-
<PAGE>

Company shall afford Seller and its representatives and agents access at all
reasonable times to the Company's files, records and documents relating to
title to the one or more Significant Properties that are the subject of such
disputed Title Defect or Defect Amount. Such access shall be subject to
confidentiality restrictions reasonably imposed by Buyer or the Company.

7.08 Arbitration.

(a) In the event the parties are unable to resolve all disputes as to the
existence of Title Defects or Defect Amounts within the later of thirty
(30) days after the expiration of the Title Examination Period or sixty
(60) days after expiration of all Cure Periods applicable to Title Defects
which Seller attempts to cure pursuant to Section 7.07, then,
------------ 
all remaining disputes regarding Title Defects and Defect Amounts shall be
submitted to binding arbitration. Within a further fifteen (15) day
period Seller and Buyer agree to jointly select an arbitrator experienced
in the U.S. oil and gas business, who shall be the sole arbitrator (the
"Arbitrator") to hear and decide all remaining disputes regarding asserted
Title Defects and Defect Amounts. The Arbitrator chosen shall be
impartial and independent of all parties to this Agreement and shall be
experienced and knowledgeable about the subject matter (generally and not
as to the express facts concerning Company Property) of the remaining
disputes. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the designation of a
person as Arbitrator, then Seller or Buyer may in writing request the
Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Texas to appoint the Arbitrator and such Arbitrator shall hear all
matters submitted to arbitration under this Section 7.08;
------------ 

(b) Each arbitration hearing shall be held at a place in Houston, Texas
acceptable to the Arbitrator. The arbitration shall be conducted in
accordance with the United States Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.A. (S)(S)1-16)
and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of
such Act and the terms hereof. The decision of the Arbitrator with
respect to such remaining disputed matters shall be reduced to writing and
binding on the parties. Judgment upon the award(s) rendered by the
Arbitrator may be entered and execution had in any court of competent
jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for a judicial
acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement. Seller and Buyer,
respectively, shall bear their own legal fees and other costs incurred in
presenting their respective cases. The charges and expenses of the
Arbitrator shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer;

(c) The arbitration shall commence within thirty (30) days after the
Arbitrator is selected in accordance with the provisions of Section
-------
7.08(a) above. In fulfilling his or her duties with respect to
------- 
determining the amount of a Defect Amount, the Arbitrator may consider
such matters as, in the opinion of the Arbitrator, are necessary or
helpful to make a proper valuation, however, the Arbitrator shall be bound
by those factors set forth in Section 7.04 above. Furthermore, the
------------ 
Arbitrator 

-36-
<PAGE>

may consult with and engage disinterested third parties to advise the
Arbitrator including, without limitation, geologists, geophysicists,
petroleum engineers, title lawyers, accountants and consultants and the
fees and expenses of such third parties shall be considered to be
charges and expenses of the Arbitrator. The sole remedy in any
arbitration award shall be resolution of alleged Title Defects and
Defect Amounts which shall then be applied as provided in Section 7.09
------------ 
and the Arbitrator shall not award any other remedy, including without
limitation actual damages, exemplary damages, attorneys' fees and
interest reflecting the time value of money. The Arbitrator shall not
add any interest factor reflecting the time value of money to any Defect
Amount;

(d) If the Arbitrator selected hereunder (whether selected by Seller
and Buyer or by the Chief Judge) should die, resign or be unable to
perform his or her duties hereunder, the Parties or senior judge (or
such judge's successor) shall select a replacement Arbitrator. The
procedure set forth in this Section 7.08(d) for selecting the Arbitrator
---------------
shall be followed from time to time as necessary;

(e) As to any determination of amounts owing under the terms of this
Section 7, no lawsuit based on such claimed amounts owing shall be
--------- 
instituted by any party hereto, other than to compel arbitration
proceedings or enforce the award of the Arbitrator; and

(f) All privileges under Texas and federal law, including attorney-client
and work-product privileges, shall be preserved and protected to the same
extent that such privileges would be protected in a federal court
proceeding applying Texas law.

7.09 Post-Closing Adjustment for Uncured Title Defects. When the last of
all Title Defects asserted by the Buyer and the Defect Amounts, if any, with
respect thereto have been finally resolved, whether by agreement, arbitration
award or Seller's retention pursuant to Section 7.05, the Title Defect
------------ 
Adjustment shall be applied to reduce the Available Deductible Amount (but not
below zero) and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by
which the Title Defect Adjustment exceeds the balance of the Available
Deductible Amount immediately prior to application of the Title Defect
Adjustment. The amount of any reduction in the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Section 7.09 shall bear interest at the Agreed Rate from the Closing Date until
- ------------ 
paid. Any reduction in the Purchase Price, together with any interest accruing
thereon pursuant to this Section 7.09, shall be due and payable by Seller to
------------ 
Buyer in immediately available funds within ten days after the date of the final
resolution of the last of all Title Defects asserted by Buyer and the Defect
Amounts, if any, with respect thereto as aforesaid. Except as provided below,
Seller's sole responsibility and Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy for the
reduction in value of the Company's title to a Significant Property resulting
from the existence of a Title Defect shall be as provided in this Section 7 and
--------- 
Seller shall not be liable for any consequential damages or other Losses in
respect of Title Defects and Defect Amounts, except to the 

-37-
<PAGE>

extent that Seller would have liability therefor under other Sections of this 
Agreement. The foregoing shall not operate to limit Seller's responsibility 
for any Retained Liability, Retained Royalty Claims or any breach of Sections 
--------
3.03, 3.05, 3.07, 3.08, 3.09, 3.11, 3.12, 3.14, 4.07, 4.08 and 6 of this 
- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- -
Agreement, except that any recovery to which Buyer may be entitled on account 
of such matters shall not be duplicative of any amount recovered by Buyer 
under this Section 7.
--------- 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parker Claims shall be a Retained Liability
and shall never form the basis for any Title Defect claim under Section 7,
--------- 
Section 10 or other Sections of this Agreement, other than as part of a Retained
- ---------- 
Liability under Section 5.02(a) of this Agreement.
--------------- 

8. Environmental.

8.01 Availability of Data to Buyer. After execution of this Agreement,
Seller and the Company shall make available to Buyer all information which is in
the possession or control of Seller or the Company or to which the Seller or the
Company has access (other than publicly available information to which Buyer has
equal access) and which relates to Environmental Matters of the Company or the
environmental condition of the Company Property, including, without
limitation, information regarding crude oil and produced water that may have
been spilled or disposed of on-site and the locations thereof; pits and pit
closures; burial; land farming; land spreading; underground injection; and
solid waste disposal sites. Also, prior to Closing, Buyer shall have the right
at its own risk and expense to conduct or have conducted a Phase I
Environmental Audit of the Company's Environmental Matters and the Company
Property. To enable Buyer to conduct the Phase I Environmental Audit, Seller
and the Company will provide Buyer (and its representatives) with reasonable
access to the Company Property subject to any third party restrictions on the
Company with respect to access to Company Property, and will use reasonable
efforts to make available for Buyer current or former employees of the Company
or Seller, and current or former contractors or consultants to the Company or
Seller. In conducting a Phase I Environmental Audit, Buyer shall treat, and
will cause all of its assigns, representatives, agents, consultants,
contractors or subcontractors to treat, all information obtained by Buyer
pursuant to the Audit as strictly confidential (except to the extent such
information is otherwise available to the general public) and will not
disclose the results without the prior written consent of Seller, except to
the extent that such results are legally required to be disclosed by Buyer.
Seller shall have the right to be present during any inspection of Company
Property and during any interviews of the Company's current or former
employees, contractors, or consultants conducted as a part of the Phase I
Environmental Audit. Buyer shall provide Seller copies of any Phase I
Environmental Audit report completed prior to Closing within five days of
Buyer's receipt of same. Buyer agrees to release, indemnify, defend, and hold
the Seller and the Company harmless from any fines, penalties or damage to
persons or property caused by the activities of Buyer or its representatives,
agents, consultants, contractors or subcontractors in conducting the Phase I
Environmental Audit except to the extent the damage arises from the negligence
of the Seller or the Company. Should Buyer desire to conduct any procedures
for environmental assessment outside the scope of the Phase I Environmental
Audit, Buyer must make written 

-38-
<PAGE>

request for Seller's permission to do so, and will not commence such
procedures without first obtaining Seller's written permission which
permission will be given or denied not later than three days after receipt of
Buyer's written request. If within such three-day period Seller refuses to
permit any request by Buyer to conduct an environmental assessment outside the
scope of a Phase I Environmental Audit, Buyer may elect, as its sole remedy
for such refusal, to terminate this Agreement.

8.02 Environmental Defects. If, on or before ten days prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer has Knowledge of and has analyzed and evaluated all material
facts and circumstances with respect to the actual (as opposed to the threatened
or alleged) existence of an Environmental Matter discovered in the course of
Buyer's environmental due diligence in connection with this transaction and, as
a result of such analysis and evaluation, the officer or manager of Buyer with
Knowledge of such Environmental Matter has concluded that such Environmental
Matter constitutes a breach by Seller of any of Seller's representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.10 hereof, then Buyer shall advise Seller in
------------ 
writing of such Environmental Matter on or before five days prior to the Closing
Date. Such written notification shall contain a reasonable description of the
facts used by Buyer in making its determination that a breach exists. Prior to
Closing, Buyer and its employees, contractors and consultants shall treat all
information regarding any Company Environmental Matter as confidential and shall
not disclose such information to any governmental authority or other third party
(other than Universal Resources Corporation and its Affiliates and their
representatives, agents, consultants, contractors or subcontractors) without
Seller's written consent unless disclosure is required by applicable law.
Within three days after receipt of a notice with respect to each Environmental
Matter constituting a breach of Seller's representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.10 hereof, Seller may, subject to obtaining the consent of
------------ 
Buyer (which consent may be given or refused at Buyer's discretion), remove that
portion of the Company Property to which such Environmental Matter pertains from
the Company Property by conveying such portion to a transferee designated by it,
and adjust the Preliminary Purchase Price proportionately in relation to the
value set forth in Schedule 7, provided that, (i) Seller fully indemnifies the
Company and Buyer (and the other persons named as indemnitees in Section 11.02
-------------
and Section 11.06) from and against any and all Environmental Liabilities and
------------- 
Losses attributable to such portion of the Company Property, except to the
extent that Buyer's acts or omissions caused or contributed to such
Environmental Liabilities, in the manner provided in such Sections, except that
such indemnity shall not be subject to or limited as to any amount, any
deductible, any threshold amount, any survival period or any other restrictions
and (ii) such conveyance of such portion of the Company Property shall be by an
instrument of assignment or conveyance which is expressly made without any
warranty or representation, express or implied, as to title, condition or any
other matter (but, to the extent transferable, with subrogation of Seller or
such transferee to all covenants and warranties theretofore made by the
Company's predecessors in title, except any subsidiary or Affiliate of the
Company).

-39-
<PAGE>

9. Pre-Closing Breaches. If, on or before ten days prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer has Knowledge of and has analyzed and evaluated all material facts

Seller's indemnity obligations under 

-42-
<PAGE>

Section 11.06 hereof, the representations and warranties of Seller contained
- -------------
in Section 3.10 shall not survive the Closing. Following Closing, for purposes
------------
of indemnity hereunder (i) the representations and warranties in Section 3
---------
(except for Section 3.10) shall be deemed to have been made at and as of the
------------
Closing Date, as though made as of such date, (ii) the Seller's certificate

Section 2.01 shall be deemed to constitute representations and warranties
- ------------
under Section 2.01, and (iii) the Buyer's certificate delivered pursuant to
------------
Section 10.02(d) as to representations and warranties in Section 2.02 shall be
- ---------------- ------------

------------ 
11.02 Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Buyer. In the event

indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and the Company, the Buyer's and the
Company's respective Affiliates, each of the respective current, former and
future directors, officers, employees and agents of any of the foregoing, and
each of the successors, heirs and executors of any of the foregoing, from and
against the entirety of any Losses resulting from or attributable to the breach
which the Buyer, the Company or any such Affiliate (or any such other
indemnified person in such person's capacity set forth above) shall suffer,
provided such claim for indemnification is brought in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement within the applicable survival period.

11.03 Limitation on Seller's Liability.

(a) After the Closing, the initial $1,000,000 of Losses incurred or paid
by the Company or Buyer, in the aggregate, with respect to breaches by
Seller of any of its representations and warranties contained in Section
-------
3.08 hereof shall be the responsibility of Buyer, Seller shall have no
---- 
liability therefor, and such initial $1,000,000 of Losses shall not be
applied to reduce the Available Deductible Amount. Seller's sole
responsibility for any breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.08 shall be to indemnify Buyer for the reduced value of
------------ 
the Assets or Losses attributable to such breach (after applying the
applicable deductible amounts); provided, however, that "Losses", as used
in this sentence, shall not include, and Seller shall not be responsible
or liable for, any death, personal injury or consequential damages in
respect of such breach. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve
any disputes after Closing with respect to breaches or alleged breaches by
Seller of any of its representations and warranties contained in Section
-------
3.08, either Buyer or Seller may give notice to the other of its election
---- 
to submit such dispute to arbitration. In the event either Party elects
to submit such dispute to arbitration, Seller and Buyer agree to jointly
select an arbitrator experienced in the U.S. oil and gas business, who
shall be the sole arbitrator to hear and decide such dispute. The
selection and qualification of such arbitrator, the conduct of such
arbitration and other matters relating to such arbitration shall be
governed by Section 7.08 hereof except to the extent the terms 
------------

-43-
<PAGE>

of Section 7.08 conflict with this Section 11.03(a) or specifically
------------ ----------------
relate to Title Defect and Defect Amount disputes.

(b) Without limiting Seller's indemnity obligations with respect to
Retained Liabilities, Offsite Environmental Liabilities or Losses arising
out of or resulting from Seller's breach of any of its representations and
warranties in Section 2.01 or Section 3.17 hereof, Seller shall not be
------------ ------------ 
required to pay any Losses, Retained Royalty Claims or Onsite
Environmental Liabilities pursuant to the indemnifications set forth in
Section 5.02(b), Section 11.02 or Section 11.06 hereof and Buyer shall not
--------------- ------------- ------------- 
be entitled to adjust the Preliminary Purchase Price or reduce the
Purchase Price on account of any Defect Amount pursuant to Section 7.06 or
------------ 
Section 7.09 until the Available Deductible Amount has been reduced to,
------------ 
but not below, zero. The Company and Buyer shall not be entitled to
indemnity for any such Losses, Retained Royalty Claims or Onsite
Environmental Liabilities to the extent the same are actually applied to
reduce the Available Deductible Amount. "Available Deductible Amount"
means $5,000,000 as reduced, but not below zero, by (i) Defect Amounts
applied to reduce the Available Deductible Amount pursuant to Section 7.06
------------
or Section 7.09 hereof, (ii) Retained Royalty Claims and Losses applied to
------------ 
reduce the Available Deductible Amount pursuant to Section 5.02(b), and
--------------- 
(iii) the total amount of Losses and Onsite Environmental Liabilities
incurred or paid by the Company and/or Buyer which are subject to
indemnification by Seller under Section 11.02 or Section 11.06 hereof;
------------- ------------- 
provided that, the Available Deductible Amount shall not be reduced by
(a) Defect Amounts attributable to Significant Properties (or portions
thereof) conveyed to Seller (or its designee) pursuant to Section 7.05
------------
hereof, (b) Retained Liabilities, (c) Offsite Environmental Liabilities,
(d) the $1,000,000 of Losses for which Buyer is responsible pursuant to
Section 11.03(a) above and (e) Losses arising out of or resulting from
----------------
Seller's breach of its representations and warranties in Section 2.01 or
------------
Section 3.17 hereof.
------------

(c) If (i) the breaches of representations and warranties set forth in

Section 3 and Title Defects which were asserted or disclosed by Buyer to
--------- 
Seller prior to Closing and (ii) the breaches of representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3 and claims for indemnity on account of
--------- 
Environmental Liabilities asserted by Buyer after Closing and which Buyer
was required to assert or advise Seller in the manner and to the extent
required by Section 8.02 and Section 9, in the aggregate, have a material
------------ --------- 
adverse effect, then Buyer shall not be entitled to seek indemnity from
Seller (x) under Section 11.06 hereof for any Environmental Liabilities
------------- 
resulting from a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in

Section 3.10 hereof of which Buyer was required to advise Seller pursuant
------------ 
to Section 8.02, but failed to do so, and (y) under Section 11.02 hereof
------------ ------------- 
for any Losses resulting from a breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3 hereof (other than Section 3.10 hereof)
--------- ------------ 
of which Buyer was required to advise Seller pursuant to Section 9, but
--------- 
failed to do so, except in each case under clauses (x) and (y) above where
Seller or the Company had Knowledge (other than as a result of receiving

-44-
<PAGE>

notification of such matter from Buyer pursuant to Sections 8.02 or 9)
-------------- - 
prior to the Closing Date of such breach by Seller of a representation and
warranty set forth in Section 3. The operation of this Section 11.03(c)
--------- ----------------
and Seller's rights under this Section 11.03(c) shall be the sole and
---------------- 
exclusive remedy of Seller for any failure by Buyer to advise Seller of
any Environmental Matters as required under Section 8.02 or any other
------------ 
matters as required under Section 9.
--------- 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Seller's
indemnity obligations shall not extend to any Losses arising out of or
resulting from any of the litigation listed in Item 3.12 of Schedule 3,
other than the Parker Claims (which are a Retained Liability).

11.04 Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of the Seller. In the event
the Buyer breaches any of its representations and warranties contained in

Section 2.02 hereof, then the Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
- ------------ 
Seller, Parent, the Seller's and Parent's respective Affiliates, each of the
respective current, former and future directors, officers, employees and agents
of any of the foregoing, and each of the successors, heirs and executors of any
of the foregoing from and against the entirety of any Losses resulting from or
attributable to the breach which the Seller, Parent or any such Affiliate (or
any such other indemnified person in such person's capacity set forth above)
shall suffer, provided such claim for indemnification is brought within one year
after the Closing Date.

11.05 Matters Involving Third Parties.

(a) If any third party (other than an Affiliate of the Party receiving 
the notice) shall notify any Party or the Company (the "Indemnified 
Party") with respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") which may 
give rise to a claim for indemnification against any other Party (the 
"Indemnifying Party") under this Section 11 or otherwise pursuant to 
---------- 
this Agreement, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any
event within ten business days after receiving service of process in a
lawsuit, administrative proceeding or arbitration proceeding with
respect to the Third Party Claim) notify each Indemnifying Party thereof
in writing. Any claim by a third party in existence as of the date
hereof as to which Seller has retained liability or agreed to indemnify
Buyer shall also constitute a Third Party Claim.

(b) Except as provided in Section 11.06(d) hereof, any Indemnifying Party
---------------- 
will have the right to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of the
Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably), unless the judgment
or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages and does
not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon (or constitute an
admission of guilt, liability, fault or responsibility by) 

-45-
<PAGE>

the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at
the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (a) the employment thereof
has been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party or
(b) the Indemnifying Party failed to assume the defense and employ
counsel.

(c) Unless and until an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the
Third Party Claim as provided in Section 11.05(b) above, however, the
---------------- 
Indemnified Party may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner
it reasonably may deem appropriate.

(d) In no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to
be withheld unreasonably), unless the Indemnified Party waives
indemnification with respect to the Third Party Claim so settled and
adjudicated.

(e) The indemnification obligations of the Seller under this Agreement
(including Section 5 and Section 11) and the indemnification obligations
--------- ---------- 
of the Buyer under this Agreement (including Section 5 and Section 11)
--------- ---------- 
shall include court costs and attorneys' fees and expenses and costs of
investigating, preparing or defending any action or proceeding with
respect to any Third Party Claim to the extent such Third Party Claim may
give rise to a claim for indemnification under such indemnification
obligations of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be.

11.06 Seller's Environmental Indemnification.

(a) Seller agrees, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
-------
11.03(b) and this Section 11.06, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
-------- ------------- 
the Company and Buyer, the Company and Buyer's respective Affiliates, each
of the respective current, former and future directors, officers,
employees, agents, stockholders and controlling persons of any of the
foregoing, and each of the respective successors, heirs and executors of
any of the foregoing from and against and in respect of any and all
Environmental Liabilities that may be imposed upon, asserted against, or
incurred by the Company or Buyer (or any such other indemnified person in
such person's capacity set forth above), arising out of or in connection
with the acts or omissions of any person on or prior to the Closing Date
relating to the Company, the Company Property, or any business,
operations, or activities conducted by the Company, including without
limitation those matters described in Item 3.10 of Schedule 3; provided,
however, that in the event that acts or omissions of any person after the
Closing Date caused or contributed to a pre-existing circumstance or
condition, then Seller's obligation to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer
and the 

-46-
<PAGE>

Company harmless shall be reduced by the Environmental Liabilities
to the extent resulting from such acts or omissions.

(b) As a limitation on Seller's indemnification obligations under this

Section 11.06, Seller shall be responsible for Onsite Environmental
------------- 
Liabilities only to the extent that Buyer or the Company within two years
after the Closing Date provides Seller notice of (i) the specific facts
and circumstances potentially giving rise to such Onsite Environmental
Liabilities as a result of actions or claims that Buyer or the Company
reasonably believes are probable of assertion or (ii) a Third Party Claim
potentially giving rise to such Onsite Environmental Liabilities (however,
notice of a lawsuit or administrative proceeding filed against Buyer or
the Company prior to the end of such two year period shall always be
timely if Buyer or the Company gives Seller notice thereof within ten
business days after being served therewith); provided that, it shall not
be required that any or all of the Onsite Environmental Liabilities
attributable to such facts and circumstances be imposed, asserted or
incurred within such two year period. In addition, Seller shall be
responsible for Offsite Environmental Liabilities only to the extent that
Buyer or the Company within ten years after the Closing Date provides
Seller notice of (i) the specific facts and circumstances potentially
giving rise to such Offsite Environmental Liability as a result of actions
or claims that Buyer or the Company reasonably believes are probable of
assertion or (ii) a Third Party Claim potentially giving rise to such
Offsite Environmental Liabilities (however, notice of a lawsuit or
administrative proceeding filed against Buyer or the Company prior to the
end of such ten year period shall always be timely if Buyer or the Company
gives Seller notice thereof within ten business days after being served
therewith); provided that, it shall not be required that any or all of the
Offsite Environmental Liabilities attributable to such facts and
circumstances be imposed, asserted or incurred within such ten year
period.

(c) As an additional limitation on Seller's indemnification obligations
under this Section 11.06, Buyer shall be responsible for the initial
------------- 
$10,000,000 of Offsite Environmental Liabilities incurred or paid by the
Company or Buyer, in the aggregate, for which Seller would otherwise be
responsible under this Section 11.06 but for this clause (c). Seller's
------------- 
obligations under this Section 11.06 to indemnify the Company or Buyer (or
------------- 
any such other indemnified person in such person's capacity set forth
above) for Onsite Environmental Liabilities are subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 11.03(b).
---------------- 

(d) With respect to any Environmental Liability for which Seller may be
responsible and which requires corrective, remedial, or other actions
necessary to respond to, remove, or otherwise address any conditions that
cause, contribute to or are associated with such Environmental Liability,
the Company will implement and complete all such corrective, remedial, or
other actions in a reasonable and professional manner and will use its
best efforts to do so in a timely and cost-

-47-
<PAGE>

effective manner. The Seller shall have the right to participate in the
planning and design of any such corrective, remedial, or other actions
by reviewing and commenting on a draft of any study, plan or report
associated with such actions before the study, plan or report is
submitted to the governmental authority. In planning and designing any
such study, plan or report and in considering Seller's comments,
suggestions and requests with respect thereto, the Company shall give
due consideration to the multiple goals of minimizing Environmental
Liabilities (including the selection of remedies which reflect customary
industry practices, are cost effective and consider all related business
and time requirements), avoiding Environmental Liabilities and fully
complying with all Environmental Laws. The Company shall in good faith
carefully consider each comment, suggestion or request made by Seller
with respect to the draft study, plan or report and will cooperate with
Seller by meeting periodically, at Seller's request, to discuss any such
study, plan or report. Seller shall maintain in confidence all
information provided by Buyer at any such meeting except to the extent
such information is otherwise available to the general public or is
information Seller is legally required to disclose. In addition , the
Company shall provide Seller copies of all reports, plans and
correspondence submitted to any governmental authority with respect to
such actions. Further, the Company shall provide Seller three days'
notice (or shall provide Seller notice as soon as practical if three
days' notice is not practical) of any formal meetings with, hearings
before, or other formal sessions with any governmental authority which
are expected to result in decisions regarding actions to be required by
the governmental authority that concern Environmental Liabilities for
which Seller may be responsible and will not object to Seller's
participation in such meetings or hearings.

11.07 Determination of Losses. A claim of an alleged breach or
Environmental Liability will be recoverable only to the extent of Losses and
Environmental Liabilities actually incurred or paid by the Indemnified Party.
The Parties shall make appropriate adjustments for tax benefits and tax costs
and insurance and other recoveries actually received (net of all costs and 
expenses incurred in connection with such recoveries) from non-Affiliates in
determining Losses and Environmental Liabilities for purposes of this Section 11
----------
or Section 5; and to the extent of Losses indemnified by a Party, such
--------- 
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to rights of the Indemnified Party in
respect of such Loss. All indemnification payments under this Section 11 shall
---------- 
be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price.

11.08 Effect of Indemnification Provisions. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the foregoing indemnification provisions in this Section 11 shall,
---------- 
following the Closing hereof, be the exclusive remedy of either Party for any
breach of the representations and warranties in Section 2 or Section 3 hereof;
--------- --------- 
provided that, the foregoing shall not limit the Parties' obligations for any
breach of a covenant or agreement contained in any Section other than Section 2
---------
or Section 3. If a claim for payment of a liquidated amount covered by a
--------- 
Party's indemnification obligations under this Agreement is made in accordance
with 

-48-
<PAGE>

the terms of this Agreement and is not paid within sixty (60) days after
such claim is received by the Party responsible for paying the same, the
liquidated amount of such claim shall bear interest at the Agreed Rate from the
date such claim was received until paid. Losses or Environmental Liabilities
incurred or paid by Universal Resources Corporation (or its Affiliates, or any
current, former or future directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders
or controlling persons of any of the foregoing, or any of the respective
successors, heirs or executors of any of the foregoing) on or after the Closing
Date in connection with or related to such Company Property shall be deemed to
have been incurred or paid by Buyer to the extent Buyer or the Company (or
another indemnified person hereunder) would be entitled to indemnity from Seller
if such Losses or Environmental Liabilities had been incurred or paid by Buyer
or the Company (or another indemnified person hereunder); provided that the
claim against Seller for indemnity for such Losses and Environmental Liabilities
must be made and administered by Buyer.

11.09 Company Negligence, Etc. IT IS EXPRESSLY AGREED THAT SELLER'S
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS SECTION 11, SECTION 5 OR UNDER ANY OTHER
---------- --------- 
SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSSES AND ENVIRONMENTAL
LIABILITIES, IF ANY, BASED ON NEGLIGENCE, ALLEGED NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE
OR ALLEGED GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY'S AFFILIATES, AND EACH
OF THE RESPECTIVE CURRENT OR FORMER DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
STOCKHOLDERS AND CONTROLLING PERSONS OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING.

31, 1994, either Buyer or Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving

that elects to terminate itself breaching any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement); provided, that in the event all applicable
waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act have not expired or otherwise terminated by March 31, 1994, neither
Party may unilaterally terminate this Agreement until the first to occur

<PAGE>

12.02 Effect of Termination. If any Party terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 12.01 above, such termination shall be the exclusive remedy
------------- 
for the breach by the other Party of any representations or warranties
hereunder; and all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall
terminate without any liability or responsibility of any Party to any other
Party (except for any liability of any Party for breach of its covenants or
agreements hereunder); provided, however, that the confidentiality and other
provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive termination.

12.03 Specific Performance. If, upon the breach by Seller of its
obligation to consummate the Closing of the sale of the Company Shares in
accordance with this Agreement, Buyer (i) elects to enforce its rights of
purchase as set forth in this Agreement and (ii) is prevented or delayed from
consummating such purchase by reason of Seller's breach of its obligations under
this Agreement (whether or not such breach is the result of willful misconduct
or otherwise) to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller hereby
acknowledges and agrees that the Company Shares constitute unique assets, that
damages for Seller's breach of contract would be difficult or impossible to
ascertain, that Buyer has no clear and adequate remedy at law and that as a
remedy for Seller's breach Buyer has the right, exercisable in its sole
discretion, to demand and obtain specific performance of this Agreement and of
Seller's obligation to consummate the Closing in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and as part of pursuing such remedy of specific performance may
pursue such other remedies as the Buyer may have under the terms of this
Agreement or at law or in equity.

which Seller is a party.

authority (including full corporate power and authority and all necessary
board approvals) to execute and deliver the Supplement and to perform its
obligations thereunder. The Supplement constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable against the Seller in
accordance with its terms and conditions except as such enforceability may

Affiliates (other than the Company and its subsidiaries) against any taxes and
any other losses, costs, or damages which it may incur solely as a direct result
of the change in allocation of consideration specified in paragraph 2.1 above to
the extent such taxes and related losses, costs, or damages exceed the aggregate

2.11 Sections 1.01, 1.02, 2.02(e), 14.12 and 14.13 of the Agreement are

(Title Matters)

all respects and shall be of no further force and effect.

3.2. The Agreement is amended and supplemented by attaching thereto
and incorporating therein as Schedule 7 to the Agreement, the form of Schedule 7
which is attached hereto as Schedule 7.

3.3 The Agreement is amended and supplemented by adding thereto the 
following additions to Section 7:

7.10 Title Defects for Undrilled Canyon Properties and Undrilled Non-
---------------------------------------------------------------
Canyon Properties. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
----------------- 
contrary, Title Defects for those of the Canyon Properties relating to the
Significant Properties identified in Schedule 7 as Undrilled Canyon Sand
and for those of the Non-Canyon Properties identified in Schedule 7 as
Undrilled Non-Canyon Sand shall be asserted, determined and resolved as
provided in the Agreement as supplemented and amended by the following
paragraphs, which shall only be applicable to Title Defects for such
Undrilled Canyon Sand and Undrilled Non-Canyon Sand:

(a) Title Defects. Seller has furnished or caused the Company
------------- 
to furnish to Buyer the Ozona Information. In the manner and within
the time provided in this Agreement, Buyer shall furnish to Seller
Title Defect Notices for each Lease or portion thereof for which Buyer
disagrees with the WI or NRI set out in the Ozona Information for any
Lease in any Ozona Formation. Except as

10
<PAGE>

otherwise provided in this Section 7.10, Buyer's notice shall be
treated in the same fashion as any other Title Defect Notice except
that it shall specify only the WI or NRI discrepancy and shall not
ascribe a Defect Amount for such discrepancy. Buyer may also assert
Title Defects as contemplated by Section 7.10(d) below.

(b) Canyon Value Adjustment. When the last of all Title Defects
----------------------- 
asserted by Buyer under this Agreement has been resolved, a
calculation shall be made comparing the Net Acres in the Canyon
Properties with the Canyon Threshold. If the number of Net Acres in
the Canyon Properties is less than the Canyon Threshold, then the
Canyon Properties' value shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
product obtained by multiplying the Canyon Value by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of Net Acres by which the Canyon
Threshold exceeds the Net Acres calculated for the Canyon Properties
and the denominator of which is the Canyon Threshold.

(c) Non-Canyon Value Adjustment. When the last of all Title
--------------------------- 
Defects asserted by Buyer under the Agreement has been resolved, a
calculation shall be made comparing the sum of the Net Acres in each
of the Ozona Formations comprising the Non-Canyon Properties with the
Non-Canyon Threshold. If the number of Net Acres in the Non-Canyon
Properties is less than the Non-Canyon Threshold, then the Non-Canyon
Value shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product obtained by
multiplying the Non-Canyon Value by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of Net Acres by which the Non-Canyon

11
<PAGE>

Threshold exceeds the Net Acres calculated for the Non-Canyon
Properties and the denominator of which is the Non-Canyon Threshold.

(d) Application of Other Title Defects. Reductions in the
---------------------------------- 
Canyon Value and the Non-Canyon Value shall be added to the Title
Defect Adjustment provided in Section 7.09 of the Agreement. In
addition to the adjustments provided above for Canyon and Non-Canyon
Properties, Buyer may assert any and all Title Defects as provided in
the Agreement including Title Defects relating to currently existing
Wells and Units in the Canyon Properties and Non-Canyon Properties.
The Defect Amounts with respect to such other Title Defects shall be
determined by treating the undrilled Canyon Properties as a single
Significant Property and the undrilled Non-Canyon Properties as a
single Significant Property. For purposes of determining the number
(but not the location) of the wells to be drilled on the Canyon
Properties and Non-Canyon Properties, the wells projected in the
informal schedule delivered by Buyer to Seller on or about March 1,
1994, for the undrilled locations in Crockett County, Texas, will be
deemed projected for the applicable Ozona Formations. A Title Defect
shall exist with respect to the Company's WI in the Canyon Properties
if the Company's weighted average WI (determined on the basis of the
Canyon Properties containing 150,000 gross acres) is greater than
64.5% (without at least a proportionate increase in the Company's
aggregate weighted average NRI of 52.8%). A Title Defect shall exist
with respect to the Company's WI in the Non-Canyon Properties if the
Company's weighted average WI (determined on the

12
<PAGE>

basis of the Non-Canyon Properties containing 480,000 gross acres) is
greater than 64.5% (without at least a proportionate increase in the
Company's aggregate weighted average NRI of 52.8%). Any Title Defects
resolved to a Defect Amount shall be deducted from the value of the
Canyon Properties or the Non-Canyon Properties as applicable. To the
extent that any Title Defect asserted by Buyer is duplicative of any
other Title Defect, adjustments in value shall be made to avoid
duplication; provided that, Title Defects asserted by Buyer with
respect to currently existing Wells and Units in the Canyon Properties
or in the Non-Canyon Properties shall not be considered to be
duplicative of any Title Defect asserted by Buyer under this Section
-------
7.10.
---- 

7.11 Title Defects for Mineral Fee Interests. Notwithstanding
--------------------------------------- 
anything contained herein to the contrary, Title Defects for Mineral Fee
Interests shall be asserted, determined and resolved as provided in this
Agreement as supplemented and amended by the following paragraphs:

(a) When used with respect to the Mineral Fee Interests, the
term "Good and Defensible Title" means, with respect to the ownership
of Mineral Fee Interests in a Title Subdivision in the Mineral Fee
Listings, a record title that (a) entitles the Company to the benefits
of ownership of aggregate Net Mineral Acres and Net Surface Acres in
such Title Subdivision of not less than the number of purported Net
Mineral Acres and Net Surface Acres listed for such Title Subdivision
in the Mineral Fee Listings and (b) is free and clear of all liens,
security interests, collateral assignments, encumbrances, clouds on
title,

13
<PAGE>

irregularities and defects except for Permitted Encumbrances. The
value per purported Net Mineral Acre or Net Surface Acre included in a
Significant Property shall be the amount determined by dividing the
value assigned in Schedule 7 to all purported Net Mineral Acres and
Net Surface Acres in the county or parish in which such Significant
Property is located by the number of purported Net Mineral Acres and
Net Surface Acres shown in Schedule 7 as being owned by the Company in
such county or parish; provided that, in instances where value is
assigned to purported Net Mineral Acres and Net Surface Acres only on
a state by state basis in Schedule 7, the value per purported Net
Mineral Acre or Net Surface Acre included in a Significant Property
shall be the amount determined by dividing the value assigned in
Schedule 7 to all purported Net Mineral Acres and Net Surface Acres in
the state in which such Significant Property is located by the number
of purported Net Mineral Acres and Net Surface Acres shown in Schedule
7 as being owned by the Company in such state.

(b) For purposes only of determining Defect Amounts with respect
to Title Defects for Mineral Fee Interests, Section 7.04 of the
------------ 
Agreement shall be deemed to be amended by replacing paragraphs (c)
and (d) of Section 7.04 with the following new paragraphs (c) and (d):
------------ 

(c) If the Title Defect results from the Company owning less Net
Mineral Acres or Net Surface Acres in a Significant Property than
the number of purported Net Mineral Acres (and Net Surface Acres,
if applicable) specified for such Significant Property in the
Mineral Fee Listings, then, the Defect Amount shall be equal to
the product obtained by multiplying the value per Net Mineral
Acre or Net Surface Acre for

14
<PAGE>

that Significant Property by the reduction in the number of Net
Mineral Acres or Net Surface Acres from that specified for such
Significant Property in the Mineral Fee Listings.

(d) Paragraph (d) of Section 7.04 is intentionally omitted for
------------ 
purposes of determining Defect Amounts with respect to Mineral
Fee Interests.

(c) If during the applicable Cure Period with respect to any
Title Defects asserted with respect to a Significant Property included
in the Mineral Fee Interests, Seller proves to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer (or the Arbitrator subsequently determines
pursuant to Section 7.08) that the aggregate number of Net Mineral
------------ 
Acres and Net Surface Acres owned by the Company on the Closing Date
in another Significant Property in the same county or parish (or state
in instances where purported Net Mineral Acres or Net Surface Acres
are listed on a state by state basis) exceeds the number of purported
Net Mineral Acres and Net Surface Acres listed for such other
Significant Property in the Mineral Fee Listings, then, when the last
of all Title Defects asserted by Buyer under the Agreement with
respect to such first mentioned Significant Property have been
resolved and without duplication of any other setoff allowed to Seller

Company or the Buyer after the Closing Date, but is offered employment by
Universal Resources Corporation ("Universal") or any of its Affiliates on
or immediately after the Closing Date (hereinafter a "Universal Employee"),
such employee will be treated as a Transferred Employee who is covered
under and actually entitled to lump-sum severance benefits payable with
respect to salary only pursuant to the applicable Plan described in Section
5.04(p)(2) to the extent such Universal Employee would have been covered
under such applicable Plan if his employment with the Company had been
terminated after the Closing Date.

(4) Buyer agrees that on or prior to the Closing Date the Company may
pay sixty (60) days pay to former employees of the Company whose employment

Field and the Deep Wilcox (below C5) formation in the Roleta Field.
Without in any way limiting or otherwise affecting Buyer's rights under the
Agreement with respect to such Title Defects, during the Title Examination
Period, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to continue to lease or cause
the Company to attempt to lease the rights covering those above zones in
the above fields. If Buyer or the Company cures all or a portion of a
Title Defect which results from the existence of such unleased interests by
causing the lease of the same during the Title Examination Period, then, at
Seller's option, the Defect Amount with respect to the portion of such
Title Defect which is so cured by Buyer's or the Company's acquisition of
such lease shall be the costs and expenses incurred by Buyer or the Company
in acquiring such lease rather than the Defect Amount which would otherwise
be determined under Section 7.
