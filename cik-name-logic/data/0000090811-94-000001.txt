AMERICAN STORES COMPANY ANNOUNCES
1993 FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR RESULTS

SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH-March 1, 1994-American Stores Company (NYSE:ASC) today
announced 1993 fourth quarter earnings of $1.52 per share before non-
recurring charges compared to $1.35 per share in 1992. The fourth quarter
included non-recurring items totaling $0.09 per share, representing costs
associated with the January 1994 earthquake in southern California, legal
settlement related to meat products in California, and severance programs
stemming from the Company's expense reduction programs. Reported net
earnings were $101.7 million, or $1.43 per share.

Earnings for the fifty-two week fiscal year before the non-recurring charges
in each year (as described on page 10 of this press release) were $3.60 per
share in 1993 compared to $3.16 per share in 1992. Reported net earnings
were $247.1 million, or $3.48 per share, in 1993 and $207.5 million, or $2.96
per share, in 1992.

Total sales were $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter and $18.8 billion for the
full year. Like-stores sales, or sales from stores that have been open at
least one year, declined 0.4 percent in the year's final quarter, which
reflects an improvement from the earlier quarters of 1993. For the 52 weeks,
like-store sales fell one percent.

Operating profit in the 1993 fourth quarter, before non-recurring costs
related to operations of $7.6 million, increased to $240.7 million (4.94
percent of sales) from $220.3 million (4.54 percent of sales) in 1992. For
the year, operating profit before the non-recurring items improved to $649.5
million (3.46 percent of sales) from $623.3 million (3.27 percent of sales). 
The operating profit figures for both the current and previous years include
an annual charge of approximately $79 million, or nearly $1 per share,
related to the Company's purchase accounting amortization. Operating profit
was $728.7 million (3.88 percent of sales) for the fiscal year and $260.5
million (5.35 percent of sales) for the fourth quarter, before this
amortization. The Company experienced lower inflation in its grocery and
drug stores throughout the year, which influenced the LIFO calculation. For
1993, the LIFO charge was $7.2 million, down from the prior year's charge of
$16.5 million. The LIFO credit in the fourth quarter was $22.8 million,
slightly lower than the $23.5 million credit recorded in the fourth quarter
of 1992.

Generally lower interest rates, in part resulting from the Company's
refinancings in 1993, helped lower total interest expense to $189.8 million
in 1993 from $214.4 million in 1992. At the fiscal year end, American Stores
Company's total debt was $2.2 billion, down $80.3 million from the prior year
end. The debt to total capital ratio improved to 55.4 percent at year end,
down sharply from 59.3 percent at the end of 1992.

Victor L. Lund, president and chief executive officer, said "We are extremely
pleased with the 1993 fiscal year results, and especially the performance
turned in by our associates in the fourth quarter. In retail, the fourth
quarter is key, and our team truly rose to the occasion."

Each of the Company's three operating segments achieved higher profits in the
1993 fourth quarter compared to the prior year. In particular, fourth
quarter operating profit before non-recurring costs was up 19.0 percent over
1992 in the western food operations. "The fourth quarter like-stores sales
in our southern California Lucky operations were the highest we have recorded
since the second quarter of 1990, reflecting the benefit of the price program
we initiated at the beginning of the year. Consumers appreciate Lucky's
consistent everyday low price strategy, especially in these tough economic
times." said Mr. Lund.

Mr. Lund also praised each of the Company's operations for their expense
management in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses in the final quarter of
1993 were lower than the previous year as a percentage of sales. "Our teams
have aggressively attacked expenses at all levels of the organization. This
approach is important to our current success. In fact, it is essential to
our survival in this extremely competitive retail environment."

The Company's ambitious capital expenditure plan was fulfilled in 1993. 
Total capital expenditures for the fifty-two week year were $652.9 million,
with 39 new stores opened and 233 remodels completed. Additionally, the
Company acquired and integrated 55 Reliable drug stores and 4 Thrifty drug
stores during the year. Mr. Lund reiterated the Company's commitment to its
capital spending program in 1994.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the Company's tax
rate by one percent. The fourth quarter impact of this increase totaled two
cents per share, and for the year, the impact totaled thirteen cents per
share, including a one-time deferred tax adjustment of six cents per share.

American Stores Company is one of the nation's largest food and drug
retailers. It operates 1,695 stores in 27 states. Its principal retail
operations include Jewel Food Stores, headquartered in Melrose Park,
Illinois; Acme Markets, headquartered in Malvern, Pennsylvania; Star Market,
headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Lucky Stores, headquartered in San
Leandro and Buena Park, California; Jewel Osco, headquartered in Albuquerque,
New Mexico; Osco Drug, headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois; and Sav-on
drugs, headquartered in Anaheim, California.
