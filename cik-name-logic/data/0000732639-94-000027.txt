THIRD QUARTER NET INCOME UP SIGNIFICANTLY

SCHAUMBURG, ILLINOIS, OCTOBER 19, 1994 -- Santa Fe Pacific

Corporation (SFP) reported third quarter net income from

continuing operations of $50.5 million or $0.27 per share

compared to net income from continuing operations, adjusted to

exclude special items, of $12.0 million or $0.07 per share a year

ago.

"The company's performance was driven primarily by railroad

operating income of $117.8 million, which was the highest

quarterly operating income in Santa Fe Railway's history," said

Robert D. Krebs, chairman, president and chief executive officer.

"Intermodal traffic growth and continued operating efficiencies

contributed to this record-setting performance."

RAILWAY RESULTS

Operating income of $117.8 million was more than double the

third quarter of 1993, which was significantly impacted by last

year's midwestern flooding. Rail revenues of $680.2 million rose

16% as volumes increased 11% over last year and average revenue

per car improved 4%. The quarterly operating ratio improved to

82.7% from 91.5% in 1993.

Intermodal traffic was up sharply, partially because this was

the business segment most severely impacted by the 1993 flood.

Intermodal revenues of $308.2 million were 33% higher than last

year. Revenues in the direct marketing segment, which includes

J.B. Hunt Transport and United Parcel Service business and less-

than-truckload (LTL) shipments, rose 41% compared to 1993.

Revenues from intermodal marketing companies were up 31% compared

to last year.

Automotive business revenues were $49.0 million, up 27%

compared to 1993 as carloadings rose 13%. Carload commodity

revenues increased 7% to $156.2 million due principally to

increased shipments of lumber and petroleum products. Bulk

commodities revenues of $154.5 million were down 2% compared to

last year as decreased grain shipments were largely offset by

increases in coal and grain products.

While overall volumes increased 11%, operating expenses

increased only 5% to $562.4 million. Compensation and benefits

expense rose $13.5 million or 7% and contract services expenses

rose $18.5 million or 22% due to higher volumes and increased use

of contract services for locomotive maintenance.

OTHER RESULTS

SFP interest expense of $29.6 million was 13% lower than last

year due to reduced debt levels. SFP's equity investment in

Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline Partners, L.P. produced income of $9.3

million in the third quarter compared to adjusted income of $8.7

million in the prior year. Pipeline revenues were up 5% compared

to last year, reflecting higher commercial volumes.

1994 YEAR-TO-DATE

For the first nine months of 1994, SFP reported adjusted net

income from continuing operations of $123.5 million or $0.65 per

share compared to $61.4 million or $0.33 per share a year ago,

excluding special items in both periods. The improvement was due

primarily to business growth at Santa Fe Railway as operating

income for the first nine months of this year was $305.9 million

compared to $202.9 million last year. The railroad's operating

ratio for 1994 to-date is 84.5% compared to 88.6% for 1993.
