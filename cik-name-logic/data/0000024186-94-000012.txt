ITEM OF INFORMATION

Item 5. Other Events

Contel of California, Inc. today announced that its results for
the fourth quarter of 1993 will include a one-time pre-tax
restructuring charge of $49.0 million related primarily to the
implementation of its re-engineering plan over the next three
years. The restructuring charge will reduce fourth quarter and
full year net income by $30.2 million.

The re-engineering plan will redesign and streamline processes in
order to improve customer-responsiveness and product quality,
reduce the time necessary to introduce new products and services
and further reduce costs. The re-engineering plan includes $20.0
million to upgrade or replace existing customer service and
administrative systems and enhance network software, $22.6
million for employee separation benefits associated with
workforce reductions and $6.1 million primarily for the
consolidation of facilities and operations and other related
costs. The charge for employee separation benefits includes
$11.4 million related to the recognition of previously deferred
postretirement health and life insurance costs for separating
employees.
