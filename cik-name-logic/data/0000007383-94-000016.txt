Item 5. Other Events.

As previously described in Armco Inc.'s ("Armco") Form 10-Q for the 
quarter ended March 31, 1994, on or about April 7, 1994, an action was filed 
in the United States Court for the District of Minnesota by the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC"), on its own behalf and as statutory 
trustee of the Pension Plan for Reserve Mining Company ("Reserve Mining"). 
As previously discussed in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
1993, the PBGC seeks judgment against Armco for the liability of Reserve 
Mining, a Minnesota partnership between a subsidiary of Armco and a 
subsidiary of LTV Company, for the alleged underfunded amount of guaranteed 
benefits to be paid by the PBGC of approximately $21.4 million plus 
interest.

On June 30, 1994, Armco settled this litigation. Under the agreement, 
Armco paid the PBGC $10 million in connection with the Reserve Mining 
pension liability and by July 15, 1994 Armco will contribute to the Armco 
Inc. Pension Agreements Plan the sum of $17.5 million in cash.
