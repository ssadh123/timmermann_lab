ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On December 30, 1993, the United States District Court for the
District of Arizona entered orders and final judgments (1) dismissing the
consolidated shareholder class litigation and shareholder derivative
litigation initiated in 1988 and 1989, respectively , and (2) partially
dismissing litigation initiated by the Resolution Trust Corporation (the
"RTC") in 1991 against certain former directors of MeraBank, A Federal
Savings Bank (the "RTC Litigation"). See "Legal Proceedings--Suits" in Part
I, Item 3 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1992.

Two non-settling individuals who are pursuing independent claims
against the RTC were not dismissed from the RTC Litigation. These
individuals may attempt to look to the Company, its insurance carriers and
others for indemnification of certain costs and damages. The Company
believes that it has no obligation with respect to any such costs or
damages.

The settlement provides for payments totaling $61.625 million, of
which the Company's share is $5.75 million. A litigation reserve previously
established by the Company is sufficient to cover the Company's share of the
settlement. The balance of the settlement payment will be funded by the
Company's insurers.
