AMETEK REPORTS 1993 RESULTS, INCLUDING PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING 
CHARGE; BALANCE OF CHARGE FOR EARLY REDEMPTION OF DEBT TO BE RECORDED IN 1994

Paoli, Pa., February 10, 1994 -- AMETEK Inc. (NYSE:AME) today reported results
for the year ended December 31, 1993, and the fourth quarter. The company had 
previously announced a plan to enhance shareholder value, which included an 
expectation that fourth quarter 1993 results would include charges of up to 
$40 million (after tax) primarily related to restructuring of operations and 
early retirement of debt. The related charges recorded in the fourth quarter 
totaled $28.6 million; another after tax charge of approximately $13 million 
for early retirement of existing debt will be recorded in 1994 when the 
company completes its public and bank financings.

Results Before Restructuring and Other Charges
- ----------------------------------------------
Income for 1993 before restructuring and other unusual operating charges was
$26.2 million or 60 cents per share on sales of $732.2 million. This compares
to net income of $44.4 million or $1.01 per share on sales of $769.6 million
in 1992. Fourth quarter earnings before restructuring and other charges were
$7.0 million or 16 cents per share on sales of $183.3 million. This compares
to net income of $10.6 million or 24 cents per share on sales of $191.5
million for the fourth quarter of 1992.

AMETEK REPORTS 1993 RESULTS, INCLUDING PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING 
CHARGE; BALANCE OF CHARGE FOR EARLY REDEMPTION OF DEBT TO BE RECORDED IN 1994
(cont'd p. 2)

Restructuring and Other Charges
- -------------------------------

The Company said restructuring and other unusual operating charges of $33.5 
million (after tax) for the year include $22.6 million of restructuring 
charges and $6.0 million of other unusual charges recorded in the fourth 
quarter and resizing charges of $4.9 million recorded in the first nine 
months. These charges were primarily for planned work force reductions, asset
write-downs, product line relocations of certain U.S. Gauge operations from 
Sellersville, Pa., consolidation of its aerospace operations and various 
other costs. AMETEK previously asked the union at the Sellersville plant to 
modify the existing labor agreement to adjust work rules and reduce labor 
costs to improve its competitive position in world markets; the union rejected
these modifications which resulted in management's decision to take 
restructuring actions.

Results After Restructuring and Other Charges
- ---------------------------------------------

After restructuring and other unusual operating charges, the company reported 
a net loss of $7.3 million or 17 cents per share for the year ended December 
31, 1993. After restructuring and other charges, a fourth quarter net loss of
$21.6 million or 50 cents per share was reported.

Plan to Enhance Shareholder Value Is Moving Forward
- ---------------------------------------------------

Walter E. Blankley, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our 
four-point plan to enhance shareholder value is moving forward. The 
company has reached an agreement in principle regarding the prepayment premiums 
for early retirement of our debt. We expect to record an extraordinary charge
of approximately $13 million (after tax) upon completion of the refinancing. 
We are in the process of converting our bank financing commitment into a 
definitive Credit Agreement. Additionally, a registration statement for the 
public financing has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and, after updating it to include 1993 audited financial statements, we expect
to proceed with the public offering in March."

Exhibit 99(a)

1993 Operating Performance 
- --------------------------
Mr. Blankley continued, "Electro-mechanical Group sales were lower due to 
reduced domestic and European demand and the negative effect of translating 
sales from our Italian operations into U.S. dollars. Operating profit was 
impacted by the costs of new product introductions, a new plant start-up and 
a related plant realignment to increase capacity, changes in product mix and 
negative currency translation effects."

"Lower 1993 sales by the Precision Instruments Group reflect the poor conditions
in the aerospace and process control markets," Mr. Blankley said. "Actions to
resize and restructure the aerospace and general gauge businesses will bring
our cost structure more in line with today's market realities."

Mr. Blankley continued, "Sales of the Industrial Materials Group for 1993 
increased, primarily due to the strength of demand for liquid filtration 
products, specialty metal products and compounded plastics. An increase in the
Specialty Metal Products Division operating profit was offset by flat or lower
profits from the other businesses and certain restructuring charges."

Fourth Quarter 1993 Results Show Improvement Over Third Quarter
- ---------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Blankley concluded, "Performance in the fourth quarter of 1993 compared to 
the third quarter shows improvement. Earnings per share, before restructuring 
and other charges, increased from 11 cents per share in the third quarter to 
16 cents per share in the fourth quarter. This was primarily due to improved 
sales and operating profits in the Electro-mechanical Group."
