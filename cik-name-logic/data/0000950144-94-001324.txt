Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On June 28, 1994, pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement dated
May 25, 1994, by and among JPS Textile Group, Inc. ("JPS" or the "Company"),
JPS Auto Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Auto"), JPS
Converter and Industrial Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
("C&I"), Foamex International Inc. ("Foamex") and JPS Automotive Products
Corp., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Foamex ("Purchaser"), the
Company consummated the disposition of its Automotive Assets (as described
below) to the Purchaser.

The Automotive Assets consisted of (i) the businesses and assets of Auto and
the synthetic industrial fabrics division of C&I, and (ii) the Company's
investment in common stock of the managing general partner of Cramerton
Automotive Products, L.P. In addition, the Purchaser agreed to assume
substantially all of the liabilities and obligations associated with the
Automotive Assets.

The purchase price for the Automotive Assets was approximately $276 million,
consisting of $264 million of cash paid at closing and $12 million of assumed
debt (as of April 30, 1994), subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The 
purchase price was determined by arms-length negotiations between the parties.

The net cash proceeds from the disposition of the Automotive Assets (after
deductions for (i) fees, (ii) other expenses and (iii) amounts designated by
management to satisfy possible contingent tax liabilities) are approximately
$213 million and such proceeds will be used by the Company to reduce its
outstanding indebtedness. Additional information regarding the use of proceeds
from the disposition of the Automotive Assets is contained in the press release
issued by the Company on June 28, 1994, filed as Exhibit 20.1 hereto and
incorporated herein by reference.

JPS TEXTILE GROUP, INC.
INTRODUCTION TO PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
(UNAUDITED)

The unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations
for the six months ended April 30, 1994 and the year ended October 30, 1993
present the results of the continuing operations of JPS Textile Group, Inc.
assuming that the sale of the Automotive Assets, as described in item 2 of this
report, was consummated as of the beginning of the periods indicated. The
statements include all material adjustments necessary to present historical
results reflecting these assumptions. The gain for financial accounting
purposes, net of taxes thereon, related to the sale of the Automotive Assets is
estimated to be approximately $135 million and has not been reflected in the
unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Condensed Statement of Operations.

The unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as of April 30,
1994 assumes that the sale of the Automotive Assets occurred on April 30, 1994.
The unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as presented
assumes net debt reduction, after the sale of the Automotive Assets, of
approximately $215 million, for the reduction of $66 million of bank debt, $102
million of senior secured notes, and $47 million of senior subordinated debt
(including related interest accruals). The respective amounts of debt
reduction described above are for purposes of presentation of the unaudited Pro
Forma Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as of April 30, 1994 and do not
reflect the actual debt reduction that will occur as described herein. In 
addition, the pro forma financial information assumes that $39.5 million 
designated by management to satisfy possible contingent tax liabilities has 
been invested in long-term investment securities.

The pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of the
results of operations or the financial position which would have actually been
obtained if the sale of the Automotive Assets had been consummated on the dates
indicated. In addition, the pro forma financial information does not purport
to be indicative of the results of operations or the financial position of the
Company which may be attained in the future.

The pro forma financial information has been prepared by the Company and all
calculations have been made based upon assumptions deemed appropriate. Certain
of these assumptions are set forth under the Notes to Pro Forma Consolidated
Condensed Financial Information. As of the date of this filing, the Company
has reasonably completed its quantification of the final accounting for the
sale of the Automotive Assets based upon currently available information. Such
information may be revised at a later date based upon additional information.
The gross proceeds amount is subject to a purchase price adjustment based on
audited net assets sold on June 28, 1994. The amount of such purchase price
adjustment has been estimated based on unaudited net assets at April 30, 1994
and such purchase price adjustment of approximately $6.4 million has been
included in accounts receivable in the accompanying unaudited Pro Forma 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any additional proceeds received as a result of 
such adjustment will be used to reduce senior subordinated debt. Management 
does not expect such adjustment to result in a reduction of the gross proceeds.

The pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the
Company's historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in its
1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

In the Form 10-Q for the period ended April 30, 1994, filed June 20, 1994, the
sale of the Automotive Assets was given discontinued operations treatment in
the unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Condensed Statement of Operations for the
six months ended April 30, 1994 (in this Form 8-K, certain previously reported
expense amounts were reclassified between income from continuing operations and
discontinued operations) and in the April 30, 1994 unaudited Pro Forma
Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet. Accordingly, the historical amounts in
this Form 8-K for such periods reflect the discontinued operations treatment.
There has not been a prior public filing where the Automotive Assets were given
discontinued operations treatment in the unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated
Condensed Statement of Operations for the year ended October 30, 1993.
Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments to the unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated
Condensed Statement of Operations for the year ended October 30, 1993 reflect
all adjustments necessary to remove the operating results of the Automotive
Assets from those of the Company.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

JPS TEXTILE GROUP COMPLETES SALE OF
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS AND SYNTHETIC INDUSTRIAL FABRICS
BUSINESS TO FOAMEX INTERNATIONAL

GREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA, June 28, 1994 -- JPS Textile Group, Inc. announced
today that it has completed the sale of its automotive products and synthetic
industrial fabrics businesses to JPS Automotive Products Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Foamex International Inc. (NASDAQ: FMXI), for approximately $276
million (which includes approximately $12 million in assumed long-term debt),
subject to post-closing adjustments.

The net cash proceeds available for debt reduction are approximately $213
million after reserves for taxes, fees and other expenses, which the Company
expects to approximate $51 million. In accordance with the terms of the
Company's various credit agreements and indentures, the Company will apply the
net cash proceeds to pay all outstanding borrowings under its bank credit
agreement of approximately $166 million and then, within 30 days, utilize the
remaining approximately $47 million to make offers to redeem, in order of
priority at par plus accrued interest, the Company's outstanding senior
subordinated notes, senior subordinated discount notes and junior subordinated
debentures. JPS Textile Group currently has outstanding $125 million principal
amount of its senior subordinated notes and approximately $151 million accreted
value of its senior subordinated discount notes, which are of equal priority,
and $75 million principal amount of its junior subordinated debentures.

Contemporaneously with the closing of the asset sale, JPS Textile Group has
entered into a new $135 million revolving credit facility and will use bank
borrowings to redeem all $93.5 million principal amount of its outstanding
senior secured notes.
