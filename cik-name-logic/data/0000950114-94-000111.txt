On September 30, 1994, the registrant acquired all of the issued
and outstanding stock of Halmode Apparel, Inc. (the "Company")
pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated August 24, 1994,
as amended September 30, 1994.

The consideration paid on September 30, 1994, consisted of a
$40,750,000 cash fixed purchase price payment. In addition, a
deferred purchase price of $2,250,000 is to be paid in two cash
installments on September 30, 1995 and 1996; also, the sellers may be
entitled to a cash contingent purchase price covering a five year period
beginning October 1, 1994 and ending September 30, 1999. The annual
contingent purchase price payment for each period will be

The stock was purchased from the shareowners of the Company. There is no
material relationship between the sellers and the registrant or any of its
affiliates, any director or officer of the registrant, or any associate of
any such director or officer.

The source of the funds for the acquisition was the registrant's

ARTICLE II
CONSIDERATION FOR TRANSFER

2.1. Determination of the Purchase Price.
-----------------------------------

(a) Formula. The purchase price for the Shares shall be equal
-------
to: (i) (A) Forty Million Seven-Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($40,750,000) less (B) the amount, if any, by which the Shareholders'
----
Equity (as hereinafter defined) shall be less than Sixteen Million
Dollars ($16,000,000) (the excess of (A) over (B) being hereinafter
referred to as the "Fixed Purchase Price Amount"); plus (ii) the
----
Deferred Purchase Price Amount (as hereinafter defined); plus (iii)
----
the contingent payments (the "Contingent Purchase Price Amount")
described in Exhibit B attached hereto ((i), (ii) and (iii) are
collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase Price"). For
purposes of this Agreement: (i) "Shareholders' Equity" shall mean the
amount equal to the shareholders' equity of the Company as of the
Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), as determined pursuant to
paragraph (b) below; and (ii) Deferred Purchase Price Amount shall
mean (A) Two Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($2,250,000),
less (B) the amount by which the Fixed Purchase Price Amount shall be
- ----
less than zero (0), less (C) the amount of uncontroverted Buyer
----
Indemnification Claims (as hereinafter defined) asserted in writing on
or prior to the last day of the two (2) year period following the
Closing Date.

(b) Closing Statement. Not later than forty-five (45) days
-----------------
after the Closing, the Sellers shall provide the Buyer with a
statement, for review by the Buyer and/or the Buyer's auditors, which
shall include: (i) a balance sheet for the Company as of the Closing
Date and (ii) the Seller's calculation of the Fixed Purchase Price
Amount based on the formula set forth in paragraph (a) above
(collectively, the "Closing Statement"). The Closing Statement shall
be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the
March 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993 Company financial statements.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the balance sheet referred to
in (i) above shall not include any Pre-Billed Sales, Pre-Shipped
Orders and Consignment Sales (as such terms are hereinafter defined)
shall be excluded in determining the Shareholders' Equity, except to
the extent of their inventory value. For purposes of this Agreement:
(i) "Pre-Billed Sales" shall mean sales billed to customers prior to
the actual shipment of goods to the customer from the finished goods
warehouse; (ii) "Pre-Shipped Orders" shall mean orders actually
shipped to a customer in advance of the customer's requested shipment
date, when the customer's requested shipment date is subsequent to the
Closing Date; and (iii) "Consignment Sales" shall mean any sales
recorded pursuant to consignment arrangements.

(c) Notice. Within forty-five (45) days following the
------
delivery of the Closing Statement, the Buyer shall notify the Sellers
in writing either that it accepts or disputes the Sellers' calculation
of the Fixed Purchase Price Amount, which notice shall include its
proposed adjustment to the Fixed Purchase Price Amount if it disputes
the same. If the Buyer fails to deliver such notice within such time,
the Closing Statement and Fixed Purchase Price Amount will be deemed
accepted by the Buyer.

(d) Dispute Resolution. If the Buyer delivers notice to the
------------------
Sellers that it disputes the Sellers' calculation of the Fixed
Purchase Price Amount, the Sellers shall respond to the Buyer's
objections and describe their position with respect thereto in writing
within fifteen (15) days following their receipt of the Buyer's
notice. The Buyer and the Sellers shall then make a good faith effort
to resolve any disputed items within fifteen (15) days following the
date of the Buyer's receipt of the

-2-
<PAGE> 8

Sellers' aforementioned written response. If they are unable to do so, and
if the amount of the disagreement in the aggregate is One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000) or less, such amount shall be adjusted between the Parties
equally by dividing the amount by two (2) and deeming the quotient so
determined to be the amount of the adjustment agreed to by the
Parties. Should the amount in dispute exceed One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate, the disputed items shall be
presented to the New York, New York office of the "Big Six" accounting
firm KPMG Peat Marwick (the "Arbitrator"), to make a final written
determination with respect to the correctness of each item remaining
in dispute. The Arbitrator shall not be regarded as a mere fact
finder or appraiser, but shall exercise its independent discretion and
judgment as an accountant. The Arbitrator will be directed to make a
final written determination within thirty (30) days of the dispute
being submitted to it. The Arbitrator shall have full access to all
requisite accounting and other records of the Company. Any
determination by the Arbitrator shall be consistent with: (i)
generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied; and
(ii) this Agreement. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on
the other hand, shall each bear one-half (1/2) of the costs and
expenses associated with the Arbitrator's review and determination,
unless the Arbitrator shall determine otherwise. All such costs and
expenses shall be paid promptly. The Arbitrator's determination of
all matters and disputes shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Buyer and the Sellers.

2.2. Payment of the Purchase Price.
-----------------------------

(a) Closing Payment. The initial payment of the Fixed
---------------
Purchase Price Amount to be made by the Buyer at Closing shall be
equal to Forty Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($40,750,000) (the "Closing Payment"). On the Closing Date, by wire
transfer of immediately available U.S. Dollar funds or other means
acceptable to the Parties, the Buyer shall pay the Closing Payment to
the Sellers in separate amounts equal to Forty Million Seven Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($40,750,000) multiplied by each Seller's Pro-
---------- --
Rata Percentage (as hereinafter defined). For purposes of this
Agreement, "Pro-Rata Percentage" shall mean with respect to each
Seller, such Seller's percentage ownership of all the Shares, as set
forth in Exhibit A.

(b) Post-Closing Payments of Fixed Purchase Price. Following
---------------------------------------------
the Closing, the Fixed Purchase Price Amount shall be finally
determined pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.1. In the
event that the Fixed Purchase Price Amount is less than the Closing
Payment, the Sellers shall pay the Buyer such difference. Any such
payment shall be due within two (2) business days following: (i) the
acceptance by the Sellers and the Buyer of the Closing Statement; or
(ii) the Arbitrator's determination regarding the Closing Statement,
in accordance with the procedures provided in Section 2.1. Such
payment shall also include interest from the Closing Date at the
reference rate of the Continental National Bank of Chicago, Illinois
and shall be made payable by certified cheque or bank draft or wire
funds transfer, as directed by the Buyer.

(c) Post-Closing Payments of the Deferred Purchase Price
----------------------------------------------------
Amount. Following the Closing, the Deferred Purchase Price Amount
- ------
shall be determined and payable to the Sellers in separate amounts
equal to the Deferred Purchase Price Amount for the applicable period
multiplied by each Seller's Pro-Rata Percentage, in accordance with
- ---------- --
the terms of a letter of credit agreement acceptable to all of the
Parties (the "L/C Agreement"). Pursuant to the L/C Agreement, the
Deferred Purchase Price Amount shall be payable in separate
installments of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) one (1) year
following the Closing Date and One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars

-3-
<PAGE> 9

($1,250,000) two (2) years following the Closing Date. All
such payments shall: (i) be reduced for the deductions described in
Section 2.1(a), if any, and as further provided in the L/C Agreement;
and (ii) also include interest from the Closing Date at the reference
rate of the Continental National Bank of Chicago, Illinois.

(d) Post-Closing Payments of the Contingent Purchase Price
------------------------------------------------------
Amount. The Contingent Purchase Price Amount, if any, shall be: (i)
- ------
determined in accordance with Exhibit B; and (ii) shall be payable in
the manner and time-frame specified in Exhibit B to each of the
Sellers in separate amounts equal to the Contingent Purchase Price
Amount for the applicable period multiplied by each Seller's Pro-Rata
---------- --
Percentage.

or termination options), basic annual rent, and any other material
terms. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(a) attached hereto, the

real property including all rights, options, land,

-14-
<PAGE> 20

buildings, leaseholds, leasehold improvements and other appurtenances related
thereto (collectively, the "Leased Real Property") and details of all
leases relating to the same, specifying in the case of leases or
subleases, the name of the lessor/lessee or sublessor/sublessee, the
lease term (specifying any renewal provisions or termination options),
basic annual rent, street address, legal description, options and
commitments, oral or written, and any other material terms. To the
best of the Selling Parties' knowledge, after due inquiry, all of such
leases are in good standing and are valid, binding, and in full force
and effect, and will be unaffected by the transactions contemplated
hereby. Except as set forth on such Schedule, to the best of the
Selling Parties' knowledge, after due inquiry, there is not under any
such lease any existing material default of the Company or of any
other party thereto, or event which, after notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a material default or result in a right to
accelerate against or loss of rights by the Company. In addition, no
notice has been received of any such event or default. The Company is
current with respect to all of its payment obligations and enjoys
peaceful and undisturbed possession of the Leased Real Property under
such leases. The Company has been in peaceable possession of the
Leased Real Property since the commencement of the original term of
each lease relating thereto.

(c) Condition of the Real Property. The buildings on the
------------------------------
Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property (collectively, the "Real
Property") and other improvements have been maintained, since their
occupancy by the Company, in a manner consistent with that of a
prudent owner. Such properties are in good operating condition and
repair, ordinary wear and tear and the repair required in the ordinary
course of business excepted. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(c)
attached hereto, no extraordinary expenditures either for repair or
replacement of any of the foregoing are foreseeable. The Selling
Parties are not aware of any structural defect to the buildings on the
Real Property or any part of the foundation, structure or roof
thereof. None of the buildings on the Leased Real Property is
subject to any outstanding work order or notice of defect or non-
compliance or other notice issued by any government department, board
or official, fire underwriter or like authority. Such properties
conform to all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations, except for
such minor variations as do not impair or interfere with the use of
such properties for the purposes for which they are employed, and the
Selling Parties have not received any notice to the contrary.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the Selling
Parties make no representation or warranty with regard to the
maintenance or condition of commercial office buildings or apparel
marts in which the Company leases less than ten percent (10%) of the
entire rentable space in such buildings or marts, except specifically
for that portion of such buildings or marts which the Company leases.

(d) Use, Agreements and Other Matters. The Company has not
---------------------------------
entered into any material agreement which might result in any of the
Real Property being subject to or assessed for any taxes, rates,
levies, assessments, local improvement rates or charges of a similar
nature other than as currently assessed. A true, correct and
complete copy of the real property tax bills for the Real Property for
the current tax year and bills with respect to any special assessments
affecting any of the Real Property has been delivered to the Buyer.
All real property taxes and special assessments with respect to the
Real Property which were due and payable prior to the date hereof have
been paid in full. The use being made of the Real Property is in
conformity in all material respects with the certificates of occupancy
issued for each of the Real Property. The Real Property and the
present use and condition thereof do not violate any applicable deed
restrictions or other covenants, restrictions or agreements, site plan
approvals, zoning or subdivision regulations or urban redevelopment
plans applicable thereto, as modified by any duly issued variances.
No party to any

-15-
<PAGE> 21

reciprocal easement agreement affecting any of the
Real Property is in default thereunder and no event has occurred
which, with the giving of notice, lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default thereunder. All maintenance payments with
respect to such reciprocal easement agreements which were due and
payable prior to the date hereof have been paid. The buildings
located on the Owned Real Property are located entirely within the
boundaries of such properties and there are no encroachments above
grade onto such properties. No building or other improvement which is
part of any of the Real Property encroaches, in any respect, upon any
property owned by any adjacent landowner or upon any real property
interest held by any other person with respect to any of the Real
Property (including easements on the Real Property) and no asset of

conditions to the Company following the Closing. There are no
disputes pending or, to the best of the Selling Parties' knowledge,

maintained in compliance in all material respects with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and
regulations, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Tax Code, which are
applicable to such Employee Benefit Plan. No Employee Benefit Plan is a
Multiemployer Plan (as hereinafter defined) and no Employee Benefit Plan is
subject to Title IV of ERISA. Neither the Company, nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates, has incurred or will incur any liability under Title IV of
ERISA or otherwise relating to any Employee Benefit Plan that could
become, after the Closing Date, an obligation of the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates. The Selling Parties have furnished to the Buyer copies

Service determination letters with respect to each such Employee
Benefit Plan. For purposes of this Agreement: (i) "ERISA Affiliate"
of any entity shall mean any other entity which, together with such

the case may be, by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates; and
(iii) covers any Employee (collectively, the "Employee Benefit

Arrangements have been made available or furnished previously to the
Buyer. Each Employee Benefit Arrangement has been maintained in
substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations
which are applicable to such Employee Benefit Arrangement. Neither
the Company, nor any of its ERISA Affiliates, have incurred or will
incur any liability relating to any Employee Benefit Arrangement that
could become, after the Closing Date, an obligation of the Buyer or
any of its Affiliates. No Employee is eligible for payments that
would constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Tax
Code or for other severance or separation type payments.

(d) Contributory Plans. With respect to each Employee
------------------
Benefit Plan or Employee Benefit Arrangement to which the Company is

value of its assets.

hereto contains a complete and correct list of the independent sales
representatives of the Company (the "Sales Reps") and a summary of the
sales volume (or, in the alternative, commission volume) of each such
Sales Rep for the twelve (12) months ended December 31, 1993 and the
material terms of the commission and expense arrangements or written
agreements between the Company and each such Sales Rep. None of the
Sales Reps has claimed that he, she or it has a written agreement with
the Company obligating the Company or its successors to continue to
engage such representative with respect to sales of the Company beyond
the term of his, her or its agreement. To the best of the Selling
Parties' knowledge, after due inquiry, there are no facts or
circumstances which may give rise to any material dispute between any
such representative and the Company.

4.17. Customers, Contractors and Suppliers. All outstanding
------------------------------------
contracts and orders with customers, contractors and suppliers of the
Business were entered into by or on behalf of the Company in the
ordinary course of business and consistently with past practice. Such
outstanding contracts or orders with customers, on average, are at a
gross profit substantially consistent with that experienced in the
Financial Statements and, there are no contracts with suppliers which

Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Selling Parties know of no
fact, condition or event which is presently materially adversely
affecting or in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the fulfillment of the terms hereof could
materially adversely affect the relationship of the Business with any
major customer, contractor or supplier.

4.18. Insurance. The Selling Parties have provided the Buyer
---------
with an accurate, correct and complete list and summary description
(including the name of the insurer, coverage, premium and expiration
date) of all binders, policies of insurance, insurance programs or

Company or in which the Company is a beneficiary or a named insured.
All Insurance has been issued by properly licensed insurance companies
under valid and enforceable policies or binders for the benefit of the
Company, and all such policies or binders are in such types and full
force and effect and are in amounts and for risks, casualties and

similar to the Business. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.18, there
are no pending or asserted claims by the Company against any Insurance
as to which any insurer has denied liability, and there are no claims
under any Insurance that have been disallowed or improperly filed.

No notice of cancellation or nonrenewal with respect to, or material
increase of premium for, any Insurance has been received by the
Company. The Selling Parties do not have knowledge of any facts or
the occurrence of any event which: (i) reasonably might form the basis
of any claim against the Company relating to the conduct or operations
of the Business and which will materially increase the insurance

-22-
<PAGE> 28

premiums payable under any Insurance, or (ii) otherwise will
materially increase the insurance premiums payable under any
Insurance.

4.19. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities; Liens. Except to the
-----------------------------------------
extent reflected in the Financial Statements or as listed on Schedule
4.19 attached hereto, the Company has no debts, obligations,
commitments or liabilities of any nature, whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether direct or indirect, primary or
secondary, due or to become due, and since December 31, 1993, the
Company has not incurred any liabilities other than in the ordinary
course of business on terms and conditions and in amounts consistent
with past practices. Schedule 4.19 also identifies all Liens against
or relating to the Company's assets and the Business, and except as
set forth on such Schedule, there is no basis for the assertion of any
more of the same. The Company is solvent having assets of a value
which exceeds its liabilities, and the Company is able to meet its
debts as they mature in the normal course of business.

of attorney or other authorizations to any persons to represent any
Taxpayer with respect to any Tax. Except as set forth on Schedule

possession or use of any product sold by the Company prior to the
Closing Date and any such liability, claim or obligation would be
fully covered by product liability insurance of the Company. To the
best of the Selling Parties' knowledge, after due inquiry, Schedule

not know, anticipate or have notice of any basis for any such action.
There is no order or injunction issued prohibiting consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. There is no judicial,
administrative or other proceeding, investigation or inquiry pending
or threatened seeking to enjoin, restrain or prohibit, or to obtain
damages in respect of, or which is related to or arises out of, this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
or which could reasonably be expected to: (i) impair or interfere in
any material respect with Buyer's ownership or operation of the
Company or the Business; (ii) reduce or materially adversely affect
the value of the Company or the Business; or (iii) result in any
material liability to the Buyer.

4.23. Compliance with Law. The Company, its assets and the

connection with any of the foregoing. There are no outstanding work
orders or notices relating to the Company, its assets or the Business

any police or fire department, sanitation, environmental, labour,
health or factory authorities or from any other federal, provincial or

any matters under discussion by the Company with any such departments
or authorities relating to work orders or notices. No notice from any
governmental body or other person of any violation of any statute,
code, ordinance, law, rule or regulation has been served upon the

licensee or any other person acting on behalf of the Company: (i) have

officials in their individual capacities for the purpose of affecting
their action or the action of the government they represent to obtain
special concessions, or (vii) have not made illegal payments to obtain

aspects of the Company's products which would cause any obligation to
report to any state, local or federal agency. None of the Selling
Parties, nor any of their assets, is a party to any settlement
agreement or instrument, or subject to any other corporate restriction
or any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, rule, regulation,
code, or ordinance which materially and adversely affects the

otherwise, of the Company or the Business.

Survival Period must be asserted in writing prior to the end of the
Survival Period, and if asserted in writing on or before the
expiration of the Survival Period, such claims shall survive until
resolved or judicially determined, and if not so asserted, then the
Parties shall be forever estopped and prohibited from asserting any
such Indemnification Claim hereunder.

7.2. Indemnification of the Buyer. In addition to their
----------------------------
obligation to indemnify the Buyer as otherwise set forth herein, the
Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold the Buyer
harmless against and in respect of the following: any and all claims,
demands, losses, costs, expenses (including court costs and reasonable
attorney fees), obligations, liabilities, damages, suits, causes of
action, deficiencies, taxes, interest on taxes, or penalties
(collectively the "Indemnification Claims"), plus interest at the
reference rate at the Continental National Bank of Chicago, Illinois,
from the date the Indemnification Claim is actually incurred by the
Buyer or the Company, that the Buyer or the Company may suffer or
incur which arise or result from or relate to any misrepresentation,
breach of warranty, or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on
the part of any of the Selling Parties, hereunder or under any other
agreement, certificate, or other document contemplated or furnished
(or to be furnished) hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Sellers shall only be severally, and

-34-
<PAGE> 40

not jointly, obligated for Indemnification Claims relating to breaches of the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.1(b) and (c).

7.3. Indemnification of the Sellers. In addition to its
------------------------------
obligation to indemnify the Sellers as otherwise set forth herein, the
Buyer shall indemnify and hold the Sellers harmless against and in
respect of any and all Indemnification Claims, plus interest at the
reference rate set forth in Section 7.2 herein, from the date the
Indemnification Claim is actually incurred by the Sellers, that the
Sellers may suffer or incur which arise or result from or relate to
any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or nonfulfillment of any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Buyer hereunder or under any
other agreement, certificate, or other document contemplated or
furnished (or to be furnished) hereunder.

7.4. Notice and Claim Procedure.
--------------------------

(a) General Requirements. Any Party who or which may be
--------------------
entitled to a right to recover indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement (the "Indemnified Party"): (i) shall give the persons or
entities required to make such indemnification (the "Indemnifying
Party") notice (which shall include all facts known to the Indemnified
Party giving rise to such right and an estimate of the amount thereof)
of the Indemnification Claim and any Third Party Claim (as hereinafter
defined) relating to such right promptly after receipt or becoming
aware thereof; (ii) prior to taking any material action with respect
to a Third Party Claim, shall consult with the Indemnifying Party as
to the procedure to be followed in defending, settling, or
compromising the Third Party Claim; (iii) shall not consent to any
settlement or compromise of the Third Party Claim without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent, unless the
Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the exclusive defense of such
Claim, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (iv) shall
permit the Indemnifying Party, if it so elects, to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim (including, except as provided below, the
compromise or settlement thereof) at its own cost and expense,
provided, however, that in such event the Indemnified Party shall have
- -------- -------
the right to approve the Indemnifying Party's choice of legal counsel,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the purposes
of this Agreement, "Third Party Claim" shall mean any Indemnification
Claim by any third party which gives rise or could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a right of indemnification hereunder.

(b) Consultation and Consent. If the Indemnified Party
------------------------
shall: (i) fail to notify or to consult with the Indemnifying Party
with respect to any Third Party Claim in accordance with subparagraph
(a)(i) or (a)(ii) above (which failure shall have a material and
adverse effect upon the Indemnifying Party); or (ii) consent to the
settlement or compromise of any Third Party Claim without having
received the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (unless, if the
Indemnifying Party has not elected to assume the defense of such
Claim, the consent of the Indemnifying Party is unreasonably withheld
or delayed), then the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its
indemnification obligation with respect to such Third Party Claim
under this Agreement.

(c) Defense of Claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall elect
----------------
to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this
Agreement, it shall notify the Indemnified Party in writing of such
election. The Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle any
such Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the party which defends any Third Party
Claim shall, to the

-35-
<PAGE> 41

extent required by applicable insurance policies, share or give control
thereof to any insurer with respect to such Claim.

7.5. Limitation on Indemnification. In the case of
-----------------------------
Indemnification Claims arising from any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty contained herein (except those contained in Section 4.1), the
obligation of indemnification set out in Sections 7.2 and 7.3 shall
not apply until such time as such cumulative Indemnification Claims of
the Indemnified Party in the aggregate exceeds Three Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($300,000). The liability of the Indemnifying Party for such
Indemnification Claims shall be limited to the amount by which the
same, in the aggregate, exceeds Three Hundred Thousand Dollars
($300,000).

7.6. Set-Off. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
-------
recover any indemnification payments due hereunder by setting off such
amount against any amount due from the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement or otherwise. Any
indemnification amounts due to the Indemnified Party which are not so
offset, shall be due and payable by the Indemnifying Party within
thirty (30) days of the Indemnifying Party's receipt of written notice
from the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party's rights hereunder
are cumulative and shall be in addition to all other rights and
remedies available at law or in equity.

ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS

8.1. Waiver; Amendment. Each Party may, at its option, waive
-----------------
in writing any and all of the obligations herein contained to which
any other Party is subject. The failure of any Party at any time to
require performance by any other Party of any provision hereof shall
in no way affect such Party's full right to require such performance
at any time thereafter. Nor shall the waiver by any Party of a breach
of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of any
succeeding breach of such provision or as a waiver of the provision
itself. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
instrument in writing executed by all Parties.

8.2. Counterparts; Attachments. This Agreement may be executed
-------------------------
simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be

the same instrument. All exhibits and schedules attached hereto and
all other documents referred to herein and delivered pursuant to and
in accordance with this Agreement are deemed to be an integral part of
this Agreement.

------------
be determined to be contrary to law or unenforceable, the remaining
provisions shall be severable and enforceable in accordance with their
terms.

8.4. Headings. The article, section and other headings
--------
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

8.5. Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall inure to the

benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns, provided that any assignment of this

-36-

Agreement or the rights hereunder by any Party hereto without the prior
written consent of all other Parties, except an assignment by the Buyer to a
successor to its business, shall be void.

8.6. Third-Party Beneficiary. This Agreement is solely for

the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and no other Party has any right, benefit, priority

Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any person other than the Parties hereto any rights, liabilities,
or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

8.7. Arms Length Contract. This Agreement has been negotiated
--------------------
"at arms length" by the Parties, each represented by counsel of its
choice and each having an equal opportunity to participate in the
drafting of the provisions hereof. Accordingly, in construing the
provisions of this Agreement no Party shall be presumed or deemed to
be the "drafter" or "preparer" of the same.

8.8. No Derogation. For greater certainty, it is acknowledged
-------------
and agreed that neither the delivery at Closing by any of the Selling
Parties of any certificate or other clearance from any government or
regulatory authority or any other person at or prior to the Closing
Date, nor any inspection, analysis or investigation prior to the
Closing Date by the Buyer respecting the Company, the Business, or the
Business records, shall derogate from any right or remedy that the
Buyer may have against any of the Sellers for breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or indemnity from them contained
herein.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
----------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF HALMODE APPAREL, INC.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of
HALMODE APPAREL, INC. as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows
for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of HALMODE APPAREL, INC. as of December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market.

Depreciation and Amortization

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization is computed by straight-line and
accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the
assets.

Debt acquisition costs are amortized over the term of the
debt.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected S Corporation status for Federal
income tax purposes and for certain states. Under these
elections, the Company's taxable income or loss is reportable
by its stockholders on their individual income tax returns, and
the Company makes no provisions for Federal income tax and
income taxes of the states for which S Corporation status was
elected.

2 - ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

The Company sells women's apparel to a cross section of
retailers throughout the country. Accounts receivable
financing arrangements with banks provide for advances of up to
85% of all trade receivables with interest at the prime rate.
Under an arrangement with an insurer, a substantial portion of
the Company's receivables, as defined, are insured. The
majority of uninsured receivables are from major retailers.
All accounts receivable, including amounts due from salesmen,
are pledged as collateral for the bank loans.
