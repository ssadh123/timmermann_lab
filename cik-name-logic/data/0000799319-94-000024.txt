IDB RETAINS ARTHUR ANDERSEN & CO. AS NEW OUTSIDE AUDITOR

Los Angeles, CA -- June 26, 1994 -- IDB Communications
Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: IDBX) announced today that Arthur Andersen
& Co. has been retained as its new outside auditor. Franklin E.
Fried, Chairman of the Audit Committee, indicated that Andersen's
selection followed careful consideration. With respect to the
audit of the company's 1994 financial statements, Fried noted
"Andersen will report directly to the audit committee on the
results of their audit work."

As a part of its engagement, Andersen will examine the
Company's internal financial controls and reporting procedures,
and will issue its recommendations to the audit sub-committee,
which is currently examining those controls and procedures as
part of its review of the circumstances surrounding the
resignation of the Company's prior auditor. Mr. Fried stated
that "we are committed to ensuring that the procedures and
controls are in place so that the integrity of the Company's
financial statements will be beyond reproach." Andersen has been
given the authority to establish the scope of their work and will
strive to complete their initial review as soon as possible.

Dick Poladian, Managing Partner of Andersen's Southern
California Practice, commented that careful consideration was
given to this decision, in light of the resignation of another
firm and the publicity it received. "We have had discussions
with the company's former auditors and its other legal and
financial advisors, as well as with outside members of the audit
committee," Poladian said. Poladian added that "the commitment
of the audit committee to work closely with Arthur Andersen
demonstrates the high priority the Board has placed on addressing
the company's financial reporting issues."

Separately, the Company also announced that it had
previously aligned its internal financial reporting structure so
that Rudy Wann, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial
Officer, now reports directly to IDB Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, Jeffrey P. Sudikoff.

IDB Communications Group, Inc. is a global
telecommunications company that operates a domestic and
international communications network providing its customer with
international private line and long distance telephone services,
radio and television transmission services, facsimile and data
connections, mobile satellite communications capabilities and the
design and integration of satellite networks worldwide.
