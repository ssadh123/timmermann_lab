CURRENT REPORT
PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15 (d) OF THE

Date of report (Date earliest event reported) December 28, 1993

(Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in Charter)

Item 5. Other Events

On December 28, 1993, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of November 15, 1993, by and among The Trustcompany
Bancorporation ("Trustcompany"), The Trust Company of New Jersey,
a state chartered bank ("TCNJ"), and TCBC Acquisition Corp.
("Merger Sub"), a wholly owned subsidiary of TCNJ, Merger Sub merged
with and into Trustcompany, with Trustcompany as the surving
corporation (the "Merger").

As a result of the Merger, each share of Trustcompany common stock,
without par value, was converted into one share of TCNJ common stock, par
value $2.00 per share ("TCNJ Common Stock"), and each share of
Trustcompany Series A 9.75% Cumulative Preferred Stock was converted into
one share of TCNJ 9.75% Cumulative Preferred Stock. Accordingly,
Trustcompany has been eliminated as a holding company for TCNJ and the
shareholders of Trustcompany now directly own shares in TCNJ.

Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, TCNJ Common Stock was deemed
registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), without the filing of a registration statement
therefor. TCNJ is, therefore, a reporting issuer under the Exchange Act
in succession to Trustcompany. Accordingly, Trustcompany is filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission a Form 15 to suspend its reporting
obligations.

As a state chartered bank, TCNJ will file its Exchange Act reports with
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). For more information
with respect of the Merger, reference may be made to the report on 
F-3 being filed by TCNJ with the FDIC, as such successor issuer.
