Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

BDO Seidman served as the independent accountant previously engaged as
the principal accountant to audit the financial statements of National Income
Realty Trust (the "Trust") for the year ended December 31, 1993. On May 19,
1994, the Trust's Board of Directors selected Arthur Andersen & Co. to serve
the Trust as its independent accountant to audit the Trust's financial
statements for the calendar year ended December 31, 1994. The failure of the
Board of Directors to select BDO Seidman as the Trust's independent accountant
to audit the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1994
constituted BDO Seidman being "dismissed" (as such term is used in Item 304 of
Regulation S-K).

BDO Seidman's report on the Trust's financial statements for the year 
ended December 31, 1993 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of 
opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or 
accounting principles. During the year BDO Seidman served as independent 
accountants to audit the financial statements of the Trust for the year ended 
December 31, 1993, and thereafter through the date hereof, the Trust has not had
any disagreement with BDO Seidman on any matter of accounting principles or 
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which 
disagreement, if not resolved to the satisfaction of BDO Seidman, would have 
caused BDO Seidman to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement 
in connection with its report.

The Trust has provided BDO Seidman with a copy of the foregoing 
disclosures at the same time as the filing of this report with the Commission 
and has requested such former accountant to furnish the Trust with a letter 
addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") stating 
whether BDO Seidman agrees with the statements made by the Trust herein and, if 
not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. The Trust will file such 
letter with the Commission as promptly as practicable after receipt.
