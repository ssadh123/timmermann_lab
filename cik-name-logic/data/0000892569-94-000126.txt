REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Shareholders and Board of Directors
Care Enterprises, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Care
Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Care
Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in notes to the consolidated financial statements, in 1992 the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. MERGER AGREEMENT

On December 20, 1993, Care Enterprises, Inc. ("Care" or "the Company") and
Regency Health Services, Inc., a Delaware Corporation ("Regency"), entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). Regency currently
operates 43 long-term care facilities with 4,215 beds and one pharmacy, all
located in California. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Care will be merged
with and into Regency with Regency as the surviving corporation (the "Merger")
and each share of Care's Common Stock will be converted into 0.71 shares of
Regency's Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share in a tax-free transaction.
The Company anticipates that the Merger will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests.

The Merger has been approved by the Board of Directors of both companies and
its completion is subject to, among other things, the approval of regulatory
agencies and the shareholders of each of Care and Regency. In connection with
the Merger Agreement, shareholders holding a majority of Care's Common Stock
and shareholders holding approximately 22% of Regency's Common Stock have
agreed to vote in favor of the Merger under certain circumstances. Care
anticipates that the Merger will be consummated in the second calendar quarter
of 1994.

Fargo Bank to collateralize letters of credit issued in conjunction with Care's
self-insured workers' compensation programs. An agreement in principle was
reached in December 1993, and a definitive agreement was signed in March 1994
with the Bank of America to provide an $8,000,000 letter of credit facility
(Note 7) and new letters of credit were obtained to secure the workers'
compensation obligations.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992 the Company held personal funds in trust for
patients approximating $425,000 and $400,000, respectively, which are not
reflected on the accompanying balance sheets.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment owned by the Company at the time of its emergence from
bankruptcy on December 31, 1990 was adjusted to its then current fair market
value. All other property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and
amortization is provided on the straight-line method over the following
estimated useful lives or, if applicable, over the terms of the leases.

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Buildings 20 to 40 years
Leasehold interests and improvements 7 to 30 years
Equipment 5 to 10 years
Assets under capitalized leases 10 to 25 years
</TABLE>

Betterments, renewals and extraordinary repairs that extend the life of the
asset are capitalized; other repairs and maintenance are expensed. The cost
and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired are removed from the
accounts and any gain or loss on disposition is recognized in income.

Health Care Revenues and Reimbursement Programs

Long-term care facilities receive payments for services to certain patients
under Medicare and state Medicaid programs and from the Veterans
Administration. Revenues are recorded at the estimated net realizable amounts
from patients and third party payors in the period in which the service is
provided. Approximately 83% (1993), 82% (1992), and 83% (1991) of total
revenue was derived from federal and state medical assistance programs.
Revenue under these programs are based in part on cost reimbursement principles
which govern reimbursement of current year costs. These revenues and costs are
subject to audit and, in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been
made for any adjustments that may result from such audits. Differences between
estimated provisions and final settlements are reflected in operations in the
year finalized. Approximately 75% (1993) and 78% (1992) of the Company's
accounts receivable were related to federal and state medical assistance
programs including approximately 26% (1993) and 33% (1992) related to the
California Medicaid program.

Interest Expense

Interest expense is reflected net of $712,000, $752,000 and $1,280,000 of
interest income for the years ending December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

Income Taxes

During 1991, the Company accounted for income taxes under the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 96 ("SFAS 96"). Effective
December 31, 1992, the Company adopted (on a cumulative basis from January 1,
1992) the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109
("SFAS 109"), "Accounting for Income Taxes" (Note 3).

In accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 90-7, "Financial Reporting by
Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code" (SOP 90- 7), SFAS 96 and
SFAS 109 tax benefits recognized in periods subsequent to bankruptcy
reorganization, resulting from utilization of pre- reorganization financial
reporting Net Operating Losses ("financial reporting NOL"), are recorded by the
Company as direct additions to additional capital with a corresponding charge
in lieu of taxes included in the provision for income taxes in the Statement of
Operations.

Income Per Share

Income per share for 1993, 1992 and 1991 has been computed on the basis of the
weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding plus, for 1993, common
equivalent shares arising from dilutive stock options, using the treasury stock
method. For 1992, common equivalent shares arising from dilutive stock options
have been excluded

-F-9-
<PAGE> 13
CARE ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

from the determination of income per share due to immateriality. No such
options were outstanding during 1991. For the computation of fully diluted
income per share for 1991, shares issued in November 1991 for the conversion of
the $3,000,000 secured convertible exchangeable notes are included in the
weighted average shares outstanding from the beginning of 1991 and,
accordingly, net income for 1991 has not been reduced by interest expense on
the notes. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares
outstanding for the calculation of primary income per share was 13,312,000 in
1993, 11,667,000 in 1992, and 9,294,000 in 1991. The weighted average number
of shares used to compute income per share, assuming full dilution, was
13,388,000 in 1993, 11,667,000 in 1992, and 11,635,000 in 1991. All common
shares issued pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization have been treated as
outstanding as of December 31, 1990.

The income per share calculation does not include the shares reserved for
issuance in connection with the Company's Share Appreciation Rights Plan (Note
8), which provides for settlement of the rights in cash or stock. The
Company's Board of Directors does not presently plan to issue any shares in
settlement of the rights.

Workers' Compensation Self-Insurance

The Company maintains self-insurance programs for workers' compensation in
California and Ohio. The self-insurance liability under these programs is
based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The
self-insurance liability is discounted at a rate of 10%, which management
believes to be its appropriate market rate of interest based on its current
financial circumstances.

Professional Liability Insurance

The Company maintains approximately $30,000,000 of professional liability
insurance covering substantially all of its operations on a claims- made basis,
with a $10,000 deductible for operations in the states of New Mexico and West
Virginia and a $250,000 self-insurance retention for all other locations. The
estimated amount payable for claims, including unasserted claims, under the
Company's self-insurance retention is recorded as a liability, without
discounting.

3. INCOME TAXES

During 1991, the Company accounted for income taxes under the provisions of
SFAS 96. Effective December 31, 1992, the Company adopted (on a cumulative
basis from January 1, 1992) the provisions of SFAS 109, which mandates the
liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and permits the
recognition of net deferred tax assets subject to an ongoing assessment of
realizability. The change in accounting for income taxes did not have a
material effect on the Company's financial statements.

For federal tax return purposes, Care Enterprises, Inc. files a consolidated
tax return with its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 1993, the Company had
claimed a federal net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes ("Tax NOL")
of approximately $93,200,000 and credit carryforwards of approximately
$4,021,000. However, when the Company's Plan of Reorganization was confirmed,
an ownership change as defined in Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 382
occurred. As a result, use of Tax NOL and credit carryforwards accumulated on
or before April 20, 1990 ("pre-confirmation") may be subject to an annual
limitation of approximately $300,000. Tax losses and credits generated after
April 20, 1990 ("post-confirmation") are not subject to the above limitation.

Because a portion of the Company's Tax NOL was generated as early as 1985, it
will begin to expire in the year 2000. Considering the annual limitation, it
is currently estimated that as of December 31, 1993, a maximum of $3,300,000 of
Tax NOL in the aggregate will be available for use prior to expiration.

Management is pursuing the possibility that the Company may qualify for the
special provisions of IRC Section 382(1)(5), which could reduce the aggregate
Tax NOL and credit carryforwards available but would not limit their annual
use. Should circumstances permit the Company to qualify for this section of
the IRC, a significant portion

-F-10-
<PAGE> 14
CARE ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

of the pre-confirmation Tax NOL and credit carryforwards could become available
for use. However, the Merger (discussed in Note 1) may also result in a
limitation on the use of the Company's post-confirmation Tax NOL and credit
carryforwards and, if Section 382(1)(5) applies, pre-confirmation Tax NOL and
carryforwards.

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") is examining the Company's income tax
returns for the years 1987 through 1990. Management believes that the outcome
of this examination will not have a material impact on the financial position
or liquidity of the Company, although it may reduce the Tax NOL.

In March 1994 the IRS issued final regulations relating to net operating
losses, and specifically relating to the determination of eligibility for the
use of Section 382(1)(5). Based on the new regulations, management believes
the Company will qualify for use of this section. After applying its
provisions, the amount of Tax NOL would be approximately $53,000,000, usable
without annual limitation, before the effect of any audit adjustments.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities originate from differences between
accounting principles and procedures used for book and tax purposes,
principally related to depreciation, contingencies and legal settlements,
workers' compensation, share appreciation rights, bankruptcy costs and fees,
doubtful accounts and reserves for losses on discontinuance of certain
operations.

The provision for income taxes consists of the following:

On December 30, 1993, Care entered into a Note Agreement with a number of
institutional purchasers pursuant to which it issued $30,000,000 of its 8.10%
Senior Secured Notes due December 15, 2000 ("Notes"). The Notes have an
average maturity of five years and provide for interest payments on each of
January 15 and July 15, commencing January 15, 1994. Principal payments of
$6,000,000 are due annually commencing on January 15, 1997, with the final
payment due on maturity. The Notes are secured by mortgages on eleven nursing
facilities having an aggregate carrying value of $30,374,000. The Notes
contain covenants which require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and
levels of tangible net worth, restrict the incurrence of new debt, and limit
the payment of dividends on Care's Common Stock.

The proceeds of the Notes were used to pay $18,851,000 of existing debt,
including the remaining balance of $11,569,000 on the Term Notes, the
$1,000,000 working capital loan from a shareholder, and $6,282,000 in other
debt. An additional $495,000 was used to pay the outstanding balance of a
capitalized lease obligation and purchase the related facility. Proceeds of
the borrowing were also used to pay costs and expenses of the issuance of the
notes totaling $1,139.000, and $709,000 was used to establish cash escrows with
a title company pending the resolution of certain title and debt payoff related
issues and to pay certain other costs.

Each of the mortgage notes and IDB's is secured by a first deed of trust on
the related facility. One of the IDB's requires the maintenance of debt
service reserve funds and all of the IDB's contain affirmative and negative
covenants and reporting requirements.

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Letters of Credit

The Company is contingently liable under letters of credit principally related
to deposit requirements on its self-insured workers' compensation plans. State
regulations require the maintenance of deposits at specified percentages of
estimated future claim payments which can be satisfied through a combination of
cash deposits, surety bonds and letters of credit. The total amount of letters
of credit outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 1992 were $6,238,000 and
$6,250,000, respectively.

An agreement in principle was reached in December 1993, and a definitive
agreement was signed in March 1994 with the Bank of America to provide an
$8,000,000 letter of credit facility secured by Care's accounts and notes
receivable and the shares of Care's subsidiary, Healthcare Network, which is a
partner in the pharmacy partnership.

Leases

The Company leases certain facilities and offices under cancelable and
noncancelable agreement expiring at various dates through October 2010. the
leases are generally triple-net leases and provide for the Company's payment of
property taxes, insurance and repairs. Certain leases contain renewal options
and rent escalation clauses. Rent escalation clauses require either fixed
increases or increases tied to the Consumer Price Index. Five leases include
purchase options at fixed or market prices at various dates. Three leases
include put options in the year 2000 at 100% of fair market value. Rent and
lease expenses aggregated $6,897,000 for 1993, $7,682,000 for 1992, and
$7,785,000 for 1991.

Future minimum lease payments (in thousands) for operating leases are as

Guarantees of Leases

The Company is contingently liable for certain operating leases assumed by the
purchasers of the Company's leasehold interests in facilities. The Company is
not aware of any failure on the part of these purchasers to meet the terms of
their obligations, and does not anticipate any expenditures to be incurred in
connection with its guarantees. If a default were to occur, the Company
generally would be able to assume operations of the facility and use the net
revenues thereof to defray the Company's expenditures on these guarantees.

The following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments (in thousands)
for the operating leases for which the Company is contingently liable:

has been made and such claims or actions are not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Company's financial position.

8. CAPITAL STRUCTURE

The Company has authorized capital stock of 26,000,000 shares consisting of
1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share, and
25,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value per share.

Preferred Stock

The Preferred Stock, none of which has been issued, has certain preferences
upon liquidation or redemption and has voting rights similar to the Common
Stock.

Common Stock

On December 21, 1992, the Company sold 1,633,000 shares of Common Stock to
affiliates of Smith Management Company and Foothill Group, Inc., its two
largest shareholders for $4,000,000 (Note 9). In 1992, Care retired 46,000
shares of Common Stock which had been acquired by the Company through
settlement of certain claims.

Stock Option Plan

In 1992, the Board of Directors and the shareholders of the Company approved a
stock option plan providing for the grant of options to employees and certain
consultants to purchase an aggregate of 550,000 shares of the Company's Common
Stock. Under this plan, full-time employees are eligible to receive grants of
either incentive stock options structured to qualify under Section 422 of the
IRC of 1986, or non- qualified stock options which are not intended to meet the
requirements of the IRC. Consultants and certain eligible directors may be
granted only non-qualified stock options. The options vest over a four year
period and have an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company's
common stock on the date of grant. Outstanding options expire on various dates
through December 15, 1998.

Share Appreciation Rights Plan

In January 1991, Care's Board of Directors adopted a Share Appreciation
Rights Plan (the "SAR Plan") which provided for the award of 1,000,000 units to
certain key executives. The SAR Plan was amended by the Board of Directors and
shareholders in May 1992.

The SAR Plan provides that upon award, 25% of the units vest on each of the
first four anniversaries of the award date and vested units must be exercised
before the fifth anniversary of the award. Upon exercise, the awardee is
entitled to receive in cash or stock, at the Company's option, the difference
between the base value awarded and the market value on the date units are
exercised.

As indicated below, of the 900,000 units which were awarded in 1991 at the
base price of $1 per unit, 36,000 were exercised, 531,000 were forfeited and
333,000 remain outstanding, of which 166,500 are vested as of December 31,
1993. The Board of Directors has decided not to award additional rights under
the SAR Plan. During 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company accrued $2,157,000,
$323,000 and $293,000, respectively, in benefits associated with this plan and
450,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for possible issuance in
settlement of the appreciation due awardees.

9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Smith Management Company and its affiliated companies ("Smith") and Foothill
Capital Corporation, Foothill Group, Inc. and affiliates ("Foothill") are
significant shareholders of the Company.

In January 1992, Foothill acquired from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. a 50% interest
in the Company's Term Note obligation. Their portion of the Term Notes
amounted to $9,375,000 at December 31, 1992. As part of the transaction,
Foothill also acquired a contingent letter of credit obligation with a
principal amount of $4,316,000. The remaining balance of the Term Notes was
paid on December 30, 1993.

In December, 1992, the Company sold 1,633,000 shares of Common Stock to Smith
and Foothill for $4,000,000. In connection with this transaction, Smith and
Foothill have registration rights whereby they can join the Company in a
registration if the Company chooses to register other shares of its Common
Stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

In 1990 and 1991 the Company sold $3,000,000 in secured convertible
exchangeable notes to Smith and Foothill. The notes, which had a maturity date
of December 31, 1993, bore interest at a rate approximating the Citibank, N.A.
prime rate plus 1% payable quarterly, were secured by two of the Company's
nursing facilities. The notes were convertible at any time, at the option of
the holder, into shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock and would
automatically convert into shares of Common Stock upon the occurrence of
certain events. On November 14, 1991, the requirements for automatic
conversion were met and the notes were converted into 2,679,000 shares of
Common Stock. The holders of these shares have registration rights whereby
they can request, at the Company's expense, that the Common Stock issued be
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Foothill also provided
the Company with a $1,000,000 revolving credit working capital facility which
was terminated, and the outstanding balance paid, in December 1993.

In April 1991, the Company engaged Smith to assist in the development and
implementation of a program which would improve the Company's liquidity. Under
this agreement, the Company paid Smith an aggregate of $218,000 for 1992 and
$100,000 for 1991. This agreement expired on December 31, 1992.

The Company has a 26% interest in the pharmacy partnership formed in April
1992. The partnership continues to provide products and services to the
nursing and rehabilitation centers operated by the Company. For 1993 and 1992
these purchases totaled approximately $5,900,000 and $4,200,000, respectively.

10. DISPOSAL OF FACILITY

In 1992, Care recognized a gain of $1,007,000 on a nursing facility disposal
which occurred in 1991. The gain represents the difference between the book
value of the nursing facility assets which were acquired in 1991 by a bank in a
non-judicial foreclosure and management's estimate of the value of the assets
surrendered.

11. RETIREMENT SAVING PLAN

Effective January 1, 1992, the Company began accepting the entry of new
participants and began accepting participant contributions to the Care
Enterprises, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan, which is a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. All
employees with at least one year of employment who have attained the age of 21
are eligible to participate. Participants may contribute, on a pre-tax basis,
up to 15% of their earnings to the plan (subject to certain limitations), for
which the Company matches 15% of the first 3% of contributions for persons with
less than three years of service and 25% of the first 5% for all others. The
Company's contributions are subject to a four-year vesting period. Matching
contributions made by the Company for 1993 and 1992 were $186,000 and $155,000,
respectively.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Under the pooling-of-interests accounting method, the accounting policies
followed by the two entities are conformed. The following describes certain
accounting policy differences between Regency and Care which were adjusted in
the unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet, unaudited pro forma condensed
statements of income and other items relevant to the pro forma information.

(1) Regency reports its financial position and results of operations using
a June 30 fiscal year end. Care reports its financial position and
results of operations using a December 31 fiscal year end. The
accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed statements of income for
each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 1993
conform Care to a June 30 fiscal year end.

(2) On December 31, 1990 Care emerged from bankruptcy after its Joint Plan
of Reorganization became effective. Care implemented the recommended
accounting for entities in ("Pre-Reorganization Reporting") and
emerging from ("Fresh-Start Reporting") Chapter 11 reorganization as
set forth in SOP 90-7 during the year ended December 31, 1990.
Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed statement of income for
the year ended June 30, 1991 includes the operations for Care for only
six months (January 1, 1991 through June 30, 1991).

(3) Regency's consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the
three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 1993 reflect income
taxes following the requirements of Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion No. 11, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Care's consolidated
financial statements reflect income taxes following the requirements
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." To conform Regency's accounting
practice to SFAS No. 109, an adjustment is required to reclassify the
utilization of Regency's net operating loss carryforward from an
extraordinary item to a reduction in the provision for income taxes.
The effect on the unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet is not
material.

(4) All fees and expenses related to the Merger and to the consolidation
and restructuring of the combining companies will be expensed as
required under the pooling-of-interests accounting method. These
expenses have not been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
statements of income, but will be reflected in the statement of income
of Regency in the period the Merger is consummated. The total
Merger costs are expected to approximate $5,400,000. The direct
transactional expenses are estimated to be approximately $2,500,000
for investment banking, legal, accounting, printing, mailing and
similar expenses. Although there can be no precise determination of
such expenses until the consolidation of operations is actually
completed, it is expected that up to an additional $2,900,000 (net of
tax) will be required for integrating management information and
accounting systems and consolidating various operating, management and
other functions of the two companies to efficiently open the new
enterprise as a result of the Merger. No assurance can be given at
present that such expenses will not be greater or less than the amount
budgeted for them or that such operating efficiencies will be fully
realized.

(5) The calculation of unaudited pro forma income per share before
extraordinary items for each period presented reflects the issuance of
.71 of a share of Regency Common Stock for each share of common and
common equivalent share of Care Common Stock used in such calculation
without consideration for fractional shares.

(6) This Pro Forma adjustment gives effect to the issuance of 9,396,140
shares of Regency Common Stock, $0.01 par value, in connection with
the Merger based upon the number of shares of Care Common Stock
outstanding as of December 31, 1993.

(7) During the six months ended December 31, 1993, Care incurred a charge
to operating income of $1,662,000 relating to the SAR's previously
granted. The charge to operating income for the year ended December
31, 1993 was approximately $2,157,000, primarily as a result of the
increasing market price of shares of Care Common Stock to $9.625 per
share on December 31, 1993 as compared to $2.75 per share on January
1, 1993. Depending upon the future performance of Regency
Common Stock, Regency may incur substantial additional charges in
future periods, through December 31, 1995, which will aggregate
approximately $330,000 for each one dollar increase in the market
price of Care Common Stock (or $235,000 for each one dollar increase
in the market price of Regency Common Stock).
