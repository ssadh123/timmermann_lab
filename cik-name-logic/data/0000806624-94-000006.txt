Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountants

On August 19, 1994, Delta Woodside Industries, Inc., a South
Carolina corporation (the "Company"), disengaged the accounting
firm of Ernst & Young LLP as principal accountants for the
Company upon completion of the annual audit for the Company's
1994 fiscal year. The decision to change accountants was
approved by the audit committee of the Company's Board of
Directors on August 18, 1994. On August 19, 1994 KPMG Peat
Marwick LLP was engaged by the Company pursuant to approval by
the Board of Directors as principal accountants for the Company's
1995 fiscal year, subject to shareholders approval.

In connection with the audits of each of the two fiscal years
ended June 27, 1992 and July 3, 1993, and in the subsequent
period preceding August 19, 1994, there have been no
disagreements with Ernst & Young LLP on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not
resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young LLP, would have
caused Ernst & Young LLP to make reference to the subject matter
of the disagreement in their reports.

The audit reports of Ernst & Young LLP on the consolidated
financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries for the
Company's 1992 and 1993 fiscal years did not contain any adverse
opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or
modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting
principles.

The Company has requested Ernst & Young LLP to furnish it a
letter addressed to the Commission stating whether or not it
agrees with the above statements. A copy of this letter dated
August 25, 1994 is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
