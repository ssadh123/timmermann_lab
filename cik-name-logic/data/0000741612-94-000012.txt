ITEM 5. Other Events

Texas-New Mexico Power Company (TNP), the Fort Worth based,
wholly owned subsidiary of TNP Enterprises, Inc. (the Company),
announced on June 2, 1994, that the Court of Appeals, Third
District of Texas, has denied all motions for
rehearing of the decision rendered on August 25, 1993. The
August 1993 ruling related to the 53rd District Court of Texas'
decision on appeals of the Public Utility Commission of Texas'
(the Commission) final order in Docket No. 9491 (TNP's
application to include Unit 1 of TNP One, TNP's Robertson County,
Texas, generating facility, in its rate base).

The Court of Appeals' denial of motions for rehearing
affirms the court's positions that:

1 TNP is entitled to an additional $9.1 million in its rate
base;

2 TNP One Unit 2 costs were not at issue in Docket No.
9491;

3 the Commission's disallowances of $30.4 million should be
upheld; and

4 the Commission erred in failing to pass on to ratepayer's
TNP's federal income tax savings for expenses disallowed
by the Commission.

The Court of Appeals' action clears the way for TNP to
appeal unfavorable positions, including the disallowances of
$30.4 million and the federal income tax issue, to the Texas
Supreme Court.
