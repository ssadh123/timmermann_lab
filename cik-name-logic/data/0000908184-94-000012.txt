Item 5. Other Events.

On March 16, 1994, Chesapeake Corporation (the "Company")
announced that its Chesapeake Paper Products Company and
Chesapeake Forest Products Company subsidiaries are offering a
voluntary enhanced retirement program to a total of 55 eligible
salaried employees. For employees who elect to participate in
the voluntary program, the effective date of retirement will be
September 1, 1994. Chesapeake expects to record a pre-tax charge
of approximately $4 million relating to this program in the
second quarter of 1994.

The program is intended to enhance the Company's competitive
position by reducing operating costs for the subsidiaries, which

The Company anticipates that the program will reduce pre-tax
operating costs by approximately $3 million on an annualized
basis.
