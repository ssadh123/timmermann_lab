Item 5. Other Materially Important Events

(1) On January 28, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors
declared a common stock dividend of $100 million which was
paid on February 1, 1994, to its parent, Entergy Corporation
(Entergy). Prior to the February 1, 1994 dividend payment
the Company had not paid a common dividend since June 1986.

(2) The Company released the following unaudited financial
information on February 4, 1994:

Financial results for the year ended December 31, 1993
include three significant charges totaling $73.8 million
related to the merger with Entergy and a fourth-quarter 1993
rate settlement. These items include:

Merger-related charges for investment advisory fees, and
early retirement and severance packages, which increased
operations and maintenance costs by $52.3 million;

A $19.2 million charge for a one-time credit to Texas
ratepayers that was part of a rate settlement approved
during the fourth quarter, which was a change from the
Company's previously reported intention to amortize such
costs over the period November 1993 through August 1994;
and

A rate reduction, which was included in the rate settlement
referred to above, that resulted in a $2.3 million decrease
in the Company's fourth quarter 1993 net revenues.
