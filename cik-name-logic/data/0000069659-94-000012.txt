Item 5. Other Events

On May 13, 1994, one of The Narragansett Electric Company's
(Narragansett) largest customers, Ocean State Steel, Inc. (OSSI),
announced that it will cease production on May 23, 1994. 
Narragansett is a wholly owned subsidiary of New England Electric
System. OSSI's announcement stated that limitations due to
environmental regulation made production of steel billets
impractical. OSSI is offering its business for sale. If no
investor is found, OSSI is planning to permanently close its
facility July 11, 1994. The loss of OSSI as a customer will
reduce Narragansett's revenues, excluding fuel and purchased
power costs, by approximately $1.4 million on an annual basis.
