THESE ARE THE EARNINGS FOR GREYHOUND FINANCIAL CORPORATION

THE PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARY OF GFC FINANCIAL CORPORATION

WHOSE EARNINGS WERE RELEASED ON APRIL 14, 1994

GREYHOUND FINANCIAL CORPORATION

ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 1994 RESULTS

PHOENIX, Arizona, April 18, 1994 -- Greyhound Financial Corporation ("GFC" or
the "Company") today reported net income for the quarter ended March 31, 1994.
Net income for the first quarter of 1994 was $11.6 million compared to
$8.6 million for the comparable period in 1993 (a 36% improvement). The 1994
results included income from Ambassador Factors, the factoring and asset based
lending company acquired from Fleet Financial Group, Inc. on February 14, 1994.
Sam Eichenfield, President and Chief Executive Officer of GFC, said,
"The acquisition of the Asset Based Finance group in the first quarter of 1993
and the acquisition of Ambassador Factors in the first quarter of 1994
complement the Company's core operations and have contributed to the growth in
funds employed and the resulting improved performance. The pending acquisition
of TriCon Capital Corporation ("TriCon"), which was announced on March 4, 1994,
will further diversify GFC's asset base and expand our focus on value-added
products and services." TriCon is a $1.8 billion niche-oriented provider of
commercial and equipment financing products.
Eichenfield added that portfolio quality remains consistent with
nonearning assets at 3.8% of funds employed after adding Ambassador, which
typically has a higher nonearning asset level (4.2% of its funds employed at
March 31, 1994), up slightly from 3.6% reported at year end.

Interest earned from financing transactions increased to $72.0 million
in the first quarter of 1994 from $58.3 million for the first quarter of 1993,
an increase of 24%. This rise in interest earned was driven by a 27% increase
in funds employed during the twelve months ended March 31, 1994 resulting from
$1.1 billion of new business being added by the core finance operations during
that period and the acquisition of Ambassador Factors.
The improvement in earnings for the 1994 quarter primarily was due to
the increase in interest margins earned which advanced to $38.1 million for the
first quarter of 1994 from $27.7 million for the same period in 1993. The
higher interest margins, which equate to a 5.6% annualized return on average
earning assets compared to 5.0% for the first quarter of 1993, were
attributable to the growth of the portfolio, a lower effective cost of debt in
1994 and higher fee income principally generated by Ambassador Factors. The
strong improvement in interest margins was more than enough to offset the $2
million reduction in gains on sale of assets, higher provisions for possible
credit losses and the higher selling, administrative and other operating
("operating") expenses.
The higher operating expenses primarily consisted of higher personnel
costs attributable in part to the acquisitions of the Asset Based Finance group
in February 1993 and Ambassador Factors in February 1994.
Income taxes were higher due to higher tax rates in effect during the
first quarter of 1994 and to higher income before taxes.
Finally, Eichenfield noted that on March 28, 1994 the Company filed a
new shelf Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
for the sale of up to $1.0 billion of Senior Debt Securities.
Greyhound Financial Corporation is a major domestic commercial finance
company that extends secured financing in selected markets: corporate finance,
transportation, communications, commercial real estate and resort finance.
Greyhound Financial also provides asset based lending, consumer rediscounting
and factoring.
