Item 5. Other Events

In March 1994, Oryx Energy Company (Company) adopted plans
designed
to achieve significant future cost reductions for Sun Energy
Partners, L.P. (Partnership) by disposing of certain assets. 
Associated therewith, the Partnership will recognize an $87
million
charge in the first quarter of 1994. Management of the Company
expects the Partnership to realize about $35 million annual cost
reductions in 1995.

The properties included in the divestment plan make up 52-percent
and 31-percent of the Partnership's onshore fields and
properties. 
During 1993, however, these properties accounted for about four
percent of the Partnership's oil and gas production and at
December
31, 1993, they accounted for about six percent of the
Partnership's
proved reserves and about eight percent of its net investment in
properties, plants and equipment.
