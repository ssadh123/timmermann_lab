Exhibit 99

January 24, 1994 - THE ST. PAUL COMPANIES REPORTS RECORD
1993 EARNINGS

St. Paul, Minn. - The St. Paul Companies (NYSE:SPC) reported
record operating earnings of $386.6 million, or $8.55 per
share, for 1993, compared with last year's operating loss of
$333.8 million, or $8.08 per share.

"What a pleasure it is to report record operating
earnings after last year's record loss," said Douglas W.
Leatherdale, chairman and chief executive officer. "In
1993, we reaped the benefits of corrective actions in our
underwriting and insurance brokerage operations. In fact,
improvement in results was virtually across-the-board.

"In addition, 1993 was an average year in terms of
catastrophic storms - nothing like 1992, which brought us
Hurricane Andrew, the most expensive storm in history.

"The decrease in catastrophe losses helped turn around
our reinsurance operation, which cut its losses by almost
$270 million in 1993.

"The John Nuveen Company performed exceptionally well
in 1993, reporting record results last week. Based on the stock price
at year-end, our 74% ownership of Nuveen was valued at $718 million.

"1993 was notable as well for our purchase of Economy
Fire & Casualty Company from Kemper Corporation. Economy is
a successful personal insurance company and a good fit with
our strategy - and it maintained its strong performance in
1993," Leatherdale said.

"Not surprisingly, our financial position has never
been stronger. Common shareholders' equity at year-end
reached a new high of $3.0 billion, or $70.95 per share.
Our assets at year-end were $17.1 billion. Debt comprised
17.6 percent of our total capital."

Net income for 1993 was a record $427.6 million, or
$9.47 per share, compared with a net loss of $156.0 million,
or $3.88 per share, for 1992. 1993 net income included
after-tax realized investment gains of $41.0 million, or
$0.92 per share. The net loss for 1992 included the
cumulative effects of two accounting changes adopted in
first-quarter 1992, which reduced the net loss by $76.5
million, or $1.81 per share, as well as after-tax realized
investment gains of $101.3 million, or $2.39 per share,
which included a $65 million gain from the sale of a
minority interest in the John Nuveen Company.

Fourth-quarter results
- ----------------------

For the fourth quarter of 1993, operating earnings were
$79.8 million, or $1.76 per share, compared with a loss of
$426.3 million, or $10.20 per share (including a $365
million write-down of Minet goodwill), for the fourth
quarter of 1992. Fourth quarter operating earnings included
a one-time pretax restructuring charge of $21 million, or
$0.31 per share (after-tax), related to the company's
restructuring of its U.S. underwriting operations.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 1993 was $89.7
million, or $1.98 per share, compared with a loss of $417.5
million, or $9.99 per share, for the fourth quarter of 1992.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 1993 included after-tax
realized investment gains of $9.9 million, or $0.22 per
share, compared with $8.7 million, or $0.21 per share, in
1992.
