and tradename "Noranda" and other trademarks and/or tradenames derived from or

names identified in Exhibit 2.5.1 attached hereto) shall not be a violation of
this Section 2.5.1.

2.5.2 PENSION PLANS. At or immediately after the Closing, Buyer
will adopt or will cause Norandex to adopt a pension plan for Active Norandex
Employees (the "Norandex Pension Plan") which, except to the extent otherwise

and liability under the Noranda Pension Plan for all participants other than

liability and responsibility for the Noranda Life Insurance Plan as it applies

retirement life insurance benefits and provisions. Persons who are Active

without distinguishing between hourly and salaried employees of Norandex for

the Section 401(k) plan previously delivered by Seller to Buyer and in effect at
the date of this Agreement, for Norandex employees at the Closing Date. Buyer
and Seller shall cooperate with each other and with the third party
administrator of the plan to implement such adoption. Seller agrees to take all
steps necessary before and after the Closing to remedy any administrative
failure either to properly and timely invest participant and beneficiary
accounts under Seller's 401(k) plan, to the extent attributable to contributions
made on or before the Closing Date or to adequately communicate with
participants and beneficiaries regarding the investment of such accounts and
Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Norandex and Buyer harmless from any Claims
or Losses arising out of or relating to any such failure. Seller and Buyer
agree to effect a transfer of the accounts under Seller's 401(k) plan maintained
for Norandex employees to the Buyer 401(k) Plan established by Buyer for such
employees, such transfer to occur as soon as practicable after the Closing Date
and after full remedy of the administrative features set forth above.

Section 2.5.4, before January 1, 1996, other than changes that may be required
by law or are beneficial to participants thereunder.

2.5.10 EMPLOYEES. It is Buyer's intention not to engage in any
employment terminations after the Closing of persons who were employees of
Norandex or a Subsidiary at the Closing Date such that prior notice would be
required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. Nothing
in the preceding sentence shall, however, be deemed to limit in any way the
right of Norandex or Buyer to terminate the employment of any person after the
Closing Date, to limit the rights of Norandex or Buyer to change its intentions
in the future, or to create any rights to continued employment in favor of any

16

such persons, and no such person shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary
of this Section.

and shall indemnify Buyer for, and hold Buyer harmless against, any Tax imposed,
accrued, or assessed in respect of (i) any Tax period that ends on or before the
Closing Date and (ii) any other Tax period to the extent of the Tax attributable
to the portion of the period that begins before the Closing Date and ends on the
Closing Date. The liability for any Taxes of Norandex and its Subsidiaries
imposed, accrued, or assessed in respect of (i) periods beginning after the
Closing Date and (ii) any other tax period to the extent of the Tax attributable
to the portion of the period that begins after the Closing Date and ends after
the Closing Date shall be borne by Buyer, and Buyer will indemnify Noranda for,
and hold Noranda harmless against, any such Taxes. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Tax" and "Taxes" mean any federal, state, or local income or
franchise taxes, and interest, additions, and penalties (civil or criminal)
imposed in connection with any Tax, and any interest in respect of any such
additions or penalties.

(b) FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY. Noranda will include Norandex
and its Subsidiaries in Noranda's consolidated federal income Tax return for the
short taxable year of Norandex and its Subsidiaries ending on the Closing Date.
Buyer will cause Norandex to provide to Noranda on or before November 30, 1994
all information

17
<PAGE>

reasonably requested by Noranda necessary to the preparation of such return.
Norandex and its Subsidiaries shall close their books and records (including
workpapers) as of the close of business on the Closing Date in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(4)(i) in order to report their annual
income as determined on the basis of income shown on their permanent books and
records (including workpapers). Noranda and Noranda Finance Inc. shall, jointly
and severally, indemnify Buyer for and hold Buyer harmless against any liability
for Taxes asserted against Norandex or its Subsidiaries for any period by reason
of the consolidation of Norandex or its Subsidiaries with Noranda, or any other
corporation consolidated with Noranda, for federal income tax purposes. Noranda
Finance is not aware of any federal income Tax issue or issues affecting the
group of corporations consolidated with Noranda Finance for federal income Tax
purposes (excluding Norandex and its Subsidiaries) for any period ending on or
before the Closing Date that would in the aggregate, together with interest and
any penalties, if resolved unfavorably to such group of corporations, create a
liability in excess of 30 percent of the aggregate assets of such group.

(c) STATE AND LOCAL FRANCHISE AND INCOME TAX LIABILITY. Noranda
shall prepare and file all state and local franchise and income Tax returns for
Norandex and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or before the Closing
Date and shall pay any Taxes due thereon. Norandex shall have an accrued
liability or receivable on its balance sheet as of the Closing Date for state
and local income and franchise Taxes of Norandex and its Subsidiaries that will,
without limitation, reflect the required state and local income and franchise
Tax balances through and including the Closing Date; Buyer will reimburse
Noranda for payments by Noranda of any such Taxes to the extent that those Taxes
are accrued on such balance sheet. Noranda and Noranda Finance Inc. shall,
jointly and

18
<PAGE>

severally, indemnify Buyer for and hold Buyer harmless against any liability for
Taxes asserted against Norandex or its Subsidiaries for any period by reason of
the consolidation or combination of Norandex or its Subsidiaries with Noranda,
or any other corporation consolidated or combined with Noranda for state income
or franchise tax purposes. Buyer will cause Norandex to provide to Noranda on
or before November 30, 1994 all information reasonably requested by Noranda
necessary to the preparation of such returns. Buyer shall prepare and file all
state and local franchise and income Tax returns for Norandex and its
Subsidiaries for all periods ending after the Closing Date and shall pay any
Taxes due thereon. In the case of any state or local franchise or income Tax
return in respect of a period beginning before and ending after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall submit the return to Noranda for review as to consistency with
prior returns at least 25 business days before the last day for filing such
return and Noranda shall have completed such review and consulted as necessary
with Buyer no later than the tenth business day before such filing day.

(d) TAX ELECTIONS. Buyer agrees not to make any election under
either Section 338(h)(10) or Section 338(g) of the Code. Noranda, Norandex, and
Norandex's Subsidiaries have made no election under Section 341(f) of the Code
respecting Norandex or its Subsidiaries. Buyer agrees to cause Norandex and its
Subsidiaries to make an election to carry forward, and not carry back, losses
occurring after the Closing Date.

(e) TAX REFUNDS. In the event that Norandex or any of its
Subsidiaries receives a refund or credit of Taxes for which Noranda has made a
payment on behalf of Norandex or any of its Subsidiaries and not been reimbursed
by Buyer applicable to any period (i) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or
(ii) ending after the Closing

19
<PAGE>

Date and including any period commencing prior to the Closing Date, then the
amount of such refund or credit shall promptly be paid by Buyer to Noranda.

2.6.2 COOPERATION. After the Closing, Buyer and Noranda shall, and
Buyer shall cause Norandex and its Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully with one
another and shall make available to one another, as reasonably requested,
records or documents relating to Tax liabilities of Norandex and its
Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Buyer shall
use reasonable efforts to preserve all such information, records, and documents
in the possession of Norandex and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, until
the expiration of any applicable statutes of limitation, including extensions
thereof. Buyer, Noranda, and Norandex and its Subsidiaries shall also make
available to one another, as reasonably requested, personnel responsible for
preparing or maintaining information, records, and documents in connection with
Tax matters.

2.6.3 AUDITS AND CONTESTS WITH RESPECT TO TAXES. So long as taxable
periods of Norandex and its Subsidiaries ending on or before, or including, the
Closing Date remain open for an assessment of Tax, Buyer and Noranda shall
notify the other in writing within 15 business days after receipt by Buyer or
Noranda of written notice of (i) any pending or threatened audit or assessment
with respect to Taxes of Norandex and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) any pending or
threatened audit or assessment with respect to Taxes of Buyer that may affect
the Tax liabilities of Norandex and its Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending
on or before, or including, the Closing Date. Within 15 business days after
receipt of the first such notice respecting an item or items for which it is
responsible pursuant to Section 2.6.1, Noranda may elect, by written notice to
Buyer, to contest the audit or assessment in the name of Norandex and its
Subsidiaries. If Noranda so elects, it shall be solely responsible for, and
shall bear all costs of, the defense of the item or items at issue, except that
Buyer

20
<PAGE>

agrees to cooperate, and cause Norandex and its Subsidiaries to cooperate, in
the defense by making relevant documents and employees available to Noranda at
Noranda's expense, and to execute such documents as may be reasonably necessary
to allow Noranda to conduct the defense. If Noranda elects to conduct a
defense, then all decisions with respect to the negotiation, settlement, or
litigation of the item or items at issue shall be made by Noranda and shall be
binding upon Buyer, except that Noranda shall consult with Buyer before agreeing
to any adjustment, or making any Tax election, that will or may create an
increase in Taxes for Norandex and its Subsidiaries or Buyer in respect of any
period ending after the Closing Date and shall promptly indemnify Buyer for, and
hold Buyer harmless against, any such increase.

2.6.4 AUDIT ADJUSTMENTS.

(a) If as a result of the examination of the consolidated or
separate federal, state, or local franchise or income Tax returns of Noranda or
any of Norandex and its Subsidiaries, or any group of corporations that includes
Noranda or Norandex and its Subsidiaries for a taxable year ending on or before,
or including, the Closing Date, there shall be made after the Closing Date any
adjustment that increases deductions, losses, or credits against Taxes or that
decreases income, gain or recapture of credits against Taxes ("Tax Benefits") or
that increases income, gain, or recapture of credits against Taxes or decreases
deductions, losses or credits against Taxes ("Tax Detriments") for any taxable
year and that will permit Noranda or Norandex and its Subsidiaries (or any
corporation in an affiliated group that includes Buyer or Norandex and its
Subsidiaries) to increase the Tax Benefits or decrease the Tax Detriments to
which they would otherwise have been entitled for any taxable year beginning on
or after the Closing Date, Noranda will notify Buyer of such adjustment and
provide Buyer with such information as may be necessary for

21
<PAGE>

Buyer to take account of such increases or decreases through the filing of a
claim of refund or otherwise. Buyer shall take any reasonable actions necessary
to secure the benefit of such increases or decreases. In any taxable year in
which the net effect of such adjustments is a Tax Benefit to Norandex and its
Subsidiaries, Buyer shall indemnify Noranda for such benefit (plus any interest
actually received by Buyer from the relevant Tax authority, but less Buyer's
reasonable net expenses incurred in securing such benefit) within thirty
business days after the Tax return reflecting those net Tax Benefits is filed;
if the net effect is a Tax Detriment to Norandex and its Subsidiaries, Noranda
shall indemnify Buyer for such detriment (plus any reasonable expenses of Buyer
incurred in attempting to mitigate such detriment) to the extent that such
detriment is not indemnified pursuant to Section 2.6.3, within thirty business
days after the tax return reflecting those net Tax Detriments is filed. If,
after Buyer has made a payment to Noranda in respect of a Tax Benefit, there is
a subsequent decrease in the amount of such Tax Benefit as a result of an
examination by federal, state or local tax authorities, Noranda shall indemnify
Buyer for the amount of such decrease in such Tax Benefit, promptly after the
tax return reflecting such decrease is filed; Buyer agrees to use its reasonable
efforts to defend against any such decrease.

(b) In calculating any amount to be indemnified under Section
2.6.3 or under this Section 2.6.4, each party shall be deemed to be subject to
Tax at the maximum combined Tax rate for the type of Tax and for the taxable
period in question. By way of example, and without limitation of the foregoing
sentence, the maximum combined federal and state corporate income Tax rate is

adjustment to the Purchase Price under this Agreement.

2.6.5 TERMINATION OF TAX AGREEMENTS. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, any and all Tax-allocation, Tax-sharing, or
other similar agreements between Noranda and Norandex and its Subsidiaries shall
be terminated as of the Closing Date, and from and after such date, none of such
entities shall have any rights or liabilities thereunder.

2.6.6 MINIMUM TAX CREDIT. No later than the date on which the
Adjustment Payment is required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.4.4, Buyer
shall pay to Seller the amount of $1,200,000, representing 60% of $2,000,000,
which is the estimated accumulated minimum tax credit carryover ("AMTCO")
available to Norandex and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (other than
any AMTCO attributable to Master Shield, Inc. ("Master Shield")). Such amount
shall not be included on the Closing Date Balance Sheet or reflected in Adjusted
Net Assets Employed as of the Closing Date. Within 30 days after Noranda
Finance files each of its 1993 Consolidated Federal Income Tax Return and its
1994 Consolidated Federal Income Tax Return, Seller shall notify Buyer of the
actual AMTCO available to Buyer (other than any AMTCO attributable to Master
Shield). If such actual AMTCO exceeds such estimated AMTCO for either of
Seller's 1993 and 1994 taxable years, Buyer shall pay Seller 60 percent of the
excess within 30 days after such notification. If such actual AMTCO is less
than such estimated AMTCO for either of Seller's 1993 and 1994 taxable years,
Seller shall pay Buyer 60 percent of the amount of the deficit within 30 days
after such notification. Buyer shall pay Seller 60 percent of any Tax saving
actually realized by Buyer from AMTCO attributable to Master Shield and deriving
from Seller's 1993 and 1994 taxable years. Adjustments of AMTCO attributable to
periods ending on or before December 31, 1994 caused by Internal Revenue Service
audits or assessments shall be subject to Section 2.6.3 and 2.6.4, except that
indemnification

23

of Tax Benefits and Tax Detriments attributable to such adjustments shall be 60
percent of the amount thereof.

the Relevant Employees concerning the representations and warranties of Seller
set forth in this Agreement as are described in a separate letter from Seller to

formal or otherwise, from any jurisdiction to the effect that Norandex is or was
required to qualify to conduct business and was not so qualified, or that a
jurisdiction in which it is authorized to conduct business may withdraw such
authorization. Seller has caused to be delivered to Buyer complete and correct

commitment to make any investment in, advance or loan to, or guarantee of the
obligations of, any person or entity, other than investments, advances, loans or
guarantees made in the ordinary course of business for which the maximum
potential liability of Norandex does not exceed $100,000 in the aggregate.

3.6 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND PERMITS; NO CONFLICTS. Norandex and each
Subsidiary have all Permits that are necessary for the lawful conduct of the
business of Norandex as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to
have such Permits would not have a material adverse effect on the business or
properties of Norandex. To the best knowledge of Seller, neither Norandex nor
any Subsidiary is in material violation of any Permit or Law. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller or Norandex, nor the

any Understanding, other contract or agreement, policy of insurance, indenture,
mortgage, lease, or other similar instrument of any kind to which Seller,
Norandex or any Subsidiary is a party or by which Seller, Norandex or any
Subsidiary, or any of their respective properties or assets, are bound (except,

that has received a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service regarding its qualified status under
Section 401(a) or Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, the most recent
Internal Revenue Service determination letter, the application
submitted when requesting such determination letter and any
subsequently filed determination letter request.

Schedule, each ERISA Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) or Section
501(c)(9) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter as to its
qualification and has been administered in compliance with ERISA and the Code
and no fact or circumstance exists which would preclude continuing, good faith
reliance on such determination letter or would adversely affect the qualified
status of any such ERISA Plan.

3.24.3 NO REPORTABLE EVENT. No fact or circumstance exists,
including, without limitation, any "reportable event" (within the meaning of
ERISA), in connection with any ERISA Plan which might constitute grounds for
termination of such ERISA Plan by the PBGC or of the appointment by a court of a
trustee to administer such ERISA Plan. Neither Norandex, any Subsidiary nor
Seller has incurred any liability to the PBGC (other than for payment of
premiums which have been timely paid) with respect to any ERISA Plan, and
Norandex, each Subsidiary and Seller have complied in full with the minimum
funding requirements and in all material respects with the reporting, disclosure
and fiduciary requirements of ERISA and the Code. All annual reports required
to be filed under ERISA with respect to any ERISA Plan have been timely filed
and each initial notification to the Department of Labor with respect to any
ERISA Plan that is intended to

36
<PAGE>

qualify for the alternative ERISA compliance alternative available under
Department of Labor Regulation section 2520.104-23 (relating to an exemption
from annual reporting for so-called "top-hat" plans) has been timely filed.

3.24.4 NO PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS. None of the ERISA Plans or
their fiduciaries has engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (within
the meaning of ERISA and the Code) or breached their fiduciary duties in a

any Subsidiary or Seller to liability for any losses, expenses, damages,
penalties or excise taxes.

3.24.5 FULLY FUNDED. As of January 1, 1994, all of the ERISA Plans
were fully funded on a termination basis using, with respect to the Noranda
Pension Plan, the assumptions set forth on Exhibit 2.3.2, and with respect to
any other ERISA Plan, the current interest rate and mortality assumptions
utilized by the PBGC and the other actuarial assumptions used in the most recent
actuarial valuations of the ERISA Plans. Except as set forth on the Disclosure
Schedule, neither Norandex nor any Subsidiary has "withdrawn" from any
"multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of ERISA). With respect to each
multiemployer plan listed on the Disclosure Schedule, neither Norandex nor any
Subsidiary would have incurred a withdrawal liability under ERISA if Norandex or
any Subsidiary or Noranda or any Affiliate of Noranda had withdrawn from any
such multiemployer plan during the calendar year 1993, except as noted in the
Disclosure Schedule. All contributions required to be made to any multiemployer
plan so listed have been made on or before their due dates.

related thereto, has incurred any federal, state or local tax liability.

37
<PAGE>

than routine claims for benefits) that have been asserted or instituted against
any Employee Benefit Plan, the assets of any Employee Benefit Plan or against
the sponsor, administrator or any fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan with
respect to the operation of such Employee Benefit Plan that could subject
Norandex or any Subsidiary to any liability or expense, nor does Norandex, any
Subsidiary or Seller have any knowledge of any facts which could form the basis
for any such Claim or of any pending investigations by any governmental agency
that could result in any such liability or expense.

3.24.8 COBRA. With respect to the employees and former employees
of Norandex or any Subsidiary, their spouses and their dependents, Seller,
Norandex and each such Subsidiary are in compliance with the notice and
continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code and
regulations thereunder ("COBRA").

3.24.9 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. Neither Norandex nor any Subsidiary
is obligated to provide any benefits under a "welfare benefit plan" (within the
meaning of ERISA) to former employees other than benefits under the Noranda Life
Insurance Plan and so-called "COBRA" health care continuation coverage. Seller
represents and warrants that there are no Employee Benefit Plans of Seller or
Norandex (or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of Seller) providing medical, dental,
health, life insurance, or similar benefits for terminated or retired employees
of Norandex, including early retirees, except under the Noranda Life Insurance
Plan, which Buyer intends to terminate (or cause Norandex to terminate) at or
immediately after the Closing Date, and such as may be required by COBRA.

3.24.10 TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT RIGHT. No action or communication
to employees or former employees of Norandex or a Subsidiary has occurred which
is inconsistent with any provision of any ERISA Plan that is a "welfare benefit
plan" (within

38
<PAGE>

the meaning of ERISA) that reserves the right of Norandex, a Subsidiary or
Seller (or an Affiliate of Seller) to amend or terminate such ERISA Plan.

3.24.11 PARACHUTE PAYMENTS. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein or as disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule, no compensation that is

Agreement and no parachute payment, within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code, will become payable to any employee or director of
Norandex or any Subsidiary as a result of the execution or performance of this
Agreement, or on the termination of any such employee or director on or after
the Closing Date.

3.25 LABOR MATTERS. (i) Norandex and each Subsidiary is and has been in
material compliance with all applicable Laws respecting employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours,
including, without limitation, any such Laws respecting employment
discrimination, occupational safety and health, and unfair labor practices; (ii)
there is no unfair labor practice complaint against Norandex or any Subsidiary
pending or threatened before the National Labor Relations Board or any
comparable state, local or foreign agency; (iii) there is no labor strike,
dispute, slowdown or stoppage actually pending, or threatened against or
directly affecting Norandex or any Subsidiary; (iv) no grievance or arbitration
proceeding is pending and no Claims therefor exist; (v) no agreement which is
binding on Norandex or any Subsidiary restricts Norandex or any Subsidiary from
relocating or closing any of its operations; (vi) Norandex and each Subsidiary
has not experienced any material work stoppage in the last 18 months; (vii)
neither Norandex nor any Subsidiary is delinquent in payments to any of its
employees for any wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses or other direct
compensation for any services performed by them or amounts required to be
reimbursed to such employees; (viii) except

39
<PAGE>

as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, neither Norandex nor any Subsidiary has
established, entered into or maintained any severance pay program, or any
payroll practice to make termination payments, or any other agreement to pay
severance or termination payments to any employee of Norandex or a Subsidiary on
or before the Closing Date; and (ix) there is no, and for the past two years
there has not been any, effort to organize any employees of Norandex or any
Subsidiary or representation campaign or election with respect to any employees
of Norandex or a Subsidiary. The collective bargaining agreement relating to
Norandex employees at its Minneapolis, Minnesota branch is the only collective
bargaining agreement to which Norandex or any Subsidiary is subject or by which
Norandex or any Subsidiary is bound, and Norandex has been and is in material
compliance with such agreement.

5.4 COOPERATION. Seller shall cooperate, and cause the appropriate
parties to cooperate, with Buyer in preparing and making all filings or
submissions to governmental agencies required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, all
filings and submissions under Hart-Scott-Rodino. Seller, at any time before or
after the Closing, shall execute, acknowledge and deliver any further
assignments, assurances, documents and instruments of transfer reasonably
requested by Buyer, and shall take any other action consistent with the terms of
this Agreement that may reasonably be requested by Buyer, for the purpose of
assigning and transferring and delivering the Shares to Buyer at the Closing.

requested by Buyer for the purpose of implementing

5.8 BEST EFFORTS TO CLOSE. Seller shall use, and shall cause Norandex to
use, their respective commercially reasonable best efforts to fulfill the
conditions set forth in Articles 7 and 8 of this Agreement over which they have
control or influence, and to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

5.9 CONSENTS TO LEASE AND CONTRACTS. Seller shall use all reasonable
efforts and cooperate in good faith with Buyer before and after the Closing to
obtain the consents of any third parties which may be required by virtue of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, those consents that are necessary for the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.6 to be true and

47
<PAGE>

correct) under any leases, Understandings or other agreements to which Norandex
or a Subsidiary is a party or by which the assets of Norandex or a Subsidiary
are bound. Seller acknowledges that with respect to such leases, Understandings
or other agreements, it (or an Affiliate) may be required to continue as a party
to or guarantor under some or all of such leases, Understandings or agreements,
notwithstanding transfer of the Shares to Buyer. If Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller (other than Norandex) continues after the Closing as a party to or a
guarantor under some or all of such leases, Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in
good faith and use all reasonable efforts after the Closing to obtain the
agreement of the other party to any such leases to release Seller (or such
Affiliate) as a party to or a guarantor thereunder; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not be deemed to require Norandex or Buyer to agree to economic
terms that are less favorable than the terms of such leases as they are in
effect on the Closing Date. If Seller or any landlord under any such lease so
requests, Buyer shall offer to become a guarantor, in replacement of Seller's
(or such Affiliate's) guaranties, or in order of priority ahead of Seller (or
such Affiliate), of such lease on the same terms and conditions as Seller's (or
such Affiliate's) existing guaranty, and to take such actions and execute such
guaranties or other instruments as are necessary to become such a guarantor.
Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller and hold Seller harmless from all guaranty
payments that Seller (or such Affiliate of Seller) may be required to pay after
the Closing Date by virtue of continuing after the Closing Date as guarantor of
any such lease, provided that there is no default under any such lease as of the
Closing Date. In the event that Norandex defaults under any such lease after
the Closing Date and Buyer defaults under any such guaranty and fails to provide
the indemnification set forth in the preceding sentence, and Noranda is required
to perform as a party to such lease or under its guaranty with respect thereto,
Buyer and Norandex will use all reasonable

48
<PAGE>

efforts to cooperate with Noranda in attempting to effect the sublease of the
premises to a sublessee designated by Noranda and will vacate the premises
thirty days after delivery of a written request from Noranda in order to
facilitate occupancy of the premises by a new tenant.

5.10 EXCLUSIVITY. Seller acknowledges that Buyer will spend substantial
funds in connection with its review of Norandex's business before the Closing
Date, and agrees that from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date
(or until this Agreement is terminated), it will not authorize any of its or
Norandex's officers, directors or representatives to enter into negotiations
with any other party for purposes of selling or disposing of all or any part of
the stock, assets or business of Norandex.

54
<PAGE>

in part from the failure to comply with, or a change in the terms of, any

claim against an Indemnifying Party for indemnification, such claim shall be in
writing and shall state in general terms the facts upon which the Indemnified
Party makes such claim. If any claim or demand is asserted against the
Indemnified Party by a third party and the Indemnified Party seeks to be
indemnified pursuant to this Article 9, the Indemnified Party promptly shall
give written notice to the Indemnifying Party. Failure of an Indemnified Party
to give prompt notice to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this Article 9 except to the extent
that such failure materially and irreparably prejudices the

56
<PAGE>

Indemnifying Party's ability to defend the Claim. Within 15 days after delivery
of such notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver a notice to the Indemnified
Party indicating whether the Indemnifying Party intends to assume the defense of
such claim or demand. Notwithstanding such assumption, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in such defense, provided that such
participation shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless there is a
conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or
different defenses are available to the Indemnified Party, in which case the
cost of such participation (including attorneys fees for counsel selected by the
Indemnified Party, which counsel must be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party) shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement of any Claim without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party, unless the settlement contains a
complete release of all claims and liability against the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnified Party elects to participate in the defense of the Claim, the
parties shall cooperate in the defense of the proceeding, and neither party
shall settle the Claim without the consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
assume the defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to do so (at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party), and may settle the Claim without the consent
of the Indemnifying Party. Any Claims or Losses for Taxes which are covered by
the provisions of Section 2.6 hereof shall be governed by the procedures set
forth in Section 2.6 hereof rather than this Section 9.4.

FIBREBOARD COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF NORANDEX

(WALNUT CREEK, CALIFORNIA, September 1, 1994) - Fibreboard Corporation
(AMEX:FBD) today announced it has successfully completed its acquisition of
Norandex Inc., one of the nation's leading manufacturers of vinyl siding and
distributors of residential exterior building products for both the new
construction and remodeling markets.

For the first seven months of 1994 Norandex generated earnings before
interest and taxes of $9 million on revenues of $119 million, compared with $7
million on revenues of $102 million for the first seven months of 1993. For the
full year 1993 Norandex generated revenues of approximately $192 million and
earnings before interest and taxes of $17 million. The cash acquisition,
previously announced on a preliminary basis in late July, is valued at
approximately $115 million. It is being funded through internally generated
cash and funds from a recently secured $100 million financing facility provided
by a group of seven banks. The acquisition is expected to contribute to
earnings immediately and will be reported in Fibreboard's results of operations
beginning in September.

"The addition of Norandex, with its quality products and extensive 23
state distribution network, clearly transforms Fibreboard into a significant
building products company enhancing our ability to grow and prosper in this
important sector of the economy," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John
D. Roach. "Norandex

is expected to make an immediate contribution to our net profitability, an
important step toward our goal of achieving consolidated net income of between
$3.50 and $5.00 per share within a short time after implementation of the
acquisition program we discussed at our 1994 Annual Shareholder's Meeting. We
are indeed pleased to welcome the Norandex team to our growing Fibreboard
family. While this significant step will increase our annual revenues by 75%,
we remain committed to achieving even further growth and earnings improvement in
our existing operations and through the acquisition of other attractive building
products opportunities," Roach said.

Norandex is a low-cost manufacturer of quality vinyl siding products which
continue to displace other materials as the product of choice for exterior
siding in both residential remodeling and new construction. Headquartered in
Macedonia, Ohio, with a manufacturing plant in Claremont, North Carolina, the
new Fibreboard subsidiary has 745 employees. Its 70 company-owned distribution
centers concentrated in the Midwestern and Eastern United States also distribute
other building products including windows, aluminum siding and building
accessories. The company was previously a subsidiary of Noranda Aluminum, Inc.

Fibreboard, headquartered in Walnut Creek, California, is a building
products company that also manufactures lumber, hardwood plywood, moulding and
millwork, precision molded industrial insulation and fireproofing materials.
The company owns approximately 80,000 acres of timberland in the Sierra Nevada
mountains in California. In addition its Resort Operations Group owns and
operates Northstar-at-Tahoe, an all-season resort featuring skiing, golf, and
conference facilities, and Sierra-at-Tahoe, a day ski facility, both located in
the Lake Tahoe recreational area in California.
