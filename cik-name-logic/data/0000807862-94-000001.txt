FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

FLAGSTAR REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS;
GOODWILL AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES TAKEN IN FOURTH QUARTER

SPARTANBURG, S.C., Jan. 24 -- Flagstar Companies, Inc.
(NASDAQ:FLST) announced today that its Board of Directors has
approved the write-off of $1.5 billion in goodwill and other
intangible assets and a charge of $225 million for restructuring
costs in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 1993.
The Company also reported a 9.6 percent increase in revenues
for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 1993 to $1.02 billion, up
from $925.9 million in the comparable quarter last year. As a
result of the goodwill write-off and restructuring charges, the
Company incurred an operating loss of $1.64 billion for the fourth
quarter, compared to operating income of $60.1 million for the same
period of 1992. Excluding the goodwill write-off and restructuring
charges, operating income increased 7.8 percent to $64.9 million,
while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA) increased 8.2 percent to $131.0 million,
compared with the same quarter last year.

Goodwill and Restructuring Charges

The write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets is a
non-cash charge with no significant effect on Flagstar's future
operations. It resulted from the determination by Flagstar that,
in light of 1993 results, projections based on four-year historical
operating trends are not sufficient to support the future
amortization of the Company's remaining goodwill. This shortfall
results primarily from declining customer traffic trends, increased
competition, adverse economic conditions and limited capital to
address both operational issues and new restaurant growth. The
Company believes that its future cash flows will continue to be
adequate to meet debt service requirements and to fund capital
projects necessary to maintain present operations during the period
of implementation of the restructuring.
4
<PAGE>

The restructuring charges of $225 million are the result of a
comprehensive financial and operational review initiated in 1993 as
a result of disappointing operating results.
The costs of the restructuring plan fall into two broad
categories. Approximately $120 million represents predominantly
non-cash adjustments made to reduce to net realizable value
approximately 270 of the Company's 1,941 restaurants. These
restaurants have been identified for sale to franchisees or
closure. The remaining charges of approximately $105 million
represent a combination of personnel-related costs such as
severance, relocation, and training resulting from changes to the
field management structure of the restaurant group and restaurant
repositioning principally within the Denny's chain as well as
systems development costs necessary to support the new
organizational structure.
"In view of recent Company developments, now is the time to
make the hard decisions to bring our balance sheet into better
alignment with current market realities," said Jerome J.
Richardson, chairman and chief executive officer. "Since 1989,
when the goodwill was recorded, Flagstar's earnings have fallen
short of expectations. Results for 1993 were particularly
disappointing. It is now clear that if current trends continue,
our earnings will not be sufficient to support future amortization
of goodwill."
"During the past year, we have restructured our debt and made
senior management changes at Denny's, Quincy's, El Pollo Loco and
Canteen," Richardson said. "In addition, we have undertaken a
strategic business review which has led to critical initiatives to
upgrade facilities, streamline operations and reposition our
concepts to compete more effectively. Acknowledging that operating
trends do not justify carrying goodwill on the books and
recognizing the cost of our restructuring programs upfront will
enable us to establish an appropriate basis against which future
performance can be measured." 
Richardson said that the majority of the restructuring
initiatives will be completed over the next 18 months.

Fourth-Quarter Results

Principally as a result of the goodwill write-off and
restructuring charges, the company reported a loss before
extraordinary items of $1.63 billion, or $38.62 per share for the
fourth quarter compared to a loss before extraordinary items of
$13.5 million or $0.53 per share for the same quarter in 1992. The
net loss for the fourth quarter was $1.65 billion, or $38.97 per
share, compared to a net loss of $158.2 million, or $5.00 per share
for the comparable 1992 period.
As a result of the impact of the fourth quarter goodwill
write-off and restructuring charges on the effective tax rate for
1993, the company reduced the tax benefit previously associated
with the extraordinary items and cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle. Accordingly, the net charge for
extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle increased by $10.1 million and $4.6 million,
respectively, resulting in charges of $26.4 million and $12.0
million for the full year of 1993, respectively.

<PAGE>

The Company's results for the fourth quarter of 1992 reflect
a charge for extraordinary items of $144.8 million, net of income
taxes, attributable to premiums paid to retire certain indebtedness
and to write-off related unamortized deferred financing costs in
connection with the Company's 1992 recapitalization.
Full-Year Results
Revenues for full year 1993 were $3.97 billion, an increase of
6.7 percent from $3.72 billion reported last year. Excluding the
goodwill write-off and restructuring charges, operating income for
the full year declined 16.4 percent to $206.1 million, from $246.4
million recorded for full year 1992, while EBITDA was $453.1
million, a decline of 4.3 percent from the $473.6 million reported
last year.
For full year 1993, the Company reported a loss before
extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle of $1.68 billion, or $40.02 per share, compared with a
loss of $51.8 million, or $2.32 per share for 1992. The net loss
for the 1993 year was $1.72 billion, or $40.93 per share for the
year, compared with a net loss of $225.0 million, or $9.29 per
share in 1992.
Per share amounts for the quarter and year ended December 31,
1993 and 1992 reflect, where applicable, the issuance in November
1992 of 100 million additional shares (pre-split) of common stock
and a June 16, 1993 five-for-one reverse stock split.
Restaurants
Denny's reported a 10.9 percent increase in revenues to $395.7 
million for the quarter, up from $356.7 million last year. This
increase reflected the net addition of 61 new company-owned and
franchise restaurants, offset in part by a 1.3 percent decrease in
average unit sales compared to the prior year period. Excluding
the goodwill write-off and restructuring charges, Denny's reported
a 1.3 percent increase in operating income to $29.3 million,
compared with $29.0 million reported in the prior year quarter. 
Denny's operating margin was lower in the fourth quarter due to
higher product costs. Denny's traffic declined 7.0 percent during
the fourth quarter, which in part was due to the discontinuance of
the free birthday meal program and reduced discounting. Fourth
quarter revenue and operating income results for Denny's reflect a
14-week accounting period in 1993 versus a 13-week accounting
period in 1992.
Hardee's fourth quarter revenues increased 8.4 percent to
$172.1 million, from $158.7 million reported in the prior year,
reflecting the net addition of 36 new restaurants and a 1.9 percent
increase in average unit sales. While traffic declined 2.6 percent
during the quarter -- partially as a result of strong year-over-
year comparisons with a 1992 period during which many of the
restaurants had just begun introducing the popular fresh fried
chicken product -- the average check increased 4.6 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1993 compared with the prior year period due to the
impact of the fresh fried chicken and a marketing emphasis on other
higher priced menu items.
Hardee's operating income, excluding the goodwill write-off
and restructuring charges, was $23.2 million, an increase of 19.9
percent over $19.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 1992.

<PAGE>

Average unit sales for Quincy's Family Steakhouse increased
3.1 percent during the quarter, while total revenues increased 1.1
percent to $68.5 million compared with the same quarter last year. 
Four Quincy's units were closed during 1993. Quincy's operating
income, excluding the goodwill write-off and restructuring charges,
increased 21.8 percent to $4.3 million from $3.6 million in the
prior year quarter. The Company began to test a new all-buffet
concept in the Columbia, S.C. area, and results thus far have been
encouraging.
While revenues at El Pollo Loco increased 13.7 percent to
$28.4 million, from $25.0 million in the comparable 1992 quarter,
the operating loss for the quarter before the goodwill write-off
and restructuring charges was $898,000, versus an operating profit
of $72,000 for the same quarter last year. The loss resulted from
heavy discounting during the quarter, which was necessary to
sustain sales in the midst of the fiercely competitive and
recessionary environment in California.

Contract Food and Recreation Services

Canteen reported a 10.3 percent increase in fourth quarter
revenues to $350.5 million, from $317.7 million in the prior year
period. Revenues in the food and vending division continue to be
negatively impacted by reductions in client employee levels, but
were offset by acquisitions and new business. Excluding the
goodwill write-off and restructuring charges, operating income
declined 17.8 percent to $11.8 million, from $14.3 million in the
comparable period last year. 
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures were $68.0 million in the fourth quarter,
compared with $55.1 million in the same 1992 quarter. For full-
year 1993, capital expenditures were $225.5 million, compared with
$178.2 million in 1992.
Flagstar, one of the nation's largest food service companies,
owns and operates Denny's, Quincy's and El Pollo Loco restaurants
and is the largest franchisee of Hardee's restaurants. Flagstar
also provides contract food, vending and recreation services
through its Canteen company.
