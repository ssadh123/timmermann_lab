NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations
for the fiscal year ended January 1, 1994 has been prepared
assuming the Acquisition had been consummated on January 3, 1993
and includes the historical consolidated results of operations of
the Company for the fiscal year ended January 1, 1994 and the
historical results of Frozen Specialty Foods for the twelve
months ended November 27, 1993. The pro forma combined results
of operations are not necessarily indicative of results of
operations that would have resulted had the Acquisition actually
occurred on January 3, 1993 nor are they necessarily indicative
of future results of operations.

The pro forma combined statement of operations does not give
effect to the loss on early extinguishment of debt resulting from
the consummation of a new bank term loan and revolving line of
credit and early extinguishment of the existing revolving line of
credit. The estimated loss of $3.1 million, which will be
reduced by income taxes (assuming a statutory (federal and state)
tax rate of 40%) of $1.2 million, resulting from the early
extinguishment of this debt, will be recorded as an extraordinary
item during the period the debt is extinguished (second quarter
of fiscal 1994).

Note 2. Pro Forma Adjustments

(a) To record the net change in depreciation based on the fair
value of depreciable assets over their historical cost,
using the straight line method over their estimated useful
lives.

(b) To record amortization of goodwill attributable to the
acquisition over a period of 30 years and eliminate
amortization of the historical goodwill.

(c) To record additional interest attributable to the increase
in bank debt to finance the acquisition and eliminate
interest on debt which will not be assumed by the Company
and debt which will be extinguished.

(d) To record amortization of debt issue costs over the term of
the new bank debt and eliminate amortization of debt issue
costs attributable to debt which will be extinguished.

(e) To record the tax benefit attributable to the net pro forma
adjustments based on the statutory (federal and state) tax
rate of 40%. The effective tax rate in future years is
expected to be in excess of the statutory rate due to non-
deductible amortization of previously recorded intangible
assets.

(f) The weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares used in the pro forma earnings per share computation
were 7,419,000 (historical).

OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. -- March 18, 1994 -- Doskocil
Companies Incorporated (NASDAQ:DOSK) today announced the signing
of a definitive agreement to purchase the Frozen Specialty Foods
division of International Multifoods Corporation (NYSE:IMC) for
approximately $135 million, subject to customary purchase price
adjustments. The acquisition provides Doskocil with leading
market positions in fast-growing segments of the foodservice
market and furthers the company's strategy of gaining dominant
positions in the food processing industry.
The company has received a commitment from Chemical Bank to
provide financing for the transaction.
Frozen Specialty, with 1993 revenues of approximately $185
million, is a processor and marketer of prepared frozen food
products primarily for the foodservice and consumer markets. 
These include ethnic foods, the fastest growing category within
the foodservice industry, as well as appetizers, entrees and
portion meats. Frozen Specialty's ethnic products include
Mexican and Italian foods such as burritos and pasta. The
majority of these products is sold to the foodservice industry; a
portion of the Mexican products is also sold to the retail
industry.
Robert S. Wright, president of Multifoods' Prepared Foods
division, will join Doskocil and will have responsibility for the
ongoing operation of the business.
Commenting on the acquisition, John T. Hanes, Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The addition of
Multifood's Frozen Specialty division enhances Doskocil's
foodservice business with leadership positions in the Mexican and
Italian segments and builds on our strengths in pepperoni and
pizza toppings. Further, Frozen Specialty's lines complement our
own leadership role within other products in the foodservice,
retail and deli markets. The acquisition marks an important step
in Doskocil's strategic transition from the meat processing
business to the broader food processing market."
Mr. Hanes continued, "Headed by strong senior management,
Frozen Specialty has essentially run on a stand-alone basis
within International Multifoods. We are pleased that Bob Wright
will remain at the helm, helping to ensure a smooth transition
and the continued growth and success of Frozen Specialty's
product-line."
Consummation of the acquisition is subject to certain
conditions including, among other things, the expiration of
termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976.
Separately, Doskocil confirmed that its search for a new
Chief Executive Officer continues and that John Hanes, who
announced his retirement in October 1993, will remain as CEO
until his successor has been identified and an orderly transition
plan established.
Doskocil produces, markets and distributes branded and
processed meat products under proprietary brand names that
include Wilson Foods(R), Corn King(R), Wilson's Continental
Deli(R), American Favorite (TM), Doskocil Foods(TM) and Jefferson
Meats(TM). The company's products include pepperoni, beef and
pork toppings marketed to the pizza industry as well as boneless
hams, sausage, bacon and other branded and processed meat
products for the foodservice, delicatessen and retail markets.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors
International Multifoods Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the Frozen
Specialty Foods Business (a unit of the Prepared Foods Division
of International Multifoods Corporation) as of November 27, 1993,
February 27, 1993 and February 29, 1992 and the related
statements of earnings and cash flows for the nine months ended
November 27, 1993 and the years ended February 27, 1993 and
February 29, 1992. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Frozen Specialty Foods Business (a unit of the Prepared
Foods Division of International Multifoods Corporation) as of
November 27, 1993, February 27, 1993 and February 29, 1992, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the nine
months ended November 27, 1993 and the years ended February 27,
1993 and February 29, 1992 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in notes 1 and 11 to the financial statements, the
Company adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, in the nine months ended
November 27, 1993.

As discussed in note 9 to the financial statements, the Company
adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions, in the year ended February 29, 1992.

Fiscal Period

The Company's fiscal periods end on the last Saturday of the
month.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized at the time of shipment to the
customer.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market (replacement or net realizable value).

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. 
Depreciation on plant and equipment is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the lease terms or
estimated useful lives of the related assets.

Intangibles

Intangibles represents the excess of cost of business
acquired over the fair market value of net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets. Intangibles are amortized
on a straight-line basis over not more than a 40-year
period.

Income Taxes

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Under the asset and
liability method of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. The
Company adopted SFAS 109 March 1, 1993 which resulted in a
cumulative effect of a change in the method of accounting
for income taxes of $4,060 for the nine months ended
November 27, 1993.

Under the deferred method applied in prior years, deferred
taxes were recognized using the tax rate applicable to the
year of the calculation and were not adjusted for subsequent
changes in tax rates.

(8) Retirement Plans

Multifoods has two defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all employees of Frozen Specialty. Benefits
are based on the final average salary for salaried employees
and years of credited service for hourly employees. The
plans are generally funded by contributions to tax-exempt
trusts in amounts estimated sufficient to provide assets to
cover the plans' benefits. Plan assets consist principally
of listed equity securities, fixed income securities and
cash equivalents. The pension expense (benefit) recorded
for Frozen Specialty for the nine months ended November 27,
1993 and the years ended February 27, 1993 and February 29,
1992, was $(126), $(201) and $30, respectively. The
information required to determine the total amount of
accumulated benefits and net assets for Frozen Specialty is
not readily available.

Multifoods sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers
salaried, sales and certain hourly employees at Frozen
Specialty. Multifoods makes contributions equal to 50% of
the employee's contribution subject to certain limitations. 
Employer contributions for Frozen Specialty employees
totaled $223, $221 and $155 for the nine months ended
November 27, 1993 and the years ended February 27, 1993 and
February 29, 1992, respectively.

(9) Postretirement Health and Life Insurance Benefits

The Company provides postretirement health and life
insurance benefits for retirees who meet minimum age and
service requirements. The costs of the life insurance
benefits are funded over the employees' active working lives
through contributions to an insurance continuation fund
maintained by an insurance company. Health care benefits
for retired employees are funded through an insurance
company, the funding of which is on a pay-as-you-go basis in
accordance with the actual claims paid plus administrative
expenses.

In fiscal 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, (SFAS 106). 
SFAS 106 requires an employer to recognize the cost of
retiree health and life insurance benefits over the
employees' period of service. Prior to fiscal 1992, expense
was recognized equal to the funding of the plans. The
cumulative effect as of March 1, 1991 of adopting SFAS 106
was a one-time charge to net earnings of $1,608.

During fiscal 1993, certain of the Company's postretirement
health benefit plans were amended resulting in a decrease in
accumulated benefit obligations and service and interest
costs.

The periodic postretirement expense (benefit) under SFAS 106
was as follows:

Nine
Months Year Ended
Ended
November February February
27, 1993 27, 1993 29, 1992

Service costs $ 84 138 218
Interest costs 48 84 240
Amortization of unrecognized
effect from plan amendments (142) (131) -

Net postretirement
expense (benefit) $ (10) 91 458

The information required to determine the components of
accrued postretirement cost for Frozen Specialty is not
readily available. The total accrued postretirement cost at
November 27, 1993, February 27, 1993 and February 29, 1992
was $3,219, $3,229 and $3,138, respectively.

The assumed annual rate of future increases in per capita
cost of health care benefits ranged from 4% to 8% for each
of the next 10 years and 4% thereafter. These trend rates
reflect the Company's prior experience, plan provisions and
management's expectation of future rates. The weighted
average discount rates used in determining the accumulated
benefit obligation were 7.25%, 8.0% and 8.5% for the nine
months ended November 27, 1993 and for the years ended
February 27, 1993 and February 29, 1992, respectively. The
information to determine the impact on the accumulated
benefit obligation and the service and interest cost of a 1%
increase in the health care cost is not readily available
for Frozen Specialty.

(10) Concentration of Risks

At November 27, 1993, February 27, 1993 and February 29,
1992, receivables from a distributor totaled $1,449, $1,912
and $1,406, respectively. No single customer accounted for
more than 10% of total revenue for the nine months ended
November 27, 1993 and the years ended February 27, 1993 and
February 29, 1992.

(11) Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return
with Multifoods and is allocated a federal tax provision as
if the Company filed a separate return. The state tax
praovision is allocated by applying a weighted-average state
tax rate to the Company's federal taxable income. 
Additional tax provision items pertaining to the Company are
maintained in the Multifoods financial statements.

Income tax expense, excluding the tax on the cumulative
effect of an accounting change for the year ended February
29, 1992, was allocated as follows:

Federal State Total

Nine months ended November 27, 1993:

reported in the statement of earnings for the nine months
ended November 27, 1993. Prior years' financial statements
have not been restated to apply the provisions of SFAS 109.

Deferred income tax expense for the nine months ended
November 27, 1993 reflects the impact of temporary
differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by
tax laws. These temporary differences are determined in
accordance with SFAS 109 and are more inclusive in nature
than timing differences as determined under previously
applicable accounting principles.
