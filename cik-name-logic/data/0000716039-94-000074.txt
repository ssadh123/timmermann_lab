On October 31, 1994, the following news release was issued:

UNOCAL REPORTS $60 MILLION EARNINGS FOR THIRD QUARTER
-----------------------------------------------------

Los Angeles, October 31 -- Unocal Corporation today reported third
quarter 1994 net earnings of $60 million, or 21 cents per common share,
compared with $70 million, or 25 cents per common share, for the same
period a year ago. Total revenues were $2.02 billion, up slightly from
$1.96 billion a year ago.
Excluding the effects of special items (detailed in attached table),
Unocal's earnings from operations for the third quarter were $59 million,
or 21 cents per common share. This compares with operating earnings of $91
million, or 34 cents per common share, for the same period last year.
For the first nine months of 1994, Unocal's reported net earnings were
$164 million, or 57 cents per common share. This compares with $169
million, or 59 cents per common share, for the same period a year ago.
Nine-months revenues were $5.98 billion, down from $6.38 billion last year.
Adjusting for special items, earnings from operations for the nine
months were $186 million, down from $277 million last year. Adjusted
earnings per common share were 66 cents, down from $1.04.
Roger C. Beach, Unocal chief executive officer, said the company's
third quarter operating earnings were adversely affected by significantly
lower natural gas prices and reduced margins from petroleum refining and
marketing operations.
"On the plus side," Beach said, "our worldwide crude oil and
condensate production is up nearly 10 percent, while natural gas production
is about 17 percent above the third quarter a year ago."
Beach noted, however, that domestic oil production in the third
quarter declined 6 percent from the same period a year ago. He said that
he expects the company's U.S. oil production will continue to decline,
reflecting the company's capital spending focus on natural gas projects
worldwide and the possible sales of various U.S. producing properties.
Unocal's average worldwide crude oil sales price was $14.95 per barrel
in the third quarter, up from $13.76 per barrel last year. The company's
worldwide average natural gas sales price was $1.76 per thousand cubic feet
(mcf), down from $2.04 per mcf in the third quarter 1993.

"The higher crude oil prices, while contributing to improved upstream
earnings, put additional pressures on margins for our West Coast refining
and marketing business," Beach said. "We're taking steps to increase the
cash flow and earnings from our downstream business by improving efficiency
and adding ancillary businesses to our marketing network."
Beach also noted that margins on export sales of urea and ammonia
products were significantly higher in the third quarter.
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter, before working capital
changes, was $331 million, down from $346 million.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $321 million, down
slightly from $324 million in the same period a year ago.

THIRD QUARTER OPERATIONS
- ------------------------
Petroleum exploration and production earnings were $111 million, up
from $106 million a year ago. The higher earnings were due principally to
increased worldwide crude oil and natural gas production. This was offset
partially by lower domestic natural gas prices. The company's foreign
exploration and production operations recorded significant gains due to
higher crude oil production in Indonesia and the Netherlands and increased
natural gas sales in Thailand due to increased pipeline allocations.

Adjusted for special items, earnings from petroleum exploration and
production operations were $105 million, up from $101 million in the same
period a year ago.
Earnings from refining, marketing and transportation were $18 million,
down from $49 million in the third quarter 1993. Adjusting for special
items, operating earnings from the downstream segment were $21 million,
down from $56 million a year ago.
Chemicals earnings were $12 million, up from $5 million in the third
quarter 1994. This increase reflected higher margins on export sales of
ammonia-based agricultural products.
Geothermal earnings were $11 million, up from $3 million a year ago.
The improved earnings reflected lower domestic expense and the beginning of
commercial operations at the Salak field in Indonesia.
Net expense for corporate and other was $92 million in the third
quarter 1994. This compares with an expense of $93 million in the same
period of 1993. Adjusted for special items, net expense for corporate and
other was $89 million, compared with $76 million last year. The third
quarter 1993 reflected favorable adjustments for California state income
tax provisions.
