Item 5. Other Events

On April 28, 1994, the Company issued the following news release: 

OG&E BOARD HOLDS SPECIAL MEETING
--------------------------------
The Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company Board of Directors
held a special meeting Thursday to review the details of
an early retirement package for employees, discuss a
proposed organizational change and name new officers.
These actions resulted from OG&E's ongoing effort to
redesign the Company for increasing competition within
the industry.

The board approved a voluntary early retirement package
that will be offered to OG&E employees age 50 or over and
be effective July 31, 1994.

The board also approved a proposed organizational change
in the Company that will take effect on August 1. The
change places all company activities into seven
operational and administrative groups headquartered in
Oklahoma City.

Officers named to lead the newly structured organization
are James G. Harlow Jr., chairman, president and CEO; Pat
Ryan, vice chairman; Al Strecker, senior vice president
of finance and administration; Steve Moore, senior vice
president of law and public affairs; Melvin Bowen, vice
president of power delivery; Jack Coffman, vice president
of power supply; Mike Davis, vice president of marketing
and customer service; Irma Elliott, corporate secretary
and Jim Edwards, president of Enogex.

"While there are many details left to be worked out, the
actions we have taken restructures OG&E to be much more
efficient and responsive to customers," said OG&E
Chairman and President James G. Harlow Jr.

The first phase of the Company's redesign effort, which
began six weeks ago, concluded with Thursday's board
action.
