THE FIRST SAVINGS BANK, FSB
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES
The following is a description of the more significant accounting and
reporting policies which the Bank follows in preparing and presenting its
consolidated financial statements.
(A) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Bank and all subsidiaries, and in consolidation all significant intercompany
items are eliminated.
(B) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash on hand, cash items in transit to depository institutions, cash
balances in depository institutions, federal funds sold, and overnight time
deposits are defined as cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting
purposes.
(C) INVESTMENT SECURITIES
The Bank maintained liquid assets in excess of the amount required by
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) regulations during all periods included in
these consolidated financial statements. The required amount is 5% of the
average daily balances of deposits and short-term borrowings. Liquid assets
consist principally of cash, including time deposits, and investment securities.
Investment securities are carried at amortized cost and are not adjusted to
the lower of cost or market because management has the intention and the ability
to hold the securities to maturity. Premiums and discounts on investment
securities are amortized over the life of the security using a method that
approximates level yield. Gains and losses on sales of these securities are
recognized when realized.
The stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank has no quoted market value, and no
ready market exists. The investment in the stock is required by law of every
federally insured thrift.
The cost of investments sold is determined by specific identification.
(D) INTEREST INCOME
Interest earned on loans receivable is recorded in the period earned. An
allowance for uncollected interest is established for all interest accrued on
delinquent loans in accordance with regulatory requirements. Delinquent interest
ultimately collected is credited to income in the period of recovery.
(E) LOAN ORIGINATION AND COMMITMENT FEES AND LOAN COSTS
Loan origination and commitment fees are deferred net of specified costs as
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 91, "Accounting for
Non-refundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and
Initial Direct Costs of Leases" (FAS 91). If no fees are charged, the FAS 91
specified loan cost is deferred. The net deferred fees or costs are accreted or
amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the loans using the
level yield method.
(F) UNEARNED AND UNAMORTIZED PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS
All unearned and unamortized premiums or discounts on loans receivable are
accreted or amortized to income over the remaining lives of the loans adjusted
for prepayments using a method approximating a level yield.
(G) ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost, committed purchase
price, or market. A quarterly analysis is done to determine the market value of
the held for sale assets, and an adjustment to the carrying value is made if
necessary.
When loans are sold with servicing rights retained, the Bank realizes
additional gains or losses if the actual servicing fees to be received differ
from the normal servicing fees. Such gains or losses are calculated as the
present value of the

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES -- Continued
differential between the actual servicing fee and the normal servicing fee over
the remaining life of the loans serviced, adjusted for estimated prepayments.
The resulting discount or premium is amortized over the estimated remaining
lives of such loans, adjusted for actual prepayments.
Normal servicing fees are recognized as income in the period earned.
(H) PURCHASED MORTGAGE SERVICING
Loan servicing rights purchased (PMSRs) are recorded at cost and are
amortized over the estimated remaining lives of the loans serviced adjusted for
prepayments. PMSRs are included in other assets.
(I) PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES
Valuation allowances for specific loans receivable are charged to income
when declines in value reduce the market value of the collateral below their
carrying value. In addition to specific valuation allowances, management has
established a policy of providing amounts for loan valuation purposes not
identified with any specific loan derived from actual loss experience ratios,
loan types, loan volume, economic conditions, industry standards and other
relevant factors.
(J) REAL ESTATE
For fiscal years prior to and including 1992, real estate acquired through
foreclosure (REO) and in-substance foreclosure was recorded at the lower of cost
or fair value. Subsequent to the transfer from loans to real estate acquired
through foreclosure, the property was carried at the lower of the new cost basis
or net realizable value. Prior to Statement of Position 92-3 "Accounting for
Foreclosed Assets" (SOP 92-3), cost was defined as the principal balance (less
any allowance for uncollected interest and/or valuation allowances) of the
former mortgage loan. In accordance with SOP 92-3, that policy was changed for
fiscal 1993 such that REO, as well as in-substance foreclosure, is carried at
the lower of cost (which is now defined as fair value at the time of
repossession less estimated disposition cost) or fair value less disposition
costs.
Real estate acquired for development and resale (READR) is stated at
initial acquisition cost plus costs of improvements, including interest. READR
investments are reviewed regularly and allowances for valuations are established
when the carrying values exceed estimated net realizable values.
Construction costs incurred in the residential land development operations
are accounted for on a unit-by-unit basis. Land acquisition costs and other
development costs not attributable to specific units are allocated based on the
projected selling prices of the unsold units. Estimated additional costs to be
incurred relating to units sold are accrued and considered in determining gains
or losses on units sold.
Interest charges during the development period of construction of READR
projects are capitalized as a cost of the project. When construction is
complete, interest charges are expended as a period cost. Interest charges on
real estate acquired through foreclosure are expended as a period cost.
Gains on the sale of real estate acquired for development and resale are
recorded at the time of sale provided certain criteria relating to property
type, cash down payment, loan terms, and other factors are met. If these
criteria are not met at the date of sale, the gain is deferred and recognized
using the installment or cost-recovery method until they are satisfied, at which
time the remaining deferred gain is recorded as income.
(K) PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT
Premises and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation, which is based on the useful lives of the assets. Buildings are
depreciated primarily over forty years using principally the straight-line
method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their respective
lives or the primary lease term using primarily the straight-line method.
Furniture and equipment are depreciated over ten years using principally the
straight-line method. Automobiles are depreciated over four years using the
straight-line method.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES -- Continued
Certain premises and equipment were sold and leased back. The related gain
on the sale has been deferred and is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over the primary lease term (ten years). The related rental expense is being
charged to earnings based on the average lease payments over the primary lease
term.
(L) INCOME TAXES
Deferred income taxes result from timing differences in the recognition of
income and expenses for financial statement and tax purposes.
(M) PENSION EXPENSE
Accrued pension expense is funded annually and includes a charge for prior
service costs.
(N) GOODWILL
Goodwill, representing the excess of cost over fair value of assets
acquired in transactions accounted for as purchases, is being amortized over
thirty-five years using the straight-line method. The acquisitions giving rise
to the goodwill were consummated prior to the Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 72, which became effective September 30, 1982.
(O) PREMIUM ON DEPOSIT ACQUISITIONS
Premium on deposit acquisitions is being amortized over the estimated lives
of the deposits (primarily nineteen to twenty-two years) using the straight-line
method. The amount amortized is included in interest expense on deposits.
(P) DEBT ISSUANCE COST
The cost of issuing the subordinated capital notes (SCN) was capitalized
and is being amortized over ten years using a method approximating a level
yield. Debt issuance costs are netted against the related debt amount and the
amortization of such costs are included in interest expense on borrowings.
(Q) MORTGAGE-BACKED CERTIFICATES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE
The Bank may enter into sales of mortgage-backed certificates (MBCs) under
agreements to repurchase (reverse repurchase agreements and dollar price
repurchase agreements). Reverse repurchase agreements are treated as financing
transactions. The obligations to repurchase MBCs sold are reflected in other
borrowed money and the MBCs underlying the agreements are reflected as assets in
the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Dollar price repurchase agreements are recorded as financing transactions
if specific criteria are met, primarily the requirement to repurchase MBCs that
are substantially the same as those delivered into the transaction. The Bank is
required to record the transaction as a sale if the criteria to qualify as a
financing transaction are not met.
(R) OPTIONS AND FINANCIAL FUTURES
The Bank periodically engages in hedging activities through the options and
financial futures markets in an effort to protect interest-sensitive assets and
liabilities against the effects of adverse changes in interest rates. Gains and
losses on options or futures positions used to hedge the cost of variable-rate
deposits are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the
contractual lives of the related deposits. Gains and losses on options or
futures positions used to hedge the value of interest-sensitive assets are
treated as adjustments to the basis of the related asset and are amortized as
adjustments of yield to maturity. There were no open positions at June 30, 1993
and 1992.
(S) EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average
number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the
year. Common share equivalents include, if applicable, dilutive stock option
share equivalents determined by using the treasury stock method.

The contractual maturity dates of the mortgage-backed certificates are
beyond ten years. However, the expected maturities differ from the contractual
maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay obligations without
prepayment penalties. The proceeds from the sales of mortgage-backed
certificates during fiscal 1993 and fiscal 1992 were $12,242,000 and
$126,951,000, respectively. Gross gains of $143,000 and $2,070,000, respectively
were realized on the sales. There were no losses realized on the sales during
fiscal 1993. Gross losses realized during fiscal 1992 were $28,045.
As disclosed in Note 10, mortgage-backed certificates of $170,782,000 and
$33,457,000 at June 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively, were pledged to secure
advances. As disclosed in Note 11, certain GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC mortgage-backed
certificates are pledged to secure other borrowed money. In addition, GNMA, FNMA
and FHLMC mortgage-backed certificates of approximately $50,074,000 and
$60,958,000 at June 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively, are pledged to secure
deposits.

The Bank has restructured loans including interest amounting to
approximately $16.0 million and $23.3 million at June 30, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. These loans are secured by various types of collateral including
shopping centers and a marina. The restructured terms do not change the original
maturities of these loans. The amount of gross interest income that would have
been recorded during 1993 and 1992 if these loans were in accordance with the
original terms would have been approximately $1.7 million and $2.5 million,
respectively. The amount of interest actually included in interest income
amounted to approximately $822,000 and $1.4 million, respectively.

The Bank adopted SOP 92-3 during the quarter ended March 31, 1993. As
stated in the 1992 Annual Report, real estate acquired through foreclosure was
previously carried at the lower of cost, estimated fair value, or net realizable
value. SOP 92-3 requires that such assets be carried at the lower of cost or
fair value less disposition costs. This change in accounting policy had a
minimal impact on the recorded net real estate balances. See Regulatory Changes
and Accounting and Reporting Changes for more discussion on this issue and its
impact. Also see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of the Bank's policy.

11. SUBORDINATED CAPITAL NOTES AND OTHER BORROWED MONEY
During 1987, the Bank issued $8,188,500 in face amount of unsecured
subordinated capital notes with a weighted average interest rate of 11.13% which
mature during 1997. These notes may be redeemed only upon death of the holder,
and to date $150,000 have been redeemed. OTS regulations provide for the
inclusion of these subordinated capital notes in the calculation of regulatory
capital. At June 30, 1993, 100% can be included in capital.
Other borrowed money at June 30, is summarized as follows:

The mortgage-backed certificates underlying the reverse repurchase
agreements (RRP) and dollar price repurchase agreements (DPR) were delivered to
the primary government security dealers who arranged the transactions. At the
maturity dates of the RRP transactions, the original securities will be returned
to the Bank. The RRP's outstanding during 1993 and 1992 averaged $33,834,000 and
$16,853,000, respectively. The maximum amounts of RRP's outstanding at any
month-end during 1993 and 1992 were $62,050,000 and $32,494,000, respectively.
The DPR securities may have been loaned, sold or otherwise disposed of by the
dealers to other parties in their normal course of business and the dealers have
agreed to resell to the Bank substantially identical securities upon maturity of
the agreements. The DPRs outstanding during 1993 and 1992

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
12. INCOME TAXES -- Continued
The Internal Revenue Code allows thrifts a special bad debt deduction based
on the greater of actual experience or a percentage of taxable income before
such deduction. The applicable percentage for the years ended June 30, 1993,
1992 and 1991 was approximately 8.0%.
The bad debt deduction determined for tax purposes is not charged to
earnings in the accompanying financial statements, but results in an
appropriation to restricted retained earnings for tax purposes. The accumulated
appropriation of bad debts in restricted retained earnings at June 30, 1993,
1992 and 1991 was approximately $16,851,000, $15,920,000 and $16,105,000,
respectively. Reductions of such amounts for other than bad debt losses create
earnings for tax purposes.
The Bank's tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) through June 30, 1990. Management settled with the IRS on a claim for
refund due to net operating losses and bad debt deductions. As a result $600,000
was taken as a reduction to income tax expense.
The Bank has not adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" for the year ending June 30, 1993. But if the
adoption had occurred, net earnings would have increased $5.2 million or $.56
per share.
13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
On December 15, 1983, the Bank converted from a federal mutual to a federal
stock association. At that date, eligible deposit account holders were granted
priority interest in the unlikely event of future liquidation of the Bank by the
establishment of a liquidation account equal to net worth at June 30, 1983. In
the event of such liquidation, and only in such event, an eligible deposit
account holder who continues to maintain his deposit account shall be entitled
to receive a distribution from the liquidation account, in the proportionate
amount of the then current adjusted balance for deposit accounts, before any
distributions may be made to the Bank's stockholders. Regulations of the OTS do
not permit the Bank to pay dividends on common stock if its stockholders' equity
would thereby be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account
or the Bank's regulatory capital requirement.
A reconciliation of stockholders' equity to statutory capital requirements
at June 30, 1993 (unaudited) follows:

requirements. The Bank, as discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis, is
always looking for ways to augment capital and will continue to restructure its
assets to improve its compliance with the risk-based requirement.

14. STOCK DIVIDEND
On January 21, 1993, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock
split effected as a 50% stock dividend payable to stockholders of record as of
February 2, 1993. The distribution date was February 23, 1993 with fractional
shares paid in cash based on the adjusted market value of the stock at the
distribution date. The weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per
share amounts for the prior years have been restated to reflect the distribution
of the stock dividend.
15. STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLANS
The Bank has two plans -- the 1983 Stock Option and Incentive Plan and the
1992 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. The stock options pursuant to the plans
are to be granted primarily to directors, officers and other key employees.
Options granted under the Option Plans may be incentive stock options or
non-incentive stock options. The plans also provide for the granting of stock
appreciation rights as well as restricted stock. The shares of stock reserved
for the 1983 option plan amounted to 940,268, 739,642, and 785,554 shares at
June 30, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. On November 6, 1992, 40,500 options
were issued to participants of the 1983 option plan. Unexercised options to
purchase 273,183 shares were surrendered to the Bank during the year ended June
30, 1991. On November 17, 1992, the shareholders of the Bank approved, by a
majority vote, the adoption of the 1992 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. The
shares of stock reserved for the 1992 Plan amounted to 450,000 shares and grants
made from this plan amounted to 113,700 options. At June 30, 1993, the Bank had
the following options outstanding from both plans:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
OPTION
GRANT DATE SHARES PRICE EXPIRATION DATE
<S> <C> <C> <C>
December 15, 1983.......................................... 2,634 $3.30 December 8, 1993

November 6, 1992........................................... 154,200 7.58 November 6, 2002
</TABLE>

During the years ended June 30, 1993 and 1992, options for 249,380 and
45,912 shares were exercised, respectively. Some of the options exercised this
year were non-incentive options, which are treated as compensation to the
employee and a tax deduction for the institution. The accounting procedure is to
record a tax benefit to paid in capital equal to the tax rate multiplied by the
total difference between fair market value on the date of exercise and the
exercise price. The resulting impact was an increase to paid in capital of
$471,000 and a corresponding reduction to current income taxes payable.
16. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (ESPP)
On July 21, 1987, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of an
ESOP to enable eligible employees to acquire stock ownership interest in the
Bank. The stockholders, at their annual meeting on October 27, 1987, approved
the ESOP. The ESOP is a leveraged employee stock ownership plan as described in
Section 497(e)(7) and is a "qualified" retirement plan under Section 401(a) and
501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. All full-time salaried employees after one
year of service and attaining 21 years of age are eligible to participate. Each
participant will become fully vested after five years of service. The Board of
Directors determines the amount, if any, to be contributed to the ESOP each
year. The contribution will be shares of common stock, cash or other property.
The Bank accrued $210,000 in fiscal 1993, $195,000 in fiscal 1992, and $170,000
in fiscal 1991 for the ESOP. The ESOP purchased unissued shares at the closing
market price as summarized in the following table:

(ESPP) -- Continued
The Bank also has a plan called the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)
that allows employees to invest in the stock of the company and thereby increase
ownership within the bank. On October 29, 1990, the shareholders approved an
amendment to the ESPP that allowed the plan to purchase unissued shares directly
from the bank on a specific day of each month at the market price for that date.

The Bank has a non-contributory trustee retirement plan for all salaried
employees who have attained the age of 21 years but not 60 years at the date of
their employment and have one year of service prior to the next anniversary date
of the plan. The normal retirement date is the first of the calendar month in
which the participant reaches the age of 65.

</TABLE>

The weighted average discount rate used in valuing liabilities was 9.5% as
was the expected return on plan assets for the current year. Anticipated salary
increases were 6.5%.
The Bank also has two incentive compensation plans, one for senior
management and one for selected other employees. The plans provide for incentive
bonuses to be paid if specified objectives, to be determined each year, are met.
The senior management plan is tied to a corporate profitability objective
(determined annually by the Board) that must be exceeded for any bonuses to be
paid to senior management. The incentive bonuses, as provided for in the plans,
may range up to 35% and 50% of annual compensation for selected other employees
and senior management, respectively, with targeted bonus levels being
established annually. The targeted bonus levels for the fiscal 1993 year were
10% and 15% for selected other employees and senior management, respectively.
The amount expended for these plans in 1993, 1992 and 1991 was $634,000,
$461,000, and $512,000, respectively.

On December 13, 1991, The First Savings Bank sold four of its branch
offices to Carolina First Savings Bank, (formerly First Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Georgetown), a subsidiary of Carolina First Corporation. The sale
of the Myrtle Beach offices consisted of $10.0 million in installment loans,
$319,000 in premises and equipment, and the assumption of $37.0 million in
deposits by Carolina First. The resulting gain before income taxes, net of

20. LITIGATION
The Bank is a defendant in a lawsuit filed in 1991 in the Court of Common
Pleas, Thirteenth Judicial Circuit, State of South Carolina. On May 21, 1993, a
jury awarded the plaintiffs a $4.1 million judgment against the Bank consisting
of $500,000 in actual damages and $3.6 million in punitive damages for allegedly
acting as a control person and aiding and abetting a state securities law
violation. The plaintiffs, limited partners in a failed venture to construct and
operate a residential health care facility for senior citizens, alleged that the
Bank, as an escrow agent and lender for the project, knew or should have known,
that its loan commitment was insufficient and that the Bank was therefore
responsible for the losses suffered by the limited partners resulting from the
actions of the general partners.
Prior to this case going to the jury, the Bank made a motion for directed
verdict which was not granted. Rule 50(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil
Procedure states that when a motion for a directed verdict is not granted, the
Court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later
determination of the legal question raised in the motion. After the jury
verdict, the Bank renewed that motion in the form of a motion for judgment not
withstanding the verdict, as well as an alternative motion for a new trial. This
motion and the Plaintiff's petition for legal fees, costs and interest were
argued before the Circuit Judge on June 22, 1993, and as yet no decision has
been rendered. It is the opinion of the Bank's legal Counsel that it is not
probable that a loss in the amount of the present jury verdict will be incurred
by The First. Furthermore, if a loss ultimately is incurred following post trial
motions and appeals, it is not probable that the loss would exceed $750,000.
Accordingly, the Bank has not established any specific allowances for this
suit. However, the Bank's general reserves are adequate to support the range of
loss estimated by its legal Counsel. Unless the Trial Judge dismisses this
action in its entirety, management will vigorously appeal any judgment.
Therefore, it is management's opinion, based upon Counsel's
VII-35

20. LITIGATION -- Continued
analysis of the outcome of the suit, that any future liability arising from this
suit will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position of the Bank.
Except for the ultimate outcome of the suit previously discussed, the legal
proceedings against the Bank are generally incidental to its business.
Management believes that liabilities arising from these proceedings, if any,
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position
of the Bank.
21. SALE OF BANK
On August 5, 1993, the Bank announced that a definitive agreement had been
reached with Southern National Corporation (SNC), (a national Bank holding
company) headquartered in Lumberton, North Carolina. SNC will acquire The First
in a fixed exchange stock swap transaction (pooling of interest). The terms of
the agreement call for SNC to issue .855 shares of its common stock for each of
the outstanding shares and options of the Bank at closing date. This transaction
is valued at $181 million based on the exchange ratio, the closing price of SNC
stock, and the shares of stock of The First outstanding on August 5, 1993.
If certain conditions are met as specified in the agreement, the exchange
ratio may be increased if SNC stock price falls below $21.625. Furthermore,
under conditions as specified in the agreement, either party may terminate the
agreement prior to closing. This transaction is subject to regulatory authority
and shareholder approval.
22. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following table discloses the carrying values and fair values at June
30, 1993 for the financial instruments of the Bank determined under the

</TABLE>

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it was practicable to estimate
that value.
CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES
For short-term instruments, the carrying amount is the best estimate for
the fair value. For investment securities a quoted market bid price supplied by
a primary broker dealer was used for each of the actual instruments.
VII-36

THE FIRST SAVINGS BANK, FSB
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
22. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- Continued
MORTGAGE-BACKED CERTIFICATES, NET
The MBCs were grouped into three categories for estimating fair value. MBCs
securitized under FHLMC, FNMA, or GNMA were grouped by even coupons in 50 basis
point increments and were valued using actual market bid prices on those
securities. MBCs with odd coupons were valued by interpolating a price from a
standard coupon security with similar characteristics. Privately issued MBCs
were valued by using a similar FHLMC security price less two (2) percentage
points.
LOANS RECEIVABLE, NET
For certain homogeneous categories of loans, fair value was estimated using
the quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans. The fair value
of other types of loans was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using
the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar
credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.
DEPOSITS
The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money
market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. For
fixed-maturity deposits, the fair value was estimated by using the rates
currently offered by the Bank for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
ADVANCES FROM FHLB
The fair value was determined under the FHLB methodology for calculating
the prepayment penalty on the advances using a discounted present value.
SUBORDINATED CAPITAL NOTES
The fair value was determined by a discounted present value calculation
using the 4 year treasury rate plus 350 basis points. At the time the notes were
issued, they were sold at the 10 year treasury rate plus 250 basis points. The 4
year treasury rate was chosen to match the remaining maturity of the notes and
the increased spread was used because retail sales are presently not allowed, so
a premium was added to the original spread.
OTHER BORROWED MONEY
The fair value of other borrowed money was estimated at its carrying value
due to the short term to maturity.
COMMITMENTS
The fair value of the commitments to originate loans was determined to be
par for the loan originations. The commitment to purchase the MBC was valued at
the current market price for that particular security.
Commitments to sell mortgage loans were valued by using the actual price
for closed loans and pipe-line loans plus an added value for the associated
servicing rights retained.
The fair value of commitments for unused lines and letters of credit was
determined to be the carrying value since these are either variable rate or
premium priced fixed-rate commitments.

$ 129,132,641
Letters of credit (variable-rate)................................................... $ 1,315,745
</TABLE>

At June 30, 1993, except for single-family home loans and the fact that the
majority of the loan portfolio is located in the Bank's immediate market area,
there were no concentrations of loans in any type of industry, type of property,
or to one borrower that exceeded 10% of the Bank's total loan portfolio.
In certain instances, the amounts reported in the prior periods'
consolidated financial statements included herein have been reclassified to put
them on a comparable basis to the amounts reported in the June 30, 1993,
consolidated financial statements.
