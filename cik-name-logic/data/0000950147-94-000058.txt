The following information relates primarily to Pinnacle West Capital
Corporation (the "Company") and its principal subsidiary, Arizona Public
Service Company ("APS").

ITEM 5. Other Events

As previously reported, on March 21, 1994 the Secretary of Labor issued
a final order approving a settlement agreement between APS and a former
contract employee who had raised a U.S. Department of Labor claim. See
"Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station" in Part II, Item 5 in the Company's
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1994. On May
19, 1994 the Secretary of Labor rescinded the order of March 21, 1994 and
remanded the matter to the responsible Administrative Law Judges ordering
them to submit new recommended orders (i) clarifying specifically the scope
of the settlement agreement and (ii) clarifying the extent to which any
claims by the former contract employee remain unresolved by the settlement
agreement. APS currently expects that the settlement agreement, as
originally approved, will ultimately be approved by the Secretary of Labor.
