amended and restated as of February 1, 1992 (the "Basic Agreement"), as
supplemented by Trust Supplement No. A1 thereto, dated as of May 26, 1994 (the
"Trust Supplement," and together with the Basic Agreement, the "Agreement"),
between the Trustee and American Airlines, Inc., a corporation incorporated
under Delaware law (the "Company"), a summary of certain of the pertinent
provisions of which is set forth below. To the extent not otherwise defined
herein, the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in
the Agreement. This Certificate is one of the duly authorized Certificates
designated as "Pass Through Certificates, Series 1994-A1" (herein called the

aircraft leased to the Company.

The Certificates represent Fractional Undivided Interests in
the Trust and the Trust Property, and have no rights, benefits or interest in
respect of any other separate trust established pursuant to the terms of the
Basic Agreement for any other series of certificates issued pursuant thereto.

Subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Agreement,
from funds then available to the Trustee, there will be distributed on each May

of business on the 15th day preceding the Regular Distribution Date, an amount
in respect of the Scheduled Payments on the Equipment Notes due on such Regular
Distribution Date, the receipt of which has been confirmed by the Trustee,

Certificate and an amount equal to the sum of such Scheduled Payments. Subject
to and in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, in the event that Special
Payments on the Equipment Notes are received by the Trustee, from funds then
available to the Trustee, there shall be distributed on the applicable Special
Distribution Date, to the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered

<PAGE> 12

Special Payments on the Equipment Notes, the receipt of which has been
confirmed by the Trustee, equal to the product of the percentage interest in
the Trust evidenced by this Certificate and an amount equal to the sum of such
Special Payments so received. If a Regular Distribution Date is not a Business
Day, distribution shall be made on the immediately following Business Day with
the same force and effect as if made on such Regular Distribution Date and no
interest shall accrue during the intervening period. The Special Distribution
Date shall be the Business Day as provided in the Trust Supplement. The
Trustee shall mail notice of each Special Payment and the Special Distribution
Date therefor to the Certificateholder of this Certificate.

Distributions on this Certificate will be made by the Trustee
by check mailed to the Person entitled thereto, without the presentation or
surrender of this Certificate or the making of any notation hereon. Except as
otherwise provided in the Agreement and notwithstanding the above, the final
distribution on this Certificate will be made after notice mailed by the
Trustee of the pendency of such distribution and only upon presentation and
surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency of the Trustee specified
in such notice.

Reverse of Certificate

The Certificates do not represent a direct obligation of, or
an obligation guaranteed by, or an interest in, the Company or the Trustee or
any affiliate thereof. The Certificates are limited in right of payment, all
as more specifically set forth on the face hereof and in the Agreement. All
payments or distributions made to Certificateholders under the Agreement shall
be made only from the Trust Property and only to the extent that the Trustee
shall have sufficient income or proceeds from the Trust Property to make such
payments in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Each Certificateholder
of this Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, agrees that it will look solely
to the income and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent available for
distribution to such Certificateholder as provided in the Agreement. This
Certificate does not purport to summarize the Agreement and reference is made
to the Agreement for information with respect to the interests, rights,
benefits, obligations, proceeds, and duties evidenced hereby. A copy of the
Agreement may be examined during normal business hours at the principal office
of the Trustee, and at such other places, if any, designated by the Trustee, by
any Certificateholder upon request.

The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and
obligations of the Company and the rights of the Certificateholders under the
Agreement at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the
Certificateholders holding Certificates evidencing Fractional Undivided
Interests aggregating not less than a majority in interest in the Trust. Any
such consent by the Certificateholder of this Certificate shall be conclusive
and binding on such Certificateholder and upon all future Certificateholders of
this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the transfer hereof or in
exchange hereof or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent is
made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also permits the amendment thereof,
in certain limited circumstances, without the consent of the Certificateholders
of any of the Certificates.

As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable
in the Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of transfer
at the offices or agencies maintained by the Trustee in its capacity as

6
<PAGE> 16

Registrar, or by any successor Registrar, in the Borough of Manhattan, the City
of New York, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form satisfactory to the Trustee and the Registrar duly executed by the
Certificateholder hereof or such Certificateholder's attorney duly authorized
in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of authorized
denominations evidencing the same aggregate Fractional Undivided Interest in
the Trust will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

The Certificates are issuable only as registered Certificates
without coupons in minimum denominations of $1,000 Fractional Undivided
Interest and integral multiples thereof. As provided in the Agreement and
subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Certificates are
exchangeable for new Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the
same aggregate Fractional Undivided Interest in the Trust, as requested by the
Certificateholder surrendering the same.

No service charge will be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange, but the Trustee shall require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

The Trustee, the Registrar, and any agent of the Trustee or
the Registrar may treat the person in whose name this Certificate is registered
as the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the Trustee, the Registrar,
nor any such agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

The obligations and responsibilities created by the Agreement
and the Trust created thereby shall terminate upon the distribution to
Certificateholders of all amounts required to be distributed to them pursuant
to the Agreement and the disposition of all property held as part of the Trust
Property.

provided such action shall not interfere with the exercise 
by the Loan Trustee of its remedies under Article 8 hereof 
or Section 15 of the Lease, or from maintaining separate 
insurance with respect to the Aircraft to the extent 
permitted by Section 11 of the Lease.

HABENDUM CLAUSE

TO HAVE AND TO HOLD all and singular the aforesaid 
property unto the Loan Trustee, its successors and assigns, in 
trust for the benefit and security of the Loan Participants 
from time to time, without any priority of any one Equipment 
Note over any other, and for the uses and purposes and subject 
to the terms and provisions set forth in this Agreement.

The Owner Trustee agrees that this Agreement is 
intended to and shall create and grant to the Loan Trustee a 
security interest in the Aircraft, which security interest 
shall attach on the Delivery Date. The security interest 
created by this Agreement and granted to the Loan Trustee 
hereunder in the Indenture Estate other than in the Aircraft 
shall attach upon the delivery hereof.

It is expressly agreed that, anything herein contained 
to the contrary notwithstanding, the Owner Trustee shall remain 
liable under each of the Operative Documents to which it is a 
party to perform all of the obligations assumed by it 
thereunder, all in accordance with and pursuant to the terms 
and provisions thereof, and the Loan Trustee and the Loan 
Participants shall have no obligation or liability under any of 
the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party 
by reason of or arising out of the assignment hereunder, nor 
shall the Loan Trustee (except as to the Loan Trustee, if the 
Loan Trustee shall have become the "Lessor" under the Lease) or 
the Loan Participants be required or
<PAGE> 13

7

obligated in any manner to perform or fulfill any obligations 
of the Owner Trustee under or pursuant to any of the Operative 
Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party or, except as 
herein expressly provided, to make any payment, or to make any 
inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received 
by it, or present or file any claim, or take any action to 
collect or enforce the payment of any amounts which may have 
been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time 
or times.

Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Owner 
Trustee does hereby constitute the Loan Trustee the true and 
lawful attorney of the Owner Trustee, irrevocably, with full 
power (in the name of the Owner Trustee or otherwise) to ask, 
require, demand, receive, compound and give acquittance for any 
and all moneys and claims for moneys due and to become due to 
the Owner Trustee (other than Excepted Property) under or 
arising out of the Lease (subject to the provisions of Section 
11.06(b)(1)), the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement 
Assignment, to endorse any checks or other instruments or 
orders in connection therewith and to file any claims or take 
any action or institute any proceedings which the Loan Trustee 
may deem to be necessary or advisable in the premises. The 
Owner Trustee has directed the Company to make all payments of 
Rent (other than Excepted Property) payable to the Owner 
Trustee by the Company and all other amounts which are required 
to be paid to or deposited with the Owner Trustee pursuant to 
the Lease directly to the Loan Trustee at such address as the 
Loan Trustee shall specify, for application as provided in this 
Agreement. The Owner Trustee agrees that promptly on receipt 
thereof, it will transfer to the Loan Trustee any and all 
moneys from time to time received by it constituting part of 
the Indenture Estate, for distribution by the Loan Trustee 
pursuant to this Agreement, except that the Owner Trustee shall 
accept for distribution pursuant to the Trust Agreement any 
amounts distributed to it by the Loan Trustee as expressly 
provided in this Agreement and any Excepted Property.

The Owner Trustee agrees that at any time and from 
time to time, upon the written request of the Loan Trustee, the 
Owner Trustee will promptly and duly execute and deliver or 
cause to be duly executed and delivered to the Loan Trustee any 
and all such further instruments and documents as the Loan 
Trustee may reasonably deem desirable in obtaining the full 
benefits of the mortgage and security interest granted hereby 
and of the rights and powers herein granted;
<PAGE> 14

8

provided, however, that the Owner Trustee shall have no 
obligation to execute and deliver or cause to be executed or 
delivered to the Loan Trustee any such instrument or document 
if such execution and delivery would result in the imposition 
of additional burdensome liabilities on the Owner Trustee or 
the Owner Participant or would result in a material burden on 
the Owner Participant's business activities, unless the Owner 
Trustee or the Owner Participant, as the case may be, is 
indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction against any losses, 
liabilities and expenses incurred in connection with such 
execution and delivery pursuant to any Operative Document.

The Owner Trustee does hereby warrant and represent 
that it has not mortgaged, assigned or pledged, and hereby 
covenants that it will not mortgage, assign or pledge, so long 
as the lien of this Agreement shall or is intended to remain in 
effect, any of its right, title or interest subject to the 
mortgage and security interest hereby created, to anyone other 
than the Loan Trustee, and that it will not (other than in 
respect of Excepted Property), except as provided in or 
permitted by this Agreement, accept any payment from the 
Company, enter into an agreement amending or supplementing any 
of the Operative Documents to which it is a party, execute any 
waiver or modification of, or consent under the terms of any of 
the Operative Documents to which it is a party, settle or 
compromise any claim against the Company arising under any of 
the Operative Documents, or submit or consent to the submission 
of any dispute, difference or other matter arising under or in 
respect of any of the Operative Documents to which it is a 
party to arbitration thereunder.

IT IS HEREBY COVENANTED AND AGREED by and among the 
parties hereto as follows:

(b) If any officer of the Owner Trustee executing the 
Equipment Notes no longer holds that office at the time the 
Equipment Note is executed on behalf of the Owner Trustee, the 
Equipment Note shall be valid nevertheless.

(c) At any time and from time to time after the 
execution of the Equipment Notes, the Owner Trustee may deliver 
such Equipment Notes to the Loan Trustee for authentication 
and, subject to the provisions of Section 2.10, the Loan 
Trustee shall authenticate the Equipment Notes by manual 
signature upon written orders of the Owner Trustee. Equipment 
Notes shall be authenticated on behalf of the Loan Trustee by 
any authorized officer or signatory of the Loan Trustee.

(d) An Equipment Note shall not be valid or 
obligatory for any purpose or entitled to any security or

signature of the authorized officer or signatory of the Loan 
Trustee as specified in Section 2.02(c). Such signatures shall 
be conclusive evidence that such Equipment Note has been duly 
executed, authenticated and issued under this Agreement.

Section 2.03. Registrar and Paying Agent. The Loan 
Trustee shall maintain an office or agency where the Equipment 
Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for 
exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency where 
(subject to Sections 2.04 and 2.08) the Equipment Notes may be 
presented for payment or for exchange (the "Paying Agent"). 
The Registrar shall keep a register (the "Register") with 
respect to the Equipment Notes and their transfer and exchange 
and the payment of Installment Payment Amounts thereon, if any. 
The Loan Trustee may appoint one or more co-registrars (the 
"Co-Registrars") and one or more additional Paying Agents for 
the Equipment Notes and the Loan Trustee may terminate the 
appointment of any Co-Registrar or Paying Agent at any time 
upon written notice. The term "Registrar" includes any 
Co-Registrar. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional 
Paying Agent.

The Loan Trustee shall initially act as Registrar and 
Paying Agent.

of a Loan Participant, Equipment Notes may be exchanged for an 
equal aggregate principal amount of other Equipment Notes of 
the same type, having the same Maturity Date and of any 
authorized denominations or transferred upon surrender of the 
Equipment Notes to be exchanged or transferred at the principal 
corporate trust office of the Loan Trustee, or at any office or 
agency maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 2.03. 
Whenever any Equipment Note or Equipment Notes are so 
surrendered, the Owner Trustee shall execute, and the Loan 
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the replacement 
Equipment Note or Equipment Notes which the Loan Participant or 
the transferee, as the case may be, is entitled to receive.

All Equipment Notes issued upon any registration of 
transfer or exchange of Equipment Notes shall be the valid 
obligations of the Owner Trustee, evidencing the same 
obligations, and entitled to the same security and benefits 
under this Agreement, as the Equipment Notes surrendered upon 
such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Equipment Note presented or surrendered for 
registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by
<PAGE> 31

the Registrar) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a 
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the 
Registrar duly executed by, the Loan Participant thereof or 
such Loan Participant's attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made to a Loan Participant 
for any registration of transfer or exchange of Equipment 
Notes, but the Registrar may require payment of a sum 
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that 
may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer 
or exchange of Equipment Notes.

The Registrar shall not be required (i) to register 
the transfer of or to exchange any Equipment Note during a 
period beginning at the opening of business 15 Business Days 
before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption (or 
purchase in lieu of redemption) of Equipment Notes pursuant to 
Section 6.01 or 6.02 and ending at the close of business on the 
day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or to 
exchange any Equipment Note called for redemption (or purchase 
in lieu of redemption) pursuant to such Section 6.01 or 6.02.

Section 2.05. Loan Participant Lists; Ownership of 
Equipment Notes. (a) The Loan Trustee shall preserve in as 
current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent 
list available to it of the names and addresses of Loan 
Participants. If the Loan Trustee is not the Registrar, the 
Registrar shall furnish (and the Owner Trustee shall cause the 
Registrar to furnish) to the Loan Trustee semiannually on or 
before each Interest Payment Date, and at such other times as 
the Loan Trustee may request in writing, a list, in such form 
and as of such date as the Loan Trustee may reasonably require, 
containing all the information in the possession or control of 
the Registrar as to the names and addresses of Loan 
Participants.

(b) Ownership of the Equipment Notes shall be proved 
by the Register kept by the Registrar. Prior to due presentment for 
registration of transfer of any Equipment Note, the Owner Trustee, 
the Loan Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall deem and 
treat the Person in whose name any Equipment Note is registered as 
the absolute owner of such Equipment Note for the purpose of 
receiving payment of principal (including, subject to the provisions 
herein regarding the applicable record dates, Installment Payment 
Amounts) of, premium, if any, and (subject to the provisions
herein regarding the applicable record dates)

interest on such Equipment Note and for all other purposes 
whatsoever, whether or not such Equipment Note is overdue, and 
none of the Owner Trustee, the Loan Trustee, the Paying Agent 
or the Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Section 2.06. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen 
Equipment Notes. If any Equipment Note shall become mutilated, 
destroyed, lost or stolen, the Owner Trustee shall, upon the 
written request of the related Loan Participant, issue and 
execute, and the Loan Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, 
in replacement thereof, a new Equipment Note of the same type, 
having the same Maturity Date, payable to the same Loan 
Participant in the same principal amount and dated the same 
date as the Equipment Note so mutilated, destroyed, lost or 
stolen. If the Equipment Note being replaced has become 
mutilated, such Equipment Note shall be surrendered to the Loan 
Trustee. If the Equipment Note being replaced has been 
destroyed, lost or stolen, the related Loan Participant shall 
furnish to the Owner Trustee and the Loan Trustee such security 
or indemnity as may be required by each of them to save the 
Owner Trustee and the Loan Trustee harmless and evidence 
satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Loan Trustee of the 
destruction, loss or theft of such Equipment Note and of the 
ownership thereof.

Section 2.07. Cancellation. The Registrar and any 
Paying Agent shall forward to the Loan Trustee all Equipment 
Notes surrendered to them for replacement, redemption, 
registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Loan 
Trustee shall cancel all Equipment Notes surrendered for 
replacement, redemption, registration or transfer, exchange, 
payment or cancellation and shall destroy cancelled Equipment 
Notes.

Section 2.08. Payment on Equipment Notes; Defaulted 
Interest. (a) The Loan Trustee will arrange directly with any 
Paying Agent for the payment, or the Loan Trustee will make 
payment, all pursuant to Section 2.09, of the principal of, 
premium, if any, and interest on or in respect of the Equipment 
Notes. Payments on the Equipment Notes in respect of interest 
and Installment Payment Amounts, if any, payable on an 
Installment Payment Date, shall be paid in immediately 
available funds in U.S. currency on each Interest Payment Date 
or Installment Payment Date, as the case may be, to the Loan 
Participant in whose name such Equipment Note is registered on 
the Register at the close of business on the
<PAGE> 33

27

relevant Record Date; provided, however, that the Paying Agent 
will, at the request of the Loan Trustee, and may, at its 
option, pay such interest or Installment Payment Amounts by 
check mailed to such Loan Participant's address as it appears 
on the Register. Principal of Equipment Notes payable on the 
Maturity Date of such Equipment Note and premium, if any, with 
respect thereto shall be payable only against presentation and 
surrender thereof at the principal corporate trust office of 
the Loan Trustee or at the office of the Paying Agent 
maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 2.03.

A Loan Participant shall have no further interest in, 
or other right with respect to, the Indenture Estate when and 
if the principal amount of, premium, if any, and interest on 
all Equipment Notes held by such Loan Participant and all other 
sums payable to such Loan Participant hereunder, under such 
Equipment Notes and under the Participation Agreement shall 
have been paid in full.

(b) Any Installment Payment Amount payable on an 
Installment Payment Date, or any interest payable on an 
Interest Payment Date on any Equipment Note which is not 
punctually paid on, or within 5 days after, such Installment 
Payment Date or such Interest Payment Date, as the case may be 
(herein called, respectively, a "Defaulted Installment" and 
"Defaulted Interest"), shall forthwith cease to be payable to 
the Loan Participant on the relevant Record Date by virtue of 
its having been such Loan Participant; and such Defaulted 
Installment or Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Loan 
Trustee, at its election in each case, as provided in clause 
(1) or (2) below:

(1) The Loan Trustee may elect to make payment of any 
Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest to the Person 
in whose name such Equipment Note is registered at the 
close of business on a special record date for the payment 
of such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest, which 
shall be fixed in the following manner. The Loan Trustee 
shall notify the Paying Agent in writing of the amount of 
the Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest proposed to 
be paid on each such Equipment Note and the date of the 
proposed payment, and at the same time the Loan Trustee 
shall make arrangements to set aside an amount of money 
equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in 
respect of such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted 
Interest, prior to the date of the proposed payment, to be 
held in trust for the benefit
<PAGE> 34

28

of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Installment or 
Defaulted Interest as this clause provides and shall fix a 
special record date for the payment of such Defaulted 
Installment or Defaulted Interest which shall be not more 
than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of 
the proposed payment. The Loan Trustee shall promptly 
notify the Owner Trustee and the Registrar of such special 
record date and shall cause notice of the proposed payment 
of such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest and the 
special record date therefor to be mailed, first class 
postage prepaid, to each Loan Participant entitled thereto 
at such Loan Participant's address as it appears in the 
Register, not less than 10 days prior to such special 
record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such 
Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest and the special 
record date therefor having been mailed, as aforesaid, such 
Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest shall be paid 
to the Persons in whose names the applicable Equipment Note 
are registered on such special record date and shall no 
longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).

(2) The Loan Trustee may make, or cause to be made, 
payment of any Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest 
in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the 
requirements of any securities exchange on which Equipment 
Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be 
required by such exchange, if such payment shall be deemed 
practicable by the Loan Trustee.

(c) The Loan Trustee shall require each Paying Agent 
to agree in writing that such Paying Agent will hold in trust, 
for the benefit of the Loan Participants and the Loan Trustee, 
all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal 
of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Equipment Notes 
payable to the Loan Participants hereunder, and shall give to 
the Loan Trustee notice of any default by any obligor upon the 
Equipment Notes in the making of any such payment upon the 
Equipment Notes. The Loan Trustee at any time may require a 
Paying Agent to repay to the Loan Trustee all money held by it. 
Upon so doing the Paying Agent shall have no further liability 
for the money so paid.

Section 2.09. Payment from Indenture Estate Only; 
Non-Recourse Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision 
herein or in the Equipment Notes to the contrary, all amounts 
payable by the Loan Trustee and the Owner Trustee under the 
Equipment Notes and this Agreement shall be made

only from the income and proceeds of the Indenture Estate and 
each Loan Participant, by its acceptance of such Equipment 
Note, agrees that (a) it will look solely to the income and

liable to any Loan Participant for any amount payable under 
such Equipment Note or this Agreement or, except as expressly

the Loan Trustee, for any liability thereunder or hereunder.

Meridian Trust Company is entering into this Agreement 
solely as Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement and not in 
its individual capacity, and in no case whatsoever shall 
Meridian Trust Company (or any entity acting as successor 
trustee under the Trust Agreement) be personally liable for, or 
for any loss in respect of, any statements, representations, 
warranties, agreements or obligations hereunder or thereunder; 
provided that Meridian Trust Company shall be liable hereunder 
in its individual capacity, (i) for the performance of its 
agreements undertaken in its individual capacity under Section 
8 of the Participation Agreement, (ii) for the performance of 
its agreements undertaken in its individual capacity under 
Section 9 of the Refunding Agreement and (iii) for its own 
willful misconduct or gross negligence. If a successor Owner 
Trustee is appointed in accordance with the terms of the Trust 
Agreement and the Participation Agreement, such successor Owner 
Trustee shall, without any further act, succeed to all of the 
rights, duties, immunities and obligations hereunder, and its 
predecessor Owner Trustee and Meridian Trust Company shall be 
released from all further duties and obligations hereunder, 
without prejudice to any claims against Meridian Trust Company 
or such predecessor Owner Trustee for any default by Meridian 
Trust Company or such predecessor Owner Trustee, respectively, 
in the performance of its obligations hereunder prior to such 
appointment.

Section 6.01. Redemption of Equipment Notes upon 
Event of Loss, Termination of the Lease or Optional Redemption. 
(a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss to the Aircraft 
if the Aircraft is not replaced pursuant to Section 10(a)(i) of 
the Lease, each Outstanding Equipment Note shall be redeemed in 
whole at a Redemption Price equal to the aggregate unpaid 
outstanding principal amount thereof together with accrued and 
unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the applicable 
Redemption Date. The Redemption Date for Equipment Notes to be 
redeemed pursuant to this Section 6.01(a) shall be the Lease 
Loss Payment Date.

(b) (1) Upon termination of the Lease pursuant to 
Section 9(a) of the Lease or upon the purchase of the Aircraft 
by the Company at its option pursuant to Section 9(e) or 20(b) 
of the Lease (unless the Company shall have assumed the rights 
and obligations of the Owner Trustee hereunder to the extent 
and as provided for in Section 7.03 hereof), each Outstanding 
Equipment Note shall be redeemed in whole at a Redemption Price 
equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount thereof together 
with accrued but unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, 
the applicable Redemption Date plus, in the case of each 
Equipment Note redeemed prior to the Premium Termination Date 
applicable to such Equipment Note, a premium, equal to the 
Make-Whole Amount, if any, and otherwise without premium. The 
Redemption Date for Equipment Notes to be redeemed pursuant to 
this clause (1) shall be the Special Termination Date in case 
the Company purchases the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(e) of 
the Lease, or the Special Purchase Option Date in case the 
Company purchases the Aircraft pursuant to Section
<PAGE> 44

20(b) of the Lease, or otherwise shall be the first Business 
Day following the Lease Termination Date by three days.

(2) Upon the request of the Owner Trustee upon at 
least 30 days' prior notice to the Loan Trustee, provided that, 
so long as no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing, the Owner Trustee shall have received written 
consent to such redemption from the Company prior to the giving 
of such notice, each Outstanding Equipment Note shall be 
redeemed (or purchased in lieu of redemption) in whole at a 
Redemption Price equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount 
thereof together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon to, 
but not including, the applicable Redemption Date plus, in the 
case of each Equipment Note redeemed or purchased prior to the 
Premium Termination Date applicable to such Equipment Note 
(unless such redemption or purchase is pursuant to Section 
6.02), a premium, equal to the Make-Whole Amount, if any, and 
otherwise without premium. The Redemption Date for Equipment 
Notes to be redeemed or purchased pursuant to this clause (2) 
shall be the date designated in the notice of the Owner Trustee, 
which shall be a Business Day. If the Owner Trustee elects to 
purchase the Equipment Notes under Section 8.03(e)(ii), nothing 
herein, including the use of the terms "Redemption Date" and 
"Redemption Price", shall be deemed to result in a redemption 
of the Equipment Notes.

(3) Upon the request of the Owner Trustee upon at 
least 30 days' prior irrevocable notice to the Loan Trustee, 
provided that (A) the Owner Trustee shall have received written 
consent to such redemption from the Company prior to the giving 
of such notice and (B) all outstanding equipment notes then 
held in the same Pass Through Trust are simultaneously being 
redeemed, each Outstanding Equipment Note having the maturity 
designated by the Owner Trustee in such notice shall be 
redeemed at a Redemption Price equal to the aggregate unpaid 
principal amount thereof together with accrued but unpaid 
interest thereon to, but not including, the applicable 
Redemption Date plus, in the case of each Equipment Note 
redeemed prior to the Premium Termination Date applicable to 
such Equipment Note, a premium, equal to the Make-Whole Amount, 
if any, and otherwise without premium. The Redemption Date for 
Equipment Notes to be redeemed pursuant to this clause (3) 
shall be the date designated in the notice of the Owner 
Trustee, which shall be a Business Day.

Trustee or the Owner Participant gives the notice specified in 
Section 8.03(e)(ii), then each Outstanding Equipment Note shall 
be redeemed (or purchased in lieu of redemption) in whole at a 
Redemption Price equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount 
thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to 
but excluding the applicable Redemption Date, but without a 
premium. The Redemption Date for Equipment Notes to be 
redeemed (or purchased in lieu of redemption) pursuant to this 
Section 6.02 shall be the date specified in the notice given by 
the Owner Trustee to the Loan Trustee pursuant to Section 
8.03(e)(ii). If the Owner Trustee elects to purchase the 
Equipment Notes under Section 8.03(e)(ii), nothing herein, 
including the use of the terms "Redemption Date" and 
"Redemption Price", shall be deemed to result in a redemption 
of the Equipment Notes.

Section 6.03. Notice of Redemption to Loan 
Participants. Notice of redemption or purchase with respect to 
the Equipment Notes shall be given by first-class mail, postage 
prepaid, mailed not less than 25 nor more than 60 days prior to 
the Redemption Date, to each Loan Participant of such Equipment 
Notes to be redeemed or purchased, at such Loan Participant's 
address appearing in the Register; provided that, in the case 
of a redemption to be made pursuant to Section 6.01(b), such 
notice shall be revocable and shall be deemed revoked in the 
event that the Lease does not in fact terminate on the Lease 
Termination Date or if notice of such redemption shall have 
been given in connection with a refinancing of Equipment Notes 
and the Loan Trustee receives written notice of such revocation 
from the Company or the Owner Trustee not later than three days 
prior to the Redemption Date.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date,

(2) the applicable basis for determining the 
Redemption Price,

interest on such Equipment Notes shall cease to accrue on 
and after such Redemption Date, and

(4) the place or places where such Equipment Notes 
are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price.

Notice of redemption or purchase of Equipment Notes to be 
redeemed or purchased shall be given by the Loan Trustee.

Section 6.04. Deposit of Redemption Price. On or 
before the Redemption Date, the Owner Trustee (or any person on 
behalf of the Owner Trustee) shall, to the extent an amount 
equal to the Redemption Price for the Equipment Notes to be 
redeemed or purchased on the Redemption Date shall not then be 
held in the Indenture Estate, deposit or cause to be deposited 
with the Loan Trustee or the Paying Agent by 12:00 Noon on the 
Redemption Date in immediately available funds the Redemption 
Price of the Equipment Notes to be redeemed or purchased.

Section 6.05. Equipment Notes Payable on Redemption 
Date. Notice of redemption or purchase having been given as 
aforesaid (and not deemed revoked as contemplated in the 
proviso to Section 6.03), the Equipment Notes to be redeemed or 
purchased shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable 
at the principal corporate trust office of the Loan Trustee or 
at any office or agency maintained for such purposes pursuant 
to Section 2.03, and from and after such Redemption Date 
(unless there shall be a default in the payment of the 
Redemption Price) any such Equipment Notes then Outstanding 
shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such 
Equipment Note for redemption or purchase in accordance with 
said notice such Equipment Note shall be paid at the Redemption 
Price.

If any Equipment Note called for redemption or 
purchase shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for 
redemption, the principal amount thereof shall, until paid, 
continue to bear interest from the applicable Redemption Date 
at the interest rate in effect for such Equipment Note as of 
such Redemption Date.

Section 7.02. Change in Registration. The Loan 
Trustee shall upon the request of the Company consent to the 
deregistration of the Aircraft under the laws of the

provided that the following conditions are met:

(a) such change in registration complies with the 
provisions of the Lease;

(b) no Lease Event of Default and no event which, 
with lapse of time or notice, or both, would become a Lease 
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at

Loan Trustee in its discretion believes the change in 
registration would be advantageous to the Loan 
Participants;

(c) the Loan Trustee shall have received an opinion 
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to it to the effect

42

continue as a fully-perfected lien and all filing, 
recording or other action necessary to perfect and 
protect the lien of this Indenture has been 
accomplished (or if such opinion cannot be given at 
the time by which the Loan Trustee has been requested 
to consent to a change in registration, (x) the 
opinion shall detail what filing, recording or other 
action is necessary and (y) the Loan Trustee shall 
have received a certificate from the Company that all 
possible preparations to accomplish such filing, 
recording and other action shall have been done, and

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or 
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors 
generally and by general principles of equity, and 
except as limited by applicable laws which may affect 
the remedies provided in the Lease and this Agreement, 
respectively, which laws, however, do not in the 
opinion of such counsel make the remedies provided in 
the Lease and this Agreement, respectively, inadequate 
for the practical realization of the rights and 
benefits provided thereby;

(d) the Loan Trustee shall have received assurances 
reasonably satisfactory to it that the insurance provisions 
of the Lease will have been complied with after giving 
effect to such change in registration; and

(e) the Company shall have paid or made provision 
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee for the payment of all 
expenses connected with such change in registration.

the Owner Trustee shall reasonably request in order to satisfy 
the above conditions and upon satisfaction of such conditions 
to effect the change in registration.

Relevant Date:

(a) the Company shall have delivered to the Loan 
Trustee a certificate, dated the Relevant Date, of a 
Responsible Company Officer stating that the Company has 
paid to the Owner Trustee all amounts required to be paid

subsequent to such purchase or assumption and the Loan 
Trustee shall have received a certificate, dated the 
Relevant Date, of a Responsible Company Officer to such 
effect;

(c) the Loan Trustee shall have received, on or prior 
to the Relevant Date, evidence of all filings, recordings 
and other action referred to in the Opinion or Opinions of 
Counsel referred to below; and

or Opinions of Counsel for the Company, dated the Relevant 
Date, which without unusual qualification shall be to the 
effect that, after giving effect to the Relevant Amendment 
(as defined below):

(i) this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid 
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable 
against the Company in accordance with its terms, 
except as the same may be limited by applicable 
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or 
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors 
generally and by general principles of equity, and 
except as limited by applicable laws which may affect 
the remedies provided for in this Agreement, which 
laws, however, do not in the opinion of such counsel 
make the remedies provided for in this Agreement 
inadequate for the practical realization of the rights 
and benefits provided for in this Agreement;
<PAGE> 50

44

(ii) the Aircraft is duly registered in 
compliance with applicable law under the laws of the 
jurisdiction in which the Aircraft was registered 
immediately prior to such purchase and assumption;

(iii) the Lien on the Aircraft constitutes a

Loan Trustee with respect to the Aircraft immediately 
prior to such assumption; and provided further that 
such opinion may contain qualifications of the tenor 
contained in the opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton

Date, which obligations and liabilities shall remain the 
sole responsibility of the Owner Trustee).

the principal of all Equipment Notes, together with accrued 
interest thereon from the date in respect of which interest was 
last paid hereunder to the date payment of such principal has 
been made or duly provided for, shall be immediately due and 
payable. At any time after such declaration and prior to the 
sale or disposition of the Indenture Estate, Loan Participants 
owning a majority in aggregate principal amount of all of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes, by notice to the Loan Trustee, the 
Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant, may rescind such a 
declaration and thereby annul its consequences if (i) an amount 
sufficient to pay all principal of, premium, if any, and 
interest on, such Equipment Notes, to the extent each such 
amount is due or past due, if any, in respect of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes other than by reason of such 
acceleration and all sums due and payable to the Loan Trustee 
has been deposited with the Loan Trustee, (ii) the rescission 
would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (iii) all 
existing Indenture Defaults and Indenture Events of Default 
under this Agreement have been cured or waived except 
nonpayment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 
Equipment Notes that has become due solely because of such 
acceleration.

Section 8.03. Other Remedies Available to Loan 
Trustee. (a) After an Indenture Event of Default shall have 
occurred and so long as such Indenture Event of Default shall 
be continuing, then and in every such case the Loan Trustee, as 
trustee of an express trust and as assignee hereunder of the 
Lease or as holder of a security interest in the Aircraft, 
Airframe or Engines or otherwise, may, and when required 
pursuant to the provisions of Article 9 shall, exercise subject 
to Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 8.03(h), any or all 
of the rights and powers and pursue any and all of the remedies 
accorded to the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 15 of the 
Lease and this Article 8, may recover judgment in its own name 
as Loan Trustee against the Indenture Estate and may take 
possession of all or any part of the Indenture Estate and may 
exclude the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant and all 
persons claiming under any of them wholly or partly.

(b) After an Indenture Event of Default shall have 
occurred and so long as such Indenture Event of Default shall 
be continuing, subject to Sections 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 
8.03(h), the Loan Trustee may, if at the time such action may 
be lawful and always subject to compliance with any mandatory 
legal requirements, either with or without taking possession, 
and either before or after taking possession, and without 
instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, and having first 
given notice of such sale by registered mail to the Owner 
Trustee, the Owner Participant and the Company once at least 30 
days prior to the date of such sale, and any other notice which 
may be required by law, sell and dispose of the Indenture 
Estate, or any part thereof, or interest therein, at public 
auction to the highest bidder, in one lot as an entirety or in 
separate lots, and either for cash or on credit and on such 
terms as the Loan Trustee may determine, and at any place 
(whether or not it be the location of the Indenture Estate or 
any part thereof) and time designated in the notice above 
referred to; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any 
provision herein to the contrary, the Loan Trustee may not 
provide the notice provided for above of its intention to sell 
any of the Indenture Estate, exercise remedies under the Lease 
or exercise other remedies against the Indenture Estate, in 
each case seeking to deprive the Owner Participant of its 
interest therein unless a declaration of acceleration has been 
made pursuant to Section 8.02. Any such sale or sales may be 
adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and 
place appointed for such sale or sales, or by announcement at 
the time and place appointed for any such adjourned sale or 
sales, without
<PAGE> 56

50

further notice, and the Loan Trustee and any Loan Participant 
may bid and become the purchaser at any such sale. The Loan 
Trustee may exercise such right without possession or 
production of the Equipment Notes or proof of ownership 
thereof, and as representative of the Loan Participants may 
exercise such right without notice to the Loan Participants or 
including the Loan Participants as parties to any suit or 
proceeding relating to foreclosure of any property in the 
Indenture Estate. The Owner Trustee hereby irrevocably 
constitutes the Loan Trustee the true and lawful 
attorney-in-fact of the Owner Trustee (in the name of the Owner 
Trustee or otherwise) for the purpose of effectuating any sale, 
assignment, transfer or delivery for enforcement of the lien 
created under this Agreement, whether pursuant to foreclosure 
or power of sale or otherwise, to execute and deliver all such 
bills of sale, assignments and other instruments as the Loan 
Trustee may consider necessary or appropriate, with full power 
of substitution, the Owner Trustee hereby ratifying and 
confirming all that such attorney or any substitute shall 
lawfully do by virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested by 
the Loan Trustee or any purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall 
ratify and confirm any such sale, assignment, transfer or 
delivery, by executing and delivering to the Loan Trustee or 
such purchaser all bills of sale, assignments, releases and 
other proper instruments to effect such ratification and 
confirmation as may be designated in any such request.

(c) Subject to Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 
8.03(h), if an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, the Owner Trustee shall, at the request of the Loan 
Trustee, promptly execute and deliver to the Loan Trustee such 
instruments of title or other documents as the Loan Trustee may 
deem necessary or advisable to enable the Loan Trustee or an 
agent or representative designated by the Loan Trustee, at such 
time or times and place or places as the Loan Trustee may 
specify, to obtain possession of all or any part of the 
Indenture Estate. If the Owner Trustee shall for any reason 
fail to execute and deliver such instruments and documents 
after such request by the Loan Trustee, the Loan Trustee shall 
be entitled to a judgment for specific performance of the 
covenants contained in the foregoing sentence, conferring upon 
the Loan Trustee the right to immediate possession and 
requiring the Owner Trustee or the Company or both to execute 
and deliver such instruments and documents to the Loan Trustee. 
The Loan Trustee shall also be entitled to pursue all or any 
part of the Indenture Estate wherever it may be found and may 
enter any of the premises of
<PAGE> 57

51

the Owner Trustee or any other Person wherever the Indenture 
Estate may be or be supposed to be and search for the Indenture 
Estate and take possession of any item of the Indenture Estate 
pursuant to this Section 8.03(c). The Loan Trustee may, from 
time to time, at the expense of the Indenture Estate, make all 
such expenditures for maintenance, insurance, repairs, 
replacements, alterations, additions and improvements to and of 
the Indenture Estate, as it may deem proper. In each such 
case, the Loan Trustee shall have the right to use, operate, 
store, lease, control or manage the Indenture Estate, and to 
exercise all rights and powers of the Owner Trustee relating to 
the Indenture Estate as the Loan Trustee shall deem 
appropriate, including the right to enter into any and all such 
agreements with respect to the use, operation, storage, 
leasing, control or management of the Indenture Estate or any 
part thereof; and the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to collect 
and receive directly all tolls, rents (including Rent), issues, 
profits, products, revenues and other income of the Indenture 
Estate and every part thereof, without prejudice, however, to 
the right of the Loan Trustee under any provision of this 
Agreement to collect and receive all cash held by, or required 
to be deposited with, the Loan Trustee hereunder. In 
accordance with the terms of this Section 8.03(c), such tolls, 
rents (including Rent), issues, profits, products, revenues and 
other income shall be applied to pay the expenses of using, 
operating, storing, leasing, controlling or managing the 
Indenture Estate, and of all maintenance, insurance, repairs, 
replacements, alterations, additions and improvements, and to 
make all payments which the Loan Trustee may be required or may 
elect to make, if any, for taxes, assessments, insurance or 
other proper charges upon the Indenture Estate or any part 
thereof (including the employment of engineers and accountants 
to examine, inspect and make reports upon the properties and 
books and records of the Owner Trustee and, to the extent 
permitted by the Lease, the Company), and all other payments 
which the Loan Trustee may be required or authorized to make 
under any provision of this Agreement, including this Section 
8.03(c), as well as just and reasonable compensation for the 
services of the Loan Trustee, and of all persons properly 
engaged and employed by the Loan Trustee.

If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is 
continuing and the Loan Trustee shall have obtained possession 
of or title to the Aircraft, the Loan Trustee shall not be 
obligated to use or operate the Aircraft or cause the Aircraft 
to be used or operated directly or
<PAGE> 58

52

indirectly by itself or through agents or other representatives 
or to lease, license or otherwise permit or provide for the use 
or operation of the Aircraft by any other Person unless (i) the 
Loan Trustee shall have been able to obtain insurance in kinds, 
at rates and in amounts satisfactory to it in its discretion to 
protect the Indenture Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee 
and individually, against any and all liability for loss or 
damage to the Aircraft and for public liability and property 
damage resulting from use or operation of the Aircraft and (ii) 
funds are available in the Indenture Estate to pay for all such 
insurance or, in lieu of such insurance, the Loan Trustee is 
furnished with indemnification from the Loan Participants or 
any other Person upon terms and in amounts satisfactory to the 
Loan Trustee in its discretion to protect the Indenture Estate 
and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and individually, against any 
and all such liabilities.

(d) Subject to Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 
8.03(h), the Loan Trustee may proceed to protect and enforce 
this Agreement and the Equipment Notes by suit or suits or 
proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy, and whether for 
the specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein 
contained or in execution or aid of any power herein granted, 
or for foreclosure hereunder, or for the appointment of a 
receiver or receivers for the Indenture Estate or any part 
thereof, or for the recovery of judgment for the indebtedness 
secured by the Lien created under this Agreement or for the 
enforcement of any other proper, legal or equitable remedy 
available under applicable law.

(e) (i) If the Company shall fail to make any 
payment of Basic Rent under the Lease when the same shall 
become due, and if such failure of the Company to make such 
payment of Basic Rent shall not constitute the fourth or 
subsequent consecutive such failure or the seventh or 
subsequent cumulative such failure, then as long as no 
Indenture Event of Default (other than arising from a Lease 
Event of Default not involving any failure to make any payments 
to which the Loan Trustee or any Loan Participant is entitled 
hereunder when due) shall have occurred and be continuing, the 
Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee may (but need not) pay 
to the Loan Trustee, at any time prior to the day which is the 
thirtieth day subsequent to notice of such failure by the Loan 
Trustee to the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant (and the 
Loan Trustee shall not (without the prior written consent of 
the Owner Trustee) declare the Lease in default pursuant to 
Section 15 thereof or exercise
<PAGE> 59

53

any of the rights, powers or remedies pursuant to such Section 
15 or this Article 8 prior to the occurrence of such date), an 
amount equal to the full amount of such payment of Basic Rent, 
together with any interest due thereon on account of the 
delayed payment thereof to the date of such payment, and such 
payment by the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee shall be 
deemed to cure as of the date of such payment any Indenture 
Event of Default which arose from such failure of the Company 
(including any Lease Event of Default arising from the 
Company's failure to pay interest in respect of such overdue 
Basic Rent for the period commencing on the date of such 
payment), but such cure shall not relieve the Company of any of 
its obligations. If the Company shall fail to perform or 
observe any covenant, condition or agreement to be performed or 
observed by it under the Lease, and if (but only if) the 
performance or observance thereof can be effected by the 
payment of money alone (it being understood that actions such 
as the obtaining of insurance and the procurement of 
maintenance services can be so effected), then as long as no 
other Indenture Event of Default (other than those arising from 
a Lease Event of Default) shall have occurred and be 
continuing, the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee may (but 
need not) pay to the Loan Trustee (or to such other person as 
may be entitled to receive the same), at any time prior to the 
day which is the thirtieth day subsequent to notice of such 
failure by the Loan Trustee to the Owner Trustee or the Owner 
Participant (and the Loan Trustee shall not (without the prior 
written consent of the Owner Trustee) declare the Lease in 
default pursuant to Section 15 thereof or exercise any of the 
rights, powers or remedies pursuant to such Section 15 or this 
Article 8 prior to the occurrence of such date), all sums 
necessary to effect the performance or observance of such 
covenant or agreement of the Company, together with any 
interest due thereon on account of the delayed payment thereof 
to the date of such payment, and such payment by the Owner 
Participant or the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to cure as of 
the date of such payment any Indenture Event of Default which 
arose from such failure of the Company (including any Lease 
Event of Default arising from the Company's failure to pay 
interest in respect of such overdue payment for the period 
commencing on the date of such payment), but such cure shall 
not relieve the Company of any of its obligations. Upon any 
payment of Basic Rent by the Owner Participant or the Owner 
Trustee in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 
8.03(e)(i), or upon any payment of any other sums by the Owner 
Participant or the Owner Trustee in accordance with the second 
sentence of this Section 8.03(e)(i), the Owner Participant or 
the Owner
<PAGE> 60

54

Trustee shall, to the extent of their respective payments, be 
subrogated, in the case of any such payment in accordance with 
such first sentence, to the rights of the Loan Trustee, as 
assignee hereunder of the Owner Trustee, or, in the case of any 
such payment in accordance with such second sentence, to the 
rights of the Loan Trustee or such other person, as the case 
may be, which actually received such payment, to receive such 
payment of Basic Rent or such other payment, as the case may be 
(and any interest due thereon on account of the delayed payment 
thereof), and shall be entitled to receive such payment upon 
its receipt by the Loan Trustee or such other person, as 
aforesaid (but in each case only if all amounts of principal 
of, and interest at the time due and payable on, the Equipment 
Notes together with interest due thereon on account of the 
delayed payment thereof shall have been paid in full); provided 
that neither the Owner Participant nor the Owner Trustee shall 
attempt to recover any such amount paid by it on behalf of the 
Company pursuant to this Section 8.03(e)(i) except by demanding 
of the Company payment of such amount or by commencing an 
action against the Company to require the payment of such 
amount.

(ii) At any time (a) one or more Lease Events of 
Default shall have occurred and shall have continued for a 
period of 180 days or more or (b) the Equipment Notes shall 
have been accelerated pursuant to Section 8.02, the Owner 
Trustee or the Owner Participant may, at its option, give at 
least 30 days' prior irrevocable notice to the Loan Trustee 
that it will redeem (or purchase in lieu of redemption) all 
Equipment Notes then Outstanding, which redemption or purchase 
shall be pursuant to Section 6.02 and concurrently with such 
notice, the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant will deposit 
with the Loan Trustee an amount sufficient to redeem or 
purchase at the applicable Redemption Price determined 
consistently with the applicable provisions of Article 6 all 
Equipment Notes then Outstanding and to pay the Loan Trustee 
all amounts then due it hereunder, which funds shall be held by 
the Loan Trustee as provided in Section 9.03. Upon the giving 
of such notice and the receipt by the Loan Trustee of such 
deposit, the Loan Trustee shall deem all instructions received 
from the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant as having been 
given by the Loan Participants of 100% of the Outstanding 
principal amount of Equipment Notes for all purposes of this 
Indenture. If such notice is given, the Owner Trustee further 
agrees that it will, if necessary, deposit or cause to be 
deposited with the Loan Trustee, on or prior to the Business 
Day preceding the applicable Redemption Date, whether or not an 
Indenture Event of Default is then
<PAGE> 61

55

continuing, additional funds sufficient, when added to the 
funds already held by the Loan Trustee for such purpose, to 
redeem or purchase at the applicable Redemption Price on such 
Redemption Date all Equipment Notes then Outstanding and to pay 
the Loan Trustee all amounts then due it hereunder.

(iii) It is further agreed and understood that the Loan 
Trustee shall not proceed to foreclose the Lien of this 
Agreement or otherwise exercise rights that would cause the 
Owner Trustee to lose its title in the Aircraft, unless it 
shall substantially simultaneously therewith, to the extent the 
Loan Trustee is then entitled to do so hereunder and under the 
Lease, and is not then stayed or otherwise prevented from doing 
so by operation of law, proceed (to the extent it has not 
already done so) to exercise one or more of the remedies 
referred to in Section 15 of the Lease to take possession of 
and/or sell the Aircraft (as it shall determine in its good 
faith discretion); provided that during any period with respect 
to which the Loan Trustee is stayed or otherwise prevented from 
exercising one or more of the remedies referred to in Section 
15 of the Lease, the Loan Trustee shall not foreclose the Lien 
of this Agreement or otherwise exercise rights that would cause 
the Owner Trustee to lose its title in the Aircraft until the 
earlier of (i) the expiration of the Section 1110 Period 
unless, at or prior to such time, the applicable bankruptcy 
court shall have authorized the trustee in bankruptcy of the 
Company to perform all obligations of the Company under the 
Lease that became due on or after the commencement of the 
applicable stay and such trustee shall have cured all existing 
defaults (other than with respect to Section 14(e), (f), (g) or 
(h) of the Lease, as the case may be) in which case the Loan 
Trustee shall have no right to exercise remedies hereunder in 
respect of Indenture Events of Default relating to Lease Events 
of Default theretofore occurring, and (ii) actual repossession 
of the Aircraft. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly 
understood and agreed that, subject to the immediately 
preceding sentence, the above-described inability of the Loan 
Trustee to exercise any right or remedy under the Lease shall 
in no event and under no circumstances prevent the Loan Trustee 
from exercising all of its rights, powers and remedies under 
this Agreement, including, without limitation, this Article 8. 
References in this subsection (iii) to particular sections of 
the Bankruptcy Code as in effect on the date of the amendment 
and restatement of this Indenture shall include any 
substantially similar successor provisions.

(f) The Owner Trustee and the Loan Trustee 
acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any provision of
<PAGE> 62

56

this Agreement to the contrary, including, without limitation, 
the Granting Clause, Section 4.01 and Article 8, as long as no 
Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, 
neither the Loan Trustee nor the Owner Trustee shall take any 
action contrary to, or disturb the Company's rights under, the 
Lease, including, without limitation, (x) the right to receive 
all monies due and payable to it in accordance with the 
provisions of the Lease and (y) the Company's rights to 
possession and use of, and to quiet enjoyment of, the Aircraft.

(g) Each and every right, power and remedy herein 
given to the Loan Trustee specifically or otherwise in this 
Agreement shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every 
other right, power and remedy herein specifically given or now 
or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute, and each 
and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein 
given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time 
and as often in such order as may be deemed expedient by the 
Loan Trustee, and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise 
of any power or remedy shall not be construed to be a waiver of 
the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other 
right, power or remedy. No delay or omission by the Loan 
Trustee in the exercise of any right, remedy or power or in 
pursuing any remedy shall impair any such right, power or 
remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default on the 
part of the Owner Trustee or the Company or to be an 
acquiescence therein.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, so 
long as the Pass Through Trustee is the registered holder of 
any Equipment Note hereunder, the Loan Trustee is not 
authorized or empowered to acquire title to all or any portion 
of the Indenture Estate (including the property subject to the 
Lien of this Indenture) or take any action with respect to all 
or any portion of the Indenture Estate (including the property 
subject to the Lien of this Indenture) so acquired by it if 
such acquisition or action would cause any Pass Through Trust 
to fail to qualify as a "grantor trust" for federal income tax 
purposes.

Section 8.04. Waiver of Owner Trustee. To the extent 
now or at any time hereafter enforceable under applicable law, 
the Owner Trustee covenants that it will not at any time insist 
upon or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take any 
benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law now or at 
any time hereafter in force, nor claim, take or insist upon any 
benefit or advantage of or
<PAGE> 63

57

from any law now or hereafter in force providing for the 
valuation or appraisement of the Indenture Estate or any part 
thereof, prior to any sale or sales thereof to be made pursuant 
to any provision herein contained, or to the decree, judgment 
or order of any court of competent jurisdiction; nor, after 
such sale or sales, claim or exercise any right under any 
statute now or hereafter made or enacted by any state or 
otherwise to redeem the property so sold or any part thereof, 
and hereby expressly waives for itself and on behalf of each 
and every Person, except decree or judgment creditors of the 
Owner Trustee acquiring any interest in or title to the 
Indenture Estate or any part thereof subsequent to the date of 
this Agreement, all benefit and advantage of any such law or 
laws, and covenants that it will not invoke or utilize any such 
law or laws or otherwise hinder, delay or impede the execution 
of any power herein granted and delegated to the Loan Trustee, 
but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as 
though no such law or laws had been made or enacted. Nothing 
in this Section 8.04 shall be deemed to be a waiver by the 
Owner Trustee of its rights under Section 8.03(e).

A delay or omission by the Loan Trustee or any Loan 
Participant in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an 
Indenture Event of Default under this Agreement shall not 
impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or 
acquiescence in such Indenture Event of Default.

Section 8.05. Waiver of Existing Defaults. The Loan 
Participants owning a majority in aggregate principal amount of 
the Outstanding Equipment Notes by notice to the Loan Trustee 
may waive on behalf of the Loan Participants an existing 
Indenture Default or Indenture Event of Default and its 
consequences except (i) an Indenture Default or Indenture Event 
of Default in the payment of the principal of, or interest on, 
any Equipment Note or (ii) in respect of a covenant or 
provision hereof that pursuant to Section 11.02 cannot be 
amended or modified without the consent of each Loan 
Participant affected thereby.

Section 8.06. Control by Majority. Loan Participants 
owning a majority in aggregate unpaid principal amount of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes may direct the time, method and 
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to 
the Loan Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on 
it by this Agreement. However, the Loan Trustee may refuse to 
follow any direction that conflicts with law, the Lease or this 
Agreement, that is
<PAGE> 64

58

unduly prejudicial to the rights of the Loan Participants so 
affected, or that would subject the Loan Trustee to personal 
liability.

Section 8.07. Limitation on Suits by Loan 
Participants. A Loan Participant may pursue a remedy under 
this Agreement or under an Equipment Note only if:

(1) the Loan Participant gives to the Loan Trustee 
written notice of a continuing Indenture Event of Default 
under this Agreement;

(2) Loan Participants owning at least 25% in 
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Equipment 
Notes make a written request to the Loan Trustee to pursue 
the remedy;

(3) such Loan Participant or Loan Participants offer 
to the Loan Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Loan 
Trustee against any loss, liability or expense to be, or 
which may be, incurred by the Loan Trustee in pursuing the 
remedy;

(4) the Loan Trustee does not comply with the request 
within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer 
of indemnity; and

(5) during such 60-day period, Loan Participants 
owning a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes do not give the Loan Trustee a 
direction inconsistent with the request.

A Loan Participant may not use this Agreement to 
prejudice the rights of another Loan Participant or to obtain a 
preference or priority over another Loan Participant.

Section 8.08. Rights of Loan Participants to Receive 
Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Agreement, the right of any Loan Participant to receive payment 
of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on an 
Equipment Note on or after the respective due dates expressed 
in such Equipment Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of 
any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not 
be impaired or affected without the consent of such Loan 
Participant.

Loan Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become 
the owner or pledgee of Equipment Notes and may otherwise deal 
with the Owner Trustee, the Company or an Affiliate of the

disposition of any such Permitted Investment, net of the Loan 
Trustee's reasonable fees and expenses in making such Permitted 
Investment, shall be held and applied by the Loan Trustee in 
the same manner as the principal amount of such Permitted 
Investment is to be applied and any loss realized upon

(b) Nothwithstanding anything to the contrary

accrued interest, or its equivalent, as are set forth in such 
request, and such Permitted Investments shall be held by the

so sold; provided that the Company, on behalf of the Owner 
Trustee, as agent of the Owner Trustee, shall upon demand pay

same manner as the amounts in respect of which such income, 
profit, interest, dividend or gain was realized are required to 
be distributed in accordance with the provisions hereof or of 
the Lease pursuant to which such amounts were required to be 
held.

(c) The Loan Trustee shall not be responsible for any 
losses on any investments or sales of Permitted Investments 
made pursuant to the procedure specified in this Section.

Participant and (ii) within 90 days after it occurs, mail to 
each Loan Participant notice of all uncured Indenture Events of 
Default under this Agreement. Except in the case of a default 
in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or 
interest on any Equipment Note, the Loan Trustee shall be 
protected in withholding the notice required under clause (ii) 
above if and so long as the executive committee or trust 
committee of
<PAGE> 69

63

directors of the Loan Trustee and/or Responsible Officers 
thereof in good faith determines that withholding such notice 
is in the interest of the Loan Participants. In addition, if 
an Indenture Default occurs and is continuing and if it is 
actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Loan Trustee, 
the Loan Trustee shall promptly send written notice thereof to 
the Company, the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant;

Refunding Agreement, (B) as otherwise provided in Section 9.09 
and (C) as otherwise excluded by the terms of Sections 7(b) and 
7(c) of the Participation Agreement from the Company's 
indemnities under said Sections; provided that, so long as the 
Lease is in effect, the Loan Trustee shall not make any claim 
under this Section 9.05 for any claim or expense indemnified 
against by the Company under the Participation Agreement 
without first making demand on the Company for payment of such 
claim or expense. The Loan Trustee shall notify the Owner 
Trustee and the Company promptly of any claim for which it may 
seek indemnity. The Owner Trustee shall have the right to 
defend the claim and the Loan Trustee shall cooperate in the 
defense. The Loan Trustee may have separate counsel and the 
Owner Trustee, subject to limitations set forth in the third 
preceding sentence, shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses 
of such counsel. The Owner Trustee need not pay for any 
settlement made without its and the Company's consent. If the 
Owner Trustee is required to make any payment under this
<PAGE> 70

Section 9.05(a), it shall be subrogated to the rights of the 
Loan Trustee with respect thereto.

(b) To secure the payment obligations of the Owner 
Trustee pursuant to this Section 9.05, the Loan Trustee shall 
have a lien prior to that of the Loan Participants on all money

interest on, the Equipment Notes.

Section 9.06. Replacement of Loan Trustee. (a) The

of a successor Loan Trustee shall become effective only upon 
the successor Loan Trustee's acceptance of appointment as 
provided in this Section.

(b) The Loan Trustee may resign by giving at least 30 
days' prior written notice to the Company and the Owner 
Trustee. Loan Participants holding a majority in aggregate 
principal amount of the Outstanding Equipment Notes may remove 
the Loan Trustee by giving at least 30 days' prior written 
notice to the Loan Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Company 
and may appoint a successor Loan Trustee for such Equipment 
Notes so long as no Indenture Event of Default shall have 
occurred and be continuing with the Owner Trustee's and the 
Company's consent. The Owner Trustee (acting pursuant to 
instructions from the Company) may remove the Loan Trustee if:

(1) the Loan Trustee fails to comply with 
Section 9.08 hereof (or, as long as State Street Bank and 
Trust Company of Connecticut, National Association shall be 
the Loan Trustee, the requirement set forth in Section 9.08 
hereof specifically applicable to such institution);

(2) the Loan Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an 
insolvent;

(3) a receiver or public officer takes charge of the 
Loan Trustee or its property; or

(4) the Loan Trustee becomes incapable of acting.

(c) If the Loan Trustee resigns or is removed, or if 
a vacancy exists in the office of Loan Trustee for any reason 
and a new Loan Trustee has not been appointed pursuant to 
Section 9.06(b), the Owner Trustee shall promptly appoint a 
successor Loan Trustee.
<PAGE> 71

65

(d) If a successor Loan Trustee does not take office 
within 30 days after the retiring Loan Trustee resigns or is 
removed, the retiring Loan Trustee, the Company, the Owner 
Trustee or Loan Participants holding a majority in aggregate 
principal amount of the Outstanding Equipment Notes may 
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the 
appointment of a successor Loan Trustee.

(e) If the Loan Trustee fails to comply with Section 
9.08, any Loan Participant may petition any court of competent 
jurisdiction for the removal of such Loan Trustee and the 
appointment of a successor Loan Trustee.

(f) A successor Loan Trustee shall deliver a written 
acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Loan Trustee, to 
the Company and to the Owner Trustee. Thereupon, the 
resignation or removal of the retiring Loan Trustee shall 
become effective, and the successor Loan Trustee shall have all 
the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Loan Trustee for 
which the successor Loan Trustee is to be acting as Loan 
Trustee under this Agreement. The retiring Loan Trustee shall 
promptly transfer all property and all books and records 
relating to the administration of the Indenture Estate held by 
it as Loan Trustee to the successor Loan Trustee subject to the 
lien provided for in Section 9.05. The Owner Trustee shall 
give notice of each appointment of a successor Loan Trustee if 
there are Equipment Notes outstanding, by mailing written 
notice of such event by first-class mail to the Loan 
Participants.

(g) All provisions of this Section 9.06 except 
subparagraphs (b)(l) and (e) and the words "subject to the lien 
provided for in Section 9.05" in subparagraph (f) shall apply 
also to any Paying Agent.

Section 9.07. Successor Loan Trustee, Agents by 
Merger, Etc. If the Loan Trustee or any Agent consolidates 
with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or 
substantially all of its corporate trust business assets to, 
another corporation, the successor corporation, without any 
further act, shall be the successor Loan Trustee or Agent, as 
the case may be.

Section 9.08. Eligibility; Disqualification. This 
Agreement shall at all times have a Loan Trustee which shall 
have a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 
(or having a combined capital and surplus in excess of
<PAGE> 72

66

$5,000,000 (or, as long as State Street Bank and Trust Company 
of Connecticut, National Association shall be the Loan Trustee, 
$3,000,000) and the obligations of which, whether now in 
existence or hereafter incurred, are fully and unconditionally 
guaranteed by a corporation organized and doing business under 
the laws of the United States, any State or Territory thereof 
or of the District of Columbia and having a combined capital 
and surplus of at least $100,000,000) and which shall be a 
"citizen of the United States" as defined in Section 101(16) of 
the Federal Aviation Act. If such corporation publishes 
reports of conditions at least annually, pursuant to law or to 
the requirements of Federal, State, Territorial or District of 
Columbia supervising or examining authority, then for the 
purposes of this Section 9.08, the combined capital and surplus 
of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital 
and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of 
conditions so published.

In case at any time the Loan Trustee shall cease to be 
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this 
Section 9.08, the Loan Trustee shall resign immediately in the 
manner and with the effect specified in Section 9.06.

Section 9.09. Trustee's Liens. The Loan Trustee in 
its individual capacity agrees that it will at its own cost and 
expense promptly take such action as may be necessary to duly 
discharge and satisfy in full all Liens ("Trustee's Liens") on 
the Indenture Estate which are either (i) attributable to the 
Loan Trustee in its individual capacity and which are unrelated 
to the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents, or 
(ii) attributable to the Loan Trustee as trustee hereunder or 
in its individual capacity and which arise out of acts or 
omissions by it which are contrary to the terms of this 
Agreement.

Section 9.10. Withholding Taxes; Information 
Reporting. The Loan Trustee shall exclude and withhold from 
each distribution of principal, premium, if any, and interest 
and other amounts due hereunder or under the Equipment Notes 
any and all withholding taxes applicable thereto as required by 
law. The Loan Trustee agrees (i) to act as such withholding 
agent and, in connection therewith, whenever any present or 
future taxes or similar charges are required to be withheld 
with respect to any amounts payable in respect of the Equipment 
Notes, to withhold such amounts and timely pay the same to the 
appropriate authority in the name of and on behalf of the Loan 
Participants, (ii) that it will file any
<PAGE> 73

67

necessary withholding tax returns or statements when due and 
(iii) that, as promptly as possible after the payment of such 
amounts, it will deliver to each Loan Participant appropriate 
documentation showing the payment of such amounts, together 
with such additional documentary evidence as such Loan 
Participants may reasonably request from time to time. The 
Loan Trustee agrees to file any other information reports as it 
may be required to file under United States law.

reinvestment thereof to discharge such indebtedness, 
including the principal of, premium, if any, and interest 
on the Equipment Notes to the date of such deposit (in the 
case of Equipment Notes which have become due and payable), 
or to the maturity thereof, as the case may be; or

clause (A), the right of the Owner Trustee or the Company 
to cause the redemption of Equipment Notes (except a 
redemption in respect of which irrevocable notice has 
theretofore been given) shall terminate;

(B) such deposit will not result in a breach or 
violation of, or constitute an Indenture Default or 
Indenture Event of Default under, this Agreement or a 
default or event of default under any other agreement or 
instrument to which the Owner Trustee or the Company is a 
party or by which it is bound; and

Revenue Service a ruling to the effect that Loan 
Participants will not recognize income, gain or loss for

the Owner Trustee of its option under this Section

the case may be, to be made from such installment of Basic 
Rent or Supplemental Rent payable in respect of the 
Make-Whole Amount, or reduce the aggregate amount of

deliver, one or more new series of Equipment Notes in an 
aggregate principal amount up to the aggregate principal amount 
of the Equipment Notes then being redeemed and having such 
terms and provisions (including, without limitation, interest 
rate, amortization schedule, maturity date and redemption 
provisions) as the Owner Trustee shall deem appropriate and as 
shall be approved by the Company; provided that if after such 
redemption any Equipment Notes remain outstanding, the new 
series of Equipment Notes:

(i) shall be denominated and payable in United States 
Dollars and shall not be in a principal amount greater than 
the Equipment Notes redeemed;

(ii) shall not rank senior in any respect to the 
Equipment Notes which remain outstanding; and

weighted average life longer than the Equipment Notes 
redeemed if any of the Equipment Notes which remain 
outstanding have a maturity date after or concurrent with

provided further that prior to authentication of such new 
series of Equipment Notes the Loan Trustee shall have received 
(i) written evidence from Standard & Poor's Corporation and 
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. to the effect that the issuance 
of such new series, by itself, would not result in a 
downgrading of the credit rating assigned to the Pass Through 
Certificates then outstanding and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel 
for the Company reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee to 
the effect that the protection afforded by Section 1110 of the 
Bankruptcy Code to the existing Loan Participants would not be 
adversely affected by the issuance of such new series of 
Equipment Notes; provided that such opinion need not be 
delivered to the extent that the benefits of such Section 1110 
are not available to the Loan Participants with respect to the 
Aircraft immediately prior to such assumption; and provided 
further that such opinion may contain qualifications of the 
tenor contained in the opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton 
delivered pursuant to Section 3(k) of the Refunding Agreement 
on the Refunding Date.

Agent by check mailed to the address of the Loan Participant 
entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Register.

than 60 days' notice by mail, under the circumstances set forth 
in the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to the unpaid 
principal amount thereof, premium, if any, plus accrued 
interest thereon to the Redemption Date.

If an Indenture Event of Default shall occur and be 
continuing, the unpaid principal amount of the Equipment Notes 
may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the 
effect provided in the Indenture. If, and only if, such an 
event of default constitutes an event of default by the Company 
under the Lease, the Loan Trustee may declare the Lease to be 
in default, and may, to the exclusion of the Owner Trustee, 
exercise one or more of the remedies of the Owner Trustee 
provided in the Lease.

Equipment Notes (except for certain matters, including 
obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Equipment 
Notes, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Equipment Notes, 
maintain paying agencies and hold moneys for payment in trust),

Indenture Estate from the lien of the Indenture, if (a) the 
Owner Trustee deposits or causes to be deposited irrevocably 
with the Loan Trustee, in trust, money or U.S. Government 
Obligations which through the payment of interest and principal 
in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide 
money in an amount sufficient to pay principal of, premium, if 
any, and interest on the

Outstanding Equipment Notes on the dates such payments are due 
in accordance with the terms of such Equipment Notes and (b) 
certain other conditions are satisfied, including the 
publication by the United States Internal Revenue Service of a 
ruling to the effect that the deposit and related defeasance 
would not cause the Loan Participants to recognize income, gain 
or loss for Federal income tax purposes.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain 
limitations therein and herein set forth, this Equipment Note 
is transferable, and upon surrender of this Equipment Note for 
registration of transfer at the principal corporate trust 
office of the Registrar, or at the office or agency maintained 
for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written 
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Registrar 
duly executed by, the Loan Participant or his attorney duly 
authorized in writing, one or more new Equipment Notes of the 
same maturity and type and of authorized denominations and for 
the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the 
designated transferee or transferees.

THIS EQUIPMENT NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE 
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. NO REGISTRATION OF A 
TRANSFER OF THIS EQUIPMENT NOTE WILL BE MADE UNLESS SUCH 
TRANSFER IS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION 
STATEMENT UNDER SUCH ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM 
REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT OR SUCH ACT DOES NOT APPLY.

The Equipment Notes are issuable only as registered 
Equipment Notes. The Equipment Notes are issuable in 
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof except 
that one Equipment Note of each maturity does not need to be an 
integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and 
subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Equipment 
Notes are exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount 
of Equipment Notes of the same type, having the same Maturity 
Date and of any authorized denominations or transferable upon 
surrender of the Equipment Notes to be exchanged or 
transferred, as requested by the Loan Participant surrendering 
the same, upon presentation thereof for such purpose at the 
principal corporate trust office of the Registrar, or at any 
office or agency maintained for such purpose.

No service charge shall be made for any such 
registration of transfer or exchange, but the Registrar may 
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other 
governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer 
of this Equipment Note, the Owner Trustee, the Loan Trustee, 
the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Company may

deem and treat the person in whose name this Equipment Note is 
registered as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of 
receiving payment of the principal of and interest on this 
Equipment Note and for all other purposes whatsoever whether or 
not this Equipment Note be overdue, and neither the Owner 
Trustee, the Loan Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar nor 
the Company shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

AS PROVIDED IN THE INDENTURE, THE INDENTURE AND THIS 
EQUIPMENT NOTE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND 
GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Owner Trustee has caused this 
instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

and eleven months after the due date for such payment and any 
money paid to the Loan Trustee pursuant to Section 11.01 of the 
Pass Through Trust Agreement, shall be paid to the Company; and 
the Loan Participants entitled to payment thereon shall 
thereafter, as unsecured general creditors, look only to the 
Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Loan 
Trustee or any such Paying Agent with respect to such trust 
money shall thereupon cease; provided that the Loan Trustee or 
such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such

Section 7.02. Change in Registration. The Loan 
Trustee shall, upon the request of the Company, consent to the 
deregistration of the Aircraft under the laws of the 
jurisdiction in which it is at the time registered and the 
registration of the Aircraft under the laws of another 
jurisdiction (herein called a "change in registration") 
provided that the following conditions are met:

(a) Such change in registration complies with the 
provisions of this Indenture.

(b) No Indenture Event of Default (and no event 
which, with lapse of time or notice, or both, would become 
an Indenture Event of Default) shall have occurred and be 
continuing at the date of such request or at the effective 
date of the change in registration, provided that it shall 
not be necessary to comply with this condition (i) if the 
change in registration results in the registration of the 
Aircraft under the laws of the
<PAGE> 118

17

United States of America or (ii) if the Loan Trustee in its 
discretion believes the change in registration would be 
advantageous to the Loan Participants.

(c) The Loan Trustee shall have received an opinion 
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to it to the effect 
that:

(i) after giving effect to the change in 
registration, the Lien on the Aircraft and the other 
property included in the Indenture Estate shall 
continue as a fully perfected Lien and that all 
filing, recording or other action necessary to perfect 
and protect the Lien of the Indenture has been 
accomplished (or if such opinion cannot be given at 
the time by which the Loan Trustee has been requested 
to consent to a change in registration, (x) the 
opinion shall detail what filing, recording or other 
action is necessary and (y) the Loan Trustee shall 
have received a certificate from the Company that all 
possible preparation to accomplish such filing, 
recording and other action shall have been done, and 
such filing, recording and other action shall be 
accomplished and a supplemental opinion to that effect 
shall be delivered to the Loan Trustee on or prior to 
the effective date of the change in registration); and

(ii) the terms of this Indenture (including the 
governing law clauses) are legal, valid and binding 
and enforceable in such jurisdiction, except as the 
same may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, 
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws 
affecting the rights of creditors generally, and by 
general principles of equity and except as limited by 
applicable laws which may affect the remedies provided 
for in this Indenture, which laws, however, do not in 
the opinion of such counsel make the remedies provided 
in this Indenture inadequate for the practical 
realization of the rights and benefits provided 
hereby.

(d) The Loan Trustee shall have received assurances 
reasonably satisfactory to it that the insurance provisions 
contained in Section 11 of Article 15 hereof will have been 
complied with after giving effect to such change in 
registration.

<PAGE> 119

18

(e) The Company shall have paid or made provision 
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee for the payment of all 
expenses connected with such change in registration.

The Loan Trustee shall execute such documents as the Company 
shall reasonably request in order to satisfy the above 
conditions and upon satisfaction of such conditions to effect 
the change in registration.

Section 7.03. (Intentionally Omitted)

(H) Sections 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 and 8.04 thereof shall 
read as follows:

Section 8.01. Indenture Events of Default. The 
following events shall constitute "Indenture Events of 
Default" under this Indenture (whether any such event shall be 
voluntary or involuntary or come about or be effected by 
operation of law or pursuant to or in compliance with any 
judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or 
regulation of any administrative or governmental body) and each 
such Indenture Event of Default shall be deemed to exist and 
continue so long as, but only as long as, it shall not have 
been remedied: 

(a) the Company shall fail to pay any installment of 
interest upon any Equipment Note, or the principal of any 
Equipment Note or premium, if any, in respect of any 
Equipment Note, in each case when the same shall be due and 
payable (whether upon redemption, final maturity, 
acceleration or otherwise), and, in each case, such failure 
shall continue for more than 15 days after the same shall 
have become due and payable; or

(b) the Company shall fail to carry and maintain 
insurance on or with respect to the Aircraft in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 11 of Article 15 hereof; 
provided that, in the case of insurance with respect to 
which cancellation, change or lapse for nonpayment of 
premium shall not be effective as to the Loan Trustee for 
30 days (seven days, or such other period as may from time 
to time be customarily obtainable in the industry, in the 
case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after 
receipt of notice by the Loan Trustee of such cancellation, 
change or lapse, no such failure to carry and maintain 
insurance shall constitute an Indenture Event of Default 
hereunder until the earlier of (i) the date such failure 
shall have
<PAGE> 120

19

continued unremedied for a period of 20 days (five days in 
the case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after 
receipt by the Loan Trustee of the notice of cancellation, 
change or lapse referred to in Section 11(a)(C) or 11(b)(C) 
of Article 15 hereof, or (ii) the date such insurance not 
being in effect as to the Loan Trustee; or

(c) the Company shall operate the Aircraft at a time 
when public liability insurance required by Section 11(a) 
of Article 15 hereof shall not be in effect; or

(d) the Company shall fail to perform or observe any 
covenant or agreement to be performed or observed by it 
hereunder or under the Participation Agreement and such 
failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days 
after written notice thereof has been given by the Loan 
Trustee; provided that, if such failure is capable of being 
remedied, no such failure shall constitute an Event of 
Default hereunder for a period of 360 days from the date of 
such notice so long as the Company is diligently proceeding 
to remedy such failure; or

(e) any material representation or warranty made by 
the Company in the Participation Agreement or in the 
Purchase Agreement (to the extent applicable to the 
Aircraft) or in any document or certificate furnished by 
the Company in connection herewith or therewith or pursuant 
hereto or thereto shall prove to have been incorrect in any 
material respect at the time made and such incorrectness 
shall continue to be material and shall continue unremedied 
for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof has 
been given by the Loan Trustee; or

(f) the Company shall consent to the appointment of a 
receiver, trustee or liquidator of itself or of a 
substantial part of its property or the Company shall admit 
in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they 
come due, or shall make a general assignment for the 
benefit of creditors; or

(g) the Company shall file a voluntary petition in 
bankruptcy or a voluntary petition or an answer seeking 
reorganization in a proceeding under any bankruptcy laws 
(as now or hereafter in effect) or an answer admitting the 
material allegations of a petition filed against the 
Company in any such proceeding, or the Company shall by 
voluntary petition, answer or consent, seek relief under
<PAGE> 121

20

the provisions of any other now existing or future 
bankruptcy or other similar law providing for the 
reorganization or winding-up of corporations, or providing 
for an agreement, composition, extension or adjustment with 
its creditors; or

(h) an order, judgment or decree shall be entered by 
any court of competent jurisdiction appointing, without the 
consent of the Company, a receiver, trustee or liquidator 
of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, 
or sequestering any substantial part of the property of the 
Company, and any such order, judgment or decree of 
appointment or sequestration shall remain in force 
undismissed, unstayed or unvacated for a period of 90 days 
after the date of entry thereof; or

(i) a petition against the Company in a proceeding 
under the Federal bankruptcy laws or other insolvency laws, 
as now or hereafter in effect, shall be filed and shall not 
be withdrawn or dismissed within 90 days thereafter, or, 
under the provisions of any law providing for 
reorganization or winding-up of corporations which may 
apply to the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction 
shall assume jurisdiction, custody or control of the 
Company or of any substantial part of its property and such 
jurisdiction, custody or control shall remain in force 
unrelinquished, unstayed or unterminated for a period of 90 
days;

provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in this Indenture, any failure of the Company to 
perform or observe any covenant, condition, or agreement herein 
shall not constitute an Indenture Event of Default if such 
failure is caused solely by reason of an event referred to in 
the definition of "Event of Loss", so long as the Company is 
continuing to comply with the applicable terms of Section 10 of 
Article 15 hereof.

Section 8.02. Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment. 
If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the 
Loan Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the Loan 
Participants holding at least 25% in aggregate principal amount 
of Outstanding Equipment Notes by notice to the Company and the 
Loan Trustee, may declare the principal of all the Equipment 
Notes to be due and payable. Upon such declaration, the 
principal of all Equipment Notes, together with accrued 
interest thereon from the date in respect of which interest was 
last paid hereunder to the date payment of
<PAGE> 122

21

such principal has been made or duly provided for shall be due 
and payable immediately. At any time after such declaration 
and prior to the sale or disposition of the Indenture Estate, 
the Loan Participants in a majority in aggregate principal 
amount of all of the Outstanding Equipment Notes, by notice to 
the Loan Trustee and the Company, may rescind such a 
declaration and thereby annul its consequences if (i) an amount 
sufficient to pay all principal of, premium, if any, and 
interest thereon, at the rate prescribed therefor in such 
Equipment Note and interest due or past due, if any, in respect 
of the Outstanding Equipment Notes plus all other amounts 
payable to the Loan Participants, other than by reason of such 
acceleration, and all sums due and payable to the Loan Trustee 
has been deposited with the Loan Trustee, (ii) the rescission 
would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (iii) all 
existing Indenture Defaults and Indenture Events of Default 
under this Indenture have been cured or waived except 
nonpayment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 
Equipment Notes that has become due solely because of such 
acceleration.

Section 8.03. Other Remedies Available to Loan 
Trustee. (a) After an Indenture Event of Default shall have 
occurred and so long as the same shall be continuing, then and 
in every such case the Loan Trustee, as trustee of an express 
trust and as holder of a security interest in the Aircraft or 
Engines or otherwise, may, at its option, declare this 
Indenture to be in default by a written notice to the Company; 
and at any time thereafter, so long as the Company shall not 
have remedied all outstanding Events of Default, the Loan 
Trustee may do one or more of the following with respect to all 
or any part of any Airframe or any Engines as the Loan Trustee 
in its sole discretion shall elect, to the extent permitted by, 
and subject to compliance with any mandatory requirements of, 
applicable law then in effect; provided, however, that, during 
any period when the Aircraft is subject to the Civil Reserve 
Air Fleet Program in accordance with the provisions of Section 
7(b) of Article 15 hereof and in the possession of the United 
States government or an instrumentality or agency thereof, and 
to the extent that any applicable law or contractual provision 
covering the Aircraft so requires, the Loan Trustee shall not, 
on account of any Indenture Event of Default, be entitled to do 
any of the following in such manner as to limit the Company's 
control (or any lessee's control under any lease permitted by 
the terms of Section 7(b) of Article 15 hereof) of any Airframe 
or any Engines, unless at least 60 days' (or such
<PAGE> 123

22

lesser period as may then be applicable under the Military 
Airlift Command Program of the United States Government) prior 
written notice of default under this Indenture with respect to 
the Company's obligations hereunder shall have been given by 
the Loan Trustee by registered or certified mail to the Company 
(and, if applicable, any such lessee) with a copy addressed to 
the Contracting Office Representative for the Military Airlift 
Command of the United States Air Force under any contract with 
the Company (or any such lessee) relating to the Aircraft:

(i) cause the Company, upon the written demand of the 
Loan Trustee and at the Company's expense, to return 
promptly, and the Company shall return promptly, all or 
such part of any Airframe or any Engine as the Loan Trustee 
may so demand to the Loan Trustee or its order or the Loan 
Trustee, at its option, may enter upon the premises where 
all or any part of such Airframe or any Engine are located 
and take immediate possession of and remove the same 
(together with any engine which is not an Engine but which 
is installed on the Airframe, subject to all of the rights 
of the owner, lessor, lienor or secured party of such 
engine; provided that the Airframe with an engine (which is 
not an Engine) installed thereon may be flown or returned 
only to a location within the continental United States, 
and such engine shall be held for the account of any such 
owner, lessor, lienor or secured party or, if owned by the 
Company, may, at the option of the Loan Trustee, be 
exchanged with the Company for an Engine) all without 
liability accruing to the Loan Trustee for or by reason of 
such entry or taking of possession or removal, whether for 
the restoration of damage to property caused by such taking 
or otherwise; or 

(ii) sell all or any part of any Airframe and any 
Engine at public or private sale, whether or not the Loan 
Trustee shall at the time have possession thereof, as the 
Loan Trustee may determine, or otherwise dispose of, hold, 
use, operate, lease to others or keep idle all or any part 
of such Airframe or such Engine as the Loan Trustee, in its 
sole discretion, may determine, all free and clear of any 
rights of the Company and without any duty to account to 
the Company with respect to such action or inaction or for 
any proceeds with respect thereto.

(b) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and Section 8.03(h), 
if an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is
<PAGE> 124

23

continuing, the Loan Trustee may, if at the time such action 
may be lawful and always subject to compliance with any 
mandatory legal requirements, either with or without taking 
possession, and either before or after taking possession, and 
without instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, and 
having first given notice of such sale by registered mail to 
the Company once at least thirty days prior to the date of such 
sale, and any other notice which may be required by law, sell 
and dispose of the Indenture Estate, or any part thereof, or 
interest therein, at public auction to the highest bidder, in 
one lot as an entirety or in separate lots, and either for cash 
or on credit and on such terms as the Loan Trustee may 
determine, and at any place (whether or not it be the location 
of the Indenture Estate or any part thereof) and time 
designated in the notice above referred to; provided, however, 
that, notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the 
Loan Trustee shall not sell any of the Indenture Estate unless 
a declaration of acceleration has been made pursuant to Section 
8.02. Any such sale or sales may be adjourned from time to 
time by announcement at the time and place appointed for such 
sale or sales, or for any such adjourned sale or sales, without 
further notice, and the Loan Trustee and any Loan Participant 
may bid and become the purchaser at any such sale. The Loan 
Trustee may exercise such right without possession or 
production of the Equipment Notes or proof of ownership 
thereof, and as representative of the Loan Participants may 
exercise such right without notice to the Loan Participants or 
including the Loan Participants as parties to any suit or 
proceeding relating to foreclosure of any property in the 
Indenture Estate. The Company hereby irrevocably constitutes 
the Loan Trustee the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the 
Company (in the name of the Company or otherwise) for the 
purpose of effectuating any sale, assignment, transfer or 
delivery for enforcement of the Lien created under this 
Indenture, whether pursuant to foreclosure or power of sale or 
otherwise, to execute and deliver all such bills of sale, 
assignments and other instruments as the Loan Trustee may 
consider necessary or appropriate, with full power of 
substitution, the Company hereby ratifying and confirming all 
that such attorney or any substitute shall lawfully do by 
virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Loan 
Trustee or any purchaser, the Company shall ratify and confirm 
any such sale, assignment, transfer or delivery, by executing 
and delivering to the Loan Trustee or such purchaser all bills 
of sale, assignments, releases and other proper instruments to 
effect such ratification and confirmation as may be designated 
in any such request.

<PAGE> 125

24

(c) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), if an 
Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the 
Company shall, at the request of the Loan Trustee, promptly 
execute and deliver to the Loan Trustee such instruments of 
title or other documents as the Loan Trustee may deem necessary 
or advisable to enable the Loan Trustee or an agent or 
representative designated by the Loan Trustee, at such time or 
times and place or places as the Loan Trustee may specify, to 
obtain possession of all or any part of the Indenture Estate. 
If the Company shall for any reason fail to execute and deliver 
such instruments and documents after such request by the Loan 
Trustee, the Loan Trustee shall be entitled, in a proceeding to 
which the Company will be a necessary party, to a judgment for 
specific performance of the covenants contained in the 
foregoing sentence, conferring upon the Loan Trustee the right 
to immediate possession and requiring the Company to execute 
and deliver such instruments and documents to the Loan Trustee. 
The Loan Trustee shall also be entitled to pursue all or any 
part of the Indenture Estate wherever it may be found and may 
enter any of the premises of the Company or any other Person 
wherever the Indenture Estate may be or is supposed to be and 
search for the Indenture Estate and take possession of any item 
of the Indenture Estate pursuant to this Section 8.03(c). The 
Loan Trustee may, from time to time, at the expense of the 
Indenture Estate, make all such expenditures for maintenance, 
insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and 
improvements to and of the Indenture Estate, as it may deem 
proper. In each such case, the Loan Trustee shall have the 
right to use, operate, store, lease, control or manage the 
Indenture Estate, and to exercise all rights and powers of the 
Company relating to the Indenture Estate as the Loan Trustee 
shall deem appropriate, including the right to enter into any 
and all such agreements with respect to the use, operation, 
storage, leasing, control or management of the Indenture Estate 
or any part thereof; and the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to 
collect and receive directly all tolls, rents, issues, profits, 
products, revenues and other income of the Indenture Estate and 
every part thereof, without prejudice, however, to the right of 
the Loan Trustee under any provision of this Indenture to 
collect and receive all cash held by, or required to be 
deposited with, the Loan Trustee hereunder. In accordance with 
the terms of this Section 8.03(c), such tolls, rents, issues, 
profits, products, revenues and other income shall be applied 
to pay the expenses of using, operating, storing, leasing, 
controlling or managing the Indenture Estate, and of all 
maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations,
<PAGE> 126

25

additions and improvements, and to make all payments which the 
Loan Trustee may be required or may elect to make, if any, for 
taxes, assessments, insurance or other proper charges upon the 
Indenture Estate or any part thereof (including the employment 
of engineers and accountants to examine, inspect and make 
reports upon the properties and books and records of the 
Company in accordance with this Section 8.03(c)), and all other 
payments which the Loan Trustee may be required or authorized 
to make under any provision of this Indenture, including this 
Section 8.03(c), as well as just and reasonable compensation 
for the services of the Loan Trustee, and of all Persons 
properly engaged and employed by the Loan Trustee.

If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is 
continuing and the Loan Trustee shall have obtained possession 
of or title to the Aircraft, the Loan Trustee shall not be 
obligated to use or operate the Aircraft or cause the Aircraft 
to be used or operated directly or indirectly by itself or 
through agents or other representatives or to lease, license or 
otherwise permit or provide for the use or operation of the 
Aircraft by any other Person unless (i) the Loan Trustee shall 
have been able to obtain insurance in kinds, at rates and in 
amounts satisfactory to it in its discretion to protect the 
Indenture Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and 
individually, against any and all liability for loss or damage 
to the Aircraft and for public liability and property damage 
resulting from use or operation of the Aircraft and (ii) funds 
are available in the Indenture Estate to pay for all such 
insurance or, in lieu of such insurance, the Loan Trustee is 
furnished with indemnification from the holders of the 
Equipment Notes or any other Person upon terms and in amounts 
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee in its discretion to protect 
the Indenture Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and 
individually, against any and all such liabilities.

(d) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), the Loan 
Trustee may proceed to protect and enforce this Indenture and 
the Equipment Notes by suit or suits or proceedings in equity, 
at law or in bankruptcy, and whether for the specific 
performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or in 
execution or aid of any power herein granted; or for 
foreclosure hereunder, or for the appointment of a receiver or 
receivers for the Indenture Estate or any part thereof, or for 
the recovery of judgment for the indebtedness secured by the 
Lien created under this Indenture or for the enforcement of any 
other proper, legal or
<PAGE> 127

26

equitable remedy available under applicable law.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture 
to the contrary, including, without limitation, Sections 
8.03(b), 8.03(c) and 8.03(d), so long as no Indenture Event of 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Loan Trustee 
shall not take any action contrary to, or disturb, the 
Company's rights to possession and use of, and quiet enjoyment 
of, the Aircraft.

(f) Each and every right, power and remedy herein 
given to the Loan Trustee specifically or otherwise in this 
Indenture shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every 
other right, power and remedy herein specifically given or now 
or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute, and each 
and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein 
given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time 
and as often in such order as may be deemed expedient by the 
Loan Trustee, and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise 
of any power or remedy shall not be construed to be a waiver of 
the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other 
right, power or remedy. No delay or omission by the Loan 
Trustee in the exercise of any right, remedy or power or in 
pursuing any remedy shall impair any such right, power or 
remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default on the 
part of the Company or to be an acquiescence therein.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if 
any payment of principal of any Equipment Note shall not be 
made when and as the same shall become due and payable, or if 
any payment of interest on any Equipment Note shall not be made 
when and as the same shall become due and payable, and such 
failure shall continue for the period prescribed in Section 
8.01(a), the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to recover 
judgment, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, 
upon the Equipment Note for the whole amount of such principal 
or interest, as the case may be, remaining unpaid.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, so 
long as the Pass Through Trustee is the registered holder of 
any Equipment Note hereunder, the Loan Trustee is not 
authorized or empowered to acquire title to all or any portion 
of the Indenture Estate or take any action with respect to all 
or any portion of the Indenture Estate so acquired by it if 
such acquisition or action would cause any Pass Through Trust 
to fail to qualify as a "grantor trust"

for Federal income tax purposes.

Section 8.04. Waiver of Company. To the extent now 
or at any time hereafter enforceable under applicable law, the 
Company covenants that it will not at any time insist upon or 
plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take any benefit or 
advantage of, any stay or extension law now or at any time 
hereafter in force, nor claim, take nor insist upon any benefit 
or advantage of or from any law now or hereafter in force 
providing for the valuation or appraisement of the Indenture 
Estate or any part thereof, prior to any sale or sales thereof 
to be made pursuant to any provision herein contained, or to 
the decree, judgment or order of any court of competent 
jurisdiction; nor, after such sale or sales, claim or exercise 
any right under any statute now or hereafter made or enacted by 
any state or otherwise to redeem the property so sold or any 
part thereof, and hereby expressly waives for itself and on 
behalf of each and every Person, except decree or judgment

laws, and covenants that it will not invoke or utilize any such 
law or laws or otherwise hinder, delay or impede the execution 
of any power herein granted and delegated to the Loan Trustee,

if it does not possess any of the Equipment Notes or does not 
produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by 
the Loan Trustee or any Loan Participant in exercising any 
right or remedy accruing upon an Indenture Event of Default

constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in such Indenture Event 
of Default.

obligation of the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to be a 
reference to the Company or to an obligation of the Company, as 
the case may be, any reference to "Lease Event of Default" 
shall be deemed to be a reference to an "Indenture Event of 
Default", all provisions requiring notices to the Owner Trustee 
or the Owner Participant shall be deemed to be

have been discharged from their respective obligations with 
respect to the Equipment Notes (and the Loan Trustee, on demand 
and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper 
instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this 
Indenture in respect of the Equipment Notes), when

at maturity within one year, and there has been deposited 
with the Loan Trustee in trust for the purpose of paying 
and discharging the entire indebtedness of the Equipment 
Notes not theretofore cancelled by the Loan Trustee or 
delivered to the Loan Trustee for cancellation, an amount 
in cash sufficient without reinvestment thereof to 
discharge such indebtedness, including the principal of, 
premium, if any, and interest on the Equipment Notes to the 
date of such deposit (in the case of Equipment Notes which 
have become due and payable), or to the maturity thereof,

Loan Participants; or

deposited irrevocably (except as provided in Section 10.04) 
with the Loan Trustee as trust funds in trust, specifically 
pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the 
benefit of the Loan Participants, (1) money in an amount, 
or (2) U.S. Government Obligations which, through the 
payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in 
accordance with their terms, will provide (not later than 
one Business Day before the due date of any payment 
referred to below in this clause) money in an amount, or 
(3) a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations 
referred to in the foregoing clause (2), sufficient, in the 
opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent 
certified public accountants expressed in a written 
certification thereof delivered to the Loan Trustee, to pay 
and discharge each installment of principal of, premium, if 
any, and interest on the Outstanding Equipment Notes on the 
dates such payments of principal or interest are due

irrevocable notice has been given to the Loan Trustee on or

of Default or Indenture Default under any of Sections 
8.01(f) through 8.01(i) hereof shall have occurred and be 
continuing on the date of such deposit or at any time 
during the period ending on the 91st day after such date;

referred to above in clause (A), the right of the Company 
to cause the redemption of Equipment Notes (except 
redemption in respect of which irrevocable notice has 
theretofore been given) shall terminate;

violation of, or constitute an Indenture Default or

is bound; and

(C) the Company has delivered to the Loan Trustee an 
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the 
effect that there has been published by the Internal 
Revenue Service a ruling to the effect that Loan 
Participants will not recognize income, gain or loss for 
Federal income tax purposes as a result of the exercise by 
the Company of its option under this Section 10.01(a)(iii) 
and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same 
amount and in the same manner and at the same

such new series of Equipment Notes the Loan Trustee shall have 
received (i) written evidence from Standard & Poor's 
Corporation and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. to the effect 
that the issuance of such new series, by itself, would not 
result in a downgrading of the credit rating assigned to the 
Pass Through Certificates then outstanding, and (ii) an Opinion 
of Counsel for the Company reasonably satisfactory to the Loan 
Trustee to the effect that the protection afforded by Section 
1110 of the Bankruptcy Code to the existing Loan Participants 
would not be adversely affected by the issuance of such new 
series of Equipment Notes; provided that such opinion need not 
be delivered to the extent that the benefits of such Section 
1110 are not available to the Loan Participants with respect to 
the Aircraft immediately prior to such assumption; and provided 
further that such opinion may contain qualifications of the 
tenor contained in the opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton

indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on 
or with respect to the Airframe or any Engine, title thereto or 
any interest therein or in this Indenture except (i) the

provided, the Lien created under this Indenture, and the rights 
of the Loan Trustee and the Loan Participants under this

Trust Agreement, (ii) the rights of others under agreements or 
arrangements to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of 
Sections 7(b) and 8(b) of this Article, (iii) Loan Participant

<PAGE> 139

38

provided) by appropriate proceedings so long as such 
proceedings do not involve any significant danger of the sale, 
forfeiture or loss of the Airframe or any Engine or any 
interest therein, (v) materialmen's, mechanics', workmen's, 
repairmen's, employees' or other like Liens arising in the 
ordinary course of business for amounts the payment of which is 
either not yet delinquent or is being contested in good faith 
(and for the payment of which adequate reserves have been 
provided) by appropriate proceedings so long as such 
proceedings do not involve any significant danger of the sale, 
forfeiture or loss of the Airframe or any Engine or interest 
therein, (vi) Liens arising out of judgments or awards against 
the Company or any lessee with respect to which an appeal or 
proceeding for review is being prosecuted in good faith, so

Airframe or any Engine or any interest therein (unless the 
Company or any lessee shall have provided a bond or other 
security in an amount and under terms reasonably satisfactory 
to the Company) and (vii) salvage or similar rights of insurers 
under insurance policies maintained pursuant to Section 11 of 
this Article. The Company will promptly, at its own expense, 
take such action as may be necessary duly to discharge 
(by bonding or otherwise) any such Lien not excepted above if 
the same shall arise at any time.

Section 7. Registration, Maintenance and Operation; 
Possession; Insignia. (a) Registration, Maintenance and 
Operation. The Company, at its own cost and expense, shall:

(i) at all times cause the Aircraft to remain duly 
registered under the laws of the United States, in the name 
of the Company, as owner; provided that the Loan Trustee 
shall execute and deliver all such documents as the Company 
shall reasonably request for the purpose of effecting and 
continuing such registration. Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence, but subject to the conditions and requirements of 
Section 7.02 of this Indenture, at no expense or liability 
to any Loan Participant or the Loan Trustee, the Company 
may cause the Aircraft to be duly registered under the laws 
of any jurisdiction in the name of the Company or of any 
nominee of the Company, or, if required by applicable law, 
in the name of any other Person, and the Loan Trustee will 
cooperate with the Company in effecting such foreign 
registration;

(ii) maintain, service, repair, overhaul and test the 
Aircraft in accordance with a maintenance program (as
<PAGE> 140

39

approved by the Federal Aviation Administration) for Boeing 
767-323ER aircraft and General Electric CF6-80C2B6 engines 
(or, at the Company's option, in accordance with the 
aircraft maintenance standards for such aircraft and 
engines approved by the central civil aviation authority of 
any of Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, 
Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom or any other 
jurisdiction with aircraft maintenance standards that are, 
at the time that such standards become applicable to the 
Aircraft, substantially similar to those of the United 
States or substantially similar to those of any of the 
foregoing countries on the Delivery Date) and in the same 
manner and with the same care used by the Company with 
respect to comparable aircraft and engines owned or 
operated by the Company and utilized in similar 
circumstances so as to keep the Aircraft in as good an 
operating condition as when delivered to the Company 
hereunder, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in such 
condition as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness 
certification of the Aircraft to be maintained in good 
standing at all times (other than during temporary periods 
of storage in accordance with applicable regulations or 
during periods of grounding by applicable governmental 
authorities) under the Federal Aviation Act or, if the 
Aircraft is registered under the laws of any other 
jurisdiction, the laws of such jurisdiction;

(iii) maintain all records, logs and other materials in 
English and such other languages as are, from time to time, 
required by the appropriate authorities in the jurisdiction 
where the Aircraft is registered and maintained to be 
maintained in respect of the Aircraft; and

(iv) promptly furnish to the Loan Trustee such 
information as may be required to enable the Loan Trustee 
to file any reports, returns or statements required to be 
filed by the Loan Trustee with any governmental authority 
because of the Loan Trustee's interest in the Aircraft.

The Company agrees that the Aircraft will not be 
maintained, used or operated in violation of any law or any 
rule, regulation or order of any government or governmental 
authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign), or in 
violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or 
registration relating to the Aircraft issued by any such 
government or authority; provided that the Company shall not
<PAGE> 141

40

be in default under this sentence if it is not possible for it 
to comply with the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United 
States (or the jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is then 
registered) because of a conflict with the applicable laws of 
the United States (or such jurisdiction in which the Aircraft 
is then registered). In the event that any such law, rule, 
regulation or order requires alteration of the Aircraft, the 
Company will conform thereto or obtain conformance therewith at 
no expense to the Loan Trustee and will maintain the Aircraft 
in proper operating condition under such laws, rules, 
regulations and orders; provided, however, that the Company 
may, in good faith, contest the validity or application of any 
such law, rule, regulation or order in any reasonable manner 
which does not materially adversely affect the Loan Trustee, 
the Aircraft, the Loan Participants or the Lien of this 
Indenture. The Company also agrees not to operate or locate 
the Aircraft, or suffer the Aircraft to be operated or located, 
(i) in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance 
required by the terms of Section 11 of this Article, except in 
the case of a requisition for use by any Government where the 
Company obtains indemnity in lieu of such insurance from such 
Government against the risks and in the amounts required by 
Section 11 of this Article, covering such area, or (ii) in any 
war zone or recognized or, in the Company's reasonable 
judgment, threatened area of hostilities unless covered by war 
risk insurance of the type required to be maintained in 
Section 11 of this Article, or unless the Aircraft is operated 
or used under contract with any Government, under which 
contract such Government assumes liability for any damage, 
loss, destruction or failure to return possession of the 
Aircraft at the end of the term of such contract and for injury 
to persons and damage to property of others.

(b) Possession. The Company will not, without the 
prior written consent of the Loan Trustee, lease or otherwise 
in any manner deliver, transfer or relinquish possession of the 
Airframe or any Engine or install any Engine, or permit any 
Engine to be installed, on any airframe other than the 
Airframe; provided that, so long as no Indenture Event of 
Default (or in the case of a lease described in clause (viii) 
or (ix) below, a Payment or Bankruptcy Default) shall have 
occurred and be continuing, and so long as the action to be 
taken shall not deprive the Loan Trustee of the perfected Lien 
of this Indenture on the Airframe or (subject to subclause (B) 
of the "provided further" clause to subsection (i) of this 
Section 7(b)) any Engine, and in any event, so long as the 
Company shall comply with the provisions of
<PAGE> 142

41

Section 11 of this Article, the Company may, without the prior 
consent of the Loan Trustee:

(i) subject the Airframe to normal interchange 
agreements or any Engine to normal interchange or pooling 
agreements or arrangements in each case customary in the 
airline industry and entered into by the Company in the 
ordinary course of its business with any other United 
States air carrier as to which there is in force a 
certificate issued pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal 
Aviation Act or any successor provision that gives like 
authority, and as to which there is in full force and 
effect an air carrier operating certificate issued pursuant 
to Part 121 of the regulations under such Act, or with any 
"foreign air carrier" (as such term is defined in such Act) 
as to which there is in force a permit issued pursuant to 
Section 402 of said Act and which is principally based in 
and a domiciliary of either (A) a country listed in 
Schedule I or Schedule I-A hereto or (B) a country as to 
which the Company has delivered an opinion to the effect 
specified in clause (y) of paragraph (ix) of this section 
7(b) with respect to such interchange agreement (mutatis 
mutandis) with such foreign air carrier (any such United 
States certificated air carrier and any such foreign air 
carrier being hereinafter called a "Permitted Air 
Carrier"); provided that no transfer of the registration of 
such Airframe shall be effected in connection therewith; 
and provided further that (A) no such agreement or 
arrangement contemplates, permits or requires or results in 
the transfer of title to the Airframe and (B) if the 
Company's title to any such Engine shall be divested under 
any such agreement or arrangement, such divestiture shall 
be deemed to be an Event of Loss with respect to such 
Engine and the Company shall comply with Section 10(b) of 
this Article in respect thereof;

(ii) deliver possession of the Airframe or any Engine 
to the manufacturer thereof for testing or other similar 
purposes or to any organization for service, repair, 
maintenance or overhaul work on the Airframe or such Engine

or additions to the Airframe or such Engine to the extent 
required or permitted by the terms of Section 7(a) or 8(c) 
of this Article;

(iii) transfer possession of the Airframe or any 
Engine to the United States or any instrumentality or 
agency thereof pursuant to a lease, contract or other 
instrument a copy of which shall be furnished to the Loan 
Trustee;

(iv) transfer possession of the Airframe or any 
Engine to the United States or any instrumentality or 
agency thereof in accordance with applicable laws, 
rulings, regulations or orders (including, without 
limitation, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program authorized 
under 10 U.S.C. Sec. 9511 et seq. or any substantially 
similar program);

(v) install an Engine on an airframe owned by the 
Company free and clear of all Liens, except (A) those of 
the type permitted under clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), 
(vi) and (vii) of Section 6 of this Article and those 
which apply only to the engines (other than Engines), 
appliances, parts, instruments, appurtenances, 
accessories, furnishings and other equipment (other than 
Parts) installed on such airframe (but not to the airframe 
as an entirety) and (B) the rights of other Permitted Air 
Carriers under normal interchange agreements which are 
customary in the airline industry and do not contemplate, 
permit, require or result in the transfer of title to the 
airframe or engines installed thereon;

(vi) install an Engine on an airframe leased to the 
Company or owned by the Company subject to a conditional 
sale or other security agreement; provided that (A) such 
airframe is free and clear of all Liens except the rights 
of the parties to the lease or conditional sale or other 
security agreement covering such airframe and except Liens 
of the type permitted by clauses (A) and (B) of 
subparagraph (v) of this paragraph of Section 7(b) of this 
Article and (B) the Company shall have obtained from the 
lessor or secured party of such airframe a written 
agreement (which may be the lease or conditional sale or 
other security agreement covering such airframe), in form 
and substance satisfactory to the Loan Trustee (it being 
understood that an agreement from such lessor or secured 
party substantially in the form of the final sentence of 
the penultimate paragraph of this Section 7(b) of this 
Article shall be deemed to be satisfactory to the Loan 
Trustee) whereby such lessor or secured party expressly 
agrees that neither it nor
<PAGE> 144

43

its successors or assigns will acquire or claim any right, 
title or interest in any Engine by reason of such Engine 
being installed on such airframe at any time while such 
Engine is subject to the Lien of this Indenture;

(vii) install an Engine on an airframe owned by the 
Company, leased to the Company or owned by the Company 
subject to a conditional sale or other security agreement 
under circumstances where neither subparagraph (v) nor 
subparagraph (vi) of this Section 7(b) of this Article is 
applicable; provided that such installation shall be 
deemed an Event of Loss with respect to such Engine and 
the Company shall comply with Section 10(b) of this 
Article in respect thereof if such installation shall 
adversely affect the Loan Trustee's interest in such 
Engine, the Loan Trustee not intending hereby to waive any 
right or interest it may have to or in such Engine under 
applicable law until compliance by the Company with such 
Section 10(b) of this Article;

(viii) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or 
engines then installed on the Airframe to any United 
States air carrier as to which there is in force a 
certificate issued pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal 
Aviation Act or successor provision that gives like 
authority;

(ix) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or 
engines then installed on the Airframe to (A) any foreign 
air carrier that is principally based in and a domiciliary 
of a country that is listed in Schedule 1 hereto, or 
(B) any foreign air carrier that is principally based in 
and a domiciliary of a country listed in Schedule 1-A 
hereto, or (C) any foreign air carrier not described in 
clause (A) or (B) above, provided that (y) prior to any 
lease to a foreign air carrier under clause (C) above, the 
Loan Trustee shall have received an opinion of counsel to 
the Company licensed in the country in which the lessee is 
domiciled and principally based, such counsel to be 
reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee, to the effect 
that (1) there exist no possessory rights in favor of the 
lessee under the laws of the lessee's country which would, 
upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of or other default by 
the Company and assuming that at such time such lessee is 
not insolvent or bankrupt, prevent the return of such
<PAGE> 145

44

Engine or the Airframe and such Engine or engine to the 
Loan Trustee in accordance with and when permitted by 
terms hereof upon the exercise by the Loan Trustee of its 
remedies hereunder, (2) the remedies provided in the lease 
are enforceable in the country in which such foreign air 
carrier is a domiciliary and principally based, to 
substantially the same extent as such remedies would be 
enforceable in the United States and the lease is subject 
and subordinate to the Lien of this Indenture, (3) it is 
not necessary for the Loan Trustee to qualify to do 
business in such country solely as a result of the 
proposed lease and (4) the proposed lease will not give 
rise to tort liability to the Loan Trustee as a result of 
the Lien of this Indenture under the laws of such country 
other than tort liability no more extensive or onerous 
than that which might have been imposed on the Loan 
Trustee under the laws of the United States in the absence 
of such lease (it being understood that, in the event the 
opinion set forth in this subclause (4) cannot be given in 
a form satisfactory to the Loan Trustee, such opinion 
shall be waived if insurance reasonably satisfactory to 
the Loan Trustee is provided by the Company to cover the 
risk of such liability) and (z) in the case of any lease 
to a foreign air carrier (other than a foreign air carrier 
principally based in Taiwan) the United States of America 
maintains diplomatic relations with the country in which 
such foreign air carrier is principally based at the time 
such lease is entered into;

provided that the rights of any lessee or other transferee who 
receives possession by reason of a transfer permitted by this 
Section 7(b) (other than the transfer of an Engine which is 
deemed an Event of Loss) shall be subject and subordinate to, 
and any lease permitted by this Section 7(b) shall be made 
expressly subject and subordinate to, all the terms of this 
Indenture, including, without limitation, Section 7(a) of this 
Article and the Loan Trustee's rights to repossession pursuant 
to Article 8 hereof and to avoid such lease upon such 
repossession and the Loan Trustee's rights to possession 
pursuant to Section 8.03 of this Indenture, and the Company 
shall in all events remain primarily liable hereunder for the 
performance and observance of all of the terms and conditions 
of this Indenture to the same extent as if such lease or 
transfer had not occurred, and any such lease shall include 
appropriate provisions for the maintenance and insurance of 
the Aircraft. No interchange agreement, pooling agreement,
<PAGE> 146

45

lease or other relinquishment of possession of the Airframe or 
any Engine shall in any way discharge or diminish any of the 
Company's obligations to the Loan Trustee hereunder. No 
sublease of the Airframe or Engines shall be permitted except 
in connection with a transaction that involves such a sublease 
commencing at the inception of the lease and in which each 
sublessee and sublease satisfies the conditions contained in 
this Section 7(b) with respect to lessees and leases, 
respectively. The Company shall not lease the Airframe or any 
Engine to an air carrier that at the inception of the lease is 
subject to bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings unless 
the lease shall have been approved by the United States 
Bankruptcy Court and payments thereunder shall have been 
accorded priority treatment in such bankruptcy or other 
insolvency or, in the case of a lease to a foreign air carrier, 
the lease shall have been approved by the corresponding foreign 
authority and payments thereunder shall have been accorded 
priority treatment in such bankruptcy or other insolvency and 
the Loan Trustee shall have received an opinion in form and 
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Loan 
Trustee of the Company's counsel to the effect that such 
approval provides the Company with assurances and priority 
treatment substantially equivalent to those that would be 
provided by the corresponding United States Bankruptcy Court. 
The Company shall, promptly (and in any event within 15 days) 
upon entering into a lease of the Airframe or Engines, notify 
the Loan Trustee of the identity of the lessee and the term of 
such lease and shall provide a copy of such lease agreement to 
the Loan Trustee upon request therefrom (with economic and 
financial provisions and information deleted therefrom if the 
Company shall so choose), provided that such parties shall keep 
confidential the identity of the lessee and the existence and 
terms of such lease, except that such parties may disclose such 
information (A) to committed (subject to receipt of such 
information and other customary closing conditions) transferees 
of the Loan Trustee's interest who agree to hold such 
information confidential, (B) to the Loan Trustee's counsel, 
independent insurance advisors or other agents who agree to 
hold such information confidential and (C) as may be required 
by any statute, court or administrative order or decree or 
governmental ruling or regulation. The Loan Trustee hereby 
agrees, for the benefit of the lessor or secured party of any 
airframe leased to the Company or owned by the Company subject 
to a conditional sale or other security agreement, that the 
Loan Trustee will not acquire or claim, as against such lessor 
or secured party, any right, title or interest in any engine or 
engines owned
<PAGE> 147

46

by the lessor under such lease or subject to a security 
interest in favor of the secured party under such conditional 
sale or other security agreement as the result of such engine 
or engines being installed on the Airframe at any time while 
such engine or engines are subject to such lease or conditional 
sale or other security agreement.

The Loan Trustee acknowledges that any "wet lease" or 
other similar arrangement under which the Company maintains 
operational control of the Aircraft shall not constitute a 
delivery, transfer or relinquishment of possession for purposes 
of this Section 7(b).

(c) Insignia. The Company agrees to at all times 
affix on or to maintain in the cockpit of the Airframe adjacent 
to the airworthiness certificate therein and (if not prevented 
by applicable law or regulations or by any governmental 
authority) on each Engine a nameplate bearing the inscription 
"MORTGAGED TO STATE STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF 
CONNECTICUT, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS LOAN TRUSTEE" 
(such nameplate to be replaced, if necessary, with a name plate 
reflecting the name of any successor Loan Trustee). Except as 
above provided, the Company will not allow the name of any 
Person to be placed on the Airframe or on any Engine as a 
designation that might be interpreted as a claim of ownership; 
provided that nothing herein contained shall prohibit the 
Company (or any lessee) from placing its customary colors and 
insignia on the Airframe or any Engine.

Section 8. Replacement and Pooling of Parts; 
Alterations, Modifications and Additions. (a) Replacement of 
Parts. The Company, at its own cost and expense, will promptly 
replace all Parts which may from time to time be incorporated 
or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine and 
which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, 
destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or 
rendered permanently unfit for use for any reason whatsoever, 
except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of this Article. 
In addition, the Company may, at its own cost and expense, 
remove in the ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, 
overhaul or testing, any Parts, whether or not worn out, lost, 
stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair 
or rendered permanently unfit for use; provided that the 
Company, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of this 
Article, will, at its own cost and expense, replace such Parts 
as promptly as possible. All replacement Parts shall be free 
and clear of all Liens
<PAGE> 148

47

(except for Permitted Liens) and shall be in as good operating 
condition as, and shall have a value and utility at least 
equal to, the Parts replaced, assuming such replaced Parts 
were in the condition and repair required to be maintained by 
the terms hereof. All Parts at any time removed from the 
Airframe or any Engine shall remain subject to the Lien of 
this Indenture no matter where located, until such time as 
such Parts be replaced by Parts which have been incorporated 
or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine, 
which meet the requirements for replacement Parts specified 
above. Immediately upon any replacement Part becoming 
incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or 
any Engine as above provided, without further act, (i) title 
to such replacement Part shall thereupon shall be free and 
clear of all Liens (except for Permitted Liens) and (ii) such 
replacement Part shall become subject to the Lien of this 
Indenture and be deemed part of the Airframe or such Engine 
for all purposes to the same extent as the Parts originally 
incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or 
such Engine. Upon such replacement Part becoming subject to 
the Lien of this Indenture, title to the replaced Part shall 
thereupon vest in the Company, free and clear of all rights of 
the Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant, and such replaced 
Part shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder.

(b) Pooling of Parts. Any Part removed from the 
Airframe or an Engine as provided in Section 8(a) of this 
Article may be subjected by the Company to a normal pooling 
arrangement customary in the airline industry entered into in 
the ordinary course of the Company's business with Permitted 
Air Carriers; provided that the Part replacing such removed 
Part shall be incorporated or installed in or attached to the 
Airframe or such Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of 
this Article as promptly as practicable after the removal of 
such removed Part. In addition, any replacement Part when 
incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or an 
Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article may be 
owned by a Permitted Air Carrier subject to such a normal 
pooling arrangement; provided that the Company shall, at its 
expense, as promptly thereafter as practicable, either 
(i) cause title to such replacement Part to vest in the 
Company free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted 
Liens) at which time such replacement Part shall in accordance 
with Section 8(a) of this Article, become a Part and subject 
to the Lien of this Indenture or (ii) replace such replacement 
Part by incorporating or installing in or attaching to the 
Airframe
<PAGE> 149

48

or such Engine a further replacement Part owned by the Company 
free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), 
which shall, without further act, be subject to the Lien of 
this Indenture and by causing title to such further 
replacement Part to vest in the Loan Trustee in accordance 
with Section 8(a) of this Article. Upon title to such 
replacement Part vesting in the Company, such replacement Part 
shall become subject to Lien of this Indenture and be deemed 
part of the Airframe or such Engine for all purposes to the 
same extent as the Part originally incorporated or installed 
in or attached to the Airframe or such Engine, and title to 
the replaced Part shall vest in the Company, free and clear of 
all rights of the Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant, and 
such replaced Part shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder.

(c) Alterations, Modifications and Additions. 
The Company, at its own expense, will make such alterations 
and modifications in and additions to the Airframe and the 
Engines as may be required from time to time to meet the 
standards of the Federal Aviation Administration or other 
governmental authority having jurisdiction in any country in 
or over which the Aircraft is flown; provided, however, that 
the Company may, in good faith, contest the validity or 
application of any such standard in any reasonable manner 
which does not materially adversely affect the Loan Trustee or 
the Lien of this Indenture or involve a significant risk of 
the imposition of criminal liability on the Loan Trustee or 
any Loan Participant. In addition, the Company, at its own 
expense, may from time to time make or cause to be made such 
alterations and modifications in and additions to the Airframe 
or any Engine as the Company may deem desirable in the proper 
conduct of its business, including, without limitation, 
removal of Parts; provided that no such alteration, 
modification, addition or removal shall diminish the value or 
utility of the Airframe or such Engine, or impair the 
condition or airworthiness thereof, below the value, utility, 
condition and airworthiness thereof immediately prior to such 
alteration, modification, addition or removal assuming the 
Airframe or such Engine was then of the value and utility and 
in the condition and airworthiness required to be maintained 
by the terms of this Indenture, except that the value (but not 
the utility, condition or airworthiness) of the Aircraft may 
be reduced by the value of Parts which the Company deems 
obsolete or no longer suitable or appropriate for use in the 
Airframe or any Engine which shall have been removed, if the 
aggregate original value of all such obsolete or unsuitable 
Parts
<PAGE> 150

49

removed from the Aircraft and not replaced during the Term 
shall not exceed $400,000. All Parts incorporated or 
installed in or attached or added to the Airframe or any 
Engine as the result of such alteration, modification or 
addition shall, without further act, be subject to the Lien of 
this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no 
Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing, the Company may, at any time, remove any Part; 
provided that (i) such Part is in addition to, and not in 
replacement of or substitution for, any Part originally 
incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or 
such Engine at the time of delivery thereof hereunder or any 
Part in replacement of, or substitution for, any such Part, 
(ii) such Part is not required to be incorporated or installed 
in or attached or added to such Airframe or Engine pursuant to 
Section 7 of this Article or the first sentence of this 
Section 8(c) other than the proviso thereto, and (iii) such 
Part can be removed from the Airframe or such Engine without 
diminishing or impairing the value, utility, condition or 
airworthinness required to be maintained by the terms of this 
Indenture which the Airframe or such Engine would have had at 
such time had such removal not occurred. Upon the removal by 
the Company of any Part as provided in the immediately 
preceding sentence or the removal of any obsolete or 
unsuitable Part permitted by this Section 8(c), such Part 
shall no longer be deemed part of the Airframe or the Engine 
from which it was removed and shall no longer be subject to 
the Lien of this Indenture. Any such Part not removed by the 
Company as provided in Section 8(c)(iii) of this Article shall 
remain subject to the Lien of this Indenture.

Section 10. Loss, Destruction, Requisition, Etc. 
(a) Event of Loss with Respect to the Airframe. Upon the 
occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe or 
the Airframe and any Engines installed on the Airframe, the 
Company shall forthwith (and, in any event, within 15 days 
after such occurrence) give the Loan Trustee written notice of 
such Event of Loss, specifying the date of such occurrence, 
and of its election to perform one of the following options 
(it being agreed that if the Company shall not have given 
notice of such election within such 15 days after such 
occurrence, the Company shall be deemed to have elected to 
perform the option set forth in the following clause (ii)):

(i) as promptly as practicable, and in any event 
on or before the Business Day next preceding the 181st
<PAGE> 151

50

day next following the date of occurrence of such Event of 
Loss, in replacement for the Airframe, the Company shall 
convey or cause to be conveyed to the Loan Trustee a 
security interest in and to a Replacement Airframe 
(together with the same number of Replacement Engines as 
the Engines, if any, installed on the Airframe at the time 
such Event of Loss occurred), such Replacement Airframe 
and Replacement Engines to be free and clear of all Liens 
(other than Permitted Liens), to have a value and utility 
at least equal to, and to be in as good operating 
condition as, the Airframe and Engines, if any, so 
replaced (assuming such Airframe and Engines were in the 
condition and repair required by the terms of this 
Indenture); provided that if the Company shall have 
elected to replace the Airframe and such Engines, but 
shall not have performed its obligation to effect such 
replacement under this clause (i) during the period of 
time provided herein, then the Company shall promptly give 
notice to the Loan Trustee and shall pay on the Business 
day next following the thirtieth day after the end of such 
period to the Loan Trustee.

(ii) on or before the Loss Payment Date (as defined 
below) the Company shall pay to the Loan Trustee an amount 
in cash which is sufficient to redeem each Outstanding 
Equipment Note pursuant to Section 6.01; provided that the 
Company may, to the extent provided and in accordance with 
Section 3.08 hereof, surrender, to the Loan Trustee for 
cancellation Equipment Notes held by the Company and in 
such event the Company shall be entitled to a credit 
against amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this 
clause (ii). As used herein, "Loss Payment Date" means the 
earlier of (x) the Business Day next following the 
181st day next following the date of occurrence of the 
Event of Loss and (y) a Business Day irrevocably specified 
by the Company at least thirty days in advance by notice 
to the Loan Trustee; provided, however, the Loss Payment 
Date shall be the date specified in the proviso to 
clause (i) above if applicable.

Upon compliance by the Company with the requirements of this 
Section 10(a)(ii), the Loan Trustee shall execute such 
instruments as may be reasonably requested by the Company 
releasing the Airframe and Engines from the Lien of this 
Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the 
Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge 
thereof hereunder.
<PAGE> 152

51

At the time of or prior to any replacement of the 
Airframe and such Engines pursuant to Section 10(a)(i) of this 
Article, if any, the Company, at its own expense, will (A) 
cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement, 
substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto for such 
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, to be 
delivered to the Loan Trustee for execution and, upon such 
execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal 
Aviation Act or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws 
of the jurisdiction other than the United States of America in 
which such Replacement Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if 
any, are to be registered in accordance with Section 7(a) of 
this Article, as the case may be, (B) cause a financing 
statement or statements with respect to the Replacement 
Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, or other requisite 
documents or instruments, to be filed in such place or places 
as necessary or advisable in order to perfect the security 
interest therein created by or pursuant to this Indenture, or, 
if necessary or advisable, pursuant to the applicable laws of 
the jurisdiction in which such Replacement Aircraft and 
Replacement Engines, if any, are to be registered in 
accordance with Section 7(a) of this Article, as the case may 
be, (C) furnish the Loan Trustee with a certificate of an 
independent aircraft engineer or appraiser reasonably 
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee certifying that the 
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, have a 
value and utility at least equal to, and, in the case of the 
Airframe, are in as good operating condition as, the Airframe 
and Engines, if any, so replaced, assuming the Airframe and 
Engines were in the condition and repair required by the terms 
hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of 
Loss, (D) furnish the Loan Trustee with (i) such evidence of 
compliance with the insurance provisions of Section 11 of this 
Article with respect to such Replacement Airframe and 
Replacement Engines as the Loan Trustee may reasonably request 
and (ii) a certificate from a Responsible Officer of the 
Company certifying that at the time of such replacement, there 
is no continuing Indenture Event of Default, (E) furnish the 
Loan Trustee with an opinion of the Company's counsel (which 
may be the Company's General Counsel) addressed to the Loan 
Trustee that the substituted property will be subject to the 
Lien of the this Indenture and the Loan Trustee should be 
entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 of the United States 
Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, with respect to the 
Replacement Airframe, provided that (x) such opinion need not 
be delivered to the extent that the benefits of
<PAGE> 153

52

such Section 1110 were not, by reason of a change in law or 
governmental interpretation thereof, available to the Loan 
Trustee with respect to the Aircraft immediately prior to such 
substitution and (y) such opinion may contain qualifications 
of the tenor contained in the opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton 
delivered pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Participation 
Agreement on the Delivery Date. In the case of each 
Replacement Airframe and each Replacement Engine, if any, in 
which a security interest has been granted to the Loan Trustee 
under this Section 10, and each Replacement Engine, if any, in 
which a security interest has been granted to the Loan Trustee 
under this Section 10, promptly upon the recordation of the 
Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement covering such 
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, or such 
Replacement Engine pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act (or 
pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which 
such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, or 
such Replacement Engine, are registered in accordance with 
Section 7(a) of this Article), the Company will cause to be 
delivered to the Loan Trustee a favorable opinion of counsel 
to the Company as to the due recordation of such Trust 
Agreement and Indenture Supplement or other requisite 
documents or instruments and the validity and perfection of 
the security interest in the Replacement Airframe, Replacement 
Engines or Replacement Engine, as the case may be, granted to 
the Loan Trustee under this Indenture.

For all purposes hereof, upon grant of a security 
interest therein to the Loan Trustee, each Replacement 
Aircraft and the Replacement Engines, if any, shall be deemed 
part of the property secured hereunder; each such Replacement 
Airframe shall be deemed an "Airframe" as defined herein, and 
each such Replacement Engine shall be deemed an "Engine" as 
defined herein. Upon full compliance with the terms of the 
previous paragraph, the Loan Trustee shall execute and deliver 
to the Company an appropriate instrument releasing such 
replaced airframe and engines (if any) installed thereon at 
the time such Event of Loss occurred from the Lien of this 
Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the 
Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge 
hereunder.

(b) Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Upon 
the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine 
under circumstances in which there has not occurred an Event 
of Loss with respect to the Airframe, the Company shall give 
the Loan Trustee prompt written notice thereof and shall,
<PAGE> 154

53

within 90 days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, 
convey or cause to be conveyed to the Loan Trustee, as 
replacement for the Engine with respect to which such Event of 
Loss occurred, a security interest in and to a Replacement 
Engine free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted 
Liens) and having a value and utility at least equal to, and 
being in as good operating condition as, the Engine with 
respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, assuming such 
Engine was of the value and utility and in the condition and 
repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior to the 
occurrence of such Event of Loss. Prior to or at the time of 
any such conveyance, the Company, at its own expense, will (i) 
cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement substantially 
in the form of Exhibit C hereto or other requisite documents 
or instruments for such Replacement Engine to be delivered to 
the Loan Trustee for execution and, upon such execution, to be 
filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act or, 
if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of such 
jurisdiction other than the United States of America in which 
the Aircraft is or is to be registered in accordance with 
Section 7(a), as the case may be, (ii) furnish the Loan 
Trustee with a certificate of an aircraft engineer or 
appraiser (who may be an employee of the Company) certifying 
that such Replacement Engine has a value and utility at least 
equal to, and is in as good operating condition as, the Engine 
so replaced, assuming such Engine was in the condition and 
repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior to the 
occurrence of such Event of Loss and (iii) cause a financing 
statement or statements with respect to the Replacement Engine 
or other requisite documents or instruments to be filed in 
such place or places necessary or advisable in order to 
perfect the security interest in the Replacement Engine 
created by or pursuant to this Indenture or, if necessary or 
advisable, pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction 
in which the Aircraft is or is to be registered in accordance 
with Section 7(a), as the case may be, and (iv) furnish the 
Loan Trustee with such evidence of compliance with the 
insurance provisions of Section 11 of this Article with 
respect to such Replacement Engine as the Loan Trustee may 
reasonably request, (v) furnish the Loan Trustee with an 
opinion of the Company's counsel (which may be the Company's 
General Counsel) addressed to the Loan Trustee to the effect 
that such substituted property will be subjected to the Lien 
of this Indenture. Upon full compliance by the Company with 
the terms of this paragraph (b), the Loan Trustee will 
transfer to the Company, without recourse or warranty
<PAGE> 155

(except as to the Trustee's Liens), all of Loan Trustee's 
right, title and interest in and to the Engine with respect to 
which such Event of Loss occurred, and Loan Trustee will 
assign to or as directed by the Company all claims of Loan 
Trustee against third Persons relating to such Engine arising 
from such Event of Loss. In addition, upon such transfer the 
Loan Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Company an 
appropriate instrument releasing such Engine from the Lien of 
this Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the 
Purchase Agreement Assignment (in respect of such Engine) from 
the assignment and pledge under this Indenture. For all 
purposes hereof, each such Replacement Engine shall, after 
such conveyance, be deemed part of the property secured 
hereunder and shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein.

(c) Application of Payments from Governmental 
Authorities for Requisition of Title or Use. Any payments 
(other than insurance proceeds the application of which is 
provided for in Section 11 of this Article) received at any 
time by the Loan Trustee or by the Company from any 
governmental authority or other Person with respect to an 
Event of Loss resulting from the condemnation, confiscation, 
theft or seizure of, or requisition of title to or use of, the 
Airframe or any Engine, other than a requisition for use by 
the United States government, or any other Government not 
constituting an Event of Loss, will be applied as follows:

(i) if such payments are received with respect to 
the Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines 
installed on the Airframe that has been or is being 
replaced by the Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this 
Article, such payments shall be paid over to, or retained 
by, the Loan Trustee, and upon completion of such 
replacement be paid over to, or retained by, the Company;

(ii) if such payments are received with respect to 
the Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines 
installed on the Airframe that has not been and will not 
be replaced pursuant to Section 10(a) of this Article, 
such payments shall, after reimbursement of the Loan 
Trustee for costs and expenses, be applied in reduction of 
the Company's obligation to pay the amounts required to be 
paid by the Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this 
Article, if not already paid by the Company, or, if 
already paid by the Company, shall be applied to reimburse 
the Company for its payment of such amounts, and the 
balance, if any, of such payments remaining
<PAGE> 156

55

thereafter shall be paid over to, and retained by, the 
Company; and

(iii) if such payments are received with respect to an 
Engine under circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b) of 
this Article, so much of such payments remaining after 
reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and expenses 
shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Company; 
provided that the Company shall have fully performed the 
terms of Section 10(b) of this Article with respect to the 
Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

(d) Requisition for Use by the Government of the 
Airframe and the Engines Installed Thereon. In the event of 
the requisition for use by the United States government, or any 
other Government or government (including for this purpose any 
agency or instrumentality thereof), not constituting an Event 
of Loss, including, without limitation, pursuant to the Civil 
Reserve Air Fleet Program referred to in Section 7(b)(iv) of 
this Article of the Airframe and the Engines or engines 
installed on the Airframe, the Company shall promptly notify 
the Loan Trustee of such requisition and, except as otherwise 
provided in this Indenture, such requisition shall not 
constitute an Event of Loss and all of the Company's 
obligations under this Indenture with respect to the Aircraft 
shall continue to the same extent as if such requisition had 
not occurred unless or until such requisition shall constitute 
an Event of Loss. All payments received by the Loan Trustee or 
the Company from the Government or government for the use of 
the Airframe and Engines or engines prior to the occurrence of 
an Event of Loss shall be paid over to, or retained by, the 
Company.

(e) Requisition for Use by the Government of an 
Engine. In the event of the requisition for use by any 
Government (including for this purpose any agency or 
instrumentality thereof) of any Engine (but not the Airframe), 
the Company will replace such Engine hereunder by complying 
with the terms of Section 10(b) of this Article to the same 
extent as if an Event of Loss had occurred with respect to such 
Engine, and any payments received by the Loan Trustee or the 
Company from such Government with respect to such requisition 
shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Company.

(f) Application of Payments During Existence of 
Indenture Event of Default. Any amount referred to in clause 
(i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 10(c), Section 10(d) or
<PAGE> 157

56

Section 10(e) of this Article which is payable to the Company 
shall not be paid to the Company, or if it has been previously 
paid directly to the Company, shall not be retained by the 
Company, if at the time of such payment an Indenture Event of 
Default, or any Payment or Bankruptcy Default, shall have 
occurred and be continuing, but shall be paid to and held by 
the Loan Trustee as security for the obligations of the Company 
under this Indenture, and at such time as there shall not be 
continuing any such Indenture Event of Default or Indenture 
Default, such amount shall be paid to the Company, provided 
that, if any such amount has been so held by the Loan Trustee 
as security for more than 180 days after an Indenture Event of 
Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default shall have occurred 
and during which period (x) the Loan Trustee shall not have 
been limited by operation of law or otherwise from exercising 
remedies hereunder and (y) the Loan Trustee shall not have 
commenced to exercise any remedy available to it under this 
Indenture, then such amount shall be paid to the Company.

Section 11. Insurance. (a) Public Liability and 
Property Damage Insurance. Subject to the rights of the 
Company to establish and maintain self-insurance with respect 
to public liability and property damage liability insurance for 
aircraft and engines (including the Aircraft and Engines) in 
the manner and to the extent specified in the next sentence, 
the Company will carry, or cause to be carried, at no expense 
to the Loan Trustee, the Pass Through Trustee or any Loan 
Participant public liability (including, without limitation, 
contractual liability and passenger legal liability) and 
property damage liability insurance (exclusive of 
manufacturer's product liability insurance) with respect to the 
Aircraft (i) in amounts which are not less than the public 
liability and property damage insurance applicable to similar 
aircraft and engines which comprise the Company's fleet on 
which the Company carries insurance, provided that such 
liability insurance shall not be less than the amount certified 
to the Original Loan Participants on the Delivery Date, (ii) of 
the type usually carried by corporations engaged in the same or 
similar business, similarly situated with the Company, and 
owning or operating similar aircraft and engines and covering 
risks of the kind customarily insured against by the Company, 
and (iii) which is maintained in effect with insurers of 
recognized responsibility. The Company may self-insure, by way 
of deductible or premium adjustment provisions in insurance 
policies, the risks
<PAGE> 158

57

required to be insured against pursuant to the preceding 
sentence, but in no case shall the self-insurance (including 
the self-insurance permitted by Section 11(b) of this Article) 
with respect to all of the aircraft and engines in the 
Company's fleet (including, without limitation, the Aircraft) 
exceed for any 12-month policy year the lesser of (x) 50% of 
the largest replacement value of any single aircraft in the 
Company's fleet or (y) 1-1/2% of the average aggregate 
insurable value (for the preceding year) of all aircraft 
(including, without limitation, the Aircraft) on which the 
Company carries insurance; provided that, in the event that 
there shall have occurred a material adverse change in the 
financial condition of the Company from such condition as is 
reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the 
Company at December 3l, 1982, then, upon not less than 30 days' 
written notice from the Loan Trustee to the Company, the 
Company will, until the Company's financial condition is on an 
overall basis equivalent to its financial condition at 
December 3l, 1982, reduce the self-insurance permitted 
hereunder to such reasonable amount as the Loan Trustee may 
require; provided further that a deductible per occurrence 
utilized to reduce handling that, in the case of the Aircraft, 
is not in excess of the amount customarily allowed as a 
deductible in the industry, shall be permitted in addition to 
the above-mentioned self-insurance. Any policies of insurance 
carried in accordance with this Section 11(a) and any policies 
taken out in substitution or replacement for any of such 
policies (A) shall name the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through 
Trustee as additional insureds as their respective Interests 
may appear, (B) shall provide that in respect of the respective 
Interests of the Loan Trustee and of the Pass Through Trustee 
in such policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any 
action or inaction of the Company and shall insure the Loan 
Trustee's and the Pass Through Trustee's Interests as they 
appear, regardless of any breach or violation of any warranty, 
declaration or condition contained in such policies by the 
Company, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is cancelled 
for any reason whatever, or any substantial change is made in 
the coverage which affects the coverage certified hereunder to 
the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, or if such 
insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premium, such 
cancellation, change or lapse shall not be effective as to the 
Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee for 30 days (seven 
days, or such other period as is customarily obtainable in the 
industry, in the case of any war risk and allied perils 
coverage) after receipt by the Loan Trustee or by the Pass 
Through Trustee, respectively, of written notice
<PAGE> 159

58

from such insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse, (D) 
shall provide that neither the Loan Trustee nor the Pass 
Through Trustee shall have any obligation or liability for 
premiums, commissions, assessments or calls in connection with 
such insurance, (E) shall provide that the insurers shall 
waive (i) any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other 
deduction, whether by attachment or otherwise, which they may 
have against the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee and 
(ii) any rights of subrogation against the Loan Trustee or the 
Pass Through Trustee to the extent that the Company has waived 
its rights by its agreements to indemnify any such party 
pursuant to this Indenture or the Participation Agreement and 
that the exercise by such insurers of rights of subrogation 
derived from rights retained by the Company will not delay 
payment of any claims that would otherwise be payable but for 
the exercise of such rights of subrogation, (F) shall be 
primary without right of contribution from any other insurance 
which may be carried by the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through 
Trustee with respect to its Interest as such in the Aircraft 
and (G) shall expressly provide that all of the provisions 
thereof, except the limits of liability, shall operate in the 
same manner as if there were a separate policy covering each 
insured. "Interests" as used in this Section 11(a) and 
Section 11(b) of this Article with respect to any Person means 
the interests of such Person in its individual capacity, as 
the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, as the case may 
be, in the transactions contemplated by this Indenture and the 
Participation Agreement. The Company shall arrange for 
appropriate certification that the requirements of this 
Section 11(a) have been met to be made to the Loan Trustee 
(and the Loan Trustee may furnish such certificates to the 
Loan Participants) as soon as practicable by each insurer or 
its authorized representative with respect thereto, provided 
that all information contained therein shall be held 
confidential by the Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant and 
shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other 
than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and 
legal counsel and any Person with whom any Loan Participant is 
in good faith conducting negotiations relating to the possible 
transfer and sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes, 
if such Person shall have entered into an agreement similar to 
that contained in this Section 11(a) whereby such Person 
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as 
may be required by an order of any court or administrative 
agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or order of any 
governmental authority. In the case of a lease or contract 
with any
<PAGE> 160

59

Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, or in the 
case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine 
by any Government, a valid agreement to indemnify the Company 
against any of the risks which the Company is required 
hereunder to insure against by such Government shall be 
considered adequate insurance to the extent of the risks and 
in the amounts that are the subject of any such agreement to 
indemnify.

(b) Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Aircraft. 
Subject to the rights of the Company to establish and maintain 
self-insurance with respect to loss or damage to aircraft 
(including the Aircraft) in the manner and to the extent 
specified in the next sentence, the Company shall maintain, or 
cause to be maintained, in effect with insurers of recognized 
responsibility, at no expense to the Loan Trustee or the Pass 
Through Trustee, all-risk aircraft hull insurance covering the 
Aircraft and all-risk coverage with respect to any Engines or 
Parts while removed from the Aircraft (including, without 
limitation, war risk, political risk and allied perils 
insurance if and to the extent the same is maintained by the 
Company or any Permitted Air Carrier leasing the same with 
respect to other aircraft owned or operated by the Company or 
such Permitted Air Carrier, as the case may be, on the same 
routes) which is of the type and in substantially the amount 
usually carried by corporations engaged in the same or similar 
business and similarly situated with the Company; provided 
that (i) such insurance (including the permitted 
self-insurance) shall at all times while the Aircraft is 
subject to the Lien of this Indenture be for an amount not 
less than, at the date of the determination thereof, an amount 
equal to the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment 
Notes plus six months interest thereon and (ii) such insurance 
need not cover an Engine while attached to an airframe not 
owned, leased or operated by the Company. The Company may 
self-insure, by way of deductible or premium adjustment 
provisions in insurance policies, the risks required to be 
insured against pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in no 
case shall the self-insurance (including the self-insurance 
permitted by Section 11(a) of this Article) with respect to 
all of the aircraft and engines in the Company's fleet 
(including, without limitation, the Aircraft) exceed for any 
12-month policy year the lesser of (i) 50% of the largest 
replacement value of any single aircraft in the Company's 
fleet or (ii) l-l/2% of the average aggregate insurable value 
(for the preceding year) of all aircraft (including, without 
limitation, the Aircraft) on which the Company carries
<PAGE> 161

60

insurance; provided that, in the event that there shall have 
occurred a material adverse change in the financial condition 
of the Company from such condition as is reflected in the 
consolidated financial statements of the Company at 
December 31, 1982, then, upon not less than 30 days' written 
notice from the Loan Trustee to the Company, the Company will, 
until the Company's financial condition is on an overall basis 
equivalent to its financial condition at December 3l, 1982, 
reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder to such 
reasonable amount as the Loan Trustee may require; provided, 
further, that a deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce 
handling that, in the case of the Aircraft, is not in excess 
of the amount customarily allowed as a deductible in the 
industry, shall be permitted in addition to the 
above-mentioned self-insurance. Any policies carried in 
accordance with this Section 11(b) and any policies taken out 
in substitution or replacement for any such policies (A) shall 
provide that any loss in excess of $10,000,000, up to the 
amount of the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment 
Notes plus accrued interest thereon, for any loss or damage to 
the Aircraft (or Engines) shall be paid to the Loan Trustee as 
long as this Indenture shall not have been discharged pursuant 
to the terms and conditions thereof, and that all other 
amounts shall be payable to the Company unless the insurer 
shall have received notice that an Indenture Event of Default 
or Payment or Bankruptcy Default exists, in which case all 
insurance proceeds up to amount equal to the Outstanding 
principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest 
thereon payable by the Company shall be payable to the Loan 
Trustee, (B) shall provide that in respect of the respective 
interests of the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee in 
such policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any 
action or inaction of the Company and shall insure the Loan 
Trustee's and the Pass Through Trustee's Interests, as they 
appear, regardless of any breach or violation of any warranty, 
declaration or condition contained in such policies by the 
Company, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is 
cancelled for any reason whatever, or any material change is 
made in the policy which affects the coverage certified 
hereunder to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, or 
if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of 
premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be 
effective as to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee 
for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as may from time 
to time be customarily obtainable in the industry, in the case 
of any war risk, political risk and allied perils coverage)
<PAGE> 162

61

after receipt by the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, 
respectively, of written notice from such insurers of such 
cancellation, change or lapse, (D) shall provide that neither 
the Loan Trustee nor the Pass Through Trustee shall have any 
obligation or liability for premiums, commissions, assessments 
or calls in connection with such insurance, (E) shall provide 
that the insurers shall waive any rights of set-off, 
counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by attachment or 
otherwise, which they may have against the Loan Trustee or the 
Pass Through Trustee and shall be primary without right of 
contribution from any other insurance which may be carried by 
the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee with respect to 
its interests as such in the Aircraft and (F) shall provide 
that the insurers shall waive any rights of subrogation 
against the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee to the 
extent that the Company has waived its rights by its 
agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to this 
Indenture or the Participation Agreement; provided, that the 
exercise by insurers of rights of subrogation derived from 
rights retained by the Company shall not, in any way, delay 
payment of a claim that would otherwise be paid by such 
insurers but for the existence of rights of subrogation 
derived from rights retained by the Company. The Company 
shall arrange for appropriate certification that the 
requirements of this Section 11(b) have been met to be made 
promptly to the Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee may furnish 
such certification to the Loan Participants) by each insurer 
or its authorized representative with respect thereto, 
provided that all information contained therein shall be held 
confidential by the Loan Trustee and each Loan participant and 
shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other 
than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and 
legal counsel and any Person with whom any Loan Participant is 
in good faith conducting negotiations relating to the possible 
transfer and sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes 
if such Person shall have entered into an agreement similar to 
that contained in this Section 11(b) whereby such Person 
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as 
may be required by an order of any court or administrative 
agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or order of any 
governmental authority. In the case of a lease or contract 
with any Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, 
or in the case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or 
any Engine by any Government, a valid agreement to indemnify 
the Company against any of the risks which the Company is 
required hereunder to insure against by such Government in any 
amount up to, at the date of determination
<PAGE> 163

62

thereof, an amout equal to the Outstanding principal amount of 
the Equipment Notes plus six months interest thereon from time 
to time shall be considered adequate insurance to the extent 
of the risks and in the amounts that are the subject of any 
such agreement to indemnify.

(c) Application of Insurance Payments. Between 
the Loan Trustee and the Company it is as agreed that all 
insurance payments received under policies required to be 
maintained by the Company hereunder, exclusive of any payments 
received in excess of the Outstanding principal amount of the 
Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon for the Aircraft 
from such policies, as the result of the occurrence of an 
Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe or an Engine will 
be applied as follows:

(x) if such payments are received with respect to 
the Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines 
installed on the Airframe that has been or is being 
replaced by the Company as contemplated by Section 10(a) 
of this Article, such payments shall be paid over to, or 
retained by, the Loan Trustee, and upon completion of such 
replacement be paid over to, or retained by, the Company;

(y) if such payments are received with respect to 
the Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines 
installed thereon that has not been and will not be 
replaced as contemplated by Section 10(a) of this Article, 
so much of such payments remaining after reimbursement of 
the Loan Trustee for costs and expenses as shall not 
exceed the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment 
Notes plus accrued interest thereon required to be paid by 
the Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this article 
shall be applied in reduction of the Company's obligation 
to pay such amount, if not already paid by the Company, 
or, if already paid by the Company, shall be applied to 
reimburse the Company for its payment of such amount, and 
the balance, if any, of such payment remaining thereafter 
will be paid over to, or retained by, the Company; and

(z) if such payments are received with respect to 
an Engine under the circumstances contemplated by 
Section 10(b) of this Article, so much of such payments 
remaining after reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for 
costs and expenses shall be paid over to, or retained
<PAGE> 164

63

by, the Company; provided that the Company shall have 
fully performed the terms of Section 10(b) of this Article 
with respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments 
are made.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the 
insurance payment of any property damage loss received under 
policies maintained by the Company in excess of the 
Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus 
accrued interest thereon for the Aircraft shall be paid to the 
Company.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the 
insurance payments of any property damage loss received under 
policies required to be maintained hereunder not constituting 
an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe or an Engine 
will be applied in payment (or to reimburse the Company) for 
repairs or for replacement property in accordance with the 
terms of Sections 7 and 8 of this Article, and any balance 
remaining after compliance with such Sections with respect to 
such loss shall be paid to the Company. Any amount referred 
to in the preceding sentence or in clause (x), (y) or (z) of 
the second preceding paragraph which is payable to the Company 
shall not be paid to the Company or, if it has been previously 
paid directly to the Company, shall not be retained by the 
Company, if at the time of such payment an Indenture Event of 
Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default shall have occurred 
and be continuing, but shall be paid to and held by the Loan 
Trustee, as security for the obligations of the Company under 
this Indenture, and at such time as there shall not be 
continuing any such Indenture Event of Default or Payment or 
Bankruptcy Default, such amount shall be paid to the Company, 
provided that if any such amount has been so held by the Loan 
Trustee as security for more than 90 days after such event or 
Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and during 
which period the Loan Trustee shall not have exercised any 
remedy available to it under Section 8 hereof, then such 
amount shall be paid to the Company, unless the Loan Trustee 
shall have been prohibited by operation of law or otherwise 
from exercising such remedies.

(d) Reports, Etc. Annually upon renewal of the 
Company's insurance coverage, the Company will furnish to the 
Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee may furnish such reports to 
the Loan Participants) a report signed by a firm of 
independent aircraft insurance brokers appointed by the 
Company, stating the opinion of such firm that the insurance
<PAGE> 165

64

then carried and maintained on the Aircraft complies with the 
terms hereof; provided that all information contained in such 
report shall be held confidential by the Loan Trustee and each 
Loan Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by 
them to anyone other than their accountants, agents and legal 
counsel and any Person with whom such Loan Participant is in 
good faith conducting negotiations relating to the possible 
transfer and sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes 
if such Person shall have entered into an agreement similar to 
that contained in this Section 11(d) whereby such Person 
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as 
may be required by an order of any court or administrative 
agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or order of any 
governmental authority. The Company will cause such firm to 
advise the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee in 
writing promptly of any default in the payment of any premium 
and of any other act or omission on the part of the Company of 
which such firm has knowledge and which might invalidate or 
render unenforceable, in whole or in part, any insurance on 
the Aircraft. The Company will also cause such firm to advise 
the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee in writing as 
promptly as practicable after such firm acquires knowledge 
that an interruption or reduction of any insurance carried and 
maintained on the Aircraft pursuant to the provisions of this 
Section 11 will occur.

(e) Insurance for Own Account. Nothing in this 
Section 11 shall limit or prohibit the Loan Trustee or the 
Company from obtaining insurance for its own account with 
respect to the Airframe or any Engine and any proceeds payable 
thereunder shall be payable as provided in the insurance 
policy relating thereto, provided that no such insurance may 
be obtained which would limit or otherwise adversely affect 
the coverage or amounts payable under insurance required to be 
maintained pursuant to this Section 11, it being understood 
that all salvage rights to the Airframe or such Engine shall 
remain with the Company's insurers at all times, and provided 
further, that the Loan Trustee may obtain hull insurance on 
the Aircraft only to the extent the procurement of such 
insurance does not have an adverse effect on the Company's 
ability or cost to obtain such insurance.

Section 12. Inspection. At all reasonable times so 
long as any Equipment Notes are outstanding, but upon at least 
10 days' prior written notice to the Company, the Loan Trustee 
or its authorized representatives may at their own
<PAGE> 166

65

expense and risk (including, without limitation, any risk of 
personal injury or death) conduct a visual walk-around 
inspection of the Aircraft and any Engine and may inspect the 
books and records of the Company relating thereto; provided 
that (a) such representative shall be fully insured to the 
reasonable satisfaction of the Company at no cost to the 
Company with respect to any risks incurred in connection with 
any such inspection, (b) any such inspection shall be subject 
to the safety, security and workplace rules applicable at the 
location where such inspection is conducted and any applicable 
governmental rules or regulations and (c) in the case of an 
inspection during a maintenance visit, such inspection shall 
not in any respect interfere with the normal conduct of such 
maintenance visit or extend the time required for such 
maintenance visit. All information obtained in connection 
with any such inspection shall be held confidential by the 
Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant and shall not be 
furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other than their 
accountants, agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom 
any such Loan Participant is in good faith conducting 
negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale of 
such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes or interest in the 
Aircraft if such Person shall have entered into an agreement 
similar to that contained in this Section 12 whereby such 
Person agrees to hold such information confidential, and 
except as may be required by an order of any court or 
administrative agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or 
order of any governmental authority. So long as any Equipment 
Notes remain Outstanding, upon Loan Trustee's request, the 
Company will notify the Loan Trustee of the next scheduled 
"heavy maintenance" check or "C" check to be conducted by the 
Company in respect of the Aircraft; provided that the Company 
shall have the right in its sole discretion to reschedule, or 
change the location of, any maintenance visit of which it 
shall have notified the Loan Trustee pursuant to this 
sentence, the Company hereby agreeing to use reasonable 
efforts to notify the Loan Trustee of any such rescheduling or 
change. The Loan Trustee shall not have any duty to make such 
inspection and shall not incur any liability or obligation by 
reason of not making any such inspection. No inspection 
pursuant to this Section 12 shall interfere with the use, 
operation or maintenance of the Aircraft or the normal conduct 
of the Company's business, and the Company shall not be 
required to undertake or incur any additional liabilities in 
connection therewith.

Section 17. Further Assurances; Financial 
Information. Forthwith upon the execution and delivery of
<PAGE> 167

66

each Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement, the Company 
will cause such Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement to be 
duly filed and recorded in accordance with the Federal 
Aviation Act. In addition, the Company and the Loan Trustee 
will promptly and duly execute and deliver to the other party

Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Owner 
Trustee does hereby constitute the Loan Trustee the true and

shall be valid nevertheless.

<PAGE> 29

23

Owner Trustee specified in Section 2.02(a) and until 
authenticated on behalf of the Loan Trustee by the manual 
signature of the authorized officer or signatory of the Loan 
Trustee as specified in Section 2.02(c). Such signatures shall 
be conclusive evidence that such Equipment Note has been duly 
executed, authenticated and issued under this Agreement.

Section 2.03. Registrar and Paying Agent. The Loan 
Trustee shall maintain an office or agency where the Equipment 
Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for 
exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency where 
(subject to Sections 2.04 and 2.08) the Equipment Notes may be 
presented for payment or for exchange (the "Paying Agent"). 
The Registrar shall keep a register (the "Register") with 
respect to the Equipment Notes and their transfer and exchange 
and the payment of Installment Payment Amounts thereon, if any. 
The Loan Trustee may appoint one or more co-registrars (the 
"Co-Registrars") and one or more additional Paying Agents for 
the Equipment Notes and the Loan Trustee may terminate the 
appointment of any Co-Registrar or Paying Agent at any time 
upon written notice. The term "Registrar" includes any 
Co-Registrar. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional

any authorized denominations or transferred upon surrender of 
the Equipment Notes to be exchanged or

<PAGE> 30

24

transferred at the principal corporate trust office of the Loan 
Trustee, or at any office or agency maintained for such purpose 
pursuant to Section 2.03. Whenever any Equipment Note or 
Equipment Notes are so surrendered, the Owner Trustee shall 
execute, and the Loan Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, 
the replacement Equipment Note or Equipment Notes which the 
Loan Participant or the transferee, as the case may be, is 
entitled to receive.

All Equipment Notes issued upon any registration of 
transfer or exchange of Equipment Notes shall be the valid 
obligations of the Owner Trustee, evidencing the same 
obligations, and entitled to the same security and benefits 
under this Agreement, as the Equipment Notes surrendered upon 
such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Equipment Note presented or surrendered for 
registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by 
the Registrar) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a 
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the 
Registrar duly executed by, the Loan Participant thereof or 
such Loan Participant's attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made to a Loan Participant 
for any registration of transfer or exchange of Equipment 
Notes, but the Registrar may require payment of a sum 
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that 
may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer 
or exchange of Equipment Notes.

The Registrar shall not be required (i) to register 
the transfer of or to exchange any Equipment Note during a 
period beginning at the opening of business 15 Business Days 
before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption (or 
purchase in lieu of redemption) of Equipment Notes pursuant to 
Section 6.01 or 6.02 and ending at the close of business on the 
day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or to 
exchange any Equipment Note called for redemption (or purchase 
in lieu of redemption) pursuant to such Section 6.01 or 6.02.

transferred to any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended 
("ERISA"), or individual retirement account or employee benefit 
plan subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, as 
amended (each an "ERISA Plan") or by any other entity whose 
assets constitute assets of an ERISA Plan. The purchase by a 
Person of any Equipment Note

<PAGE> 31

25

constitutes a representation by such Person to the Company, the 
Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee and the Loan Trustee that 
such Person is not an ERISA Plan and that such Person is not 
acquiring, and has not acquired, such Equipment Notes with 
assets of an ERISA Plan.

Section 2.05. Loan Participant Lists; Ownership of 
Equipment Notes. (a) The Loan Trustee shall preserve in as 
current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent 
list available to it of the names and addresses of Loan

Registrar shall furnish (and the Owner Trustee shall cause the 
Registrar to furnish) to the Loan Trustee semiannually on or 
before each Interest Payment Date, and at such other times as 
the Loan Trustee may request in writing, a list, in such form 
and as of such date as the Loan Trustee may reasonably require, 
containing all the information in the possession or control of 
the Registrar as to the names and addresses of Loan 
Participants.

(b) Ownership of the Equipment Notes shall be proved 
by the Register kept by the Registrar. Prior to due 
presentment for registration of transfer of any Equipment Note, 
the Owner Trustee, the Loan Trustee, the Paying Agent and the 
Registrar shall deem and treat the Person in whose name any 
Equipment Note is registered as the absolute owner of such 
Equipment Note for the purpose of receiving 
payment of principal (including, subject to the provisions 
herein regarding the applicable record dates, Installment 
Payment Amounts) of, premium, if any, and (subject to the 
provisions herein regarding the applicable record dates) 
interest on such Equipment Note and for all other purposes 
whatsoever, whether or not such Equipment Note is overdue, and 
none of the Owner Trustee, the Loan Trustee, the Paying Agent 
or the Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Section 2.06. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen 
Equipment Notes. If any Equipment Note shall become mutilated, 
destroyed, lost or stolen, the Owner Trustee shall, upon the 
written request of the related Loan Participant, issue and 
execute, and the Loan Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, 
in replacement thereof, a new Equipment Note of the same type, 
having the same Maturity Date, payable to the same Loan 
Participant in the same principal amount and dated the same 
date as the Equipment Note so mutilated, destroyed, lost or 
stolen. If the Equipment Note being replaced has become 
mutilated, such

<PAGE> 32

26

Equipment Note shall be surrendered to the Loan Trustee. If 
the Equipment Note being replaced has been destroyed, lost or 
stolen, the related Loan Participant shall furnish to the Owner 
Trustee and the Loan Trustee such security or indemnity as may 
be required by each of them to save the Owner Trustee and the 
Loan Trustee harmless and evidence satisfactory to the Owner 
Trustee and the Loan Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft 
of such Equipment Note and of the ownership thereof.

Section 2.07. Cancellation. The Registrar and any 
Paying Agent shall forward to the Loan Trustee all Equipment 
Notes surrendered to them for replacement, redemption, 
registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Loan 
Trustee shall cancel all Equipment Notes surrendered for 
replacement, redemption, registration or transfer, exchange, 
payment or cancellation and shall destroy cancelled Equipment 
Notes.

Section 2.08. Payment on Equipment Notes; Defaulted 
Interest. (a) The Loan Trustee will arrange directly with any 
Paying Agent for the payment, or the Loan Trustee will make 
payment, all pursuant to Section 2.09, of the principal of, 
premium, if any, and interest on or in respect of the Equipment 
Notes. Payments on the Equipment Notes in respect of interest 
and Installment Payment Amounts, if any, payable on an 
Installment Payment Date, shall be paid in immediately 
available funds in U.S. currency on each Interest Payment Date 
or Installment Payment Date, as the case may be, to the Loan 
Participant in whose name such Equipment Note is registered on 
the Register at the close of business on the relevant Record 
Date; provided, however, that the Paying Agent will, at the 
request of the Loan Trustee, and may, at its option, pay such 
interest or Installment Payment Amounts by check mailed to such 
Loan Participant's address as it appears on the Register. 
Principal of Equipment Notes payable on the Maturity Date of 
such Equipment Note and premium, if any, with respect thereto 
shall be payable only against presentation and surrender 
thereof at the principal corporate trust office of the Loan 
Trustee or at the office of the Paying Agent maintained for 
such purpose pursuant to Section 2.03.

A Loan Participant shall have no further interest in, 
or other right with respect to, the Indenture Estate when and 
if the principal amount of, premium, if any, and interest on 
all Equipment Notes held by such Loan Participant and all other 
sums payable to such Loan Participant hereunder, under such 
Equipment Notes and under the Participation Agreement
<PAGE> 33

27

shall have been paid in full.

(b) Any Installment Payment Amount payable on an 
Installment Payment Date, or any interest payable on an 
Interest Payment Date on any Equipment Note which is not 
punctually paid on, or within 5 days after, such Installment 
Payment Date or such Interest Payment Date, as the case may be 
(herein called, respectively, a "Defaulted Installment" and 
"Defaulted Interest"), shall forthwith cease to be payable to 
the Loan Participant on the relevant Record Date by virtue of 
its having been such Loan Participant; and such Defaulted 
Installment or Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Loan 
Trustee, at its election in each case, as provided in clause 
(1) or (2) below:

(1) The Loan Trustee may elect to make payment of any 
Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest to the Person 
in whose name such Equipment Note is registered at the 
close of business on a special record date for the payment 
of such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest, which 
shall be fixed in the following manner. The Loan Trustee 
shall notify the Paying Agent in writing of the amount of 
the Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest proposed to 
be paid on each such Equipment Note and the date of the 
proposed payment, and at the same time the Loan Trustee 
shall make arrangements to set aside an amount of money 
equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in 
respect of such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted 
Interest, prior to the date of the proposed payment, to be 
held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to 
such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest as this 
clause provides and shall fix a special record date for the 
payment of such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest 
which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 
days prior to the date of the proposed payment. The Loan 
Trustee shall promptly notify the Owner Trustee and the 
Registrar of such special record date and shall cause 
notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted 
Installment or Defaulted Interest and the special record 
date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to 
each Loan Participant entitled thereto at such Loan 
Participant's address as it appears in the Register, not 
less than 10 days prior to such special record date.

date therefor having been mailed, as aforesaid, such 
Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest shall be paid 
to the
<PAGE> 34

28

Persons in whose names the applicable Equipment Note are 
registered on such special record date and shall no longer 
be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).

(2) The Loan Trustee may make, or cause to be made, 
payment of any Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest 
in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the 
requirements of any securities exchange on which Equipment 
Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be 
required by such exchange, if such payment shall be deemed 
practicable by the Loan Trustee.

(c) The Loan Trustee shall require each Paying Agent 
to agree in writing that such Paying Agent will hold in trust, 
for the benefit of the Loan Participants and the Loan Trustee, 
all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal 
of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Equipment Notes 
payable to the Loan Participants hereunder, and shall give to 
the Loan Trustee notice of any default by any obligor upon the 
Equipment Notes in the making of any such payment upon the

Upon so doing the Paying Agent shall have no further liability 
for the money so paid.

Indenture Estate for the payment of such amounts, to the extent 
available for distribution to it as herein provided, and (b) 
none of the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant or the Loan 
Trustee is or shall be personally liable to any Loan 
Participant for any amount payable under such Equipment Note or 
this Agreement or, except as expressly provided in this 
Agreement in the case of the Owner Trustee and the Loan 
Trustee, for any liability thereunder or hereunder.

Agreement solely as Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement and 
not in its individual capacity, and in no case whatsoever shall

reasonably satisfactory to it that the insurance provisions 
of the Lease will have been complied with after giving

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or 
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors 
generally and by general principles of equity, and

contained in the fifth paragraph of the Habendum Clause or 
Sections 4.01(d) and 4.01(e) if, but only if, such failure 
is not remedied within a period of 30 days after there has 
been given to the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant 
by registered or certified mail, a written notice 
specifying such failure and requiring it to be remedied and 
stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" 
hereunder, by the Loan Trustee or by the Loan Participants 
owning at least 25% in principal amount of Outstanding 
Equipment Notes; or

(c) any failure by the Owner Participant or the Owner 
Trustee, in its individual capacity, to observe or perform 
any of its respective covenants in Section 9(b), 9(c), 9(d) 
or 16(c) of the Participation Agreement; or

(d) any failure by the Owner Trustee, in its 
individual capacity or as Owner Trustee, to observe or 
perform any other covenant or obligation of the Owner 
Trustee contained in this Agreement, in the Participation 
Agreement or any failure by the Owner Participant to 
observe or perform any other covenant or obligation of the 
Owner Participant contained in the Participation Agreement 
which failure, in any case and either individually or 
together with other then existing failures, shall have a 
material adverse effect on the rights and interests of the 
Loan Participants and is not remedied within a period of 30 
days after there has been given to the Owner Trustee and 
the Owner Participant by registered or certified mail, a 
written notice specifying such failure and requiring it to 
be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of 
Default" hereunder, by the Loan Trustee or by Loan 
Participants owning at least 25% in principal amount of 
Outstanding Equipment Notes; (provided that if such failure 
is capable of being remedied, no such failure shall 
constitute an Indenture Event of Default hereunder for such 
longer period (not to exceed 180 days) during which the 
Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant, as the case may be, 
is diligently proceeding to remedy such failure and 
provided further that the Owner Trustee or the Owner 
Participant, as the

case may be, shall have provided to the Loan Trustee 
adequate assurances of performance within such period); or

(e) any representation or warranty made by the Owner 
Participant, the Owner Trustee, in its individual capacity 
or as Owner Trustee, or the Owner Participant Guarantor 
herein, in the Participation Agreement, in the Refunding 
Agreement, or in the Owner Participant Guaranty shall prove 
at any time to have been false or incorrect when made and 
was and is in any respect materially adverse to the rights 
and interests of the Loan Participants; and if such 
misrepresentation and its consequences are capable of being 
corrected as of a subsequent date and if such correction is 
being sought diligently, such misrepresentation and its 
consequences shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 
days after there has been given to the Owner Trustee and 
the Owner Participant by registered or certified mail a 
written notice specifying such incorrectness and requiring 
it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice 
of Default" hereunder by the Loan Trustee or by Loan 
Participants owning at least 25% in principal amount of 
Outstanding Equipment Notes; or

(f) subject to Section 8.03(e)(1), any Lease Event of 
Default (other than any such Lease Event of Default in 
respect of any Excepted Property); provided that any Lease 
Event of Default shall be deemed to exist and continue so 
long as, but only so long as, it shall not be remedied; or

(g) either the Trust Estate or the Owner Trustee with 
respect thereto (and not in its individual capacity), the 
Owner Participant or the Owner Participant Guarantor, as 
the case may be, shall (i) file, or consent by answer or 
otherwise to the filing against it of a petition for relief 
or reorganization or arrangement or any other petition in 
bankruptcy, for liquidation or to take advantage of any

the case may be, a custodian, receiver, trustee or other 
officer with similar powers with respect to it or with 
respect to any substantial part of its property, or 
constituting an order for relief or approving a petition 
for relief or reorganization or any other petition in 
bankruptcy or for liquidation or to take advantage of any 
bankruptcy or insolvency law of any jurisdiction, or 
ordering the dissolution, winding-up or liquidation of the 
Trust Estate or the Owner Trustee with respect thereto (and 
not in its individual capacity), the Owner Participant, or 
the Owner Participant Guarantor, as the case may be, and 
any such order or petition is not dismissed or stayed 
within 90 days after the earlier of the entering of any 
such order or the approval of any such petition; or

(i) any Lessor's Lien required to be discharged by 
the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee, in its 
individual capacity, pursuant to Section 16(b) of the 
Participation Agreement (in the case of the Owner 
Participant) or Section 9(c) of the Participation Agreement

President in the Corporate Trust Department (with respect 
to a Lessor's Lien attributable to the Owner Trustee) or an 
officer of the Owner Participant who has responsibility 
for, or familiarity with, the transactions contemplated by 
the Operative Documents or any Vice President of the Owner 
Participant (with respect to a Lessor's Lien attributable 
to the Owner Participant) shall have actual knowledge of 
such Lien; or 

(j) at any time when the Aircraft is registered under 
the laws of a country other than the United States of 
America, as a result of the gross negligence or wilful 
misconduct of the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant, 
the Lien of this Agreement shall cease to constitute a 
valid and duly perfected Lien on the Indenture Estate 
(other than pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of 
Section 10.01); or

(k) any Owner Participant Guaranty ceases to be a

valid and enforceable obligation of the Owner Participant 
Guarantor or otherwise shall not be in full force and 
effect.

Section 8.02. Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment. 
If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the 
Loan Trustee, by notice to the Company, the Owner Participant 
and the Owner Trustee, or Loan Participants owning at least 25% 
in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Equipment Notes by 
notice to the Company, the Loan Trustee, the Owner Trustee and 
the Owner Participant, may declare the principal of all the 
Equipment Notes to be due and payable. Upon such declaration, 
the principal of all Equipment Notes, together with accrued 
interest thereon from the date in respect of which interest was 
last paid hereunder to the date payment of such principal has 
been made or duly provided for, shall be immediately due and 
payable. At any time after such declaration and prior to the 
sale or disposition of the Indenture Estate, Loan Participants 
owning a majority in aggregate principal amount of all of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes, by notice to the Loan Trustee, the 
Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant, may rescind such a 
declaration and thereby annul its consequences if (i) an amount 
sufficient to pay all principal of, premium, if any, and 
interest on, such Equipment Notes, to the extent each such 
amount is due or past due, if any, in respect of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes other than by reason of such 
acceleration and all sums due and payable to the Loan Trustee 
has been deposited with the Loan Trustee, (ii) the rescission 
would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (iii) all 
existing Indenture Defaults and Indenture Events of Default 
under this Agreement have been cured or waived except 
nonpayment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 
Equipment Notes that has become due solely because of such 
acceleration. No premium shall be payable on the Equipment 
Notes as a result of the acceleration of the Equipment Notes.

Section 8.03. Other Remedies Available to Loan 
Trustee. (a) After an Indenture Event of Default shall have 
occurred and so long as such Indenture Event of Default shall 
be continuing, then and in every such case the Loan Trustee, as 
trustee of an express trust and as assignee hereunder of the 
Lease or as holder of a security interest in the Aircraft, 
Airframe or Engines or otherwise, may, and when required 
pursuant to the provisions of Article 9 shall, exercise subject 
to Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 8.03(h), upon ten 
(10) Business days prior notice to the Owner Trustee and the 
Owner Participant (if not precluded by
<PAGE> 55

49

law or otherwise) any or all of the rights and powers and 
pursue any and all of the remedies accorded to the Owner 
Trustee pursuant to this Article 8 (and in the event that such 
Indenture Event of Default is also a Lease Event of Default, 
pursuant to Section 15 of the Lease), may recover judgment in 
its own name as Loan Trustee against the Indenture Estate and 
may take possession of all or any part of the Indenture Estate 
and may exclude the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant and 
all persons claiming under any of them wholly or partly.

(b) After an Indenture Event of Default shall have 
occurred and so long as such Indenture Event of Default shall 
be continuing, subject to Sections 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 
8.03(h), the Loan Trustee may, if at the time such action may 
be lawful and always subject to compliance with any mandatory 
legal requirements, either with or without taking possession, 
and either before or after taking possession, and without 
instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, and having first 
given notice of such sale by registered mail to the Owner 
Trustee, the Owner Participant and the Company once at least 10 
Business Days prior to the date of such sale, and any other 
notice which may be required by law, sell and dispose of the 
Indenture Estate, or any part thereof, or interest therein, at 
public auction to the highest bidder, in one lot as an entirety 
or in separate lots, and either for cash or on credit and on 
such terms as the Loan Trustee may determine, and at any place 
(whether or not it be the location of the Indenture Estate or 
any part thereof) and time designated in the notice above 
referred to; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any 
provision herein to the contrary, the Loan Trustee may not 
provide the notice provided for above of its intention to sell 
any of the Indenture Estate, exercise remedies under the Lease 
or exercise other remedies against the Indenture Estate, in 
each case seeking to deprive the Owner Participant of its 
interest therein unless a declaration of acceleration has been 
made pursuant to Section 8.02. Any such sale or sales may be 
adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and 
place appointed for such sale or sales, or by announcement at 
the time and place appointed for any such adjourned sale or 
sales, without further notice, and the Loan Trustee and any 
Loan Participant may bid and become the purchaser at any such 
sale. The Loan Trustee may exercise such right without 
possession or production of the Equipment Notes or proof of 
ownership thereof, and as representative of the Loan 
Participants may exercise such right without notice to the Loan 
Participants or including the Loan Participants as parties to 
any suit or proceeding relating to foreclosure of
<PAGE> 56

50

any property in the Indenture Estate. The Owner Trustee hereby 
irrevocably constitutes the Loan Trustee the true and lawful 
attorney-in-fact of the Owner Trustee (in the name of the Owner 
Trustee or otherwise) for the purpose of effectuating any sale, 
assignment, transfer or delivery for enforcement of the lien 
created under this Agreement, whether pursuant to foreclosure 
or power of sale or otherwise, to execute and deliver all such 
bills of sale, assignments and other instruments as the Loan 
Trustee may consider necessary or appropriate, with full power 
of substitution, the Owner Trustee hereby ratifying and 
confirming all that such attorney or any substitute shall 
lawfully do by virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested by 
the Loan Trustee or any purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall 
ratify and confirm any such sale, assignment, transfer or 
delivery, by executing and delivering to the Loan Trustee or 
such purchaser all bills of sale, assignments, releases and 
other proper instruments to effect such ratification and 
confirmation as may be designated in any such request.

(c) Subject to Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 
8.03(h), if an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, the Owner Trustee shall, at the request of the Loan 
Trustee, promptly execute and deliver to the Loan Trustee such 
instruments of title or other documents as the Loan Trustee may 
deem necessary or advisable to enable the Loan Trustee or an 
agent or representative designated by the Loan Trustee, at such 
time or times and place or places as the Loan Trustee may 
specify, to obtain possession of all or any part of the 
Indenture Estate. If the Owner Trustee shall for any reason 
fail to execute and deliver such instruments and documents 
after such request by the Loan Trustee, the Loan Trustee shall 
be entitled to a judgment for specific performance of the 
covenants contained in the foregoing sentence, conferring upon 
the Loan Trustee the right to immediate possession and 
requiring the Owner Trustee or the Company or both to execute 
and deliver such instruments and documents to the Loan Trustee. 
The Loan Trustee shall also be entitled to pursue all or any 
part of the Indenture Estate wherever it may be found and may 
enter any of the premises of the Owner Trustee or any other 
Person wherever the Indenture Estate may be or be supposed to 
be and search for the Indenture Estate and take possession of 
any item of the Indenture Estate pursuant to this Section 
8.03(c). The Loan Trustee may, from time to time, at the 
expense of the Indenture Estate, make all such expenditures for 
maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, 
additions and improvements to and of the Indenture Estate, as 
it may deem proper. In each such case, the Loan Trustee shall 
have the
<PAGE> 57

51

right to use, operate, store, lease, control or manage the 
Indenture Estate, and to exercise all rights and powers of the 
Owner Trustee relating to the Indenture Estate as the Loan 
Trustee shall deem appropriate, including the right to enter 
into any and all such agreements with respect to the use, 
operation, storage, leasing, control or management of the 
Indenture Estate or any part thereof; and the Loan Trustee 
shall be entitled to collect and receive directly all tolls, 
rents (including Rent), issues, profits, products, revenues and 
other income of the Indenture Estate and every part thereof, 
without prejudice, however, to the right of the Loan Trustee 
under any provision of this Agreement to collect and receive 
all cash held by, or required to be deposited with, the Loan 
Trustee hereunder. In accordance with the terms of this 
Section 8.03(c), such tolls, rents (including Rent), issues, 
profits, products, revenues and other income shall be applied 
to pay the expenses of using, operating, storing, leasing, 
controlling or managing the Indenture Estate, and of all 
maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, 
additions and improvements, and to make all payments which the 
Loan Trustee may be required or may elect to make, if any, for 
taxes, assessments, insurance or other proper charges upon the 
Indenture Estate or any part thereof (including the employment 
of engineers and accountants to examine, inspect and make 
reports upon the properties and books and records of the Owner 
Trustee and, to the extent permitted by the Lease, the 
Company), and all other payments which the Loan Trustee may be 
required or authorized to make under any provision of this 
Agreement, including this Section 8.03(c), as well as just and 
reasonable compensation for the services of the Loan Trustee, 
and of all persons properly engaged and employed by the Loan 
Trustee.

If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is 
continuing and the Loan Trustee shall have obtained possession 
of or title to the Aircraft, the Loan Trustee shall not be 
obligated to use or operate the Aircraft or cause the Aircraft 
to be used or operated directly or indirectly by itself or 
through agents or other representatives or to lease, license or 
otherwise permit or provide for the use or operation of the 
Aircraft by any other Person unless (i) the Loan Trustee shall 
have been able to obtain insurance in kinds, at rates and in 
amounts satisfactory to it in its discretion to protect the 
Indenture Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and 
individually, against any and all liability for loss or damage 
to the Aircraft and for public liability and property damage
<PAGE> 58

52

resulting from use or operation of the Aircraft and (ii) funds 
are available in the Indenture Estate to pay for all such 
insurance or, in lieu of such insurance, the Loan Trustee is 
furnished with indemnification from the Loan Participants or 
any other Person upon terms and in amounts satisfactory to the 
Loan Trustee in its discretion to protect the Indenture Estate 
and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and individually, against any 
and all such liabilities.

(d) Subject to Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 
8.03(h), the Loan Trustee may proceed to protect and enforce 
this Agreement and the Equipment Notes by suit or suits or 
proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy, and whether for 
the specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein 
contained or in execution or aid of any power herein granted, 
or for foreclosure hereunder, or for the appointment of a 
receiver or receivers for the Indenture Estate or any part 
thereof, or for the recovery of judgment for the indebtedness 
secured by the Lien created under this Agreement or for the 
enforcement of any other proper, legal or equitable remedy 
available under applicable law.

(e) (i) If the Company shall fail to make any 
payment of Basic Rent under the Lease when the same shall 
become due, and if such failure of the Company to make such 
payment of Basic Rent shall not constitute the fourth or 
subsequent consecutive such failure or the seventh or 
subsequent cumulative such failure, then as long as no 
Indenture Event of Default (other than arising from a Lease 
Event of Default) shall have occurred and be continuing, the 
Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee may (but need not) pay 
to the Loan Trustee, at any time prior to the day which is the 
thirtieth day subsequent to notice of such failure by the Loan 
Trustee to the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant (and the 
Loan Trustee shall not (without the prior written consent of 
the Owner Trustee) declare the Lease in default pursuant to 
Section 15 thereof or exercise any of the rights, powers or 
remedies pursuant to such Section 15 or this Article 8 prior to 
the occurrence of such date), an amount equal to the full 
amount of such payment of Basic Rent, together with any 
interest due thereon on account of the delayed payment thereof 
to the date of such payment (without regard to any 
acceleration), and such payment by the Owner Participant or the 
Owner Trustee shall be deemed to cure as of the date of such 
payment any Indenture Event of Default which arose from such 
failure of the Company (including any Lease Event of Default 
arising from the Company's failure to pay interest in respect 
of such overdue Basic Rent for the
<PAGE> 59

53

period commencing on the date of such payment), but such cure 
shall not relieve the Company of any of its obligations. If 
the Company shall fail to perform or observe any covenant, 
condition or agreement to be performed or observed by it under 
the Lease other than the payment of Basic Rent, and if (but 
only if) the performance or observance thereof can be effected 
by the payment of money alone (it being understood that actions 
such as the obtaining of insurance and the procurement of 
maintenance services can be so effected), then as long as no 
other Indenture Event of Default (other than those arising from 
a Lease Event of Default) shall have occurred and be 
continuing, the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee may (but 
need not) pay to the Loan Trustee (or to such other person as 
may be entitled to receive the same), at any time prior to the 
day which is the thirtieth day subsequent to notice of such 
failure by the Loan Trustee to the Owner Trustee or the Owner 
Participant (or such longer period ending on the second day 
after the expiry of the applicable grace period specified in 
the Lease with respect to such default) (and the Loan Trustee 
shall not (without the prior written consent of the Owner 
Trustee) declare the Lease in default pursuant to Section 15 
thereof or exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies 
pursuant to such Section 15 or this Article 8 prior to the 
occurrence of such date), all sums necessary to effect the 
performance or observance of such covenant or agreement of the 
Company, together with any interest due thereon on account of 
the delayed payment thereof to the date of such payment, and 
such payment by the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee 
shall be deemed to cure as of the date of such payment any 
Indenture Event of Default which arose from such failure of the 
Company (including any Lease Event of Default arising from the 
Company's failure to pay interest in respect of such overdue 
payment for the period commencing on the date of such payment), 
but such cure shall not relieve the Company of any of its 
obligations. Upon any payment of Basic Rent by the Owner 
Participant or the Owner Trustee in accordance with the first 
sentence of this Section 8.03(e)(i), or upon any payment of any 
other sums by the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee in 
accordance with the second sentence of this Section 8.03(e)(i), 
then any declaration pursuant to Section 15 of the Lease that 
the Lease is in default, and any declaration pursuant to this 
Indenture that the Equipment Notes are due and payable or that 
an Indenture Event of Default exists, based upon such Lease 
Event of Default, shall be deemed rescinded, and the Owner 
Participant or the Owner Trustee shall, to the extent of their 
respective payments, be subrogated, in the case of any such 
payment in accordance
<PAGE> 60

54

with such first sentence, to the rights of the Loan Trustee, as 
assignee hereunder of the Owner Trustee, or, in the case of any 
such payment in accordance with such second sentence, to the 
rights of the Loan Trustee or such other person, as the case 
may be, which actually received such payment, to receive such 
payment of Basic Rent or such other payment, as the case may be 
(and any interest due thereon on account of the delayed payment 
thereof), and shall be entitled to receive such payment upon 
its receipt by the Loan Trustee or such other person, as 
aforesaid (but in each case only if all amounts of principal 
of, and interest at the time due and payable on, the Equipment 
Notes together with interest due thereon on account of the 
delayed payment thereof shall have been paid in full); provided 
that neither the Owner Participant nor the Owner Trustee shall 
attempt to recover any such amount paid by it on behalf of the 
Company pursuant to this Section 8.03(e)(i) except by demanding 
of the Company payment of such amount or by commencing an 
action against the Company to require the payment of such 
amount.

(ii) At any time (a) one or more Lease Events of 
Default shall have occurred and shall have continued for a 
period of 180 days or more or (b) the Equipment Notes shall 
have been accelerated pursuant to Section 8.02, the Owner 
Trustee or the Owner Participant may, at its option, give at 
least 30 days' prior irrevocable notice to the Loan Trustee 
that it will redeem (or purchase in lieu of redemption) all 
Equipment Notes then Outstanding, which redemption or purchase 
shall be pursuant to Section 6.02 and concurrently with such 
notice, the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant will deposit 
with the Loan Trustee an amount sufficient to redeem or 
purchase at the applicable Redemption Price determined 
consistently with the applicable provisions of Article 6 all 
Equipment Notes then Outstanding and to pay the Loan Trustee 
all amounts then due it hereunder, which funds shall be held by 
the Loan Trustee as provided in Section 9.03. Upon the giving 
of such notice and the receipt by the Loan Trustee of such 
deposit, the Loan Trustee shall deem all instructions received 
from the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant as having been 
given by the Loan Participants of 100% of the Outstanding 
principal amount of Equipment Notes for all purposes of this 
Indenture. If such notice is given, the Owner Trustee further 
agrees that it will, if necessary, deposit or cause to be 
deposited with the Loan Trustee, on or prior to the Business 
Day preceding the applicable Redemption Date, whether or not an 
Indenture Event of Default is then continuing, additional funds 
sufficient, when added to the funds already held by the Loan 
Trustee for such purpose, to
<PAGE> 61

55

redeem or purchase at the applicable Redemption Price on such 
Redemption Date all Equipment Notes then Outstanding and to pay 
the Loan Trustee all amounts then due it hereunder. No premium 
on the Equipment Notes shall be payable by the Owner Trustee in 
connection with the redemption or the purchase of Equipment 
Notes pursuant to this Section. Upon the payment of all 
amounts by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant pursuant 
to this Section, the Loan Trustee shall transfer the Equipment 
Notes to the Owner Trustee.

(iii) It is further agreed and understood that if the 
Loan Trustee shall proceed to foreclose the Lien of this 
Agreement, it shall substantially simultaneously therewith, to 
the extent the Loan Trustee is then entitled to do so hereunder 
and under the Lease, and is not then stayed or otherwise 
prevented from doing so by operation of law, proceed (to the 
extent it has not already done so) to exercise one or more 
comparable or consistent remedies referred to in Section 15 of 
the Lease (but in any case, the exercise of such remedies shall 
be commercially reasonable); provided, that, if the Loan 
Trustee is stayed or otherwise prevented from exercising one or 
more of the remedies referred to in Section 15 of the Lease, 
the Loan Trustee shall not, if and so long as such stay or 
other prohibition shall remain in effect, foreclose the Lien of 
this Agreement (A) for a period of 60 days after the date of 
the order for relief in a chapter 11 case of the Company under 
the Bankruptcy Code unless the Company elects to return the 
Aircraft or to permit the repossession of the Aircraft before 
the expiration of such 60-day period and the Loan Trustee 
actually repossesses the Aircraft; (B) for so long as the 
Company has agreed with the approval of the relevant court to 
perform the Lease in compliance with the requirements of 
Section 1110(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and so long after such 
agreement as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing that relates to the performance of the Lease (other 
than an Event of Default set forth in Section 14(g), (h) or (i) 
of the Lease), provided that no such Event of Default shall be 
deemed to occur earlier than the expiration of the 30-day 
period referred to in Section 1110(a)(2)(B)(i) of the 
Bankruptcy Code, as such period may be extended with the 
approval, if required, of the Loan Trustee; (C) for so long as 
the 60-day period specified in Section 1110(b) of the 
Bankruptcy Code is extended pursuant to Section 1110(b) of the 
Bankruptcy Code with the consent of the Loan Trustee; (D) for 
such longer period of time after the expiration of the 60-day 
period referred to in, and as extended pursuant to, the 
preceding clause (C) (the "Period") that the issue of
<PAGE> 62

56

the applicability of Section 1110 to the Aircraft and Lease is 
being disputed by the Company or the Owner Trustee or is 
subject to judicial determination or pending appeal, provided 
that such longer period of time shall not extend beyond 6 
months after the Period unless there shall not be continuing 
any default by the Company in the payment of Basic Rent, other 
than a default as to which the 30-day period referred to in, 
and as extended pursuant to, the preceding clause (B) has not 
expired (it being understood that if the Owner Trustee or the 
Owner Participant cures any such default, such cure shall not 
be considered an exercise of Lessor's cure rights for purposes 
of determining the number of cures permitted under Section 
8.03(e)(i) hereof); or (E) from and after the Company's 
assumption with the approval of the relevant court of the Lease 
pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and so long 
after such assumption as no Event of Default shall have 
occurred and be continuing that relates to the performance of 
the Lease (other than an Event of Default set forth in Section 
l4(g), (h) or (i) of the Lease), and other than a default as to 
which the 30-day period referred to in, and as extended 
pursuant to, the preceding clause (B) has not expired; 
provided, however, that if such assumption is in connection 
with an assignment of the Company's interest in the Lease 
pursuant to Section 365(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, this clause 
(E) shall have no effect unless the Loan Trustee has agreed 
that it has received adequate assurance of future performance 
as set forth in Section 365(f)(2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. 
For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly understood and 
agreed that, subject to the immediately preceding sentence, the 
above-described inability of the Loan Trustee to exercise any 
right or remedy under the Lease shall in no event and under no 
circumstances prevent the Loan Trustee from exercising all of 
its rights, powers and remedies under this Agreement, 
including, without limitation, this Article 8. References in 
this subsection (iii) to particular sections of the Bankruptcy 
Code as in effect on the date of the amendment and restatement 
of this Indenture shall include any substantially similar 
successor provisions.

(f) The Owner Trustee and the Loan Trustee 
acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any provision of 
this Agreement to the contrary, including, without limitation, 
the Granting Clause, Section 4.01 and Article 8, as long as no 
Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, 
neither the Loan Trustee nor the Owner Trustee shall take any 
action contrary to, or disturb the Company's rights under, the 
Lease, including, without limitation, (x)
<PAGE> 63

the right to receive all monies due and payable to it in 
accordance with the provisions of the Lease and (y) the 
Company's rights to possession and use of, and to quiet 
enjoyment of, the Aircraft.

(g) Each and every right, power and remedy herein 
given to the Loan Trustee specifically or otherwise in this 
Agreement shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every 
other right, power and remedy herein specifically given or now 
or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute, and each 
and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein 
given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time 
and as often in such order as may be deemed expedient by the 
Loan Trustee, and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise 
of any power or remedy shall not be construed to be a waiver of 
the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other 
right, power or remedy. No delay or omission by the Loan 
Trustee in the exercise of any right, remedy or power or in 
pursuing any remedy shall impair any such right, power or 
remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default on the 
part of the Owner Trustee or the Company or to be an 
acquiescence therein.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, so 
long as the Pass Through Trustee is the registered holder of 
any Equipment Note hereunder, the Loan Trustee is not 
authorized or empowered to acquire title to all or any portion 
of the Indenture Estate (including the property subject to the 
Lien of this Indenture) or take any action with respect to all 
or any portion of the Indenture Estate (including the property 
subject to the Lien of this Indenture) so acquired by it if 
such acquisition or action would cause any Pass Through Trust 
to fail to qualify as a "grantor trust" for federal income tax 
purposes.

Section 8.04. Waiver of Owner Trustee. A delay or 
omission by the Loan Trustee or any Loan Participant in 
exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Indenture Event 
of Default under this Agreement shall not impair the right or 
remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in such 
Indenture Event of Default.

Section 8.05. Waiver of Existing Defaults. The Loan 
Participants owning a majority in aggregate principal amount 
of the Outstanding Equipment Notes by notice to the Loan 
Trustee may waive on behalf of the Loan Participants an 
existing Indenture Default or Indenture Event of Default and 
its consequences except (i) an Indenture Default or Indenture 
Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or

interest on, any Equipment Note or (ii) in respect of a 
covenant or provision hereof that pursuant to Section 11.02 
cannot be amended or modified without the consent of each Loan 
Participant affected thereby.

Section 8.06. Control by Majority. Loan Participants 
owning a majority in aggregate unpaid principal amount of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes may direct the time, method and 
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to 
the Loan Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on 
it by this Agreement. However, the Loan Trustee may refuse to 
follow any direction that conflicts with law, the Lease or this 
Agreement, that is unduly prejudicial to the rights of the Loan 
Participants so affected, or that would subject the Loan 
Trustee to personal liability.

Section 8.07. Limitation on Suits by Loan 
Participants. A Loan Participant may pursue a remedy under 
this Agreement or under an Equipment Note only if:

(1) the Loan Participant gives to the Loan Trustee 
written notice of a continuing Indenture Event of Default 
under this Agreement;

(2) Loan Participants owning at least 25% in 
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Equipment 
Notes make a written request to the Loan Trustee to pursue 
the remedy;

(3) such Loan Participant or Loan Participants offer 
to the Loan Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Loan 
Trustee against any loss, liability or expense to be, or 
which may be, incurred by the Loan Trustee in pursuing the 
remedy;

(4) the Loan Trustee does not comply with the request 
within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer 
of indemnity; and

(5) during such 60-day period, Loan Participants 
owning a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes do not give the Loan Trustee a 
direction inconsistent with the request.

A Loan Participant may not use this Agreement to 
prejudice the rights of another Loan Participant or to obtain a 
preference or priority over another Loan Participant.

Section 8.08. Rights of Loan Participants to Receive 
Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Agreement, the right of any Loan Participant to receive payment 
of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on an 
Equipment Note on or after the respective due dates expressed 
in such Equipment Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of 
any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not 
be impaired or affected without the consent of such Loan 
Participant.

the owner or pledgee of Equipment Notes and may otherwise deal 
with the Owner Trustee, the Company or an Affiliate of the

held pursuant to Section 25 of the Lease or (ii) amounts held 
under Section 6.01(b)(1) in connection with termination of the 
Lease pursuant to Section 9(a) of the Lease, at any time and

reinvested in Permitted Investments as specified in such 
request (if such investments are reasonably available for

Trustee, as agent of the Owner Trustee, shall upon demand pay

upon maturity, sale or other disposition of any Permitted 
Investment made pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be held as 
part of the Indenture Estate and shall be applied by the Loan

same manner as the amounts in respect of which such income, 
profit, interest, dividend or gain was realized are required to 
be distributed in accordance with the provisions hereof or of 
the Lease pursuant to which such amounts were required to be 
held.

continuing and if it is actually known to a Responsible Officer

written notice thereof to the Company, the Owner Trustee and 
the Owner Participant and (ii) within 90 days after it occurs, 
mail to each Loan Participant notice of all uncured Indenture 
Events of Default under this Agreement. Except in the case of a 
default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or 
interest on any Equipment Note, the Loan Trustee shall be 
protected in withholding the notice required under clause (ii) 
above if and so long as the executive committee or trust 
committee of directors of the Loan Trustee and/or Responsible 
Officers thereof in good faith determines that withholding such 
notice is in the interest of the Loan Participants. In 
addition, if an Indenture Default occurs and is continuing and 
if it is actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Loan 
Trustee, the Loan Trustee shall promptly send written notice 
thereof to the Company, the Owner Trustee and the Owner 
Participant; provided that, with respect to any payment

agent appointed in accordance with Section 9.01(c)) and (iii) 
indemnification against any loss or liability incurred by it 
arising out of or in connection with its acceptance or 
administration of the trust or trusts hereunder except (A) as 
such expenses or loss or liability might result from the 
negligence or willful misconduct of the Loan Trustee or the 
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Loan 
Trustee in its individual capacity in Section 9 of the 
Refunding Agreement, (B) as otherwise provided in Section 9.09 
and (C) as otherwise excluded by the terms of Sections 7(b) and 
7(c) of the Participation Agreement from the Company's 
indemnities under said Sections; provided that, so long as the 
Lease is in effect, the Loan Trustee shall not make any claim 
under this Section 9.05 for any claim or expense indemnified 
against by the Company under the Participation Agreement 
without first making demand on
<PAGE> 70

64

the Company for payment of such claim or expense. The Loan 
Trustee shall notify the Owner Trustee and the Company promptly 
of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Owner 
Trustee shall have the right to defend the claim and the Loan 
Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Loan Trustee may 
have separate counsel and the Owner Trustee, subject to 
limitations set forth in the third preceding sentence, shall 
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The 
Owner Trustee need not pay for any settlement made without its 
and the Company's consent. If the Owner Trustee is required to 
make any payment under this Section 9.05(a), it shall be 
subrogated to the rights of the Loan Trustee with respect 
thereto.

(b) To secure the payment obligations of the Owner 
Trustee pursuant to this Section 9.05, the Loan Trustee shall 
have a lien prior to that of the Loan Participants on all money 
or property held or collected by the Loan Trustee, except that

interest on, the Equipment Notes.

Section 9.06. Replacement of Loan Trustee. (a) The 
resignation or removal of the Loan Trustee and the appointment 
of a successor Loan Trustee shall become effective only upon 
the successor Loan Trustee's acceptance of appointment as 
provided in this Section.

(b) The Loan Trustee may resign by giving at least 30 
days' prior written notice to the Company and the Owner 
Trustee. Loan Participants holding a majority in aggregate 
principal amount of the Outstanding Equipment Notes may remove 
the Loan Trustee by giving at least 30 days' prior written 
notice to the Loan Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Owner 
Participant and the Company and may appoint a successor Loan 
Trustee for such Equipment Notes so long as no Indenture Event 
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with the Owner 
Trustee's and the Company's consent. The Owner Trustee (acting 
pursuant to instructions from the Company) may remove the Loan 
Trustee if:

(1) the Loan Trustee fails to comply with 
Section 9.08 hereof (or, as long as State Street Bank and 
Trust Company of Connecticut, National Association shall be 
the Loan Trustee, the requirement set forth in Section 9.08 
hereof specifically applicable to such institution);

(c) If the Loan Trustee resigns or is removed, or if 
a vacancy exists in the office of Loan Trustee for any reason 
and a new Loan Trustee has not been appointed pursuant to 
Section 9.06(b), the Owner Trustee shall promptly appoint a 
successor Loan Trustee.

(d) If a successor Loan Trustee does not take office 
within 30 days after the retiring Loan Trustee resigns or is 
removed, the retiring Loan Trustee, the Company, the Owner 
Trustee or Loan Participants holding a majority in aggregate 
principal amount of the Outstanding Equipment Notes may 
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the 
appointment of a successor Loan Trustee.

(e) If the Loan Trustee fails to comply with Section 
9.08, any Loan Participant may petition any court of competent 
jurisdiction for the removal of such Loan Trustee and the 
appointment of a successor Loan Trustee.

(f) A successor Loan Trustee shall deliver a written 
acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Loan Trustee, to 
the Company and to the Owner Trustee. Thereupon, the 
resignation or removal of the retiring Loan Trustee shall 
become effective, and the successor Loan Trustee shall have all 
the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Loan Trustee for 
which the successor Loan Trustee is to be acting as Loan 
Trustee under this Agreement. The retiring Loan Trustee shall 
promptly transfer all property and all books and records 
relating to the administration of the Indenture Estate held by 
it as Loan Trustee to the successor Loan Trustee subject to the 
lien provided for in Section 9.05. The Owner Trustee shall 
give notice of each appointment of a successor Loan Trustee if 
there are Equipment Notes outstanding, by mailing written 
notice of such event by first-class mail to the Loan 
Participants.

(g) All provisions of this Section 9.06 except 
subparagraphs (b)(l) and (e) and the words "subject to the lien 
provided for in Section 9.05" in subparagraph (f) shall apply 
also to any Paying Agent.

substantially all of its corporate trust business assets to, 
another corporation, the successor corporation, without any 
further act, shall be the successor Loan Trustee or Agent, as 
the case may be.

Section 9.08. Eligibility; Disqualification. This 
Agreement shall at all times have a Loan Trustee which shall be 
a bank or trust company and have a combined capital and surplus 
of at least $100,000,000 (or having a combined capital and 
surplus in excess of $5,000,000 (or, as long as State Street 
Bank and Trust Company of Connecticut, National Association 
shall be the Loan Trustee, $3,000,000) and the obligations of 
which, whether now in existence or hereafter incurred, are 
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by a corporation organized 
and doing business under the laws of the United States, any 
State or Territory thereof or of the District of Columbia and 
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000) 
and which shall be a "citizen of the United States" as defined 
in Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act. If such 
corporation publishes reports of conditions at least annually, 
pursuant to law or to the requirements of Federal, State, 
Territorial or District of Columbia supervising or examining 
authority, then for the purposes of this Section 9.08, the 
combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be 
deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in 
its most recent report of conditions so published.

In case at any time the Loan Trustee shall cease to be 
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this 
Section 9.08, the Loan Trustee shall resign immediately in the 
manner and with the effect specified in Section 9.06.

Section 9.09. Trustee's Liens. The Loan Trustee in 
its individual capacity agrees that it will at its own cost and 
expense promptly take such action as may be necessary to duly 
discharge and satisfy in full all Liens ("Trustee's Liens") on 
the Indenture Estate which are either (i) attributable to the 
Loan Trustee in its individual capacity and which are unrelated 
to the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents, or 
(ii) attributable to the Loan Trustee as trustee hereunder or 
in its individual capacity and which arise out of acts or 
omissions by it which are contrary to the terms of this 
Agreement.

Section 9.10. Withholding Taxes; Information 
Reporting. The Loan Trustee shall exclude and withhold from
<PAGE> 73

67

each distribution of principal, premium, if any, and interest 
and other amounts due hereunder or under the Equipment Notes 
any and all withholding taxes applicable thereto as required by 
law. The Loan Trustee agrees (i) to act as such withholding 
agent and, in connection therewith, whenever any present or 
future taxes or similar charges are required to be withheld 
with respect to any amounts payable in respect of the Equipment 
Notes, to withhold such amounts and timely pay the same to the 
appropriate authority in the name of and on behalf of the Loan 
Participants, (ii) that it will file any necessary withholding 
tax returns or statements when due and (iii) that, as promptly 
as possible after the payment of such amounts, it will deliver 
to each Loan Participant appropriate documentation showing the 
payment of such amounts, together with such additional 
documentary evidence as such Loan Participants may reasonably 
request from time to time. The Loan Trustee agrees to file any 
other information reports as it may be required to file under 
United States law.

Trustee, the Company and the Loan Trustee of any supplemental 
agreement pursuant to the provisions of this Section 11.02, the 
Owner Trustee shall transmit by first-class mail a notice,

Owner Trustee may at its option by delivery of an Officers'

Outstanding Equipment Notes have authorized or agreed or 
consented to such consent, request, demand, authorization, 
direction, notice, waiver or other act, and for that purpose

record date; provided that no such consent, request, demand, 
authorization, direction, notice, waiver or other act by the 
Loan Participants on such record date shall be deemed effective 
unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of 
this Agreement not later than one year after the record date.

Section 11.04. Notation on or Exchange of Equipment

adversely affects its rights, duties, immunities or 
indemnities.

Section 11.06. Amendments, Waivers, Etc. of Other 
Operative Documents. (a) Without the consent of the Loan 
Participants holding a majority in principal amount of 
Outstanding Equipment Notes, the respective parties to the 
Participation Agreement, the Lease, the Trust Agreement and the

deem appropriate and as shall be approved by the Company;

series of Equipment Notes the Loan Trustee shall have received 
(i) written evidence from Standard & Poor's Corporation and 
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. to the effect that the issuance

for the Company reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee to 
the effect that the protection afforded by Section 1110 of the

Equipment Notes; provided that such opinion need not be 
delivered to the extent that the benefits of such Section 1110

tenor contained in the opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton

No service charge shall be made for any such

general principles of equity and except as limited by 
applicable laws which may affect the remedies provided

hereby.

reasonably satisfactory to it that the insurance provisions 
contained in Section 11 of Article 15 hereof will have been

case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after 
receipt of notice by the Loan Trustee of such cancellation, 
change or lapse, no such failure to carry and maintain

days; 

provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in this Indenture, any failure of the Company to 
perform or observe any covenant, condition, or agreement herein 
shall not constitute an Indenture Event of Default if such 
failure is caused solely by reason of an event referred to in 
the definition of "Event of Loss", so long as the Company is 
continuing to comply with the applicable terms of Section 10 of 
Article 15 hereof.

all sums due and payable to the Loan Trustee has been deposited 
with the Loan Trustee, (ii) the rescission would not conflict 
with any judgment or decree and (iii) all existing Indenture 
Defaults and Indenture Events of Default under this Indenture 
have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal of, 
premium, if any, or interest on the Equipment Notes that has

Section 8.03. Other Remedies Available to Loan 
Trustee. (a) After an Indenture Event of Default shall have 
occurred and so long as the same shall be continuing, then and 
in every such case the Loan Trustee, as trustee of an express 
trust and as holder of a security interest in the Aircraft or 
Engines or otherwise, may, at its option, declare this 
Indenture to be in default by a written notice to the Company; 
and at any time thereafter, so long as the Company shall not 
have remedied all outstanding Events of Default, the Loan 
Trustee may do one or more of the following with respect to all 
or any part of any Airframe or any Engines as the Loan Trustee 
in its sole discretion shall elect, to the extent permitted by, 
and subject to compliance with any mandatory requirements of, 
applicable law then in effect; provided, however, that, during 
any period when the Aircraft is subject to the Civil Reserve 
Air Fleet Program in accordance with the provisions of Section 
7(b) of Article 15 hereof and in the possession of the United 
States government or an instrumentality or agency thereof, and 
to the extent that any applicable law or contractual provision 
covering the Aircraft so requires, the Loan Trustee shall not, 
on account
<PAGE> 123

22

of any Indenture Event of Default, be entitled to do any of the 
following in such manner as to limit the Company's control (or 
any lessee's control under any lease permitted by the terms of 
Section 7(b) of Article 15 hereof) of any Airframe or any 
Engines, unless at least 60 days' (or such lesser period as may 
then be applicable under the Military Airlift Command Program 
of the United States Government) prior written notice of 
default under this Indenture with respect to the Company's 
obligations hereunder shall have been given by the Loan Trustee 
by registered or certified mail to the Company (and, if 
applicable, any such lessee) with a copy addressed to the 
Contracting Office Representative for the Military Airlift 
Command of the United States Air Force under any contract with 
the Company (or any such lessee) relating to the Aircraft:

(i) cause the Company, upon the written demand of the 
Loan Trustee and at the Company's expense, to return 
promptly, and the Company shall return promptly, all or 
such part of any Airframe or any Engine as the Loan Trustee 
may so demand to the Loan Trustee or its order or the Loan 
Trustee, at its option, may enter upon the premises where 
all or any part of such Airframe or any Engine are located 
and take immediate possession of and remove the same 
(together with any engine which is not an Engine but which 
is installed on the Airframe, subject to all of the rights 
of the owner, lessor, lienor or secured party of such 
engine; provided that the Airframe with an engine (which is 
not an Engine) installed thereon may be flown or returned 
only to a location within the continental United States, 
and such engine shall be held for the account of any such 
owner, lessor, lienor or secured party or, if owned by the 
Company, may, at the option of the Loan Trustee, be 
exchanged with the Company for an Engine) all without 
liability accruing to the Loan Trustee for or by reason of 
such entry or taking of possession or removal, whether for 
the restoration of damage to property caused by such taking 
or otherwise; or 

(ii) sell all or any part of any Airframe and any 
Engine at public or private sale, whether or not the Loan 
Trustee shall at the time have possession thereof, as the 
Loan Trustee may determine, or otherwise dispose of, hold, 
use, operate, lease to others or keep idle all or any part 
of such Airframe or such Engine as the Loan Trustee, in its 
sole discretion, may determine, all free
<PAGE> 124

23

and clear of any rights of the Company and without any duty 
to account to the Company with respect to such action or 
inaction or for any proceeds with respect thereto.

(b) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and Section 8.03(h), 
if an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, the Loan Trustee may, if at the time such action 
may be lawful and always subject to compliance with any 
mandatory legal requirements, either with or without taking 
possession, and either before or after taking possession, and 
without instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, and 
having first given notice of such sale by registered mail to 
the Company once at least thirty days prior to the date of such 
sale, and any other notice which may be required by law, sell 
and dispose of the Indenture Estate, or any part thereof, or 
interest therein, at public auction to the highest bidder, in 
one lot as an entirety or in separate lots, and either for cash 
or on credit and on such terms as the Loan Trustee may 
determine, and at any place (whether or not it be the location 
of the Indenture Estate or any part thereof) and time 
designated in the notice above referred to; provided, however, 
that, notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the 
Loan Trustee shall not sell any of the Indenture Estate unless 
a declaration of acceleration has been made pursuant to Section 
8.02. Any such sale or sales may be adjourned from time to 
time by announcement at the time and place appointed for such 
sale or sales, or for any such adjourned sale or sales, without 
further notice, and the Loan Trustee and any Loan Participant 
may bid and become the purchaser at any such sale. The Loan 
Trustee may exercise such right without possession or 
production of the Equipment Notes or proof of ownership 
thereof, and as representative of the Loan Participants may 
exercise such right without notice to the Loan Participants or 
including the Loan Participants as parties to any suit or 
proceeding relating to foreclosure of any property in the 
Indenture Estate. The Company hereby irrevocably constitutes 
the Loan Trustee the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the 
Company (in the name of the Company or otherwise) for the 
purpose of effectuating any sale, assignment, transfer or 
delivery for enforcement of the Lien created under this 
Indenture, whether pursuant to foreclosure or power of sale or 
otherwise, to execute and deliver all such bills of sale, 
assignments and other instruments as the Loan Trustee may 
consider necessary or appropriate, with full power of 
substitution, the Company hereby ratifying and confirming all 
that such attorney or any substitute shall lawfully do by 
virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested
<PAGE> 125

24

by the Loan Trustee or any purchaser, the Company shall ratify 
and confirm any such sale, assignment, transfer or delivery, by 
executing and delivering to the Loan Trustee or such purchaser 
all bills of sale, assignments, releases and other proper 
instruments to effect such ratification and confirmation as may 
be designated in any such request.

(c) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), if an 
Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the 
Company shall, at the request of the Loan Trustee, promptly 
execute and deliver to the Loan Trustee such instruments of 
title or other documents as the Loan Trustee may deem necessary 
or advisable to enable the Loan Trustee or an agent or 
representative designated by the Loan Trustee, at such time or 
times and place or places as the Loan Trustee may specify, to 
obtain possession of all or any part of the Indenture Estate. 
If the Company shall for any reason fail to execute and deliver 
such instruments and documents after such request by the Loan 
Trustee, the Loan Trustee shall be entitled, in a proceeding to 
which the Company will be a necessary party, to a judgment for 
specific performance of the covenants contained in the 
foregoing sentence, conferring upon the Loan Trustee the right 
to immediate possession and requiring the Company to execute 
and deliver such instruments and documents to the Loan Trustee. 
The Loan Trustee shall also be entitled to pursue all or any 
part of the Indenture Estate wherever it may be found and may 
enter any of the premises of the Company or any other Person 
wherever the Indenture Estate may be or is supposed to be and 
search for the Indenture Estate and take possession of any item 
of the Indenture Estate pursuant to this Section 8.03(c). The 
Loan Trustee may, from time to time, at the expense of the 
Indenture Estate, make all such expenditures for maintenance, 
insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and 
improvements to and of the Indenture Estate, as it may deem 
proper. In each such case, the Loan Trustee shall have the 
right to use, operate, store, lease, control or manage the 
Indenture Estate, and to exercise all rights and powers of the 
Company relating to the Indenture Estate as the Loan Trustee 
shall deem appropriate, including the right to enter into any 
and all such agreements with respect to the use, operation, 
storage, leasing, control or management of the Indenture Estate 
or any part thereof; and the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to 
collect and receive directly all tolls, rents, issues, profits, 
products, revenues and other income of the Indenture Estate and 
every part thereof, without prejudice, however, to the right of 
the Loan Trustee under any provision of this Indenture to 
collect and receive all
<PAGE> 126

25

cash held by, or required to be deposited with, the Loan 
Trustee hereunder. In accordance with the terms of this 
Section 8.03(c), such tolls, rents, issues, profits, products, 
revenues and other income shall be applied to pay the expenses 
of using, operating, storing, leasing, controlling or managing 
the Indenture Estate, and of all maintenance, insurance, 
repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and improvements, 
and to make all payments which the Loan Trustee may be required 
or may elect to make, if any, for taxes, assessments, insurance 
or other proper charges upon the Indenture Estate or any part 
thereof (including the employment of engineers and accountants 
to examine, inspect and make reports upon the properties and 
books and records of the Company in accordance with this 
Section 8.03(c)), and all other payments which the Loan Trustee 
may be required or authorized to make under any provision of 
this Indenture, including this Section 8.03(c), as well as just 
and reasonable compensation for the services of the Loan 
Trustee, and of all Persons properly engaged and employed by 
the Loan Trustee.

If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is 
continuing and the Loan Trustee shall have obtained possession 
of or title to the Aircraft, the Loan Trustee shall not be 
obligated to use or operate the Aircraft or cause the Aircraft 
to be used or operated directly or indirectly by itself or 
through agents or other representatives or to lease, license or 
otherwise permit or provide for the use or operation of the 
Aircraft by any other Person unless (i) the Loan Trustee shall 
have been able to obtain insurance in kinds, at rates and in 
amounts satisfactory to it in its discretion to protect the 
Indenture Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and 
individually, against any and all liability for loss or damage 
to the Aircraft and for public liability and property damage 
resulting from use or operation of the Aircraft and (ii) funds 
are available in the Indenture Estate to pay for all such 
insurance or, in lieu of such insurance, the Loan Trustee is 
furnished with indemnification from the holders of the 
Equipment Notes or any other Person upon terms and in amounts 
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee in its discretion to protect 
the Indenture Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and 
individually, against any and all such liabilities.

(d) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), the Loan 
Trustee may proceed to protect and enforce this Indenture and 
the Equipment Notes by suit or suits or proceedings in equity, 
at law or in bankruptcy, and whether
<PAGE> 127

26

for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement 
herein contained or in execution or aid of any power herein 
granted; or for foreclosure hereunder, or for the appointment 
of a receiver or receivers for the Indenture Estate or any part 
thereof, or for the recovery of judgment for the indebtedness 
secured by the Lien created under this Indenture or for the 
enforcement of any other proper, legal or equitable remedy 
available under applicable law.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture 
to the contrary, including, without limitation, Sections 
8.03(b), 8.03(c) and 8.03(d), so long as no Indenture Event of 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Loan Trustee 
shall not take any action contrary to, or disturb, the 
Company's rights to possession and use of, and quiet enjoyment 
of, the Aircraft.

(f) Each and every right, power and remedy herein 
given to the Loan Trustee specifically or otherwise in this 
Indenture shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every 
other right, power and remedy herein specifically given or now 
or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute, and each 
and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein 
given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time 
and as often in such order as may be deemed expedient by the 
Loan Trustee, and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise 
of any power or remedy shall not be construed to be a waiver of 
the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other 
right, power or remedy. No delay or omission by the Loan 
Trustee in the exercise of any right, remedy or power or in 
pursuing any remedy shall impair any such right, power or 
remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default on the 
part of the Company or to be an acquiescence therein.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if 
any payment of principal of any Equipment Note shall not be 
made when and as the same shall become due and payable, or if 
any payment of interest on any Equipment Note shall not be made 
when and as the same shall become due and payable, and such 
failure shall continue for the period prescribed in Section 
8.01(a), the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to recover 
judgment, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, 
upon the Equipment Note for the whole amount of such principal 
or interest, as the case may be, remaining unpaid.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, so 
long as the Pass Through Trustee is the registered holder of
<PAGE> 128

27

any Equipment Note hereunder, the Loan Trustee is not 
authorized or empowered to acquire title to all or any portion 
of the Indenture Estate or take any action with respect to all 
or any portion of the Indenture Estate so acquired by it if 
such acquisition or action would cause any Pass Through Trust 
to fail to qualify as a "grantor trust" for Federal income tax 
purposes.

Section 8.04. Waiver of Company. To the extent now 
or at any time hereafter enforceable under applicable law, the 
Company covenants that it will not at any time insist upon or 
plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take any benefit or 
advantage of, any stay or extension law now or at any time 
hereafter in force, nor claim, take nor insist upon any benefit 
or advantage of or from any law now or hereafter in force 
providing for the valuation or appraisement of the Indenture 
Estate or any part thereof, prior to any sale or sales thereof 
to be made pursuant to any provision herein contained, or to 
the decree, judgment or order of any court of competent 
jurisdiction; nor, after such sale or sales, claim or exercise 
any right under any statute now or hereafter made or enacted by 
any state or otherwise to redeem the property so sold or any 
part thereof, and hereby expressly waives for itself and on 
behalf of each and every Person, except decree or judgment 
creditors of the Company acquiring any interest in or title to 
the Indenture Estate or any part thereof subsequent to the date 
of this Indenture, all benefit and advantage of any such law or 
laws, and covenants that it will not invoke or utilize any such 
law or laws or otherwise hinder, delay or impede the execution 
of any power herein granted and delegated to the Loan Trustee, 
but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as 
though no such law or laws had been made or enacted.

The Loan Trustee may maintain such a proceeding even 
if it does not possess any of the Equipment Notes or does not 
produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by 
the Loan Trustee or any Loan Participant in exercising any 
right or remedy accruing upon an Indenture Event of Default 
under this Indenture shall not impair the right or remedy or 
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in such Indenture Event 
of Default.

(I) Section 9.11 thereof shall read as follows:

Section 9.11. Assumption of Certain Obligations. 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, 
any reference in this Article 9 to the Owner Trustee
<PAGE> 129

28

or to any obligation of the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to be 
a reference to the Company or to an obligation of the Company, 
as the case may be, any reference to "Lease Event of Default" 
shall be deemed to be a reference to an "Indenture Event of 
Default", all provisions requiring notices to the Owner Trustee 
or the Owner Participant shall be deemed to be deleted for the 
purposes of this Article 9 and any provision in this Article 9 
requiring the action or consent of the Owner Trustee shall be 
deemed to require the action or approval of the Company.

(J) Sections 10.01 and 10.04 thereof shall read as 
follows:

Section 10.01. Satisfaction and Discharge of 
Agreement; Defeasance; Termination of Obligations. Subject to

effect, and the Company and the Loan Trustee shall be deemed to 
have been discharged from their respective obligations with 
respect to the Equipment Notes (and the Loan Trustee, on demand 
and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper 
instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this 
Indenture in respect of the Equipment Notes), when

trust hereunder has been paid and discharged from such 
trust, as provided in Section 7.01) have been delivered to 
the Loan Trustee for cancellation; or

(ii) all Equipment Notes not theretofore delivered to 
the Loan Trustee for cancellation have become due and 
payable (whether upon stated maturity, as a result of 
redemption or upon acceleration), or will become due and 
payable (including as a result of redemption in respect of 
which irrevocable notice has been given to the Loan Trustee 
on or prior to the date of the deposit referred to below) 
at maturity within one year, and there has been deposited 
with the Loan Trustee in trust for the purpose of paying 
and discharging the entire indebtedness of the Equipment 
Notes not theretofore cancelled by the Loan Trustee or 
delivered to the Loan Trustee for cancellation, an amount 
in cash sufficient without reinvestment thereof to 
discharge such indebtedness, including the principal of,

deposited irrevocably (except as provided in Section 10.04) 
with the Loan Trustee as trust funds in trust, specifically 
pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the 
benefit of the Loan Participants, (1) money in an amount, 
or (2) U.S. Government Obligations which, through the 
payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in 
accordance with their terms, will provide (not later than 
one Business Day before the due date of any payment 
referred to below in this clause) money in an amount, or 
(3) a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations 
referred to in the foregoing clause (2), sufficient, in the 
opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent 
certified public accountants expressed in a written 
certification thereof delivered to the Loan Trustee, to pay 
and discharge each installment of principal of, premium, if 
any, and interest on the Outstanding Equipment Notes on the 
dates such payments of principal or interest are due 
(including as a result of redemption in respect of which 
irrevocable notice has been given to the Loan Trustee on or 
prior to the date of such deposit) and no Indenture Event 
of Default or Indenture Default under any of Sections 
8.01(f) through 8.01(i) hereof shall have occurred and be 
continuing on the date of such deposit or at any time 
during the period ending on the 91st day after such date; 
provided further that, upon the making of the deposit 
referred to above in clause (A), the right of the Company 
to cause the redemption of Equipment Notes (except 
redemption in respect of which irrevocable notice has 
theretofore been given) shall terminate;

(B) such deposit will not result in a breach or 
violation of, or constitute an Indenture Default or 
Indenture Event of Default under, this Indenture or a 
default or event of default under any other agreement or 
instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it 
is bound; and

(C) the Company has delivered to the Loan Trustee an 
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the

Participants will not recognize income, gain or loss for 
Federal income tax purposes as a result of the exercise by 
the Company of its option under this Section 10.01(a)(iii) 
and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same 
amount and in the same manner and at the same time as would 
have been the case if such option had not been exercised;

(b) all other amounts then due and payable hereunder 
have been paid; and

The Loan Trustee and any Paying Agent shall promptly pay or 
return to the Company upon request of the Company any money or

of the Equipment Notes then being redeemed and having such 
terms and provisions (including, without limitation, interest 
rate, amortization schedule, maturity date and redemption 
provisions) as the Company shall deem appropriate; provided 
that if after such redemption any Equipment Notes remain 
outstanding the new series of Equipment Notes:

(i) shall be denominated and payable in United States 
Dollars and shall not be in a principal amount greater than 
the Equipment Notes redeemed;

<PAGE> 138

37

(ii) shall not rank senior in any respect to the 
Equipment Notes which remain outstanding; and

(iii) shall not have a maturity after or have a 
weighted average life longer than the Equipment Notes 
redeemed if any of the Equipment Notes which remain 
outstanding have a maturity date after or concurrent with 
the maturity date of the Equipment Notes redeemed; and

provided further that prior to authentication and delivery of 
such new series of Equipment Notes the Loan Trustee shall have 
received (i) written evidence from Standard & Poor's 
Corporation and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. to the effect 
that the issuance of such new series, by itself, would not 
result in a downgrading of the credit rating assigned to the 
Pass Through Equipment Notes then outstanding, and (ii) an 
Opinion of Counsel for the Company reasonably satisfactory to 
the Loan Trustee to the effect that the protection afforded by 
Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code to the existing Loan 
Participants would not be adversely affected by the issuance of 
such new series of Equipment Notes; provided that such opinion 
need not be delivered to the extent that the benefits of such 
Section 1110 are not available to the Loan Participants with 
respect to the Aircraft immediately prior to such assumption; 
and provided further that such opinion may contain 
qualifications of the tenor contained in the opinion of 
Debevoise & Plimpton delivered pursuant to Section 3(k) of the

either not yet due or being contested in good faith (and for 
the payment of which adequate reserves have been provided) by 
appropriate proceedings so long as such proceedings do not 
involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of 
the Airframe or any Engine or interest therein, (v) 
materialmen's, mechanics', workmen's, repairmen's, employees' 
or other like Liens arising in the ordinary course of business 
for amounts the payment of which is either not yet delinquent

Section 7. Registration, Maintenance and Operation; 
Possession; Insignia. (a) Registration, Maintenance and 
Operation. The Company, at its own cost and expense, shall:

(i) cause the Aircraft at all times to be duly 
registered, under the laws of the United States, in the 
name of the Company, as owner, except as otherwise required 
by the Federal Aviation Act; provided that the Loan Trustee 
shall execute and deliver all such documents as the Company 
shall reasonably request for the purpose of effecting and 
continuing such registration. Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence, but subject always to the terms and conditions 
set forth in Section 7.02 of this Indenture, the Company 
may cause the Aircraft to be duly registered under the laws 
of any jurisdiction in which a lessee pursuant to 
Section 7(b)(ix) of this Article could be principally based 
and shall thereafter maintain such registration unless and 
until changed as provided herein and therein; and the Loan 
Trustee will cooperate with the Company in effecting such 
foreign registration;

<PAGE> 140

39

(ii) maintain, service, repair, overhaul and test the 
Aircraft in accordance with a maintenance program (as 
approved by the Federal Aviation Administration) for 
Boeing 757-200 series aircraft (or, at the Company's 
option, (x) in the event that the Aircraft is re-registered 
in another jurisdiction pursuant to Section 7(a)(i) of this 
Article, in accordance with an aircraft maintenance program 
approved by the central civil aviation authority of the 
jurisdiction of such registration or (y) in the event of 
any lease to a foreign air carrier in accordance with 
Section 7(b)(ix) of this Article, approved by the central 
civil aviation authority of one of the jurisdictions 
specified in clause (y) of such Section 7(b)(ix)) and in 
the same manner and with the same care used by the Company 
with respect to comparable aircraft and engines owned or 
operated by the Company and utilized in similar 
circumstances so as to keep the Aircraft in as good 
operating condition as when delivered to the Company by the 
Manufacturer, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in such 
condition as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness 
certification of the Aircraft to be maintained in good 
standing at all times (other than during temporary periods 
of storage in accordance with applicable regulations or 
during periods of grounding by applicable governmental 
authorities, except where such periods of grounding are the 
result of the failure by the Company to maintain the 
Aircraft as otherwise required herein) under the Federal 
Aviation Act or, if the Aircraft is registered under the 
laws of any other jurisdiction, the laws of such 
jurisdiction and in compliance with all applicable 
manufacturer's alert service bulletins;

(iii) maintain, in the English language, all records 
logs and other materials required by the appropriate 
authorities in the jurisdiction where the Aircraft is 
registered to be maintained in respect of the Aircraft; and

(iv) promptly furnish to the Loan Trustee such 
information as may be required to enable the Loan Trustee 
to file any reports, returns or statements required to be 
filed by the Loan Trustee with any governmental authority 
because of the Loan Trustee's interest in the Aircraft.

The Company agrees that the Aircraft will not be 
maintained, used or operated in violation of any law or any
<PAGE> 141

40

rule, regulation or order of any government or governmental 
authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign), or in 
violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or 
registration relating to the Aircraft issued by any such 
authority; provided that the Company shall not be in default 
under this sentence if it is not possible for it to comply with 
the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States (or 
other than any jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is then 
registered) because of a conflict with the applicable laws of 
the United States (or such jurisdiction in which the Aircraft 
is then registered). In the event that any such law, rule, 
regulation or order requires alteration of the Aircraft, the 
Company will conform thereto or obtain conformance therewith at 
no expense to the Loan Trustee and will maintain the Aircraft 
in proper operating condition under such laws, rules, 
regulations and orders; provided, however, that the Company 
may, in good faith, contest the validity or application of any 
such law, rule, regulation or order in any reasonable manner 
which does not materially adversely affect the Loan Trustee, 
the Aircraft, the Loan Participants or the Lien of this 
Indenture. The Company also agrees not to operate or locate 
the Aircraft, or suffer the Aircraft to be operated or located, 
(i) in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance 
required by the terms of Section 11 of this Article, except in 
the case of a requisition for use by any Government where the 
Company obtains indemnity pursuant to Section 11 of this 
Article in lieu of such insurance from such Government against 
the risks and in the amounts required by Section 11 of this 
Article covering such area, or (ii) in any war zone or 
recognized or, in the Company's judgment, threatened area of 
hostilities unless covered by war risk insurance in accordance 
with Section 11 of this Article, but only so long as the same 
remains in effect while the Aircraft is so operated or located, 
or unless the Aircraft is operated or used under contract with 
any Government entered into pursuant to Section 11 of this 
Article, under which contract such Government assumes liability 
for any damage, loss, destruction or failure to return 
possession of the Aircraft at the end of the term of such 
contract or for injury to persons or damage to property of 
others.

(b) Possession. The Company will not, without the 
prior written consent of the Loan Trustee, lease or otherwise 
in any manner deliver, transfer or relinquish possession of the 
Airframe or any Engine or install any Engine, or permit any 
Engine to be installed, on any airframe other than the 
Airframe; provided that, so long as no Indenture Event of 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and so long as
<PAGE> 142

41

the action to be taken shall not deprive the Loan Trustee of 
the perfected lien of this Indenture on the Airframe or 
(subject to subclause (B) of the "provided further" clause to 
subsection (i) of this Section 7(b)) any Engine, and in any 
event, so long as the Company shall comply with the provisions 
of Section 11, the Company may, without the prior consent of 
the Loan Trustee:

(i) subject the Airframe to normal interchange 
agreements or any Engine to normal interchange or pooling 
agreements or arrangements in each case customary in the 
airline industry and entered into by the Company in the 
ordinary course of its business with any other United 
States air carrier as to which there is in force a 
certificate issued pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal 
Aviation Act or any successor provision that gives like 
authority or with any "foreign air carrier" (as such term 
is defined in such Act) as to which there is in force a 
permit issued pursuant to Section 402 of said Act (any such 
United States certificated air carrier and any such foreign 
air carrier being hereinafter called a "Permitted Air 
Carrier"); provided that no transfer of the registration of 
such Airframe shall be effected in connection therewith; 
and provided, further, that (A) no such agreement or 
arrangement contemplates or requires the transfer of title 
to the Airframe and (B) if the Company's title to any such 
Engine shall be divested under any such agreement or 
arrangement, such divestiture shall be deemed to be an 
Event of Loss with respect to such Engine and the Company 
shall comply with Section 10(b) of this Article in respect 
thereof;

(ii) deliver possession of the Airframe or any Engine 
to the manufacturer thereof for testing or other similar 
purposes or to any organization for service, repair, 
maintenance or overhaul work on the Airframe or such Engine 
or any part thereof or for alterations or modifications in 
or additions to the Airframe or such Engine to the extent 
required or permitted by the terms of Section 7(a) or 8(c) 
of this Article;

(iii) transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine 
to the United States of America or any instrumentality or 
agency thereof pursuant to a sublease, contract or other 
instrument, a copy of which shall be furnished to the Loan 
Trustee;

(iv) transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine 
to the United States of America or any
<PAGE> 143

42

instrumentality or agency thereof in accordance with 
applicable laws, rulings, regulations or orders (including, 
without limitation, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program 
authorized under 10 U.S.C. Section 9511 et seq. or any 
substantially similar program);

(v) install an Engine on an airframe owned by the 
Company free and clear of all Liens, except (A) those of 
the type permitted under clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), 
(vi) and (vii) of Section 6 of this Article and those which 
apply only to the engines (other than Engines), appliances, 
parts, instruments, appurtenances, accessories, furnishings 
and other equipment (other than Parts) installed on such 
airframe (but not to the airframe as an entirety) and 
(B) the rights of other Permitted Air Carriers under normal 
interchange agreements which are customary in the airline 
industry and do not contemplate, permit or require the transfer 
of title to the airframe or engines installed thereon;

(vi) install an Engine on an airframe leased to the 
Company or owned by the Company subject to a conditional 
sale or other security agreement; provided that (A) such 
airframe is free and clear of all Liens except the rights 
of the parties to the lease or conditional sale or other 
security agreement covering such airframe and except Liens 
of the type permitted by clauses (A) and (B) of 
subparagraph (v) of this paragraph of Section 7(b) of this 
Article and (B) the Company shall have obtained from the 
lessor or secured party of such airframe a written 
agreement (which may be the lease or conditional sale or 
other security agreement covering such airframe), in form 
and substance satisfactory to the Loan Trustee (it being 
understood that an agreement from such lessor or secured 
party substantially in the form of the final sentence of 
the penultimate paragraph of this Section 7(b) of this 
Article shall be deemed to be satisfactory to the Loan 
Trustee), whereby such lessor or secured party expressly 
agrees that neither it nor its successors or assigns will 
acquire or claim any right, title or interest in any Engine 
by reason of such Engine being installed on such airframe 
at any time while such Engine is subject to the lien of the 
Trust Indenture;

(vii) install an Engine on an airframe owned by the 
Company, leased to the Company or owned by the Company 
subject to a conditional sale or other security agreement 
under circumstances where neither subparagraph (v) nor
<PAGE> 144

43

subparagraph (vi) of this Section 7(b) of this Article is 
applicable; provided that such installation shall be deemed 
an Event of Loss with respect to such Engine and the 
Company shall comply with Section 10(b) of this Article in 
respect thereof, the Loan Trustee not intending hereby to 
waive any right or interest it may have to or in such 
Engine under applicable law until compliance by the Company 
with such Section 10(b) of this Article; 

(viii) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or 
engines then installed on the Airframe to any United States 
air carrier as to which there is in force a certificate 
issued pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act 
or successor provision that gives like authority;

(ix) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or 
engines then installed on the Airframe to (A) any foreign 
air carrier that is principally based in and a domiciliary 
of a country (other than Cuba, El Salvador, Iran, Iraq, 
Lebanon and Libya) that is at the inception of the lease a 
party to the Mortgage Convention, or (B) any foreign air 
carrier that is principally based in and a domiciliary of a 
country listed in Schedule I hereto, or (C) any foreign air 
carrier not described in clause (A) or (B) above; provided 
that (w) in the case only of a lease to a foreign air 
carrier under clause (C) above, the Loan Trustee receives 
at the time of such lease an opinion of counsel to the 
Company (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to 
the Loan Trustee to the effect that (a) the terms of the 
lease and the Operative Documents are legal, valid, binding 
and enforceable in the country in which such air carrier is 
principally based, to substantially the same extent as the 
Operative Documents are at that time enforceable in the 
United States, (b) it is not necessary for the Loan Trustee 
to qualify to do business in such country solely as a 
result of the proposed lease, (c) there is no tort 
liability of the Loan Trustee as a result of the Lien of 
this Indenture under the laws of such country other than 
tort liability no more extensive or onerous than that which 
might have been imposed on the Loan Trustee under the laws 
of the United States or any state thereof (it being 
understood that, in the event such opinion cannot be given 
in a form satisfactory to the Loan Trustee, such opinion 
shall be waived if insurance reasonably satisfactory to the 
Loan Trustee is provided by the Company
<PAGE> 145

44

to cover the risk of such liability), (d) the laws of
such country require fair compensation by the government 
of such country for the loss of the use of the Aircraft in 
the event of the requisition by such government of the 
Aircraft (unless the Company shall have agreed to provide 
insurance reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee 
covering the risk of requisition of use of the Aircraft by 
the government of such jurisdiction so long as the aircraft 
is leased in such country), and (e) there exist no 
possessory rights in favor of such lessee under the laws of 
such country which would, upon bankruptcy of or other 
default by the Company or the lessee, prevent the return of 
such Engine or the Airframe and such Engine or engine to 
the Loan Trustee in accordance with and when permitted by 
the terms of this Indenture upon the exercise by the Loan 
Trustee of its remedies under this Indenture, (x) in the 
case only of a lease to a foreign air carrier under clause 
(C) above, the Loan Trustees receives assurances reasonably 
satisfactory to it that the currency of such country is 
freely convertible into U.S. Dollars (unless the Company 
shall have agreed to provide the requisition insurance 
described in subclause (d) of clause (w) above,), (y) in 
the case of any lease to a foreign air carrier, either the 
lease, or an arrangement existing between the Company, the 
lessee and/or one or more third parties that provide 
maintenance services, provides that the Aircraft will be 
maintained, serviced, repaired, overhauled and tested in 
accordance with maintenance standards for Boeing 757-200 
series aircraft approved by, or substantially similar to 
those approved or required by, the Federal Aviation 
Administration or the central civil aviation authority of 
any of Brazil, Canada, France, The Federal Republic of 
Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland 
or the United Kingdom and (z) in the case of any lease to a 
foreign air carrier (other than a foreign air carrier 
principally based in Taiwan) the United States of America 
maintains diplomatic relations with the country in which 
such foreign air carrier is principally based at the time 
such lease is entered into;

provided that the rights of any transferee who receives 
possession by reason of a transfer permitted by this Section 
7(b) (other than the transfer of an Engine which is deemed an 
Event of Loss) shall be subject and subordinate to, and any 
lease permitted by this Section 7(b) shall be made expressly 
subject and subordinate to, all the terms of this Indenture, 
including, without limitation, the Loan Trustee's rights to 
repossession pursuant to Article 8 hereof and to avoid such
<PAGE> 146

45

lease upon such repossession and the Loan Trustee's rights to 
possession pursuant to Section 8.03 of this Indenture, and the 
Company shall in all events remain primarily liable hereunder 
for the performance and observance of all of the terms and 
conditions of this Indenture to the same extent as if such 
lease or transfer had not occurred, and any such lease shall 
include appropriate provisions for the maintenance (subject to 
clause (y) of the proviso to Section 7(b)(ix) of this Article) 
and insurance of the Aircraft. The Company shall not lease the 
Aircraft to an air carrier that at the inception of the lease 
is subject to bankruptcy proceedings unless the lease shall 
have been approved by the receiver, liquidator, conservator, 
court or other governmental or administrative authority or 
entity responsible for the adjudication or administration of 
such proceedings. No interchange agreement, pooling agreement, 
lease or other relinquishment of possession of the Airframe or 
any Engine shall in any way discharge or diminish any of the 
Company's obligations to the Loan Trustee hereunder or under 
the Participation Agreement. With the prior written consent of 
the Loan Trustee, the Company may sublease the Airframe or 
Engines in connection with a transaction that involves such a 
sublease commencing at the inception of the transaction. The 
Loan Trustee hereby agrees, for the benefit of the lessor or 
secured party of any airframe leased by the Company or owned by 
the Company subject to a conditional sale or other security 
agreement, that the Loan Trustee will not acquire or claim, as 
against such lessor or secured party, any right, title or 
interest in any engine or engines owned by the lessor under 
such lease or subject to a security interest in favor of the 
secured party under such conditional sale or other security 
agreement as the result of such engine or engines being 
installed on the Airframe at any time while such engine or 
engines are subject to such lease or conditional sale or other 
security agreement.

The Loan Trustee acknowledges that any "wet lease" or 
other similar arrangement under which the Company maintains 
operational control of the Aircraft shall not constitute a 
delivery, transfer or relinquishment of possession for purposes 
of this Section 7(b).

(c) Insignia. The Company agrees to at all times 
maintain in the cockpit of the Airframe adjacent to the 
airworthiness certificate therein and (if not prevented by 
applicable law or regulations or by any governmental authority) 
on each Engine a nameplate bearing the inscription "STATE 
STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CONNECTICUT, NATIONAL
<PAGE> 147

46

ASSOCIATION, AS LOAN TRUSTEE, MORTGAGEE" (such nameplate to be 
replaced, if necessary, with a nameplate reflecting the name of 
any successor Loan Trustee). 

Section 8. Replacement and Pooling of Parts; 
Alterations, Modifications and Additions. (a) Replacement of 
Parts. The Company, at its own cost and expense, will promptly 
replace all Parts which may from time to time be incorporated 
or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine and 
which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, 
destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or 
rendered permanently unfit for use for any reason whatsoever, 
except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of this Article. 
In addition, the Company may, at its own cost and expense, 
remove in the ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, 
overhaul or testing, any Parts, whether or not worn out, lost, 
stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair 
or rendered permanently unfit for use; provided that the 
Company, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of this 
Article, will, at its own cost and expense, replace such Parts 
as promptly as possible. All replacement Parts shall be free 
and clear of all Liens (except for pooling arrangements to the 
extent permitted by Section 8(b) of this Article and Permitted 
Liens) and shall be in as good operating condition as, and 
shall have a value and utility at least equal to, the Parts 
replaced, assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition 
and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof. All 
Parts at any time removed from the Airframe or any Engine shall 
remain subject to the Lien of this Indenture, no matter where 
located, until such time as such Parts shall be replaced by 
Parts which have been incorporated or installed in or attached 
to the Airframe or such Engine and which meet the requirements 
for replacement Parts specified above. Immediately upon any 
replacement Part becoming incorporated or installed in or 
attached to the Airframe or any Engine as above provided 
without further act, (i) title to the replaced Part shall 
thereupon be free and clear of all rights of the Loan Trustee, 
and shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder, (ii) title to 
such replacement Part shall thereupon be subject to the Lien of 
this Indenture, free and clear of all Liens (except for 
Permitted Liens) and (iii) such replacement Part shall become 
subject to this Indenture and be deemed part of the Airframe or 
such Engine for all purposes to the same extent as the Parts 
originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the 
Airframe or such Engine.

(b) Pooling of Parts. Any Part removed from the 
Airframe or any Engine as provided in Section 8(a) of this
<PAGE> 148

47

Article may be subjected by the Company to a normal pooling 
arrangement customary in the airline industry entered into in 
the ordinary course of the Company's business with Permitted 
Air Carriers; provided that the Part replacing such removed 
Part shall be incorporated or installed in or attached to the 
Airframe or such Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of this 
Article as promptly as practicable after the removal of such 
removed Part. In addition, any replacement Part, when 
incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any 
Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article, may be 
owned by a Permitted Air Carrier subject to such a normal 
pooling arrangement; provided that the Company, at its expense, 
as promptly thereafter as is practicable, either (i) causes 
title to such replacement Part to vest in the Company free and 
clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens, at which time such 
replacement Part shall, in accordance with Section 8(a) of this 
Article become a Part and become subject to the Lien of this 
Indenture or (ii) replaces such replacement part by 
incorporating or installing in or attaching to the Airframe or 
such Engine a further replacement Part owned by the Company 
free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), which 
shall without further act be subject to the Lien of this 
Indenture.

(c) Alterations, Modifications and Additions. The 
Company, at its own expense, will make such alterations and 
modifications in and additions to the Airframe and the Engines 
as may be required from time to time to meet the standards of 
the Federal Aviation Administration or other governmental 
authority having jurisdiction in any country in or over which 
the Aircraft is flown; provided, however, that the Company may, 
in good faith, contest the validity or application of any such 
standard in any reasonable manner which does not materially 
adversely affect the Loan Trustee or the Lien of this 
Indenture, but only so long as such proceedings do not involve 
any material danger of criminal liability or material danger of 
civil liability to the Loan Trustee, or a material danger of 
the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Aircraft or any Engine or 
any interest therein. In addition, the Company, at its own 
expense, may from time to time make or cause to be made such 
alterations and modifications in and additions to the Airframe 
or any Engine as the Company may deem desirable in the proper 
conduct of its business, including, without limitation, removal 
or Parts; provided that no such alterations, modification, 
addition or removal shall materially diminish the value or 
utility of the Airframe or such Engine or of the Aircraft, or 
materially impair the condition or airworthiness thereof,
<PAGE> 149

48

below the value, utility, condition and airworthiness thereof 
immediately prior to such alternation, modification, addition 
or removal assuming the Airframe or such Engine was then of the 
value and utility and in the condition and airworthiness 
required to be maintained by the terms of this Indenture, 
except that the value (but not the utility, condition or 
airworthiness) of the Aircraft may be reduced by the value of 
Parts which the Company deems obsolete or no longer suitable or 
appropriate for use in the Airframe or any Engine which shall 
have been removed, if the aggregate value of such obsolete or 
unsuitable Parts removed from the Aircraft and not replaced 
shall not exceed $500,000. All Parts incorporated or installed 
in or attached or added to the Airframe or any Engine as the 
result of such alteration, modification or addition shall, with 
our further act, be subject to the Lien of this Indenture. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, at any time, 
remove any Part; provided that (i) such Part is in addition to, 
and not in replacement of or substitution for, any Part 
originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the 
Airframe or such Engine at the time of delivery thereof under 
the Lease or hereunder or any Part in replacement of, or 
substitution for, any such Part, (ii) such Part is not required 
to be incorporated or installed in or attached or added to such 
Airframe or Engine pursuant to the first sentence of this 
Section 8(c), and (iii) such Part can be removed from the 
Airframe or such Engine without materially diminishing or 
impairing the value, utility, condition or airworthiness 
required to be maintained by the terms of this Indenture which 
the Airframe or such Engine would have had at such time had 
such removal not occurred. Upon the removal by the Company of 
any Part as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, or 
the removal of any obsolete or unsuitable part permitted by 
this Section 8(c), such Part shall not longer be deemed part of 
the Airframe or the Engine from which it was removed and shall 
no longer be subject to the Lien of this Indenture. Any such 
Part not removed by the Company as provided in Section 
8(c)(iii) of this Article shall remain subject to the Lien of 
this Indenture.

Section 10. Loss, Destruction, Requisition, Etc. (a) 
Event of Loss with Respect to an Airframe. Upon the occurrence 
of an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe, the Company 
shall forthwith (and, in any event, within 30 days after such 
occurrence) give the Loan Trustee written notice of such Event 
of Loss and of its election to perform one of the following 
options (it being agreed that if the Company shall not have 
given notice of such election within
<PAGE> 150

49

such 30 days after such occurrence, the Company shall be deemed 
to have elected to perform the option set forth in the 
following clause (ii)): 

(i) as promptly as practicable, and in any event on 
or before the Business Day next preceding the 121st day 
next following the date of occurrence of such Event of 
Loss, in replacement for the Airframe, the Company shall 
convey or cause to be conveyed to the Loan Trustee a 
security interest in and to one or more Replacement 
Airframes (together with the same number of Replacement 
Engines as the Engines, if any, installed on the Airframe 
at the time such Event of Loss occurred), such Replacement 
Airframe and Replacement Engines to be duly certificated as 
airworthy by the central aviation authority of the 
jurisdiction of the registry of such Replacement Airframes 
and Engines, free and clear of all Liens (other than 
Permitted Liens), to have a value and utility at least 
equal to, and to be in as good operating condition as, the 
Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced (assuming such 
Airframe and Engines were in the condition and repair 
required by the terms of this Indenture); provided that, if 
the Company shall not perform its obligation to effect such 
replacement under this clause (i) during the period of time 
provided herein, then the Company shall promptly give 
notice to the Loan Trustee and shall pay on the Business 
Day next following the thirtieth day after the end of such 
period to the Loan Trustee, in U.S. currency, the amounts 
specified in clause (ii) below; or

(ii) on or before the Loss Payment Date (as defined 
below) the Company shall pay to the Loan Trustee an amount 
in cash which is sufficient to redeem each Outstanding 
Equipment Note pursuant to Section 6.01; provided that the 
Company may, to the extent provided and in accordance with 
Section 3.08 hereof, surrender, to the Loan Trustee for 
cancellation Equipment Notes held by the Company and in 
such event the Company shall be entitled to a credit 
against amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this 
clause (ii). As used herein, "Loss Payment Date" means the 
earliest of (x) 30 days following the date on which 
insurance proceeds are received with respect to such Event 
of Loss, (y) the Business Day next following the 121st day 
next following the date of occurrence of the Event of Loss 
and (z) a Business Day irrevocably specified by the Company 
at least thirty days in advance by notice to the Loan 
Trustee; provided, however, the
<PAGE> 151

50

Loss Payment Date shall be the date specified in the 
proviso to clause (i) above if applicable.

Upon compliance by the Company with the requirements of this 
Section 10(a)(ii), the Loan Trustee shall execute such 
instruments as may be reasonably requested by the Company 
releasing the Airframe and Engines from the Lien of this 
Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase 
Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge thereof 
hereunder.

At the time of or prior to any replacement of the 
Airframe and such Engines pursuant to Section 10(a)(i) of this 
Article, if any, the Company, at its own expense, will (A) 
cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement, substantially 
in the form of Exhibit C hereto for such Replacement Airframe 
and Replacement Engines, if any, to be delivered to the Loan 
Trustee for execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for 
recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act or, if 
necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction 
other than the United States of America in which such 
Replacement Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if any, are to be 
registered in accordance with Section 7(a) of this Article, as 
the case may be, (B) cause a financing statement or statements 
with respect to the Replacement Airframe and Replacement 
Engines, if any, or other requisite documents or instruments, 
to be filed in such place or places as necessary or advisable 
in order to perfect the security interest therein created by or 
pursuant to this Indenture, or, if necessary or advisable, 
pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which 
such Replacement Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if any, are 
to be registered in accordance with Section 7(a) of this 
Article, as the case may be, (C) furnish the Loan Trustee with 
a certificate of an independent aircraft engineer or appraiser 
reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee certifying that the 
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, have a 
value and utility at least equal to, and are in as good 
operating condition as, the Airframe and Engines, if any, so 
replaced assuming the Airframe and Engines were in the 
condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately 
prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss, (D) furnish the 
Loan Trustee with (i) such evidence of compliance with the 
insurance provisions of Section 11 of this Article with respect 
to such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines as the 
Loan Trustee may reasonably request and (ii) a certificate from 
a Responsible Officer of the Company certifying that at the 
time of such
<PAGE> 152

51

replacement, there is no continuing Indenture Event of Default, 
(E) furnish the Loan Trustee with an opinion of the Company's 
counsel (which may be the Company's General Counsel) addressed 
to the Loan Trustee that the substituted property will be 
subject to the Lien of the this Indenture and the Loan Trustee 
should be entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 of the 
United States Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, with respect 
to the Replacement Airframe, provided that (x) such opinion 
need not be delivered to the extent that the benefits of such 
Section 1110 were not, by reason of a change in law or 
governmental interpretation thereof, available to the Loan 
Trustee with respect to the Aircraft immediately prior to such 
substitution and (y) such opinion may contain qualifications of 
the tenor contained in the opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton 
delivered pursuant to Section 4(J) of the Participation 
Agreement on the Delivery Date. In the case of each 
Replacement Airframe and each Replacement Engine, if any, in 
which a security interest has been granted to the Loan Trustee 
under this Section 10, and each Replacement Engine, if any, in 
which a security interest has been granted to the Loan Trustee 
under this Section 10, promptly upon the recordation of the 
Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement covering such 
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, or such 
Replacement Engine pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act (or 
pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which 
such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, or 
such Replacement Engine, are registered in accordance with 
Section 7(a) of this Article), the Company will cause to be 
delivered to the Loan Trustee a favorable opinion of counsel to 
the Company as to the due registration of such Replacement 
Aircraft, the due recordation of such Trust Agreement and 
Indenture Supplement or other requisite documents or 
instruments and the validity and perfection of the security 
interest in the Replacement Airframe, Replacement Engines or 
Replacement Engine, as the case may be, granted to the Loan 
Trustee under this Indenture.

For all purposes hereof, upon grant of a security 
interest therein to the Loan Trustee, each Replacement Aircraft 
and the Replacement Engines, if any, shall be deemed part of 
the property secured hereunder; each such Replacement Airframe 
shall be deemed an "Airframe" as defined herein, and each such 
Replacement Engine shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined 
herein. Upon full compliance with the terms of the previous 
paragraph, the Loan Trustee shall execute and deliver to the 
Company an appropriate instrument releasing such replaced 
airframe and engines (if any) installed thereon at the time 
such Event of Loss occurred from the Lien of this
<PAGE> 153

52

Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase 
Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge hereunder.

(b) Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Upon 
the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine 
under circumstances in which there has not occurred an Event of 
Loss with respect to the Airframe, the Company shall give the 
Loan Trustee prompt written notice thereof and shall, within 90 
days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, convey or 
cause to be conveyed to the Loan Trustee, as replacement for 
the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, a 
security interest in and to a Replacement Engine free and clear 
of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and having a value 
and utility at least equal to, and being in as good operating 
condition as, the Engine with respect to which such Event of 
Loss occurred, assuming such Engine was of the value and 
utility and in the condition and repair required by the terms 
hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of 
Loss. Prior to or at the time of any such conveyance, the 
Company, at its own expense, will (i) cause a Trust Agreement 
and Indenture Supplement substantially in the form of Exhibit C 
hereto or other requisite documents or instruments for such 
Replacement Engine to be delivered to the Loan Trustee for 
execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for recordation 
pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act or, if necessary, pursuant 
to the applicable laws of such jurisdiction other than the 
United States of America in which the Aircraft is or is to be 
registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the case may be, 
(ii) furnish the Loan Trustee with a certificate of an aircraft 
engineer or appraiser (who may be an employee of the Company) 
certifying that such Replacement Engine has a value and utility 
at least equal to, and is in as good operating condition as, 
the Engine so replaced, assuming such Engine was in the 
condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately 
prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss and (iii) cause a 
financing statement or statements with respect to the 
Replacement Engine or other requisite documents or instruments 
to be filed in such place or places necessary or advisable in 
order to perfect the security interest in the Replacement 
Engine created by or pursuant to this Indenture or, if 
necessary or advisable, pursuant to the applicable laws of the 
jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is or is to be registered in 
accordance with Section 7(a), as the case may be, and (iv) 
furnish the Loan Trustee with such evidence of compliance with 
the insurance provisions of Section 11 of this Article with 
respect to such Replacement Engine as the
<PAGE> 154

53

Loan Trustee may reasonably request, and (v) furnish the Loan 
Trustee with an opinion of the Company's counsel (which may be 
the Company's General Counsel) addressed to the Loan Trustee to 
the effect that such substituted property will be subjected to 
the Lien of this Indenture. Upon full compliance by the 
Company with the terms of this paragraph (b), the Loan Trustee 
will transfer to the Company, without recourse or warranty 
(except as to the Trustee's Liens), all of Loan Trustee's 
right, title and interest in and to the Engine with respect to 
which such Event of Loss occurred, and Loan Trustee will assign 
to or as directed by the Company all claims of Loan Trustee 
against third Persons relating to such Engine arising from such 
Event of Loss. In addition, upon such transfer the Loan 
Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Company an appropriate 
instrument releasing such Engine from the Lien of this 
Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase 
Agreement Assignment (in respect of such Engine) from the 
assignment and pledge under this Indenture. For all purposes 
hereof, each such Replacement Engine shall, after such 
conveyance, be deemed part of the property secured hereunder 
and shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein.

(c) Application of Payments from Governmental 
Authorities for Requisition of Title or Use. Any payments 
(other than insurance proceeds the application of which is 
provided for in Section 11 of this Article) received at any 
time by the Loan Trustee or by the Company from any 
governmental authority or other Person with respect to an Event 
of Loss resulting from the condemnation, confiscation, theft or 
seizure of, or requisition of title to or use of, the Airframe 
or any Engine, other than a requisition for use by any 
Government or by the government of registry of the Aircraft not 
constituting an Event of Loss, will be applied as follows:

(i) if such payments are received with respect to the 
Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines 
installed on the Airframe that has been or is being 
replaced by the Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this 
Article, such payments shall be paid over to, or retained 
by, the Loan Trustee, and upon completion of such 
replacement be paid over to, or retained by, the Company;

(ii) if such payments are received with respect to the 
Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines 
installed on the Airframe that has not been and will not be 
replaced pursuant to Section 10(a) of this Article,
<PAGE> 155

54

such payments shall, after reimbursement of the Loan 
Trustee for costs and expenses, be applied in reduction of 
the Company's obligation to pay the amounts required to be 
paid by the Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this 
Article, if not already paid by the Company, or, if already 
paid by the Company, shall be applied to reimburse the 
Company for its payment of such amounts, and the balance, 
if any, of such payments remaining thereafter shall be paid 
over to, and retained by, the Company; and

(iii) if such payments are received with respect to an 
Engine under circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b) of 
this Article, so much of such payments remaining after 
reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and expenses 
shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Company; 
provided that the Company shall have fully performed the 
terms of Section 10(b) of this Article with respect to the 
Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

(d) Requisition for Use by the Government of the 
Airframe and the Engines Installed Thereon. In the event of 
the requisition for use by any Government or by the government 
of the country of registry of the Aircraft (including for this 
purpose any agency or instrumentality thereof), including, 
without limitation, pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet 
Program referred to in Section 7(b)(iv) of this Article of the 
Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on the Airframe, 
the Company shall promptly notify the Loan Trustee of such 
requisition and, except as otherwise provided in this 
Indenture, such requisition shall not constitute an Event of 
Loss and all of the Company's obligations under this Indenture 
with respect to the Aircraft shall continue to the same extent 
as if such requisition had not occurred unless or until such 
requisition shall constitute an Event of Loss. All payments 
received by the Loan Trustee or the Company from the Government 
or government for the use of the Airframe and Engines or 
engines prior to the occurrence of an Event of Loss shall be 
paid over to, or retained by, the Company.

(e) Requisition for Use by the Government of an 
Engine. In the event of the requisition for use by any 
Government or by the government of the country of registry of 
the Aircraft (including for this purpose any agency or 
instrumentality thereof) of any Engine (but not the Airframe), 
the Company will replace such Engine hereunder by
<PAGE> 156

55

complying with the terms of Section 10(b) of this Article to 
the same extent as if an Event of Loss had occurred with 
respect to such Engine, and any payments received by the Loan 
Trustee or the Company from such Government or government with 
respect to such requisition shall be paid over to, or retained 
by, the Company.

(f) Application of Payments During Existence of 
Indenture Event of Default. Any amount referred to in clause 
(i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 10(c), Section 10(d) or 
Section 10(e) of this Article which is payable to the Company 
shall not be paid to the Company, or if it has been previously 
paid directly to the Company, shall not be retained by the 
Company, if at the time of such payment an Indenture Event of 
Default, or an Indenture Default which would constitute an 
Indenture Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), 8.01(f), 
8.01(g), 8.01(h) or 8.01(i), shall have occurred and be 
continuing, but shall be paid to and held by the Loan Trustee 
as security for the obligations of the Company under this 
Indenture, and at such time as there shall not be continuing 
any such Indenture Event of Default or event, such amount shall 
be paid to the Company, provided that, if any such amount has 
been so held by the Loan Trustee as security for more than 90 
days after an Event of Default shall have occurred and during 
which period (x) the Loan Trustee shall not have been limited 
by operation of law or otherwise from exercising remedies 
hereunder and (y) the Loan Trustee shall not have commenced to 
exercise any remedy available to it under this Indenture, then 
such amount shall be paid to the Company.

Section 11. Insurance. (a) Public Liability and 
Property Damage Insurance. Subject to the rights of the 
Company to establish and maintain self-insurance with respect 
to public liability and property damage liability insurance for 
aircraft and engines (including the Aircraft and Engines) in 
the manner and to the extent specified in the next sentence, 
the Company will carry, or cause to be carried, at no expense 
to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, public 
liability (including, without limitation, contractual liability 
and passenger legal liability) and property damage liability 
insurance (exclusive of manufacturer's product liability 
insurance) with respect to the Aircraft (i) in amounts which 
are not less than the public liability and property damage 
insurance applicable to similar aircraft and engines which 
comprise the Company's fleet on which the Company carries 
insurance, provided that such liability insurance shall not be 
less than the amount certified to the
<PAGE> 157

56

Original Loan Participants on the Delivery Date, (ii) of the 
type usually carried by corporations engaged in the same or 
similar business, similarly situated with the Company, and 
owning or operating similar aircraft and engines and covering 
risks of the kind customarily insured against by the Company, 
and (iii) which is maintained in effect with insurers of 
recognized responsibility. The Company may self-insure, by way 
of deductible or premium adjustment provisions in insurance 
policies, the risks required to be insured against pursuant to 
the preceding sentence, but in no case shall the self-insurance 
(including the self-insurance permitted by Section 11(b) of 
this Article) with respect to all of the aircraft and engines 
in the Company's fleet (including, without limitation, the 
Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month policy year the lesser of (x) 
50% of the largest replacement value of any single aircraft in 
the Company's fleet or (y) 1-1/2% of the average aggregate 
insurable value (for the preceding year) of all aircraft 
(including, without limitation, the Aircraft) on which the 
Company carries insurance; provided that, in the event that 
there shall have occurred a material adverse change in the 
financial condition of the Company from such condition as is 
reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the 
Company at December 31, 1982, then, upon not less than 30 days' 
written notice from the Loan Trustee to the Company, the 
Company will, until the Company's financial condition is on an 
overall basis equivalent to its financial condition at December 
31, 1982, reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder to such 
reasonable amount as the Loan Trustee may require; provided, 
further, that a deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce 
handling that, in the case of the Aircraft, is not in excess of 
the amount customarily allowed as a deductible in the industry, 
shall be permitted in addition to the abovementioned 
self-insurance. Any policies of insurance carried in 
accordance with this Section 11(a) and any policies taken out 
in substitution or replacement for any of such policies (A) 
shall name the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee as 
additional insureds as their respective Interests may appear, 
(B) shall provide that in respect of the respective interests 
of the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee in such 
policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action 
or inaction of the Company and shall insure the Loan Trustee's 
and the Pass Through Trustee's Interests as they appear, 
regardless of any breach or violation of any warranty, 
declaration or condition contained in such policies by the 
Company, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is cancelled 
for any reason whatever, or any substantial change is made in 
the policy which affects the coverage certified
<PAGE> 158

57

hereunder to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, or 
if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of 
premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be 
effective as to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee 
for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as is customarily 
obtainable in the industry, in the case of any war risk and 
allied perils coverage) after receipt by the Loan Trustee nor 
the Pass Through Trustee, respectively, of written notice from 
such insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse, (D) shall 
provide that neither the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through 
Trustee shall have any obligation or liability for premiums, 
commissions, assessments or calls in connection with such 
insurance, (E) shall provide that the insurers shall waive (i) 
any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction, 
whether by attachment or otherwise, which they may have against 
the Loan Trustee nor the Pass Through Trustee and (ii) any 
rights of subrogation against the Loan Trustee or the Pass 
Through Trustee to the extent that the Company has waived its 
rights by its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant 
to this Indenture or the Participation Agreement; provided that 
the exercise by such insurers of rights of subrogation derived 
from the rights retained by the Company shall not, in any way, 
delay payment of any claim that would otherwise be payable by 
such insurers but for the existence of rights of subrogation 
derived from rights retained by the Company, (F) shall be 
primary without right of contribution from any other insurance 
which may be carried by the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through 
Trustee with respect to its Interests as such in the Aircraft 
and (G) shall expressly provide that all of the provisions 
thereof, except the limits of liability, shall operate in the 
same manner as if there were a separate policy covering each 
insured. "Interests" as used in this Section 11(a) and Section 
11(b) of this Article with respect to any person means the 
interests of such person in its capacity as Loan Trustee or 
Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, in the transaction 
contemplated by the Participation Agreement and this Indenture. 
The Company shall arrange for appropriate certification that 
the requirements of this Section 11(a) have been met to be made 
to the Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee may furnish such 
certificates to each Loan Participant) as soon as practicable 
by each insurer or its authorized representative with respect 
thereto, provided that all information contained therein shall 
be held confidential by the Loan Trustee and each Loan 
Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to 
anyone other than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, 
agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom any Loan 
Participant is in
<PAGE> 159

58

good faith conducting negotiations relating to the possible 
transfer and sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes, 
if such person shall have entered into an agreement similar to 
that contained in this Section 11(a) whereby such person agrees 
to hold such information confidential, and except as may be 
required by an order of any court or administrative agency or 
by any statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental 
authority. In the case of a lease or contract with any 
Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, or in the 
case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine 
by any Government, a valid agreement, reasonably satisfactory 
to the Loan Trustee, to indemnify the Company against any of 
the risks which the Company is required hereunder to insure 
against by such Government shall be considered adequate 
insurance to the extent of the risks and in the amounts that 
are the subject of any such agreement to indemnify.

(b) Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Aircraft. 
Subject to the rights of the Company to establish and maintain 
self-insurance with respect to loss or damage to aircraft 
(including the Aircraft) in the manner and to the extent 
specified in the next sentence, the Company shall maintain, or 
cause to be maintained, in effect with insurers of recognized 
responsibility, at no expense to the Loan Trustee or the Pass 
Through Trustee, all-risk aircraft hull insurance covering the 
Aircraft and all-risk coverage with respect to any Engines or 
parts while removed from the Aircraft (including, without 
limitation, war risk and allied perils insurance if and to the 
extent the same is maintained by the Company or any Permitted 
Air Carrier leasing the same with respect to other aircraft 
owned or operated by the Company or such Permitted Air Carrier, 
as the case may be, on the same routes) which is of the type 
and in substantially the amount usually carried by corporations 
engaged in the same or similar business and similarly situated 
with the Company; provided that (i) such insurance (including 
the permitted self-insurance) shall at all times while the 
Aircraft is subject to the Lien of this Indenture be for an 
amount not less than, at the date of determination thereof, the 
Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus six 
months interest thereon and (ii) such insurance need not cover 
an Engine while attached to an airframe not owned, leased or 
operated by the Company. The Company may self-insure, by way 
of deductible or premium adjustment provisions in insurance 
policies, the risks required to be insured against pursuant to 
the preceding sentence, but in no case shall the self-insurance 
(including the self-insurance
<PAGE> 160

59

permitted by Section 11(a) of this Article) with respect to all 
of the aircraft and engines in the Company's fleet (including, 
without limitation, the Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month 
policy year the lesser of (i) 50% of the largest replacement 
value of any single aircraft in the Company's fleet or (ii) 
1-1/2% of the average aggregate insurable value (for the 
preceding year) of all aircraft (including, without limitation, 
the Aircraft) on which the Company carries insurance; provided 
that, in the event that there shall have occurred a material 
adverse change in the financial condition of the Company from 
such condition as is reflected in the consolidated financial 
statements of the Company at December 31, 1982, then, upon not 
less than 30 days' written notice from the Loan Trustee to the 
Company, the Company will, until the Company's financial 
condition is on an overall basis equivalent to its financial 
condition at December 31, 1982, reduce the self-insurance 
permitted hereunder to such reasonable amount as the Loan 
Trustee may require; provided, further, that a deductible per 
occurrence utilized to reduce handling that, in the case of the 
Aircraft, is not in excess of the amount customarily allowed as 
a deductible in the industry, shall be permitted in addition to 
the above-mentioned self-insurance. Any policies carried in 
accordance with this Section 11(b) and any policies taken out 
in substitution or replacement for any such policies (A) shall 
provide that any loss up to the amount equal to the Outstanding 
principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest 
thereon, for any loss or damage constituting an Event of Loss 
with respect to the Aircraft, and any loss in excess of 
$7,000,000, up to the amount equal to the Outstanding principal 
amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon, 
for any loss or damage to the Aircraft (or Engines) not 
constituting an Event of Loss with respect to the Aircraft, 
shall be paid to the Loan Trustee as long as this Indenture 
shall not have been discharged pursuant to the terms and 
conditions thereof, and thereafter to the Company, unless, in 
each case, the insurer shall have received notice that an 
Indenture Event of Default exists, in which case all insurance 
proceeds up to an amount equal to the Outstanding principal 
amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon 
shall be payable to the Loan Trustee, (B) shall provide that in 
respect of the respective interests of the Loan Trustee and of 
the Pass Through Trustee in such policies the insurance shall 
not be invalidated by any action or inaction of the Company and 
shall insure the Loan Trustee's and the Pass Through Trustee's 
Interests, as they appear, regardless of any breach or 
violation of any warranty, declaration or condition contained 
in such policies

by the Company, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is 
cancelled for any reason whatever, or any material change is 
made in the policy which affects the coverage certified 
hereunder to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, or 
if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of 
premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be 
effective as to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee 
for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as may from time 
to time be customarily obtainable in the industry, in the case 
of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt by 
the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, respectively, of 
written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, change 
or lapse, (D) shall be primary without right of contribution 
from any other insurance which may be carried by the Loan 
Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee with respect to its 
Interests as such in the Aircraft and (E) shall provide that 
the insurers shall waive (i) any rights of set-off, 
counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by attachment or 
otherwise, which they may have against the Loan Trustee or the 
Pass Through Trustee and (ii) any rights of subrogation against 
the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee to the extent 
that the Company has waived its rights by its agreements to 
indemnify any such party pursuant to this Indenture or the 
Participation Agreement; provided that the exercise by such 
insurers of rights of subrogation derived from rights retained 
by the Company shall not, in any way, delay payment of any 
claim that would otherwise be payable by such insurers but for 
the existence of rights of subrogation derived from rights 
retained by the Company. The Company shall arrange for 
appropriate certification that the requirements of this Section 
11(b) have been met to be made promptly to the Loan Trustee 
(and the Loan Trustee shall furnish such certification to each 
Loan Participant) by each insurer or its authorized 
representative with respect thereto, provided that all 
information contained therein shall be held confidential by the 
Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant and shall not be 
furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other than their bank 
examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and 
any person with whom any Loan Participant is in good faith 
conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and 
sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes, if such person 
shall have entered into an agreement similar to that contained 
in this Section 11(b) whereby such Person agrees to hold such 
information confidential, and except as may be required by an 
order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, 
rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. In 
the
<PAGE> 162

61

case of a lease or contract with any Government in respect of 
the Aircraft or any Engine, or in the case of any requisition 
for use of the Aircraft or any Engine by any Government, a 
valid agreement, reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee, 
to indemnify the Company against any of the risks which the 
Company is required hereunder to insure against by such 
Government in an amount, as at the date of determination 
thereof, equal to the Outstanding principal amount of the 
Equipment Notes plus six months interest thereon from time to 
time shall be considered adequate insurance to the extent of 
the risks and in the amounts that are the subject of any such 
agreement to indemnify.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company it is 
agreed that all insurance payments received under policies 
required to be maintained by the Company hereunder, exclusive 
of any payments received in excess of an amount, as at the date 
of determination thereof, equal to the Outstanding principal 
amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon 
from such policies, as the result of the occurrence of an Event 
of Loss with respect to the Airframe or an Engine will be 
applied as follows:

(x) if such payments are received with respect to the 
Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines 
installed on the Airframe that has been or is being 
replaced by the Company as contemplated by Section 10(a) of 
this Article, such payments shall be paid over to, or 
retained by, the Loan Trustee, and upon completion of such 
replacement be paid over to, or retained by, the Company;

(y) if such payments are received with respect to the 
Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines 
installed thereon that has not been and will not be 
replaced as contemplated by Section 10(a) of this Article, 
so much of such payments remaining after reimbursement of 
the Loan Trustee for costs and expenses as shall not exceed 
an amount, as at the date of determination thereof, equal 
to the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes 
plus accrued interest thereon required to be paid by the 
Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this Article shall be 
applied in reduction of the Company's obligation to pay 
such amount equal to the Outstanding principal amount of 
the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon, if not 
already paid by the Company, or, if already paid by the 
Company, shall be applied to reimburse the Company for
<PAGE> 163

62

its payment of such amount equal to the Outstanding 
principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued 
interest thereon, and the balance, if any, of such payment 
remaining thereafter will be paid over to, or retained by, 
the Company; and

(z) if such payments are received with respect to an 
Engine under the circumstances contemplated by Section 
10(b) of this Article, so much of such payments remaining 
after reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and 
expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by, the 
Company; provided that the Company shall have fully 
performed the terms of Section 10(b) of this Article with 
respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments are 
made.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the 
insurance payment of any property damage loss in excess of an 
amount equal to the Outstanding principal amount of the 
Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon shall be paid to 
the Company.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the 
insurance payments of any property damage loss not constituting 
an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe or an Engine will 
be applied in payment (or to reimburse the Company) for repairs 
or for replacement property in accordance with the terms of 
Sections 7 and 8 of this Article, and any balance remaining 
after compliance with such Sections with respect to such loss 
shall be paid to the Company. Any amount referred to in the 
preceding sentence or in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the second 
preceding paragraph which is payable to the Company shall not 
be paid to the Company or, if it has been previously paid 
directly to the Company, shall not be retained by the Company, 
if at the time of such payment an Indenture Event of Default 
(or an Indenture Default that with lapse of time would 
constitute an Indenture Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), 
8.01(f), 8.01(g), 8.01(h) or 8.01(i) of this Indenture) shall 
have occurred and be continuing, but shall be paid to and held 
by the Loan Trustee, as security for the obligations of the 
Company under this Indenture, and at such time as there shall 
not be continuing any such Indenture Event of Default or event, 
such amount shall be paid to the Company, provided that if any 
such amount has been so held by the Loan Trustee as security 
for more than 90 days after an Indenture Event of Default shall 
have occurred and during which period (i) the Loan Trustee 
shall not have been limited by operation of law
<PAGE> 164

63

or otherwise from exercising remedies hereunder and (ii) the 
Loan Trustee shall not have exercised any remedy available to 
it under Section 15 of this Article, then such amount shall be 
paid to the Company.

(c) Reports, Etc. Annually upon renewal of the 
Company's insurance coverage, the Company will furnish to the 
Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee shall furnish to each Loan 
Participant) a report signed by a firm of independent aircraft 
insurance brokers appointed by the Company, stating the opinion 
of such firm that the insurance then carried and maintained on 
the Aircraft complies with the terms hereof; provided that all 
information contained in such report shall be held confidential 
by the Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant and shall not be 
furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other than their bank 
examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and 
any Person with whom any Loan Participant is in good faith 
conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and 
sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes, if such Person 
shall have entered into an agreement similar to that contained 
in this Section 11(c) whereby such Person agrees to hold such 
information confidential, and except as may be required by an 
order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, 
rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. The 
Company will cause such firm to advise the Loan Trustee and the 
Pass Through Trustee, in writing promptly of any default in the 
payment of any premium and of any other act or omission on the 
part of the Company of which such firm has knowledge and which 
might invalidate or render unenforceable, in whole or in part, 
any insurance on the Aircraft. The Company will also cause 
such firm to advise the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through 
Trustee, in writing as promptly as practicable after such firm 
acquires knowledge that an interruption or reduction of any 
insurance carried and maintained on the Aircraft pursuant to 
the provisions of this Section 11 will occur.

(d) Insurance for Own Account. Nothing in this 
Section 11 shall limit or prohibit the Loan Trustee or the 
Company from obtaining insurance for its own account with 
respect to the Airframe or any Engine and any proceeds payable 
thereunder shall be payable as provided in the insurance policy 
relating thereto, provided that (i) no such insurance may be 
obtained which would limit or otherwise adversely affect the 
coverage or amounts payable under insurance required to be 
maintained pursuant to this Section 11, it being understood 
that all salvage rights to the
<PAGE> 165

64

Airframe or such Engine shall remain with the Company's 
insurers at all times, and (ii) the Loan Trustee may obtain 
hull insurance on the Aircraft only to the extent the 
procurement of such insurance does not have an adverse effect 
on the Company's ability or cost to obtain such insurance, 
except that the limitation in the foregoing clause (i) on the 
Loan Trustee's right to obtain liability insurance shall not 
apply during any period in which the Company is providing a 
Government indemnity in lieu of the liability insurance 
required by Section 11(a) of this Article and the limitations 
in clauses (i) and (ii) on the Loan Trustee's rights to obtain 
hull insurance shall not apply during any period in which the 
Company is providing a Government indemnity in lieu of the hull 
insurance required by Section 11(b) of this Article.

Section 12. Inspection. At all reasonable times so 
long as any Equipment Notes are outstanding, but upon at least 
5 days' prior written notice to the Company, the Loan Trustee 
or its authorized representatives may at their own expense and 
risk (including, without limitation, any risk of personal 
injury or death) conduct a visual walk-around inspection of the 
Aircraft and any Engine and may inspect the books and records 
of the Company relating thereto; provided that (a) such 
representative shall be fully insured to the reasonable 
satisfaction of the Company at no cost to the Company with 
respect to any risks incurred in connection with any such 
inspection, (b) any such inspection shall be subject to the 
safety, security and workplace rules applicable at the location 
where such inspection is conducted and any applicable 
governmental rules or regulations and (c) in the case of an 
inspection during a maintenance visit, such inspection shall 
not in any respect interfere with the normal conduct of such 
maintenance visit or extend the time required for such 
maintenance visit. All information obtained in connection with 
any such inspection shall be held confidential by the Loan 
Trustee and each Loan Participant and shall not be furnished or 
disclosed by them to anyone other than their accountants, 
agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom any such Loan 
Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations relating 
to the possible transfer and sale of such Loan Participant's 
Equipment Notes if such Person shall have entered into an 
agreement similar to that contained in this Section 12 whereby 
such Person agrees to hold such information confidential, and 
except as may be required by an order of any court or 
administrative agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or 
order of any governmental authority. Upon the Loan Trustee's 
request, the
<PAGE> 166

65

Company will notify the Loan Trustee of the next scheduled 
"heavy maintenance" visit to be conducted by the Company in 
respect of the Aircraft; provided that the Company shall have 
the right in its sole discretion to reschedule, or change the 
location of, any maintenance visit of which it shall have 
notified the Loan Trustee pursuant to this sentence, the 
Company hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts to notify the 
Loan Trustee of any such rescheduling or change. The Loan 
Trustee shall not have any duty to make such inspection and 
shall not incur any liability or obligation by reason of not 
making any such inspection. No inspection pursuant to this 
Section 12 shall interfere with the use, operation or 
maintenance of the Aircraft or the normal conduct of the 
Company's business, and the Company shall not be required to 
undertake or incur any additional liabilities in connection 
therewith.

Section 17. Further Assurances; Financial 
Information. Forthwith upon the execution and delivery of each 
Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement, the Company will 
cause such Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement to be duly 
filed and recorded in accordance with the Federal Aviation Act. 
In addition, the Company and the Loan Trustee will promptly 
and duly execute and deliver to the other party hereto such 
further documents and assurances and take such further action 
as such other party may from time to time reasonably request in 
order to effectively carry out the intent and purpose of this 
Indenture, including, without limitation, if requested by the 
Loan Trustee, the execution and delivery of supplements or 
amendments hereto, in recordable form, subjecting to this 
Indenture any Replacement Airframe or Replacement Engine and 
the recording or filing of counterparts hereof or thereof, in 
accordance with the laws of such jurisdictions as the Loan 
Trustee may from time to time deem advisable; provided that 
this sentence is not intended to impose upon the Company any 
additional liabilities not otherwise contemplated by this 
Indenture. The Company agrees to furnish the Loan Trustee (i) 
within 60 days after the end of each of the first three 
quarterly fiscal periods in each fiscal year of the Company, a 
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated 
subsidiaries prepared by it as of the close of such period, 
together with the related consolidated statements of income and 
cash flows for such period, (ii) within 120 days after the 
close of each fiscal year of the Company, a consolidated 
balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries 
as of the close of such fiscal year, together with the related 
consolidated statements of
<PAGE> 167

66

income and cash flows for such fiscal year, as certified by 
independent public accountants, (iii) within 120 days after the 
close of each fiscal year of the Company, a certificate of the 
Company signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company and 
addressed to the Loan Trustee to the effect that the signer has 
reviewed the relevant terms of this Indenture and the 
Participation Agreement and has made, or caused to be made 
under his supervision, a review of the transactions and 
condition of the Company during the accounting period covered 
by the financial statements referred to in clause (ii) above, 
and that such review has not disclosed the existence during 
such accounting period, nor does the signer have knowledge of 
the existence as at the date of such certificate, of any 
condition or event which constitutes an Indenture Event of 
Default or which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would 
constitute an Indenture Event of Default, or, if any such 
condition or event existed or exists, specifying the nature and 
period of existence thereof and what action the Company has 
taken or is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto, 
and (iv) from time to time such other non-confidential 
information as the Loan Trustee may reasonably request.

Section 24. Maintenance of Certain Engines. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an 
aircraft engine which is not an Engine, but which is installed 
on the Airframe, shall be maintained in accordance with Section 
7(a) of this Article.

Section 27. Company's Performance and Rights. Any 
obligation imposed on the Company pursuant to Sections 7, 8, 
11, 12 and 24 of this Article shall require only that the 
Company perform or cause to be performed such obligation, even 
if stated herein as a direct obligation, and the performance of 
any such obligation by any permitted assignee, lessee or 
transferee under an assignment, lease or transfer agreement 
then in effect shall constitute performance by the Company and 
to the extent of such performance, discharge such obligation by 
the Company. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, 
any right granted to the Company in this Indenture shall grant 
the Company the right to exercise such right or permit such 
right to be exercised by any such assignee, lessee or 
transferee; provided that no such assignee, lessee or 
transferee shall be permitted to exercise the self-insurance 
rights of the Company set forth in Section 11 of this Article. 
The inclusion of specific references to obligations or rights 
of any such assignee, lessee or transferee in certain 
provisions of this Indenture shall not
<PAGE> 168

67

in any way prevent or diminish the application of the 
provisions of the two sentences immediately preceding with 
respect to obligations or rights in respect of which specific 
reference to any such assignee, lessee or transferee has not 
been made in this Indenture.

Section 28. Statement of Intention. The Loan 
Trustee, the Company and the Owner Trustee acknowledge that the 
intent of the provisions contained in this Article 15 is, 
following the termination of the Lease pursuant to Section 
9(e), 9(f) or 20(b) thereof, to provide for the Loan Trustee to 
have rights similar to those enjoyed by the Owner Trustee under 
the Lease and for the Company to have rights similar to those 
enjoyed by it under the Lease. The Loan Trustee and the 
Company hereby agree that this Article 15 shall be construed 
and interpreted in a manner consistent with the intent 
expressed in this Section 28.

Section 29. Amendment of Exhibit to the Indenture. 
Each Equipment Note issued after the Relevant Date shall be 
issued in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A to this 
Indenture as originally executed, provided that the following 
legend shall be affixed to each such Equipment Note:

"Pursuant to Section 7.03 of the Trust Indenture and 
Security Agreement, American Airlines, Inc. has assumed all of 
the obligations of the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture 
and Security Agreement and this Equipment Note except such 
obligations as could necessarily be performed exclusively by an 
entity acting in the capacity of the Owner Trustee."

In lieu of issuing Equipment Notes with a legend as described 
in the immediately preceding sentence, at the option of the 
Loan Trustee or if requested by the Company, any Equipment Note 
issued after the Relevant Date shall be substantially in the 
form set forth in Exhibit D-1 to this Indenture.

Section 30. General. Effective as of the Relevant 
Date the Company assumes on a full recourse basis all of the 
duties and obligations of the Owner Trustee under this 
Indenture and the Equipment Notes and shall be entitled to all 
the rights and benefits of the Owner Trustee hereunder and 
thereunder, in each case to the extent provided for in this 
Indenture, and the Owner Trustee is, effective upon the 
Relevant Date, released from all duties, obligations and rights 
under this Indenture and the Equipment Notes (other than any 
obligations or liabilities of the Owner Trustee in
<PAGE> 169

68

its individual capacity incurred on or prior to the Relevant 
Date or arising out of or based upon events occurring on or 
prior to the Relevant Date, which obligations and liabilities 
shall remain the responsibility of the Owner Trustee).

The Company confirms and ratifies the security 
interest which the Owner Trustee granted to the Loan Trustee 
pursuant to the Granting Clause of this Indenture in all of the 
Owner Trustee's right, title and interest in the Aircraft and 
its interest in the Purchase Agreement (to the extent assigned 
to the Owner Trustee pursuant to the Purchase Agreement 
Assignment) and the Company explicitly agrees that the Company 
is acquiring the Aircraft subject to such security interest, 
which shall remain in full force and effect until this 
Indenture is discharged in accordance with the terms hereof, 
and the Loan Trustee acknowledges that the Lease and the 
obligations of the Company hereunder as Company have been 
terminated, except as specifically provided for therein, and 
each of the Company and the Loan Trustee hereby agree that the 
Granting Clause hereof shall, subject always to the provisions 
of Section 28 of Article 15 hereof, be deemed to have been 
modified mutatis mutandis.

All provisions of the Indenture not specifically 
amended by operation of this Exhibit D shall remain in full 
force and effect.

The right of the Loan Participant to institute action 
for any remedy under the Indenture, including the enforcement 
of payment of any amount due hereon, is subject to certain 
restrictions specified in the Indenture.

The Company and the Loan Trustee will be discharged

stolen, lost or mutilated Equipment Notes, maintain paying 
agencies and hold moneys for payment in trust), and the Loan

HABENDUM CLAUSE

TO HAVE AND TO HOLD all and singular the aforesaid

trust for the benefit and security of the Loan Participants 
from time to time, without any priority of any one Equipment

to the terms and provisions set forth in this Agreement.

The Owner Trustee agrees that this Agreement is 
intended to and shall create and grant to the Loan Trustee a

hereunder in the Indenture Estate other than in the Aircraft 
shall attach upon the delivery hereof.

It is expressly agreed that, anything herein contained 
to the contrary notwithstanding, the Owner Trustee shall remain

party to perform all of the obligations assumed by it 
thereunder, all in accordance with and pursuant to the terms 
and provisions thereof, and the Loan Trustee and the Loan 
Participants shall have no obligation or liability under any of 
the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party 
by reason of or arising out of the assignment hereunder, nor

Loan Trustee shall have become the "Lessor"
<PAGE> 13

7

under the Lease) or the Loan Participants be required or 
obligated in any manner to perform or fulfill any obligations 
of the Owner Trustee under or pursuant to any of the Operative 
Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party or, except as 
herein expressly provided, to make any payment, or to make any 
inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received 
by it, or present or file any claim, or take any action to 
collect or enforce the payment of any amounts which may have 
been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time 
or times.

Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Owner 
Trustee does hereby constitute the Loan Trustee the true and 
lawful attorney of the Owner Trustee, irrevocably, with full 
power (in the name of the Owner Trustee or otherwise) to ask, 
require, demand, receive, compound and give acquittance for any 
and all moneys and claims for moneys due and to become due to 
the Owner Trustee (other than Excepted Property) under or 
arising out of the Lease (subject to the provisions of Section 
11.06(b)(1)), the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement 
Assignment, to endorse any checks or other instruments or 
orders in connection therewith and to file any claims or take 
any action or institute any proceedings which the Loan Trustee 
may deem to be necessary or advisable in the premises. The 
Owner Trustee has directed the Company to make all payments of 
Rent (other than Excepted Property) payable to the Owner 
Trustee by the Company and all other amounts which are required 
to be paid to or deposited with the Owner Trustee pursuant to 
the Lease directly to the Loan Trustee at such address as the 
Loan Trustee shall specify, for application as provided in this 
Agreement. The Owner Trustee agrees that promptly on receipt 
thereof, it will transfer to the Loan Trustee any and all 
moneys from time to time received by it constituting part of 
the Indenture Estate, for distribution by the Loan Trustee 
pursuant to this Agreement, except that the Owner Trustee shall 
accept for distribution pursuant to the Trust Agreement any 
amounts distributed to it by the Loan Trustee as expressly 
provided in this Agreement and any Excepted Property.

The Owner Trustee agrees that at any time and from 
time to time, upon the written request of the Loan Trustee, the 
Owner Trustee will promptly and duly execute and deliver or 
cause to be duly executed and delivered to the Loan Trustee any 
and all such further instruments and documents as the Loan 
Trustee may reasonably deem desirable in obtaining the full 
benefits of the mortgage and security interest
<PAGE> 14

granted hereby and of the rights and powers herein granted.

The Owner Trustee does hereby warrant and represent 
that it has not mortgaged, assigned or pledged, and hereby 
covenants that it will not mortgage, assign or pledge, so long 
as the lien of this Agreement shall or is intended to remain in 
effect, any of its right, title or interest subject to the 
mortgage and security interest hereby created, to anyone other 
than the Loan Trustee, and that it will not (other than in 
respect of Excepted Property), except as provided in or 
permitted by this Agreement, accept any payment from the 
Company, enter into an agreement amending or supplementing any 
of the Operative Documents to which it is a party, execute any 
waiver or modification of, or consent under the terms of any of 
the Operative Documents to which it is a party, settle or 
compromise any claim against the Company arising under any of 
the Operative Documents, or submit or consent to the submission 
of any dispute, difference or other matter arising under or in

sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that 
may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer 
or exchange of Equipment Notes.

The Registrar shall not be required (i) to register 
the transfer of or to exchange any Equipment Note during a 
period beginning at the opening of business 15 Business Days 
before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption (or 
purchase in lieu of redemption) of Equipment Notes pursuant to 
Section 6.01 or 6.02 and ending at the close of business on the 
day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or to 
exchange any Equipment Note called for redemption (or purchase

transferred to any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended 
("ERISA"), or individual retirement account or employee benefit 
plan subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, as 
amended (each an "ERISA Plan") or by any other entity whose 
assets constitute assets of an ERISA Plan. The purchase by a 
Person of any Equipment Note
<PAGE> 31

25

constitutes a representation by such Person to the Company, the 
Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee and the Loan Trustee that 
such Person is not an ERISA Plan and that such Person is not 
acquiring, and has not acquired, such Equipment Notes with 
assets of an ERISA Plan.

Section 2.05. Loan Participant Lists; Ownership of 
Equipment Notes. (a) The Loan Trustee shall preserve in as 
current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent 
list available to it of the names and addresses of Loan 
Participants. If the Loan Trustee is not the Registrar, the 
Registrar shall furnish (and the Owner Trustee shall cause the 
Registrar to furnish) to the Loan Trustee semiannually on or 
before each Interest Payment Date, and at such other times as 
the Loan Trustee may request in writing, a list, in such form 
and as of such date as the Loan Trustee may reasonably require, 
containing all the information in the possession or control of 
the Registrar as to the names and addresses of Loan 
Participants.

(b) Ownership of the Equipment Notes shall be proved 
by the Register kept by the Registrar. Prior to due 
presentment for registration of transfer of any Equipment Note, 
the Owner Trustee, the Loan Trustee, the Paying Agent and the 
Registrar shall deem and treat the Person in whose name any 
Equipment Note is registered as the absolute owner of such 
Equipment Note for the purpose of receiving 
payment of principal (including, subject to the provisions 
herein regarding the applicable record dates, Installment 
Payment Amounts) of, premium, if any, and (subject to the 
provisions herein regarding the applicable record dates) 
interest on such Equipment Note and for all other purposes 
whatsoever, whether or not such Equipment Note is overdue, and 
none of the Owner Trustee, the Loan Trustee, the Paying Agent 
or the Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Section 2.06. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen 
Equipment Notes. If any Equipment Note shall become mutilated, 
destroyed, lost or stolen, the Owner Trustee shall, upon the 
written request of the related Loan Participant, issue and 
execute, and the Loan Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, 
in replacement thereof, a new Equipment Note of the same type, 
having the same Maturity Date, payable to the same Loan 
Participant in the same principal amount and dated the same 
date as the Equipment Note so mutilated, destroyed, lost or 
stolen. If the Equipment Note being replaced has become 
mutilated, such
<PAGE> 32

26

Equipment Note shall be surrendered to the Loan Trustee. If 
the Equipment Note being replaced has been destroyed, lost or 
stolen, the related Loan Participant shall furnish to the Owner 
Trustee and the Loan Trustee such security or indemnity as may 
be required by each of them to save the Owner Trustee and the 
Loan Trustee harmless and evidence satisfactory to the Owner 
Trustee and the Loan Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft 
of such Equipment Note and of the ownership thereof.

Section 2.07. Cancellation. The Registrar and any 
Paying Agent shall forward to the Loan Trustee all Equipment 
Notes surrendered to them for replacement, redemption,

payment or cancellation and shall destroy cancelled Equipment 
Notes.

Interest. (a) The Loan Trustee will arrange directly with any 
Paying Agent for the payment, or the Loan Trustee will make 
payment, all pursuant to Section 2.09, of the principal of, 
premium, if any, and interest on or in respect of the Equipment 
Notes. Payments on the Equipment Notes in respect of interest 
and Installment Payment Amounts, if any, payable on an 
Installment Payment Date, shall be paid in immediately 
available funds in U.S. currency on each Interest Payment Date 
or Installment Payment Date, as the case may be, to the Loan 
Participant in whose name such Equipment Note is registered on 
the Register at the close of business on the relevant Record 
Date; provided, however, that the Paying Agent will, at the 
request of the Loan Trustee, and may, at its option, pay such 
interest or Installment Payment Amounts by check mailed to such 
Loan Participant's address as it appears on the Register. 
Principal of Equipment Notes payable on the Maturity Date of 
such Equipment Note and premium, if any, with respect thereto 
shall be payable only against presentation and surrender 
thereof at the principal corporate trust office of the Loan 
Trustee or at the office of the Paying Agent maintained for 
such purpose pursuant to Section 2.03.

A Loan Participant shall have no further interest in, 
or other right with respect to, the Indenture Estate when and 
if the principal amount of, premium, if any, and interest on 
all Equipment Notes held by such Loan Participant and all other 
sums payable to such Loan Participant hereunder, under such 
Equipment Notes and under the Participation Agreement
<PAGE> 33

27

(b) Any Installment Payment Amount payable on an 
Installment Payment Date, or any interest payable on an 
Interest Payment Date on any Equipment Note which is not 
punctually paid on, or within 5 days after, such Installment 
Payment Date or such Interest Payment Date, as the case may be 
(herein called, respectively, a "Defaulted Installment" and 
"Defaulted Interest"), shall forthwith cease to be payable to 
the Loan Participant on the relevant Record Date by virtue of 
its having been such Loan Participant; and such Defaulted 
Installment or Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Loan 
Trustee, at its election in each case, as provided in clause 
(1) or (2) below:

(1) The Loan Trustee may elect to make payment of any 
Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest to the Person 
in whose name such Equipment Note is registered at the 
close of business on a special record date for the payment 
of such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest, which 
shall be fixed in the following manner. The Loan Trustee 
shall notify the Paying Agent in writing of the amount of 
the Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest proposed to 
be paid on each such Equipment Note and the date of the 
proposed payment, and at the same time the Loan Trustee 
shall make arrangements to set aside an amount of money 
equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in 
respect of such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted 
Interest, prior to the date of the proposed payment, to be 
held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to 
such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest as this 
clause provides and shall fix a special record date for the 
payment of such Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest 
which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 
days prior to the date of the proposed payment. The Loan 
Trustee shall promptly notify the Owner Trustee and the 
Registrar of such special record date and shall cause 
notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted 
Installment or Defaulted Interest and the special record 
date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to 
each Loan Participant entitled thereto at such Loan 
Participant's address as it appears in the Register, not 
less than 10 days prior to such special record date.

Installment or Defaulted Interest and the special record 
date therefor having been mailed, as aforesaid, such 
Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest shall be paid 
to the
<PAGE> 34

28

Persons in whose names the applicable Equipment Note are 
registered on such special record date and shall no longer 
be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).

(2) The Loan Trustee may make, or cause to be made, 
payment of any Defaulted Installment or Defaulted Interest 
in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the 
requirements of any securities exchange on which Equipment 
Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be 
required by such exchange, if such payment shall be deemed 
practicable by the Loan Trustee.

(c) The Loan Trustee shall require each Paying Agent 
to agree in writing that such Paying Agent will hold in trust, 
for the benefit of the Loan Participants and the Loan Trustee, 
all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal 
of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Equipment Notes 
payable to the Loan Participants hereunder, and shall give to 
the Loan Trustee notice of any default by any obligor upon the 
Equipment Notes in the making of any such payment upon the 
Equipment Notes. The Loan Trustee at any time may require a 
Paying Agent to repay to the Loan Trustee all money held by it. 
Upon so doing the Paying Agent shall have no further liability 
for the money so paid.

Non-Recourse Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision 
herein or in the Equipment Notes to the contrary, all amounts 
payable by the Loan Trustee and the Owner Trustee under the 
Equipment Notes and this Agreement shall be made only from the 
income and proceeds of the Indenture Estate and each Loan 
Participant, by its acceptance of such Equipment Note, agrees 
that (a) it will look solely to the income and proceeds of the 
Indenture Estate for the payment of such amounts, to the extent 
available for distribution to it as herein provided, and (b) 
none of the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant or the Loan 
Trustee is or shall be personally liable to any Loan 
Participant for any amount payable under such Equipment Note or 
this Agreement or, except as expressly provided in this 
Agreement in the case of the Owner Trustee and the Loan 
Trustee, for any liability thereunder or hereunder.

Wilmington Trust Company is entering into this 
Agreement solely as Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement and 
not in its individual capacity, and in no case whatsoever shall 
Wilmington Trust Company (or any entity acting as successor 
trustee under the Trust Agreement) be personally

capacity under Section 8 of the Participation Agreement, (ii) 
for the performance of its agreements undertaken in its 
individual capacity under Section 9 of the Refunding Agreement 
and (iii) for its own willful misconduct or gross negligence.

Agreement, such successor Owner Trustee shall, without any 
further act, succeed to all of the rights, duties, immunities 
and obligations hereunder, and its predecessor Owner Trustee 
and Wilmington Trust Company shall be released from all further 
duties and obligations hereunder, without prejudice to any

provided that (A) the Owner Trustee shall have received written 
consent to such redemption from the Company prior to the giving 
of such notice and (B) all outstanding equipment notes then 
held in the same Pass Through Trust are simultaneously being 
redeemed, each Outstanding Equipment Note having the maturity 
designated by the Owner Trustee in such notice shall be 
redeemed at a Redemption Price equal to the aggregate unpaid 
principal amount thereof together with accrued but unpaid 
interest thereon to, but not including, the applicable 
Redemption Date plus, in the case of each Equipment Note 
redeemed prior to the Premium Termination Date applicable to 
such Equipment Note, a premium, equal to the Make-Whole Amount, 
if any, and otherwise without premium. The Redemption Date for 
Equipment Notes to be redeemed pursuant to this clause (3) 
shall be the date designated in the notice of the Owner 
Trustee, which shall be a Business Day. If the Owner Trustee 
elects to purchase the Equipment Notes under Section 
8.03(e)(ii), nothing herein, including the use of the terms 
"Redemption Date" and "Redemption Price" shall be deemed to 
result in a redemption of the Equipment Notes.

Section 6.02. Redemption or Purchase of Equipment 
Notes upon Certain Indenture Events of Default. If the Owner 
Trustee or the Owner Participant gives the notice specified in 
Section 8.03(e)(ii), then each Outstanding Equipment Note shall 
be redeemed (or purchased in lieu of redemption) in whole at a 
Redemption Price equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount 
thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to 
but excluding the applicable Redemption Date, but without a 
premium. The Redemption Date for Equipment Notes to be 
redeemed (or purchased in lieu of redemption) pursuant to this 
Section 6.02 shall be the date specified in the notice given by 
the Owner Trustee to the Loan Trustee pursuant to Section 
8.03(e)(ii). If the Owner Trustee elects to purchase the 
Equipment Notes under Section 8.03(e)(ii), nothing herein, 
including the use of the terms "Redemption Date" and 
"Redemption Price", shall be deemed to result in a redemption 
of the Equipment Notes.

to the Equipment Notes shall be given by first-class mail, 
postage prepaid, mailed not less than 25 nor more than 60 days 
prior to the Redemption Date, to each Loan Participant of such 
Equipment Notes to be redeemed or purchased, at such Loan 
Participant's address appearing in the Register; provided that, 
in the case of a redemption to be made pursuant to Section 
6.01(b), such notice shall be revocable and shall be deemed 
revoked in the event that the Lease does not in fact terminate 
on the Lease Termination Date or if notice of such redemption 
shall have been given in connection with a refinancing of 
Equipment Notes and the Loan Trustee receives written notice of 
such revocation from the Company or the Owner Trustee not later 
than three days prior to the Redemption Date.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date,

(2) the applicable basis for determining the 
Redemption Price,

(3) that on the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price 
will become due and payable upon each such Equipment Note, 
and that, if any such Equipment Notes are then Outstanding, 
interest on such Equipment Notes shall cease to accrue on 
and after such Redemption Date, and

(4) the place or places where such Equipment Notes 
are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price.

Notice of redemption or purchase of Equipment Notes to be 
redeemed or purchased shall be given by the Loan Trustee.

Section 6.04. Deposit of Redemption Price. On or 
before the Redemption Date, the Owner Trustee (or any person 
on behalf of the Owner Trustee) shall, to the extent an amount 
equal to the Redemption Price for the Equipment Notes to be 
redeemed or purchased on the Redemption Date shall not then be 
held in the Indenture Estate, deposit or cause to be deposited 
with the Loan Trustee or the Paying Agent by 12:00 Noon on the 
Redemption Date in immediately available funds the Redemption 
Price of the Equipment Notes to be redeemed or purchased.

Section 6.05. Equipment Notes Payable on Redemption 
Date. Notice of redemption or purchase having been given as 
aforesaid (and not deemed revoked as contemplated in the
<PAGE> 46

40

proviso to Section 6.03), the Equipment Notes to be redeemed or 
purchased shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable 
at the principal corporate trust office of the Loan Trustee or 
at any office or agency maintained for such purposes pursuant 
to Section 2.03, and from and after such Redemption Date 
(unless there shall be a default in the payment of the 
Redemption Price) any such Equipment Notes then Outstanding 
shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such 
Equipment Note for redemption or purchase in accordance with 
said notice such Equipment Note shall be paid at the Redemption 
Price.

If any Equipment Note called for redemption or 
purchase shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for 
redemption, the principal amount thereof shall, until paid, 
continue to bear interest from the applicable Redemption Date 
at the interest rate in effect for such Equipment Note as of 
such Redemption Date.

Section 7.02. Change in Registration. The Loan 
Trustee shall upon the request of the Company consent to the 
deregistration of the Aircraft under the laws of the

provided that the following conditions are met:

(a) such change in registration complies with the 
provisions of the Lease;

(b) no Lease Event of Default and no event which, 
with lapse of time or notice, or both, would become a Lease 
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at 
the date of such request or at the effective date of the 
change in registration, provided that it shall not be 
necessary to comply with this condition (b) if the change 
in registration results in the registration of the Aircraft 
under the laws of the United States of America or if the 
Loan Trustee in its discretion believes the change in 
registration would be advantageous to the Loan 
Participants;

(c) the Loan Trustee shall have received an opinion 
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to it to the effect 
that:

(i) after giving effect to the change in 
registration, the Lien on the Aircraft and the other 
property included in the Indenture Estate shall 
continue as a fully-perfected lien and all filing, 
recording or other action necessary to perfect and 
protect the lien of this Indenture has been 
accomplished (or if such opinion cannot be given at 
the time by which the Loan Trustee has been requested 
to consent to a change in registration, (x) the 
opinion shall detail what filing, recording or other 
action is necessary and (y) the Loan Trustee shall 
have received a certificate from the Company that all 
possible preparations to accomplish such filing, 
recording and other action shall have been done, and 
such filing, recording and other action shall be 
accomplished and a supplemental opinion to that effect 
shall be delivered to the Loan Trustee on or prior to 
the effective date of the change in registration); and

(ii) the terms of the Lease and this Agreement

42

valid and binding and enforceable in such 
jurisdiction, except as the same may be limited by 
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, 
moratorium or similar laws affecting the rights of 
creditors generally and by general principles of 
equity, and except as limited by applicable laws which 
may affect the remedies provided in the Lease and this 
Agreement, respectively, which laws, however, do not 
in the opinion of such counsel make the remedies 
provided in the Lease and this Agreement, 
respectively, inadequate for the practical realization 
of the rights and benefits provided thereby;

(d) the Loan Trustee shall have received assurances 
reasonably satisfactory to it that the insurance provisions 
of the Lease will have been complied with after giving 
effect to such change in registration; and

(e) the Company shall have paid or made provision 
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee for the payment of all 
expenses connected with such change in registration. 

The Loan Trustee shall execute such documents as the Company or 
the Owner Trustee shall reasonably request in order to satisfy 
the above conditions and upon satisfaction of such conditions 
to effect the change in registration.

with such purchase and assumption;

(b) no Indenture Default after giving effect to the 
Relevant Amendment (as defined below) pursuant to clause 
(x) below shall have occurred and be continuing
<PAGE> 49

43

immediately subsequent to such purchase or assumption and 
the Loan Trustee shall have received a certificate, dated 
the Relevant Date, of a Responsible Company Officer to such 
effect;

(c) the Loan Trustee shall have received, on or prior 
to the Relevant Date, evidence of all filings, recordings 
and other action referred to in the Opinion or Opinions of 
Counsel referred to below; and 

(d) the Loan Trustee shall have received an Opinion 
or Opinions of Counsel for the Company, dated the Relevant 
Date, which without unusual qualification shall be to the 
effect that, after giving effect to the Relevant Amendment 
(as defined below):

(i) this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid 
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable 
against the Company in accordance with its terms, 
except as the same may be limited by applicable 
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or 
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors 
generally and by general principles of equity, and 
except as limited by applicable laws which may affect 
the remedies provided for in this Agreement, which 
laws, however, do not in the opinion of such counsel 
make the remedies provided for in this Agreement 
inadequate for the practical realization of the rights 
and benefits provided for in this Agreement;

(ii) the Aircraft is duly registered in 
compliance with applicable law under the laws of the 
jurisdiction in which the Aircraft was registered 
immediately prior to such purchase and assumption;

(iii) the Lien on the Aircraft constitutes a 
fully-perfected Lien and all filing, recording or 
other action (specifying the same) necessary to 
perfect and protect the Lien of this Agreement has 
been accomplished; and

(iv) the Loan Trustee should, for the reasons set 
forth in such opinion, be entitled to the benefits of 
Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to 
the Aircraft; provided that such opinion need not be 
delivered to the extent that the benefits of Section 
1110 of the Bankruptcy Code are
<PAGE> 50

44

not available to the Loan Trustee with respect to the 
Aircraft immediately prior to such assumption; and 
provided further that such opinion may contain 
qualifications of the tenor contained in the opinion 
of Debevoise & Plimpton delivered pursuant to Section 
3(k) of the Refunding Agreement on the Refunding Date 
(other than the "true" lease assumption);

then, automatically and without the requirement of further 
action by any Person, effective as of the Relevant Date:

(x) this Agreement shall be deemed to have been 
amended as provided for in Exhibit D hereto (the "Relevant 
Amendment"); and

(y) the Owner Trustee shall be released from all of 
its obligations under this Agreement in respect of the 
Equipment Notes or otherwise (other than any obligations or 
liabilities of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity 
incurred on or prior to the Relevant Date or arising out of 
or based upon events occurring on or prior to the Relevant 
Date, which obligations and liabilities shall remain the 
sole responsibility of the Owner Trustee).

longer period (not to exceed 180 days) during which the 
Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant, as the case may be, 
is diligently proceeding to remedy such failure and 
provided further that the Owner Trustee or the Owner

Section 8.02. Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment. 
If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the

the Owner Participant, may declare the principal of all the 
Equipment Notes to be due and payable. Upon such declaration, 
the principal of all Equipment Notes, together with accrued 
interest thereon from the date in respect of which interest was 
last paid hereunder to the date payment of such principal has 
been made or duly provided for, shall be immediately due and 
payable. At any time after such declaration and prior to the 
sale or disposition of the Indenture Estate, Loan Participants 
owning a majority in aggregate principal amount of all of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes, by notice to the Loan Trustee, the 
Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant, may rescind such a 
declaration and thereby annul its consequences if (i) an amount 
sufficient to pay all principal of, premium, if any, and 
interest on, such Equipment Notes, to the extent each such 
amount is due or past due, if any, in respect of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes other than by reason of such 
acceleration and all sums due and payable to the Loan Trustee 
has been deposited with the Loan Trustee, (ii) the rescission 
would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (iii) all 
existing Indenture Defaults and Indenture Events of Default 
under this Agreement have been cured or waived except 
nonpayment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the 
Equipment Notes that has become due solely because of such 
acceleration. No premium shall be payable on the Equipment 
Notes as a result of the acceleration of the Equipment Notes.

Section 8.03. Other Remedies Available to Loan 
Trustee. (a) After an Indenture Event of Default shall have 
occurred and so long as such Indenture Event of Default shall 
be continuing, then and in every such case the Loan Trustee, as 
trustee of an express trust and as assignee hereunder of the 
Lease or as holder of a security interest in the Aircraft, 
Airframe or Engines or otherwise, may, and when required 
pursuant to the provisions of Article 9 shall, exercise subject 
to Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 8.03(h), upon ten 
(10) Business days prior notice to the Owner Trustee and the 
Owner Participant (if not precluded by
<PAGE> 55

49

law or otherwise) any or all of the rights and powers and 
pursue any and all of the remedies accorded to the Owner 
Trustee pursuant to this Article 8 (and in the event that such 
Indenture Event of Default is also a Lease Event of Default, 
pursuant to Section 15 of the Lease), may recover judgment in 
its own name as Loan Trustee against the Indenture Estate and 
may take possession of all or any part of the Indenture Estate 
and may exclude the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant and 
all persons claiming under any of them wholly or partly.

(b) After an Indenture Event of Default shall have 
occurred and so long as such Indenture Event of Default shall 
be continuing, subject to Sections 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 
8.03(h), the Loan Trustee may, if at the time such action may 
be lawful and always subject to compliance with any mandatory 
legal requirements, either with or without taking possession, 
and either before or after taking possession, and without 
instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, and having first 
given notice of such sale by registered mail to the Owner 
Trustee, the Owner Participant and the Company once at least 10 
Business Days prior to the date of such sale, and any other 
notice which may be required by law, sell and dispose of the 
Indenture Estate, or any part thereof, or interest therein, at 
public auction to the highest bidder, in one lot as an entirety 
or in separate lots, and either for cash or on credit and on 
such terms as the Loan Trustee may determine, and at any place 
(whether or not it be the location of the Indenture Estate or 
any part thereof) and time designated in the notice above 
referred to; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any 
provision herein to the contrary, the Loan Trustee may not 
provide the notice provided for above of its intention to sell 
any of the Indenture Estate, exercise remedies under the Lease 
or exercise other remedies against the Indenture Estate, in 
each case seeking to deprive the Owner Participant of its 
interest therein unless a declaration of acceleration has been 
made pursuant to Section 8.02. Any such sale or sales may be 
adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and 
place appointed for such sale or sales, or by announcement at 
the time and place appointed for any such adjourned sale or 
sales, without further notice, and the Loan Trustee and any 
Loan Participant may bid and become the purchaser at any such 
sale. The Loan Trustee may exercise such right without 
possession or production of the Equipment Notes or proof of 
ownership thereof, and as representative of the Loan 
Participants may exercise such right without notice to the Loan 
Participants or including the Loan Participants as parties to 
any suit or proceeding relating to foreclosure of
<PAGE> 56

50

any property in the Indenture Estate. The Owner Trustee hereby 
irrevocably constitutes the Loan Trustee the true and lawful 
attorney-in-fact of the Owner Trustee (in the name of the Owner 
Trustee or otherwise) for the purpose of effectuating any sale, 
assignment, transfer or delivery for enforcement of the lien 
created under this Agreement, whether pursuant to foreclosure 
or power of sale or otherwise, to execute and deliver all such 
bills of sale, assignments and other instruments as the Loan 
Trustee may consider necessary or appropriate, with full power 
of substitution, the Owner Trustee hereby ratifying and 
confirming all that such attorney or any substitute shall 
lawfully do by virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested by 
the Loan Trustee or any purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall 
ratify and confirm any such sale, assignment, transfer or 
delivery, by executing and delivering to the Loan Trustee or 
such purchaser all bills of sale, assignments, releases and 
other proper instruments to effect such ratification and 
confirmation as may be designated in any such request.

(c) Subject to Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 
8.03(h), if an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, the Owner Trustee shall, at the request of the Loan 
Trustee, promptly execute and deliver to the Loan Trustee such 
instruments of title or other documents as the Loan Trustee may 
deem necessary or advisable to enable the Loan Trustee or an 
agent or representative designated by the Loan Trustee, at such 
time or times and place or places as the Loan Trustee may 
specify, to obtain possession of all or any part of the 
Indenture Estate. If the Owner Trustee shall for any reason 
fail to execute and deliver such instruments and documents 
after such request by the Loan Trustee, the Loan Trustee shall 
be entitled to a judgment for specific performance of the 
covenants contained in the foregoing sentence, conferring upon 
the Loan Trustee the right to immediate possession and 
requiring the Owner Trustee or the Company or both to execute 
and deliver such instruments and documents to the Loan Trustee. 
The Loan Trustee shall also be entitled to pursue all or any 
part of the Indenture Estate wherever it may be found and may 
enter any of the premises of the Owner Trustee or any other 
Person wherever the Indenture Estate may be or be supposed to 
be and search for the Indenture Estate and take possession of 
any item of the Indenture Estate pursuant to this Section 
8.03(c). The Loan Trustee may, from time to time, at the 
expense of the Indenture Estate, make all such expenditures for 
maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, 
additions and improvements to and of the Indenture Estate, as 
it may deem proper. In each such case, the Loan Trustee shall 
have the
<PAGE> 57

51

right to use, operate, store, lease, control or manage the 
Indenture Estate, and to exercise all rights and powers of the 
Owner Trustee relating to the Indenture Estate as the Loan 
Trustee shall deem appropriate, including the right to enter 
into any and all such agreements with respect to the use, 
operation, storage, leasing, control or management of the 
Indenture Estate or any part thereof; and the Loan Trustee 
shall be entitled to collect and receive directly all tolls, 
rents (including Rent), issues, profits, products, revenues and 
other income of the Indenture Estate and every part thereof, 
without prejudice, however, to the right of the Loan Trustee 
under any provision of this Agreement to collect and receive 
all cash held by, or required to be deposited with, the Loan 
Trustee hereunder. In accordance with the terms of this 
Section 8.03(c), such tolls, rents (including Rent), issues, 
profits, products, revenues and other income shall be applied 
to pay the expenses of using, operating, storing, leasing, 
controlling or managing the Indenture Estate, and of all 
maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, 
additions and improvements, and to make all payments which the 
Loan Trustee may be required or may elect to make, if any, for 
taxes, assessments, insurance or other proper charges upon the 
Indenture Estate or any part thereof (including the employment 
of engineers and accountants to examine, inspect and make 
reports upon the properties and books and records of the Owner 
Trustee and, to the extent permitted by the Lease, the 
Company), and all other payments which the Loan Trustee may be 
required or authorized to make under any provision of this 
Agreement, including this Section 8.03(c), as well as just and 
reasonable compensation for the services of the Loan Trustee, 
and of all persons properly engaged and employed by the Loan 
Trustee.

If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is 
continuing and the Loan Trustee shall have obtained possession 
of or title to the Aircraft, the Loan Trustee shall not be 
obligated to use or operate the Aircraft or cause the Aircraft 
to be used or operated directly or indirectly by itself or 
through agents or other representatives or to lease, license or 
otherwise permit or provide for the use or operation of the 
Aircraft by any other Person unless (i) the Loan Trustee shall 
have been able to obtain insurance in kinds, at rates and in 
amounts satisfactory to it in its discretion to protect the 
Indenture Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and 
individually, against any and all liability for loss or damage 
to the Aircraft and for public liability and property damage
<PAGE> 58

52

resulting from use or operation of the Aircraft and (ii) funds 
are available in the Indenture Estate to pay for all such 
insurance or, in lieu of such insurance, the Loan Trustee is 
furnished with indemnification from the Loan Participants or 
any other Person upon terms and in amounts satisfactory to the 
Loan Trustee in its discretion to protect the Indenture Estate 
and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and individually, against any 
and all such liabilities.

(d) Subject to Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(e), 8.03(f) and 
8.03(h), the Loan Trustee may proceed to protect and enforce 
this Agreement and the Equipment Notes by suit or suits or 
proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy, and whether for 
the specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein 
contained or in execution or aid of any power herein granted, 
or for foreclosure hereunder, or for the appointment of a 
receiver or receivers for the Indenture Estate or any part 
thereof, or for the recovery of judgment for the indebtedness 
secured by the Lien created under this Agreement or for the 
enforcement of any other proper, legal or equitable remedy 
available under applicable law.

(e) (i) If the Company shall fail to make any 
payment of Basic Rent under the Lease when the same shall 
become due, and if such failure of the Company to make such 
payment of Basic Rent shall not constitute the fourth or 
subsequent consecutive such failure or the seventh or 
subsequent cumulative such failure, then as long as no 
Indenture Event of Default (other than arising from a Lease 
Event of Default) shall have occurred and be continuing, the 
Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee may (but need not) pay 
to the Loan Trustee, at any time prior to the day which is the 
thirtieth day subsequent to notice of such failure by the Loan 
Trustee to the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant (and the 
Loan Trustee shall not (without the prior written consent of 
the Owner Trustee) declare the Lease in default pursuant to 
Section 15 thereof or exercise any of the rights, powers or 
remedies pursuant to such Section 15 or this Article 8 prior to 
the occurrence of such date), an amount equal to the full 
amount of such payment of Basic Rent, together with any 
interest due thereon on account of the delayed payment thereof 
to the date of such payment (without regard to any 
acceleration), and such payment by the Owner Participant or the 
Owner Trustee shall be deemed to cure as of the date of such 
payment any Indenture Event of Default which arose from such 
failure of the Company (including any Lease Event of Default 
arising from the Company's failure to pay interest in respect 
of such overdue Basic Rent for the
<PAGE> 59

53

period commencing on the date of such payment), but such cure 
shall not relieve the Company of any of its obligations. If 
the Company shall fail to perform or observe any covenant, 
condition or agreement to be performed or observed by it under 
the Lease other than the payment of Basic Rent, and if (but 
only if) the performance or observance thereof can be effected 
by the payment of money alone (it being understood that actions 
such as the obtaining of insurance and the procurement of 
maintenance services can be so effected), then as long as no 
other Indenture Event of Default (other than those arising from 
a Lease Event of Default) shall have occurred and be 
continuing, the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee may (but 
need not) pay to the Loan Trustee (or to such other person as 
may be entitled to receive the same), at any time prior to the 
day which is the thirtieth day subsequent to notice of such 
failure by the Loan Trustee to the Owner Trustee or the Owner 
Participant (or such longer period ending on the second day 
after the expiry of the applicable grace period specified in 
the Lease with respect to such default) (and the Loan Trustee 
shall not (without the prior written consent of the Owner 
Trustee) declare the Lease in default pursuant to Section 15 
thereof or exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies 
pursuant to such Section 15 or this Article 8 prior to the 
occurrence of such date), all sums necessary to effect the 
performance or observance of such covenant or agreement of the 
Company, together with any interest due thereon on account of 
the delayed payment thereof to the date of such payment, and 
such payment by the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee 
shall be deemed to cure as of the date of such payment any 
Indenture Event of Default which arose from such failure of the 
Company (including any Lease Event of Default arising from the 
Company's failure to pay interest in respect of such overdue 
payment for the period commencing on the date of such payment), 
but such cure shall not relieve the Company of any of its 
obligations. Upon any payment of Basic Rent by the Owner 
Participant or the Owner Trustee in accordance with the first 
sentence of this Section 8.03(e)(i), or upon any payment of any 
other sums by the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee in 
accordance with the second sentence of this Section 8.03(e)(i), 
then any declaration pursuant to Section 15 of the Lease that 
the Lease is in default, and any declaration pursuant to this 
Indenture that the Equipment Notes are due and payable or that 
an Indenture Event of Default exists, based upon such Lease 
Event of Default, shall be deemed rescinded, and the Owner 
Participant or the Owner Trustee shall, to the extent of their 
respective payments, be subrogated, in the case of any such 
payment in accordance
<PAGE> 60

54

with such first sentence, to the rights of the Loan Trustee, as 
assignee hereunder of the Owner Trustee, or, in the case of any 
such payment in accordance with such second sentence, to the 
rights of the Loan Trustee or such other person, as the case 
may be, which actually received such payment, to receive such 
payment of Basic Rent or such other payment, as the case may be 
(and any interest due thereon on account of the delayed payment 
thereof), and shall be entitled to receive such payment upon 
its receipt by the Loan Trustee or such other person, as 
aforesaid (but in each case only if all amounts of principal 
of, and interest at the time due and payable on, the Equipment 
Notes together with interest due thereon on account of the 
delayed payment thereof shall have been paid in full); provided 
that neither the Owner Participant nor the Owner Trustee shall 
attempt to recover any such amount paid by it on behalf of the 
Company pursuant to this Section 8.03(e)(i) except by demanding 
of the Company payment of such amount or by commencing an 
action against the Company to require the payment of such 
amount.

(ii) At any time (a) one or more Lease Events of 
Default shall have occurred and shall have continued for a 
period of 180 days or more or (b) the Equipment Notes shall 
have been accelerated pursuant to Section 8.02, the Owner 
Trustee or the Owner Participant may, at its option, give at 
least 30 days' prior irrevocable notice to the Loan Trustee 
that it will redeem (or purchase in lieu of redemption) all 
Equipment Notes then Outstanding, which redemption or purchase 
shall be pursuant to Section 6.02 and concurrently with such 
notice, the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant will deposit 
with the Loan Trustee an amount sufficient to redeem or 
purchase at the applicable Redemption Price determined 
consistently with the applicable provisions of Article 6 all 
Equipment Notes then Outstanding and to pay the Loan Trustee 
all amounts then due it hereunder, which funds shall be held by 
the Loan Trustee as provided in Section 9.03. Upon the giving 
of such notice and the receipt by the Loan Trustee of such 
deposit, the Loan Trustee shall deem all instructions received 
from the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant as having been 
given by the Loan Participants of 100% of the Outstanding 
principal amount of Equipment Notes for all purposes of this 
Indenture. If such notice is given, the Owner Trustee further 
agrees that it will, if necessary, deposit or cause to be 
deposited with the Loan Trustee, on or prior to the Business 
Day preceding the applicable Redemption Date, whether or not an 
Indenture Event of Default is then continuing, additional funds 
sufficient, when added to the funds already held by the Loan 
Trustee for such purpose, to
<PAGE> 61

55

redeem or purchase at the applicable Redemption Price on such 
Redemption Date all Equipment Notes then Outstanding and to pay 
the Loan Trustee all amounts then due it hereunder. No premium 
on the Equipment Notes shall be payable by the Owner Trustee in 
connection with the redemption or the purchase of Equipment 
Notes pursuant to this Section. Upon the payment of all 
amounts by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant pursuant 
to this Section, the Loan Trustee shall transfer the Equipment 
Notes to the Owner Trustee.

(iii) It is further agreed and understood that if the 
Loan Trustee shall proceed to foreclose the Lien of this 
Agreement, it shall substantially simultaneously therewith, to 
the extent the Loan Trustee is then entitled to do so hereunder 
and under the Lease, and is not then stayed or otherwise 
prevented from doing so by operation of law, proceed (to the 
extent it has not already done so) to exercise one or more 
comparable or consistent remedies referred to in Section 15 of 
the Lease (but in any case, the exercise of such remedies shall 
be commercially reasonable); provided, that, if the Loan 
Trustee is stayed or otherwise prevented from exercising one or 
more of the remedies referred to in Section 15 of the Lease, 
the Loan Trustee shall not, if and so long as such stay or 
other prohibition shall remain in effect, foreclose the Lien of 
this Agreement (A) for a period of 60 days after the date of 
the order for relief in a chapter 11 case of the Company under 
the Bankruptcy Code unless the Company elects to return the 
Aircraft or to permit the repossession of the Aircraft before 
the expiration of such 60-day period and the Loan Trustee 
actually repossesses the Aircraft; (B) for so long as the 
Company has agreed with the approval of the relevant court to 
perform the Lease in compliance with the requirements of 
Section 1110(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and so long after such 
agreement as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing that relates to the performance of the Lease (other 
than an Event of Default set forth in Section 14(g), (h) or (i) 
of the Lease), provided that no such Event of Default shall be 
deemed to occur earlier than the expiration of the 30-day 
period referred to in Section 1110(a)(2)(B)(i) of the 
Bankruptcy Code, as such period may be extended with the 
approval, if required, of the Loan Trustee; (C) for so long as 
the 60-day period specified in Section 1110(b) of the 
Bankruptcy Code is extended pursuant to Section 1110(b) of the 
Bankruptcy Code with the consent of the Loan Trustee; (D) for 
such longer period of time after the expiration of the 60-day 
period referred to in, and as extended pursuant to, the 
preceding clause (C) (the "Period") that the issue of
<PAGE> 62

56

the applicability of Section 1110 to the Aircraft and Lease is 
being disputed by the Company or the Owner Trustee or is 
subject to judicial determination or pending appeal, provided 
that such longer period of time shall not extend beyond 6 
months after the Period unless there shall not be continuing 
any default by the Company in the payment of Basic Rent, other 
than a default as to which the 30-day period referred to in, 
and as extended pursuant to, the preceding clause (B) has not 
expired (it being understood that if the Owner Trustee or the 
Owner Participant cures any such default, such cure shall not 
be considered an exercise of Lessor's cure rights for purposes 
of determining the number of cures permitted under Section 
8.03(e)(i) hereof); or (E) from and after the Company's 
assumption with the approval of the relevant court of the Lease 
pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and so long 
after such assumption as no Event of Default shall have 
occurred and be continuing that relates to the performance of 
the Lease (other than an Event of Default set forth in Section 
l4(g), (h) or (i) of the Lease), and other than a default as to 
which the 30-day period referred to in, and as extended 
pursuant to, the preceding clause (B) has not expired; 
provided, however, that if such assumption is in connection 
with an assignment of the Company's interest in the Lease 
pursuant to Section 365(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, this clause 
(E) shall have no effect unless the Loan Trustee has agreed 
that it has received adequate assurance of future performance 
as set forth in Section 365(f)(2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. 
For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly understood and 
agreed that, subject to the immediately preceding sentence, the 
above-described inability of the Loan Trustee to exercise any 
right or remedy under the Lease shall in no event and under no 
circumstances prevent the Loan Trustee from exercising all of 
its rights, powers and remedies under this Agreement, 
including, without limitation, this Article 8. References in 
this subsection (iii) to particular sections of the Bankruptcy 
Code as in effect on the date of the amendment and restatement 
of this Indenture shall include any substantially similar 
successor provisions.

(f) The Owner Trustee and the Loan Trustee 
acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any provision of 
this Agreement to the contrary, including, without limitation, 
the Granting Clause, Section 4.01 and Article 8, as long as no 
Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, 
neither the Loan Trustee nor the Owner Trustee shall take any 
action contrary to, or disturb the Company's rights under, the 
Lease, including, without limitation, (x)
<PAGE> 63

57

the right to receive all monies due and payable to it in 
accordance with the provisions of the Lease and (y) the 
Company's rights to possession and use of, and to quiet 
enjoyment of, the Aircraft.

(g) Each and every right, power and remedy herein 
given to the Loan Trustee specifically or otherwise in this 
Agreement shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every 
other right, power and remedy herein specifically given or now 
or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute, and each 
and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein 
given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time 
and as often in such order as may be deemed expedient by the 
Loan Trustee, and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise 
of any power or remedy shall not be construed to be a waiver of 
the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other 
right, power or remedy. No delay or omission by the Loan 
Trustee in the exercise of any right, remedy or power or in 
pursuing any remedy shall impair any such right, power or 
remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default on the 
part of the Owner Trustee or the Company or to be an 
acquiescence therein.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, so 
long as the Pass Through Trustee is the registered holder of 
any Equipment Note hereunder, the Loan Trustee is not 
authorized or empowered to acquire title to all or any portion 
of the Indenture Estate (including the property subject to the 
Lien of this Indenture) or take any action with respect to all 
or any portion of the Indenture Estate (including the property 
subject to the Lien of this Indenture) so acquired by it if 
such acquisition or action would cause any Pass Through Trust 
to fail to qualify as a "grantor trust" for federal income tax 
purposes.

Section 8.04. Waiver of Owner Trustee. A delay or 
omission by the Loan Trustee or any Loan Participant in 
exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Indenture Event 
of Default under this Agreement shall not impair the right or 
remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in such 
Indenture Event of Default.

Section 8.05. Waiver of Existing Defaults. The Loan 
Participants owning a majority in aggregate principal amount of 
the Outstanding Equipment Notes by notice to the Loan Trustee 
may waive on behalf of the Loan Participants an existing 
Indenture Default or Indenture Event of Default and its 
consequences except (i) an Indenture Default or Indenture Event 
of Default in the payment of the principal of, or
<PAGE> 64

58

interest on, any Equipment Note or (ii) in respect of a 
covenant or provision hereof that pursuant to Section 11.02 
cannot be amended or modified without the consent of each Loan 
Participant affected thereby.

Section 8.06. Control by Majority. Loan Participants 
owning a majority in aggregate unpaid principal amount of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes may direct the time, method and 
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to 
the Loan Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on 
it by this Agreement. However, the Loan Trustee may refuse to 
follow any direction that conflicts with law, the Lease or this 
Agreement, that is unduly prejudicial to the rights of the Loan 
Participants so affected, or that would subject the Loan 
Trustee to personal liability.

Section 8.07. Limitation on Suits by Loan 
Participants. A Loan Participant may pursue a remedy under 
this Agreement or under an Equipment Note only if:

(1) the Loan Participant gives to the Loan Trustee 
written notice of a continuing Indenture Event of Default 
under this Agreement;

(2) Loan Participants owning at least 25% in 
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Equipment 
Notes make a written request to the Loan Trustee to pursue 
the remedy;

(3) such Loan Participant or Loan Participants offer 
to the Loan Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Loan 
Trustee against any loss, liability or expense to be, or 
which may be, incurred by the Loan Trustee in pursuing the 
remedy;

(4) the Loan Trustee does not comply with the request 
within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer 
of indemnity; and

(5) during such 60-day period, Loan Participants 
owning a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 
Outstanding Equipment Notes do not give the Loan Trustee a 
direction inconsistent with the request.

A Loan Participant may not use this Agreement to 
prejudice the rights of another Loan Participant or to obtain a 
preference or priority over another Loan Participant.
<PAGE> 65

59

Section 8.08. Rights of Loan Participants to Receive 
Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
Agreement, the right of any Loan Participant to receive payment 
of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on an 
Equipment Note on or after the respective due dates expressed 
in such Equipment Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of 
any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not 
be impaired or affected without the consent of such Loan 
Participant.

extent required by law.

(g) If an Indenture Event of Default under this 
Agreement has occurred and is continuing, the Loan Trustee 
shall exercise its rights and powers under this Agreement, and

Agreement. However, the Loan Trustee shall examine the 
certificates and opinions to determine whether they conform 
to the requirements of this Agreement.

liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent 
failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:

(1) This paragraph does not limit the effect of 
paragraph (h) of this Section.

(2) The Loan Trustee shall not be liable for any 
error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible 
Officer or officers, unless it shall be proved that the

facts.
<PAGE> 67

Section 9.02. Individual Rights of Loan Trustee. The 
Loan Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become 
the owner or pledgee of Equipment Notes and may otherwise deal 
with the Owner Trustee, the Company or an Affiliate of the 
Owner Trustee or the Company or a subsidiary of the Owner 
Trustee or the Company with the same rights it would have if it 
were not the Loan Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like 
rights.

Section 9.03. Funds May Be Held by Loan Trustee or 
Paying Agent; Investments. (a) Subject to paragraph (b) 
below, any monies (including for the purpose of this subsection 
9.03 any cash deposited with the Loan Trustee or Permitted

subsection 9.03 or any cash constituting the proceeds of the 
maturity, sale or other disposition of any Permitted 
Investment) held by the Loan Trustee or the Paying Agent 
hereunder as part of the Indenture Estate, until paid out by 
the Loan Trustee or the Paying Agent as herein provided, at any

such prices, including accrued interest or its equivalent, as 
are set forth in such request, and such Permitted Investments 
shall be held by the Loan Trustee in trust as part of the 
Indenture Estate until so sold. Unless otherwise expressly 
provided in this Agreement, any profit, income, interest, 
dividend or gain realized upon maturity, sale or other 
disposition of any such Permitted Investment, net of the Loan 
Trustee's reasonable fees and expenses in making such Permitted 
Investment, shall be held and applied by the Loan Trustee in 
the same manner as the principal amount of such Permitted 
Investment is to be applied and any loss realized upon 
maturity, sale or other disposition of any such Permitted 
Investment shall be charged against the principal amount 
invested.
<PAGE> 68

62

(b) Nothwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in paragraph (a) above, any amounts held by the Loan 
Trustee or the Paying Agent hereunder as a part of the 
Indenture Estate, until paid out by the Loan Trustee or the 
Paying Agent as herein provided, which are either (i) amounts 
held pursuant to Section 25 of the Lease or (ii) amounts held 
under Section 6.01(b)(1) in connection with termination of the 
Lease pursuant to Section 9(a) of the Lease, at any time and 
from time to time, so long as no Lease Event of Default shall 
have occurred and be continuing, at the request (given directly 
by the Company to the Loan Trustee) of the Company acting as 
the agent of the Owner Trustee, shall be invested and 
reinvested in Permitted Investments as specified in such 
request (if such investments are reasonably available for 
purchase) and sold, in any case at such prices, including 
accrued interest, or its equivalent, as are set forth in such 
request, and such Permitted Investments shall be held by the 
Loan Trustee in trust as a part of the Indenture Estate until 
so sold; provided that the Company, on behalf of the Owner 
Trustee, as agent of the Owner Trustee, shall upon demand pay 
to the Loan Trustee the amount of any loss realized upon 
maturity, sale or other disposition of any such Permitted 
Investment and, so long as no Lease Event of Default shall have 
occurred and be continuing, be entitled to receive from the 
Loan Trustee, and the Loan Trustee shall promptly pay to the 
Company, on behalf of the Owner Trustee, any profit, income, 
interest, dividend or gain realized upon maturity, sale or 
other disposition of any such Permitted Investment. If any 
Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, 
any net income, profit, interest, dividend or gain realized 
upon maturity, sale or other disposition of any Permitted 
Investment made pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be held as 
part of the Indenture Estate and shall be applied by the Loan 
Trustee at the same time, on the same conditions and in the 
same manner as the amounts in respect of which such income, 
profit, interest, dividend or gain was realized are required to 
be distributed in accordance with the provisions hereof or of 
the Lease pursuant to which such amounts were required to be 
held.

(c) The Loan Trustee shall not be responsible for any 
losses on any investments or sales of Permitted Investments 
made pursuant to the procedure specified in this Section.

Section 9.04. Notice of Defaults. If an Indenture 
Event of Default under this Agreement occurs and is
<PAGE> 69

63

continuing and if it is actually known to a Responsible Officer 
of the Loan Trustee, the Loan Trustee shall (i) promptly send 
written notice thereof to the Company, the Owner Trustee and 
the Owner Participant and (ii) within 90 days after it occurs, 
mail to each Loan Participant notice of all uncured Indenture 
Events of Default under this Agreement. Except in the case of a 
default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or 
interest on any Equipment Note, the Loan Trustee shall be 
protected in withholding the notice required under clause (ii) 
above if and so long as the executive committee or trust 
committee of directors of the Loan Trustee and/or Responsible 
Officers thereof in good faith determines that withholding such 
notice is in the interest of the Loan Participants. In 
addition, if an Indenture Default occurs and is continuing and 
if it is actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Loan 
Trustee, the Loan Trustee shall promptly send written notice 
thereof to the Company, the Owner Trustee and the Owner 
Participant; provided that, with respect to any payment 
Indenture Default, the Loan Trustee shall send such notice no 
later than five days after a Responsible Officer of the Loan 
Trustee obtains actual knowledge thereof.

Section 9.05. Compensation and Indemnity. (a) The 
Owner Trustee shall pay to the Loan Trustee, from time to time, 
on demand, (i) reasonable compensation for its services,
which compensation shall not be limited by any law on 
compensation of a trustee of an express trust, (ii) 
reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred by the Loan Trustee in connection with the performance 
of its duties under this Agreement (including the reasonable 
compensation and expenses of the Loan Trustee's counsel and any 
agent appointed in accordance with Section 9.01(c)) and (iii) 
indemnification against any loss or liability incurred by it 
arising out of or in connection with its acceptance or 
administration of the trust or trusts hereunder except (A) as 
such expenses or loss or liability might result from the 
negligence or willful misconduct of the Loan Trustee or the 
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Loan 
Trustee in its individual capacity in Section 9 of the 
Refunding Agreement, (B) as otherwise provided in Section 9.09 
and (C) as otherwise excluded by the terms of Sections 7(b) and 
7(c) of the Participation Agreement from the Company's 
indemnities under said Sections; provided that, so long as the 
Lease is in effect, the Loan Trustee shall not make any claim 
under this Section 9.05 for any claim or expense indemnified 
against by the Company under the Participation Agreement 
without first making demand on
<PAGE> 70

64

the Company for payment of such claim or expense. The Loan 
Trustee shall notify the Owner Trustee and the Company promptly 
of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Owner 
Trustee shall have the right to defend the claim and the Loan 
Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Loan Trustee may 
have separate counsel and the Owner Trustee, subject to 
limitations set forth in the third preceding sentence, shall 
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The 
Owner Trustee need not pay for any settlement made without its

notice to the Loan Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Owner 
Participant and the Company and may appoint a successor Loan 
Trustee for such Equipment Notes so long as no Indenture Event 
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with the Owner 
Trustee's and the Company's consent. The Owner Trustee (acting 
pursuant to instructions from the Company) may remove the Loan 
Trustee if:

(1) the Loan Trustee fails to comply with

hereof specifically applicable to such institution);

(c) If the Loan Trustee resigns or is removed, or if

and a new Loan Trustee has not been appointed pursuant to 
Section 9.06(b), the Owner Trustee shall promptly appoint a 
successor Loan Trustee.

(d) If a successor Loan Trustee does not take office 
within 30 days after the retiring Loan Trustee resigns or is 
removed, the retiring Loan Trustee, the Company, the Owner 
Trustee or Loan Participants holding a majority in aggregate 
principal amount of the Outstanding Equipment Notes may 
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the 
appointment of a successor Loan Trustee.

(e) If the Loan Trustee fails to comply with Section 
9.08, any Loan Participant may petition any court of competent 
jurisdiction for the removal of such Loan Trustee and the 
appointment of a successor Loan Trustee.

(f) A successor Loan Trustee shall deliver a written 
acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Loan Trustee, to 
the Company and to the Owner Trustee. Thereupon, the 
resignation or removal of the retiring Loan Trustee shall 
become effective, and the successor Loan Trustee shall have all 
the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Loan Trustee for 
which the successor Loan Trustee is to be acting as Loan 
Trustee under this Agreement. The retiring Loan Trustee shall 
promptly transfer all property and all books and records 
relating to the administration of the Indenture Estate held by 
it as Loan Trustee to the successor Loan Trustee subject to the 
lien provided for in Section 9.05. The Owner Trustee shall 
give notice of each appointment of a successor Loan Trustee if 
there are Equipment Notes outstanding, by mailing written 
notice of such event by first-class mail to the Loan 
Participants.

(g) All provisions of this Section 9.06 except

another corporation, the successor corporation, without any 
further act, shall be the successor Loan Trustee or Agent, as 
the case may be.

Section 9.08. Eligibility; Disqualification. This 
Agreement shall at all times have a Loan Trustee which shall be 
a bank or trust company and have a combined capital and surplus 
of at least $100,000,000 (or having a combined capital and 
surplus in excess of $5,000,000 (or, as long as State Street 
Bank and Trust Company of Connecticut, National Association 
shall be the Loan Trustee, $3,000,000) and the obligations of 
which, whether now in existence or hereafter incurred, are 
fully and unconditionally guaranteed by a corporation organized 
and doing business under the laws of the United States, any 
State or Territory thereof or of the District of Columbia and 
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000) 
and which shall be a "citizen of the United States" as defined 
in Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act. If such 
corporation publishes reports of conditions at least annually, 
pursuant to law or to the requirements of Federal, State, 
Territorial or District of Columbia supervising or examining 
authority, then for the purposes of this Section 9.08, the 
combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be 
deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in 
its most recent report of conditions so published.

In case at any time the Loan Trustee shall cease to be 
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this 
Section 9.08, the Loan Trustee shall resign immediately in the 
manner and with the effect specified in Section 9.06.

Section 9.09. Trustee's Liens. The Loan Trustee in 
its individual capacity agrees that it will at its own cost and 
expense promptly take such action as may be necessary to duly 
discharge and satisfy in full all Liens ("Trustee's Liens") on 
the Indenture Estate which are either (i) attributable to the 
Loan Trustee in its individual capacity and which are unrelated 
to the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents, or 
(ii) attributable to the Loan Trustee as trustee hereunder or 
in its individual capacity and which arise out of acts or 
omissions by it which are contrary to the terms of this 
Agreement.

Section 9.10. Withholding Taxes; Information 
Reporting. The Loan Trustee shall exclude and withhold from
<PAGE> 73

67

each distribution of principal, premium, if any, and interest 
and other amounts due hereunder or under the Equipment Notes 
any and all withholding taxes applicable thereto as required by 
law. The Loan Trustee agrees (i) to act as such withholding 
agent and, in connection therewith, whenever any present or 
future taxes or similar charges are required to be withheld 
with respect to any amounts payable in respect of the Equipment 
Notes, to withhold such amounts and timely pay the same to the 
appropriate authority in the name of and on behalf of the Loan 
Participants, (ii) that it will file any necessary withholding 
tax returns or statements when due and (iii) that, as promptly 
as possible after the payment of such amounts, it will deliver 
to each Loan Participant appropriate documentation showing the

documentary evidence as such Loan Participants may reasonably 
request from time to time. The Loan Trustee agrees to file any 
other information reports as it may be required to file under 
United States law.

deem appropriate and as shall be approved by the Company;

(i) shall be denominated and payable in United States 
Dollars and shall not be in a principal amount greater than 
the Equipment Notes redeemed;

(ii) shall not rank senior in any respect to the

weighted average life longer than the Equipment Notes 
redeemed if any of the Equipment Notes which remain

provided further that prior to authentication of such new 
series of Equipment Notes the Loan Trustee shall have 
received (i) written evidence from Standard & Poor's 
Corporation and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. to the 
effect that the issuance of such new series, by itself, 
would not result in a downgrading of the credit rating 
assigned to the Pass Through Certificates then outstanding 
and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel for the Company reasonably 
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee to the effect that the 
protection afforded by Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code 
to the existing Loan Participants would not be adversely 
affected by the issuance of such new series of Equipment 
Notes; provided that such opinion need not be delivered to 
the extent that the benefits of such Section 1110 are not 
available to the Loan Participants with respect to the 
Aircraft immediately prior to such assumption; and provided 
further that such opinion may contain qualifications of the 
tenor contained in the opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton 
delivered pursuant to Section 3(k) of the Refunding

Payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and 
interest on this Equipment Note will be made in immediately 
available funds at the principal corporate trust office of the 
Loan Trustee, or the office or agency maintained by the Loan

however, that payment of interest (and Installment Payment 
Amounts (other than that payable on the Maturity Date hereof))* 
may be made at the option of the Loan Trustee or the Paying 
Agent by check mailed to the address of the Loan Participant 
entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Register.

authorized officer of the Owner Trustee, and authenticated by 
the Loan Trustee by the manual signature of an authorized 
officer or signatory of the Loan Trustee, in each case as

As more fully provided in the Indenture, the Equipment 
Notes are subject to redemption, on not less than 25 nor more 
than 60 days' notice by mail, under the circumstances set forth 
in the Indenture, at a redemption price equal to the unpaid 
principal amount thereof, premium, if any, plus accrued 
interest thereon to the Redemption Date.

If an Indenture Event of Default shall occur and be 
continuing, the unpaid principal amount of the Equipment Notes 
may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the 
effect provided in the Indenture. If, and only if, such an 
event of default constitutes an event of default by the Company 
under the Lease, the Loan Trustee may declare the Lease to be 
in default, and may, to the exclusion of the Owner Trustee, 
exercise one or more of the remedies of the Owner Trustee 
provided in the Lease. 

The right of the Loan Participant to institute action 
for any remedy under the Indenture, including the enforcement 
of payment of any amount due hereon, is subject to certain 
restrictions specified in the Indenture.

discharged from their respective obligations in respect of the 
Equipment Notes (except for certain matters, including 
obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Equipment 
Notes, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Equipment Notes, 
maintain paying agencies and hold moneys for payment in trust), 
and the Loan Trustee may thereupon cause the release of the 
Indenture Estate from the lien of the Indenture, if (a) the 
Owner Trustee deposits or causes to be deposited irrevocably 
with the Loan Trustee, in trust, money or U.S. Government 
Obligations which through the payment of interest and principal 
in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide 
money in an amount sufficient to pay principal of, premium, if 
any, and interest on the

Outstanding Equipment Notes on the dates such payments are due 
in accordance with the terms of such Equipment Notes and (b) 
certain other conditions are satisfied, including the 
publication by the United States Internal Revenue Service of a 
ruling to the effect that the deposit and related defeasance 
would not cause the Loan Participants to recognize income, gain 
or loss for Federal income tax purposes.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain 
limitations therein and herein set forth, this Equipment Note 
is transferable, and upon surrender of this Equipment Note for 
registration of transfer at the principal corporate trust 
office of the Registrar, or at the office or agency maintained 
for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written 
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Registrar 
duly executed by, the Loan Participant or his attorney duly 
authorized in writing, one or more new Equipment Notes of the 
same maturity and type and of authorized denominations and for 
the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the 
designated transferee or transferees.

THIS EQUIPMENT NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE 
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. NO REGISTRATION OF A 
TRANSFER OF THIS EQUIPMENT NOTE WILL BE MADE UNLESS SUCH 
TRANSFER IS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION 
STATEMENT UNDER SUCH ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM 
REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT OR SUCH ACT DOES NOT APPLY.

The Equipment Notes are issuable only as registered 
Equipment Notes. The Equipment Notes are issuable in 
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof except 
that one Equipment Note of each maturity does not need to be an 
integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture and 
subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Equipment 
Notes are exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount 
of Equipment Notes of the same type, having the same Maturity 
Date and of any authorized denominations or transferable upon 
surrender of the Equipment Notes to be exchanged or 
transferred, as requested by the Loan Participant surrendering 
the same, upon presentation thereof for such purpose at the 
principal corporate trust office of the Registrar, or at any 
office or agency maintained for such purpose.

No service charge shall be made for any such 
registration of transfer or exchange, but the Registrar may 
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other 
governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer 
of this Equipment Note, the Owner Trustee, the Loan Trustee, 
the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the Company may

deem and treat the person in whose name this Equipment Note is 
registered as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of 
receiving payment of the principal of and interest on this 
Equipment Note and for all other purposes whatsoever whether or 
not this Equipment Note be overdue, and neither the Owner 
Trustee, the Loan Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar nor 
the Company shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

AS PROVIDED IN THE INDENTURE, THE INDENTURE AND THIS 
EQUIPMENT NOTE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND 
GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Owner Trustee has caused this 
instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

and eleven months after the due date for such payment and any 
money paid to the Loan Trustee pursuant to Section 11.01 of the 
Pass Through Trust Agreement, shall be paid to the Company; and 
the Loan Participants entitled to payment thereon shall 
thereafter, as unsecured general creditors, look only to the 
Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Loan 
Trustee or any such Paying Agent with respect to such trust 
money shall thereupon cease; provided that the Loan Trustee or 
such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such 
repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be mailed 
to each such Loan Participant notice that such money remains 
unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall

Section 7.02. Change in Registration. The Loan 
Trustee shall, upon the request of the Company, consent to the 
deregistration of the Aircraft under the laws of the 
jurisdiction in which it is at the time registered and the 
registration of the Aircraft under the laws of another 
jurisdiction (herein called a "change in registration") 
provided that the following conditions are met:

(a) Such change in registration complies with the 
provisions of this Indenture.

(b) No Indenture Event of Default (and no event 
which, with lapse of time or notice, or both, would become 
an Indenture Event of Default) shall have occurred and be 
continuing at the date of such request or at the effective 
date of the change in registration, provided that it shall 
not be necessary to comply with this
<PAGE> 118

17

condition (i) if the change in registration results in the 
registration of the Aircraft under the laws of the United 
States of America or (ii) if the Loan Trustee in its 
discretion believes the change in registration would be 
advantageous to the Loan Participants.

(c) The Loan Trustee shall have received an opinion 
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to it to the effect 
that:

(i) after giving effect to the change in 
registration, the Lien on the Aircraft and the other 
property included in the Indenture Estate shall 
continue as a fully perfected Lien and that all 
filing, recording or other action necessary to perfect 
and protect the Lien of the Indenture has been 
accomplished (or if such opinion cannot be given at 
the time by which the Loan Trustee has been requested 
to consent to a change in registration, (x) the 
opinion shall detail what filing, recording or other 
action is necessary and (y) the Loan Trustee shall 
have received a certificate from the Company that all 
possible preparation to accomplish such filing, 
recording and other action shall have been done, and 
such filing, recording and other action shall be 
accomplished and a supplemental opinion to that effect 
shall be delivered to the Loan Trustee on or prior to 
the effective date of the change in registration); and

(ii) the terms of this Indenture (including the 
governing law clauses) are legal, valid and binding 
and enforceable in such jurisdiction, except as the 
same may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, 
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws 
affecting the rights of creditors generally, and by 
general principles of equity and except as limited by 
applicable laws which may affect the remedies provided 
for in this Indenture, which laws, however, do not in 
the opinion of such counsel make the remedies provided 
in this Indenture inadequate for the practical 
realization of the rights and benefits provided 
hereby.

(d) The Loan Trustee shall have received assurances 
reasonably satisfactory to it that the insurance provisions 
contained in Section 11 of Article 15 hereof will have been 
complied with after giving effect to such
<PAGE> 119

18

change in registration.

(e) The Company shall have paid or made provision 
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee for the payment of all 
expenses connected with such change in registration.

The Loan Trustee shall execute such documents as the Company 
shall reasonably request in order to satisfy the above 
conditions and upon satisfaction of such conditions to effect 
the change in registration.

Section 7.03. (Intentionally Omitted)

(H) Sections 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 and 8.04 thereof shall 
read as follows:

Section 8.01. Indenture Events of Default. The 
following events shall constitute "Indenture Events of Default"

or involuntary or come about or be effected by operation of law 
or pursuant to or in compliance with any judgment, decree or 
order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any 
administrative or governmental body) and each such Indenture 
Event of Default shall be deemed to exist and continue so long 
as, but only as long as, it shall not have been remedied: 

(a) the Company shall fail to pay any installment of 
interest upon any Equipment Note, or the principal of any 
Equipment Note or premium, if any, in respect of any 
Equipment Note, in each case when the same shall be due and 
payable (whether upon redemption, final maturity, 
acceleration or otherwise), and, in each case, such failure 
shall continue for more than 15 days after the same shall 
have become due and payable; or

(b) the Company shall fail to carry and maintain 
insurance on or with respect to the Aircraft in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 11 of Article 15 hereof; 
provided that, in the case of insurance with respect to 
which cancellation, change or lapse for nonpayment of 
premium shall not be effective as to the Loan Trustee for 
30 days (seven days, or such other period as may from time 
to time be customarily obtainable in the industry, in the 
case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after 
receipt of notice by the Loan Trustee of such cancellation, 
change or lapse, no such failure to carry and maintain 
insurance shall
<PAGE> 120

19

constitute an Indenture Event of Default hereunder until 
the earlier of (i) the date such failure shall have 
continued unremedied for a period of 20 days (five days in 
the case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after 
receipt by the Loan Trustee of the notice of cancellation, 
change or lapse referred to in Section 11(a)(C) or 11(b)(C) 
of Article 15 hereof, or (ii) the date such insurance not 
being in effect as to the Loan Trustee; or

when public liability insurance required by Section 11(a) 
of Article 15 hereof shall not be in effect; or

(d) the Company shall fail to perform or observe any 
covenant or agreement to be performed or observed by it 
hereunder or under the Participation Agreement and such 
failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days 
after written notice thereof has been given by the Loan 
Trustee; provided that, if such failure is capable of being 
remedied, so long as the Company is diligently proceeding 
to remedy such failure, no such failure shall constitute an 
Event of Default hereunder for a period of up to 365 days; 
or

(e) any material representation or warranty made by 
the Company in the Participation Agreement or in the 
Purchase Agreement (to the extent applicable to the 
Aircraft) or in any document or certificate furnished by 
the Company in connection herewith or therewith or pursuant 
hereto or thereto shall prove to have been incorrect in any 
material respect at the time made and such incorrectness 
shall continue to be material and shall continue unremedied 
for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof has 
been given by the Loan Trustee; or

(f) the Company shall consent to the appointment of a 
receiver, trustee or liquidator of itself or of a 
substantial part of its property or the Company shall admit 
in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they 
come due, or shall make a general assignment for the 
benefit of creditors; or

(g) the Company shall file a voluntary petition in 
bankruptcy or a voluntary petition or an answer seeking 
reorganization in a proceeding under any bankruptcy laws 
(as now or hereafter in effect) or an answer admitting the 
material allegations of a petition filed against the
<PAGE> 121

20

Company in any such proceeding, or the Company shall by 
voluntary petition, answer or consent, seek relief under 
the provisions of any other now existing or future 
bankruptcy or other similar law providing for the 
reorganization or winding-up of corporations, or providing 
for an agreement, composition, extension or adjustment with 
its creditors; or

(h) an order, judgment or decree shall be entered by 
any court of competent jurisdiction appointing, without the 
consent of the Company, a receiver, trustee or liquidator 
of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, 
or sequestering any substantial part of the property of the 
Company, and any such order, judgment or decree of 
appointment or sequestration shall remain in force 
undismissed, unstayed or unvacated for a period of 90 days 
after the date of entry thereof; or

(i) a petition against the Company in a proceeding 
under the Federal bankruptcy laws or other insolvency laws, 
as now or hereafter in effect, shall be filed and shall not 
be withdrawn or dismissed within 90 days thereafter, or, 
under the provisions of any law providing for 
reorganization or winding-up of corporations which may 
apply to the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction 
shall assume jurisdiction, custody or control of the 
Company or of any substantial part of its property and such 
jurisdiction, custody or control shall remain in force 
unrelinquished, unstayed or unterminated for a period of 90 
days;

provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in this Indenture, any failure of the Company to 
perform or observe any covenant, condition, or agreement herein 
shall not constitute an Indenture Event of Default if such 
failure is caused solely by reason of an event referred to in 
the definition of "Event of Loss", so long as the Company is 
continuing to comply with the applicable terms of Section 10 of 
Article 15 hereof.

Section 8.02. Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment. 
If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the 
Loan Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the Loan 
Participants holding at least 25% in aggregate principal amount 
of Outstanding Equipment Notes by notice to the Company and the 
Loan Trustee, may declare the principal
<PAGE> 122

21

of all the Equipment Notes to be due and payable. Upon such 
declaration, the principal of all Equipment Notes, together 
with accrued interest thereon from the date in respect of which 
interest was last paid hereunder to the date payment of such 
principal has been made or duly provided for shall be due and 
payable immediately. At any time after such declaration and 
prior to the sale or disposition of the Indenture Estate, the 
Loan Participants in a majority in aggregate principal amount 
of all of the Outstanding Equipment Notes, by notice to the 
Loan Trustee and the Company, may rescind such a declaration 
and thereby annul its consequences if (i) an amount sufficient 
to pay all principal of, premium, if any, and interest thereon, 
at the rate prescribed therefor in such Equipment Note and 
interest due or past due, if any, in respect of the Outstanding 
Equipment Notes plus all other amounts payable to the Loan 
Participants, other than by reason of such acceleration, and 
all sums due and payable to the Loan Trustee has been deposited 
with the Loan Trustee, (ii) the rescission would not conflict 
with any judgment or decree and (iii) all existing Indenture 
Defaults and Indenture Events of Default under this Indenture 
have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal of, 
premium, if any, or interest on the Equipment Notes that has 
become due solely because of such acceleration.

Section 8.03. Other Remedies Available to Loan 
Trustee. (a) After an Indenture Event of Default shall have 
occurred and so long as the same shall be continuing, then and 
in every such case the Loan Trustee, as trustee of an express 
trust and as holder of a security interest in the Aircraft or 
Engines or otherwise, may, at its option, declare this 
Indenture to be in default by a written notice to the Company; 
and at any time thereafter, so long as the Company shall not 
have remedied all outstanding Events of Default, the Loan 
Trustee may do one or more of the following with respect to all 
or any part of any Airframe or any Engines as the Loan Trustee 
in its sole discretion shall elect, to the extent permitted by, 
and subject to compliance with any mandatory requirements of, 
applicable law then in effect; provided, however, that, during 
any period when the Aircraft is subject to the Civil Reserve 
Air Fleet Program in accordance with the provisions of Section 
7(b) of Article 15 hereof and in the possession of the United 
States government or an instrumentality or agency thereof, and 
to the extent that any applicable law or contractual provision 
covering the Aircraft so requires, the Loan Trustee shall not, 
on account
<PAGE> 123

22

of any Indenture Event of Default, be entitled to do any of the 
following in such manner as to limit the Company's control (or 
any lessee's control under any lease permitted by the terms of 
Section 7(b) of Article 15 hereof) of any Airframe or any 
Engines, unless at least 60 days' (or such lesser period as may 
then be applicable under the Military Airlift Command Program 
of the United States Government) prior written notice of 
default under this Indenture with respect to the Company's 
obligations hereunder shall have been given by the Loan Trustee 
by registered or certified mail to the Company (and, if 
applicable, any such lessee) with a copy addressed to the 
Contracting Office Representative for the Military Airlift 
Command of the United States Air Force under any contract with 
the Company (or any such lessee) relating to the Aircraft:

(i) cause the Company, upon the written demand of the 
Loan Trustee and at the Company's expense, to return 
promptly, and the Company shall return promptly, all or 
such part of any Airframe or any Engine as the Loan Trustee 
may so demand to the Loan Trustee or its order or the Loan 
Trustee, at its option, may enter upon the premises where 
all or any part of such Airframe or any Engine are located 
and take immediate possession of and remove the same 
(together with any engine which is not an Engine but which 
is installed on the Airframe, subject to all of the rights 
of the owner, lessor, lienor or secured party of such 
engine; provided that the Airframe with an engine (which is 
not an Engine) installed thereon may be flown or returned 
only to a location within the continental United States, 
and such engine shall be held for the account of any such 
owner, lessor, lienor or secured party or, if owned by the 
Company, may, at the option of the Loan Trustee, be 
exchanged with the Company for an Engine) all without 
liability accruing to the Loan Trustee for or by reason of 
such entry or taking of possession or removal, whether for 
the restoration of damage to property caused by such taking 
or otherwise; or 

(ii) sell all or any part of any Airframe and any 
Engine at public or private sale, whether or not the Loan 
Trustee shall at the time have possession thereof, as the 
Loan Trustee may determine, or otherwise dispose of, hold, 
use, operate, lease to others or keep idle all or any part 
of such Airframe or such Engine as the Loan Trustee, in its 
sole discretion, may determine, all free
<PAGE> 124

23

and clear of any rights of the Company and without any duty 
to account to the Company with respect to such action or 
inaction or for any proceeds with respect thereto.

(b) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and Section 8.03(h), 
if an Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is 
continuing, the Loan Trustee may, if at the time such action 
may be lawful and always subject to compliance with any 
mandatory legal requirements, either with or without taking 
possession, and either before or after taking possession, and 
without instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, and 
having first given notice of such sale by registered mail to 
the Company once at least thirty days prior to the date of such 
sale, and any other notice which may be required by law, sell 
and dispose of the Indenture Estate, or any part thereof, or 
interest therein, at public auction to the highest bidder, in 
one lot as an entirety or in separate lots, and either for cash 
or on credit and on such terms as the Loan Trustee may 
determine, and at any place (whether or not it be the location 
of the Indenture Estate or any part thereof) and time 
designated in the notice above referred to; provided, however, 
that, notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the 
Loan Trustee shall not sell any of the Indenture Estate unless 
a declaration of acceleration has been made pursuant to Section 
8.02. Any such sale or sales may be adjourned from time to 
time by announcement at the time and place appointed for such 
sale or sales, or for any such adjourned sale or sales, without 
further notice, and the Loan Trustee and any Loan Participant 
may bid and become the purchaser at any such sale. The Loan 
Trustee may exercise such right without possession or 
production of the Equipment Notes or proof of ownership 
thereof, and as representative of the Loan Participants may 
exercise such right without notice to the Loan Participants or 
including the Loan Participants as parties to any suit or 
proceeding relating to foreclosure of any property in the 
Indenture Estate. The Company hereby irrevocably constitutes 
the Loan Trustee the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the 
Company (in the name of the Company or otherwise) for the 
purpose of effectuating any sale, assignment, transfer or 
delivery for enforcement of the Lien created under this 
Indenture, whether pursuant to foreclosure or power of sale or 
otherwise, to execute and deliver all such bills of sale, 
assignments and other instruments as the Loan Trustee may 
consider necessary or appropriate, with full power of 
substitution, the Company hereby ratifying and confirming all 
that such attorney or any substitute shall lawfully do by 
virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested
<PAGE> 125

24

by the Loan Trustee or any purchaser, the Company shall ratify 
and confirm any such sale, assignment, transfer or delivery, by 
executing and delivering to the Loan Trustee or such purchaser 
all bills of sale, assignments, releases and other proper 
instruments to effect such ratification and confirmation as may 
be designated in any such request.

(c) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), if an 
Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the 
Company shall, at the request of the Loan Trustee, promptly 
execute and deliver to the Loan Trustee such instruments of 
title or other documents as the Loan Trustee may deem necessary 
or advisable to enable the Loan Trustee or an agent or 
representative designated by the Loan Trustee, at such time or 
times and place or places as the Loan Trustee may specify, to 
obtain possession of all or any part of the Indenture Estate. 
If the Company shall for any reason fail to execute and deliver 
such instruments and documents after such request by the Loan 
Trustee, the Loan Trustee shall be entitled, in a proceeding to 
which the Company will be a necessary party, to a judgment for 
specific performance of the covenants contained in the 
foregoing sentence, conferring upon the Loan Trustee the right 
to immediate possession and requiring the Company to execute 
and deliver such instruments and documents to the Loan Trustee. 
The Loan Trustee shall also be entitled to pursue all or any 
part of the Indenture Estate wherever it may be found and may 
enter any of the premises of the Company or any other Person 
wherever the Indenture Estate may be or is supposed to be and 
search for the Indenture Estate and take possession of any item 
of the Indenture Estate pursuant to this Section 8.03(c). The 
Loan Trustee may, from time to time, at the expense of the 
Indenture Estate, make all such expenditures for maintenance, 
insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and 
improvements to and of the Indenture Estate, as it may deem 
proper. In each such case, the Loan Trustee shall have the 
right to use, operate, store, lease, control or manage the 
Indenture Estate, and to exercise all rights and powers of the 
Company relating to the Indenture Estate as the Loan Trustee 
shall deem appropriate, including the right to enter into any 
and all such agreements with respect to the use, operation, 
storage, leasing, control or management of the Indenture Estate 
or any part thereof; and the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to 
collect and receive directly all tolls, rents, issues, profits, 
products, revenues and other income of the Indenture Estate and 
every part thereof, without prejudice, however, to the right of 
the Loan Trustee under any provision of this Indenture to 
collect and receive all
<PAGE> 126

25

cash held by, or required to be deposited with, the Loan 
Trustee hereunder. In accordance with the terms of this 
Section 8.03(c), such tolls, rents, issues, profits, products, 
revenues and other income shall be applied to pay the expenses 
of using, operating, storing, leasing, controlling or managing 
the Indenture Estate, and of all maintenance, insurance, 
repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and improvements, 
and to make all payments which the Loan Trustee may be required 
or may elect to make, if any, for taxes, assessments, insurance 
or other proper charges upon the Indenture Estate or any part 
thereof (including the employment of engineers and accountants 
to examine, inspect and make reports upon the properties and 
books and records of the Company in accordance with this 
Section 8.03(c)), and all other payments which the Loan Trustee 
may be required or authorized to make under any provision of 
this Indenture, including this Section 8.03(c), as well as just 
and reasonable compensation for the services of the Loan 
Trustee, and of all Persons properly engaged and employed by 
the Loan Trustee.

If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is 
continuing and the Loan Trustee shall have obtained possession 
of or title to the Aircraft, the Loan Trustee shall not be 
obligated to use or operate the Aircraft or cause the Aircraft 
to be used or operated directly or indirectly by itself or 
through agents or other representatives or to lease, license or 
otherwise permit or provide for the use or operation of the 
Aircraft by any other Person unless (i) the Loan Trustee shall 
have been able to obtain insurance in kinds, at rates and in 
amounts satisfactory to it in its discretion to protect the 
Indenture Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and 
individually, against any and all liability for loss or damage 
to the Aircraft and for public liability and property damage 
resulting from use or operation of the Aircraft and (ii) funds 
are available in the Indenture Estate to pay for all such 
insurance or, in lieu of such insurance, the Loan Trustee is 
furnished with indemnification from the holders of the 
Equipment Notes or any other Person upon terms and in amounts 
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee in its discretion to protect 
the Indenture Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and 
individually, against any and all such liabilities.

(d) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), the Loan 
Trustee may proceed to protect and enforce this Indenture and 
the Equipment Notes by suit or suits or proceedings in equity, 
at law or in bankruptcy, and whether
<PAGE> 127

26

for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement 
herein contained or in execution or aid of any power herein 
granted; or for foreclosure hereunder, or for the appointment 
of a receiver or receivers for the Indenture Estate or any part 
thereof, or for the recovery of judgment for the indebtedness 
secured by the Lien created under this Indenture or for the 
enforcement of any other proper, legal or equitable remedy 
available under applicable law.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture 
to the contrary, including, without limitation, Sections 
8.03(b), 8.03(c) and 8.03(d), so long as no Indenture Event of 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Loan Trustee 
shall not take any action contrary to, or disturb, the 
Company's rights to possession and use of, and quiet enjoyment 
of, the Aircraft.

(f) Each and every right, power and remedy herein 
given to the Loan Trustee specifically or otherwise in this 
Indenture shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every 
other right, power and remedy herein specifically given or now 
or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute, and each 
and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein 
given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time 
and as often in such order as may be deemed expedient by the 
Loan Trustee, and the exercise or the beginning of the exercise 
of any power or remedy shall not be construed to be a waiver of 
the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other 
right, power or remedy. No delay or omission by the Loan 
Trustee in the exercise of any right, remedy or power or in 
pursuing any remedy shall impair any such right, power or 
remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default on the 
part of the Company or to be an acquiescence therein.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if 
any payment of principal of any Equipment Note shall not be 
made when and as the same shall become due and payable, or if 
any payment of interest on any Equipment Note shall not be made 
when and as the same shall become due and payable, and such 
failure shall continue for the period prescribed in Section 
8.01(a), the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to recover 
judgment, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, 
upon the Equipment Note for the whole amount of such principal 
or interest, as the case may be, remaining unpaid.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, so 
long as the Pass Through Trustee is the registered holder of
<PAGE> 128

27

any Equipment Note hereunder, the Loan Trustee is not 
authorized or empowered to acquire title to all or any portion 
of the Indenture Estate or take any action with respect to all 
or any portion of the Indenture Estate so acquired by it if 
such acquisition or action would cause any Pass Through Trust 
to fail to qualify as a "grantor trust" for Federal income tax 
purposes.

Section 8.04. Waiver of Company. To the extent now 
or at any time hereafter enforceable under applicable law, the 
Company covenants that it will not at any time insist upon or 
plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take any benefit or 
advantage of, any stay or extension law now or at any time 
hereafter in force, nor claim, take nor insist upon any benefit 
or advantage of or from any law now or hereafter in force 
providing for the valuation or appraisement of the Indenture 
Estate or any part thereof, prior to any sale or sales thereof 
to be made pursuant to any provision herein contained, or to 
the decree, judgment or order of any court of competent 
jurisdiction; nor, after such sale or sales, claim or exercise 
any right under any statute now or hereafter made or enacted by 
any state or otherwise to redeem the property so sold or any 
part thereof, and hereby expressly waives for itself and on 
behalf of each and every Person, except decree or judgment 
creditors of the Company acquiring any interest in or title to 
the Indenture Estate or any part thereof subsequent to the date 
of this Indenture, all benefit and advantage of any such law or 
laws, and covenants that it will not invoke or utilize any such 
law or laws or otherwise hinder, delay or impede the execution 
of any power herein granted and delegated to the Loan Trustee, 
but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as 
though no such law or laws had been made or enacted.

The Loan Trustee may maintain such a proceeding even

Opinion of Counsel for the Company reasonably satisfactory to 
the Loan Trustee to the effect that the protection afforded by

materialmen's, mechanics', workmen's, repairmen's, employees' 
or other like Liens arising in the ordinary course of business 
for amounts the payment of which is either not yet delinquent

name of the Company, as owner, except as otherwise required 
by the Federal Aviation Act; provided that the Loan Trustee

shall reasonably request for the purpose of effecting and 
continuing such registration. Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence, but subject always to the terms and conditions 
set forth in Section 7.02 of this Indenture, the Company 
may cause the Aircraft to be duly registered under the laws 
of any jurisdiction in which a lessee pursuant to

39

(ii) maintain, service, repair, overhaul and test the

Boeing 757-200 series aircraft (or, at the Company's 
option, (x) in the event that the Aircraft is re-registered 
in another jurisdiction pursuant to Section 7(a)(i) of this 
Article, in accordance with an aircraft maintenance program 
approved by the central civil aviation authority of the 
jurisdiction of such registration or (y) in the event of 
any lease to a foreign air carrier in accordance with 
Section 7(b)(ix) of this Article, approved by the central 
civil aviation authority of one of the jurisdictions 
specified in clause (y) of such Section 7(b)(ix)) and in 
the same manner and with the same care used by the Company 
with respect to comparable aircraft and engines owned or 
operated by the Company and utilized in similar 
circumstances so as to keep the Aircraft in as good 
operating condition as when delivered to the Company by the 
Manufacturer, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in such 
condition as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness 
certification of the Aircraft to be maintained in good 
standing at all times (other than during temporary periods 
of storage in accordance with applicable regulations or 
during periods of grounding by applicable governmental 
authorities, except where such periods of grounding are the 
result of the failure by the Company to maintain the 
Aircraft as otherwise required herein) under the Federal 
Aviation Act or, if the Aircraft is registered under the 
laws of any other jurisdiction, the laws of such 
jurisdiction and in compliance with all applicable 
manufacturer's alert service bulletins;

(iii) maintain, in the English language, all records 
logs and other materials required by the appropriate 
authorities in the jurisdiction where the Aircraft is

maintained, used or operated in violation of any law or any
<PAGE> 141

40

rule, regulation or order of any government or governmental 
authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign), or in 
violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or 
registration relating to the Aircraft issued by any such 
authority; provided that the Company shall not be in default 
under this sentence if it is not possible for it to comply with 
the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States (or 
other than any jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is then 
registered) because of a conflict with the applicable laws of 
the United States (or such jurisdiction in which the Aircraft 
is then registered). In the event that any such law, rule, 
regulation or order requires alteration of the Aircraft, the 
Company will conform thereto or obtain conformance therewith at 
no expense to the Loan Trustee and will maintain the Aircraft 
in proper operating condition under such laws, rules, 
regulations and orders; provided, however, that the Company 
may, in good faith, contest the validity or application of any 
such law, rule, regulation or order in any reasonable manner 
which does not materially adversely affect the Loan Trustee, 
the Aircraft, the Loan Participants or the Lien of this 
Indenture. The Company also agrees not to operate or locate 
the Aircraft, or suffer the Aircraft to be operated or located, 
(i) in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance 
required by the terms of Section 11 of this Article, except in 
the case of a requisition for use by any Government where the 
Company obtains indemnity pursuant to Section 11 of this 
Article in lieu of such insurance from such Government against 
the risks and in the amounts required by Section 11 of this 
Article covering such area, or (ii) in any war zone or 
recognized or, in the Company's judgment, threatened area of 
hostilities unless covered by war risk insurance in accordance 
with Section 11 of this Article, but only so long as the same 
remains in effect while the Aircraft is so operated or located, 
or unless the Aircraft is operated or used under contract with 
any Government entered into pursuant to Section 11 of this 
Article, under which contract such Government assumes liability 
for any damage, loss, destruction or failure to return 
possession of the Aircraft at the end of the term of such 
contract or for injury to persons or damage to property of 
others.

(b) Possession. The Company will not, without the 
prior written consent of the Loan Trustee, lease or otherwise 
in any manner deliver, transfer or relinquish possession of the 
Airframe or any Engine or install any Engine, or permit any

Airframe; provided that, so long as no Indenture Event of 
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and so long as
<PAGE> 142

41

the action to be taken shall not deprive the Loan Trustee of 
the perfected lien of this Indenture on the Airframe or 
(subject to subclause (B) of the "provided further" clause to 
subsection (i) of this Section 7(b)) any Engine, and in any 
event, so long as the Company shall comply with the provisions 
of Section 11, the Company may, without the prior consent of 
the Loan Trustee:

(i) subject the Airframe to normal interchange 
agreements or any Engine to normal interchange or pooling 
agreements or arrangements in each case customary in the 
airline industry and entered into by the Company in the 
ordinary course of its business with any other United 
States air carrier as to which there is in force a 
certificate issued pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal 
Aviation Act or any successor provision that gives like 
authority or with any "foreign air carrier" (as such term 
is defined in such Act) as to which there is in force a 
permit issued pursuant to Section 402 of said Act (any such 
United States certificated air carrier and any such foreign 
air carrier being hereinafter called a "Permitted Air 
Carrier"); provided that no transfer of the registration of 
such Airframe shall be effected in connection therewith; 
and provided, further, that (A) no such agreement or 
arrangement contemplates or requires the transfer of title 
to the Airframe and (B) if the Company's title to any such 
Engine shall be divested under any such agreement or 
arrangement, such divestiture shall be deemed to be an 
Event of Loss with respect to such Engine and the Company 
shall comply with Section 10(b) of this Article in respect 
thereof;

(ii) deliver possession of the Airframe or any Engine

required or permitted by the terms of Section 7(a) or 8(c) 
of this Article;

(iii) transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine 
to the United States of America or any instrumentality or 
agency thereof pursuant to a sublease, contract or other

without limitation, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program 
authorized under 10 U.S.C. Section 9511 et seq. or any 
substantially similar program);

(v) install an Engine on an airframe owned by the 
Company free and clear of all Liens, except (A) those of 
the type permitted under clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), 
(vi) and (vii) of Section 6 of this Article and those which 
apply only to the engines (other than Engines), appliances, 
parts, instruments, appurtenances, accessories, furnishings 
and other equipment (other than Parts) installed on such 
airframe (but not to the airframe as an entirety) and 
(B) the rights of other Permitted Air Carriers under normal 
interchange agreements which are customary in the airline 
industry 
and do not contemplate, permit or require the transfer of 
title to the airframe or engines installed thereon;

(vi) install an Engine on an airframe leased to the 
Company or owned by the Company subject to a conditional 
sale or other security agreement; provided that (A) such 
airframe is free and clear of all Liens except the rights 
of the parties to the lease or conditional sale or other 
security agreement covering such airframe and except Liens 
of the type permitted by clauses (A) and (B) of 
subparagraph (v) of this paragraph of Section 7(b) of this 
Article and (B) the Company shall have obtained from the 
lessor or secured party of such airframe a written 
agreement (which may be the lease or conditional sale or 
other security agreement covering such airframe), in form 
and substance satisfactory to the Loan Trustee (it being 
understood that an agreement from such lessor or secured 
party substantially in the form of the final sentence of 
the penultimate paragraph of this Section 7(b) of this 
Article shall be deemed to be satisfactory to the Loan 
Trustee), whereby such lessor or secured party expressly 
agrees that neither it nor its successors or assigns will 
acquire or claim any right, title or interest in any Engine 
by reason of such Engine being installed on such airframe 
at any time while such Engine is subject to the lien of the 
Trust Indenture;

<PAGE> 144

43

subparagraph (vi) of this Section 7(b) of this Article is 
applicable; provided that such installation shall be deemed 
an Event of Loss with respect to such Engine and the 
Company shall comply with Section 10(b) of this Article in 
respect thereof, the Loan Trustee not intending hereby to 
waive any right or interest it may have to or in such 
Engine under applicable law until compliance by the Company 
with such Section 10(b) of this Article; 

(viii) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or 
engines then installed on the Airframe to any United States 
air carrier as to which there is in force a certificate 
issued pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act 
or successor provision that gives like authority;

(ix) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or 
engines then installed on the Airframe to (A) any foreign 
air carrier that is principally based in and a domiciliary 
of a country (other than Cuba, El Salvador, Iran, Iraq, 
Lebanon and Libya) that is at the inception of the lease a 
party to the Mortgage Convention, or (B) any foreign air 
carrier that is principally based in and a domiciliary of a 
country listed in Schedule I hereto, or (C) any foreign air 
carrier not described in clause (A) or (B) above; provided 
that (w) in the case only of a lease to a foreign air 
carrier under clause (C) above, the Loan Trustee receives 
at the time of such lease an opinion of counsel to the 
Company (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to 
the Loan Trustee to the effect that (a) the terms of the 
lease and the Operative Documents are legal, valid, binding 
and enforceable in the country in which such air carrier is 
principally based, to substantially the same extent as the 
Operative Documents are at that time enforceable in the 
United States, (b) it is not necessary for the Loan Trustee 
to qualify to do business in such country solely as a 
result of the proposed lease, (c) there is no tort 
liability of the Loan Trustee as a result of the Lien of 
this Indenture under the laws of such country other than 
tort liability no more extensive or onerous than that which 
might have been imposed on the Loan Trustee under the laws 
of the United States or any state thereof (it being 
understood that, in the event such opinion cannot be given 
in a form satisfactory to the Loan Trustee, such opinion 
shall be waived if insurance reasonably satisfactory to the 
Loan Trustee is provided by the Company
<PAGE> 145

44

to cover the risk of such liability), (d) the laws of
such country require fair compensation by the government 
of such country for the loss of the use of the Aircraft in 
the event of the requisition by such government of the 
Aircraft (unless the Company shall have agreed to provide 
insurance reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee 
covering the risk of requisition of use of the Aircraft by 
the government of such jurisdiction so long as the aircraft 
is leased in such country), and (e) there exist no 
possessory rights in favor of such lessee under the laws of 
such country which would, upon bankruptcy of or other 
default by the Company or the lessee, prevent the return of 
such Engine or the Airframe and such Engine or engine to 
the Loan Trustee in accordance with and when permitted by 
the terms of this Indenture upon the exercise by the Loan 
Trustee of its remedies under this Indenture, (x) in the 
case only of a lease to a foreign air carrier under clause 
(C) above, the Loan Trustees receives assurances reasonably 
satisfactory to it that the currency of such country is 
freely convertible into U.S. Dollars (unless the Company 
shall have agreed to provide the requisition insurance 
described in subclause (d) of clause (w) above,), (y) in 
the case of any lease to a foreign air carrier, either the 
lease, or an arrangement existing between the Company, the 
lessee and/or one or more third parties that provide 
maintenance services, provides that the Aircraft will be 
maintained, serviced, repaired, overhauled and tested in 
accordance with maintenance standards for Boeing 757-200 
series aircraft approved by, or substantially similar to 
those approved or required by, the Federal Aviation 
Administration or the central civil aviation authority of 
any of Brazil, Canada, France, The Federal Republic of 
Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland 
or the United Kingdom and (z) in the case of any lease to a 
foreign air carrier (other than a foreign air carrier 
principally based in Taiwan) the United States of America 
maintains diplomatic relations with the country in which 
such foreign air carrier is principally based at the time 
such lease is entered into;

provided that the rights of any transferee who receives 
possession by reason of a transfer permitted by this Section 
7(b) (other than the transfer of an Engine which is deemed an 
Event of Loss) shall be subject and subordinate to, and any 
lease permitted by this Section 7(b) shall be made expressly 
subject and subordinate to, all the terms of this Indenture, 
including, without limitation, the Loan Trustee's rights to 
repossession pursuant to Article 8 hereof and to avoid such
<PAGE> 146

45

lease upon such repossession and the Loan Trustee's rights to 
possession pursuant to Section 8.03 of this Indenture, and the 
Company shall in all events remain primarily liable hereunder 
for the performance and observance of all of the terms and 
conditions of this Indenture to the same extent as if such 
lease or transfer had not occurred, and any such lease shall 
include appropriate provisions for the maintenance (subject to 
clause (y) of the proviso to Section 7(b)(ix) of this Article) 
and insurance of the Aircraft. The Company shall not lease the 
Aircraft to an air carrier that at the inception of the lease 
is subject to bankruptcy proceedings unless the lease shall 
have been approved by the receiver, liquidator, conservator, 
court or other governmental or administrative authority or 
entity responsible for the adjudication or administration of 
such proceedings. No interchange agreement, pooling agreement, 
lease or other relinquishment of possession of the Airframe or 
any Engine shall in any way discharge or diminish any of the 
Company's obligations to the Loan Trustee hereunder or under 
the Participation Agreement. With the prior written consent of 
the Loan Trustee, the Company may sublease the Airframe or 
Engines in connection with a transaction that involves such a 
sublease commencing at the inception of the transaction. The 
Loan Trustee hereby agrees, for the benefit of the lessor or 
secured party of any airframe leased by the Company or owned by 
the Company subject to a conditional sale or other security 
agreement, that the Loan Trustee will not acquire or claim, as 
against such lessor or secured party, any right, title or 
interest in any engine or engines owned by the lessor under 
such lease or subject to a security interest in favor of the 
secured party under such conditional sale or other security 
agreement as the result of such engine or engines being 
installed on the Airframe at any time while such engine or 
engines are subject to such lease or conditional sale or other 
security agreement.

The Loan Trustee acknowledges that any "wet lease" or 
other similar arrangement under which the Company maintains 
operational control of the Aircraft shall not constitute a 
delivery, transfer or relinquishment of possession for purposes 
of this Section 7(b).

(c) Insignia. The Company agrees to at all times 
maintain in the cockpit of the Airframe adjacent to the 
airworthiness certificate therein and (if not prevented by 
applicable law or regulations or by any governmental authority) 
on each Engine a nameplate bearing the inscription "STATE 
STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CONNECTICUT, NATIONAL
<PAGE> 147

46

ASSOCIATION, AS LOAN TRUSTEE, MORTGAGEE" (such nameplate to be 
replaced, if necessary, with a nameplate reflecting the name of 
any successor Loan Trustee). 

Section 8. Replacement and Pooling of Parts; 
Alterations, Modifications and Additions. (a) Replacement of 
Parts. The Company, at its own cost and expense, will promptly 
replace all Parts which may from time to time be incorporated 
or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine and 
which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, 
destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or 
rendered permanently unfit for use for any reason whatsoever, 
except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of this Article. 
In addition, the Company may, at its own cost and expense, 
remove in the ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, 
overhaul or testing, any Parts, whether or not worn out, lost, 
stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair 
or rendered permanently unfit for use; provided that the 
Company, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of this 
Article, will, at its own cost and expense, replace such Parts 
as promptly as possible. All replacement Parts shall be free 
and clear of all Liens (except for pooling arrangements to the 
extent permitted by Section 8(b) of this Article and Permitted 
Liens) and shall be in as good operating condition as, and 
shall have a value and utility at least equal to, the Parts 
replaced, assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition 
and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof. All 
Parts at any time removed from the Airframe or any Engine shall 
remain subject to the Lien of this Indenture, no matter where 
located, until such time as such Parts shall be replaced by 
Parts which have been incorporated or installed in or attached 
to the Airframe or such Engine and which meet the requirements 
for replacement Parts specified above. Immediately upon any 
replacement Part becoming incorporated or installed in or 
attached to the Airframe or any Engine as above provided 
without further act, (i) title to the replaced Part shall 
thereupon be free and clear of all rights of the Loan Trustee, 
and shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder, (ii) title to 
such replacement Part shall thereupon be subject to the Lien of 
this Indenture, free and clear of all Liens (except for 
Permitted Liens) and (iii) such replacement Part shall become 
subject to this Indenture and be deemed part of the Airframe or 
such Engine for all purposes to the same extent as the Parts 
originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the 
Airframe or such Engine.

(b) Pooling of Parts. Any Part removed from the 
Airframe or any Engine as provided in Section 8(a) of this
<PAGE> 148

47

Article may be subjected by the Company to a normal pooling 
arrangement customary in the airline industry entered into in 
the ordinary course of the Company's business with Permitted 
Air Carriers; provided that the Part replacing such removed 
Part shall be incorporated or installed in or attached to the 
Airframe or such Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of this 
Article as promptly as practicable after the removal of such 
removed Part. In addition, any replacement Part, when 
incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any 
Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article, may be 
owned by a Permitted Air Carrier subject to such a normal 
pooling arrangement; provided that the Company, at its expense, 
as promptly thereafter as is practicable, either (i) causes 
title to such replacement Part to vest in the Company free and 
clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens, at which time such 
replacement Part shall, in accordance with Section 8(a) of this 
Article become a Part and become subject to the Lien of this 
Indenture or (ii) replaces such replacement part by 
incorporating or installing in or attaching to the Airframe or 
such Engine a further replacement Part owned by the Company 
free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), which 
shall without further act be subject to the Lien of this 
Indenture.

(c) Alterations, Modifications and Additions. The 
Company, at its own expense, will make such alterations and 
modifications in and additions to the Airframe and the Engines 
as may be required from time to time to meet the standards of 
the Federal Aviation Administration or other governmental 
authority having jurisdiction in any country in or over which 
the Aircraft is flown; provided, however, that the Company may, 
in good faith, contest the validity or application of any such 
standard in any reasonable manner which does not materially 
adversely affect the Loan Trustee or the Lien of this 
Indenture, but only so long as such proceedings do not involve 
any material danger of criminal liability or material danger of 
civil liability to the Loan Trustee, or a material danger of 
the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Aircraft or any Engine or 
any interest therein. In addition, the Company, at its own 
expense, may from time to time make or cause to be made such 
alterations and modifications in and additions to the Airframe 
or any Engine as the Company may deem desirable in the proper 
conduct of its business, including, without limitation, removal 
or Parts; provided that no such alterations, modification, 
addition or removal shall materially diminish the value or 
utility of the Airframe or such Engine or of the Aircraft, or 
materially impair the condition or airworthiness thereof,
<PAGE> 149

48

below the value, utility, condition and airworthiness thereof 
immediately prior to such alternation, modification, addition 
or removal assuming the Airframe or such Engine was then of the 
value and utility and in the condition and airworthiness 
required to be maintained by the terms of this Indenture, 
except that the value (but not the utility, condition or 
airworthiness) of the Aircraft may be reduced by the value of 
Parts which the Company deems obsolete or no longer suitable or 
appropriate for use in the Airframe or any Engine which shall 
have been removed, if the aggregate value of such obsolete or 
unsuitable Parts removed from the Aircraft and not replaced 
shall not exceed $500,000. All Parts incorporated or installed 
in or attached or added to the Airframe or any Engine as the 
result of such alteration, modification or addition shall, with 
our further act, be subject to the Lien of this Indenture. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, at any time, 
remove any Part; provided that (i) such Part is in addition to, 
and not in replacement of or substitution for, any Part 
originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the 
Airframe or such Engine at the time of delivery thereof under 
the Lease or hereunder or any Part in replacement of, or 
substitution for, any such Part, (ii) such Part is not required 
to be incorporated or installed in or attached or added to such 
Airframe or Engine pursuant to the first sentence of this 
Section 8(c), and (iii) such Part can be removed from the 
Airframe or such Engine without materially diminishing or 
impairing the value, utility, condition or airworthiness 
required to be maintained by the terms of this Indenture which 
the Airframe or such Engine would have had at such time had 
such removal not occurred. Upon the removal by the Company of 
any Part as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, or 
the removal of any obsolete or unsuitable part permitted by 
this Section 8(c), such Part shall not longer be deemed part of 
the Airframe or the Engine from which it was removed and shall 
no longer be subject to the Lien of this Indenture. Any such 
Part not removed by the Company as provided in Section 
8(c)(iii) of this Article shall remain subject to the Lien of 
this Indenture.

Section 10. Loss, Destruction, Requisition, Etc. (a) 
Event of Loss with Respect to an Airframe. Upon the occurrence 
of an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe, the Company 
shall forthwith (and, in any event, within 30 days after such 
occurrence) give the Loan Trustee written notice of such Event 
of Loss and of its election to perform one of the following 
options (it being agreed that if the Company shall not have 
given notice of such election within
<PAGE> 150

49

such 30 days after such occurrence, the Company shall be deemed 
to have elected to perform the option set forth in the 
following clause (ii)): 

(i) as promptly as practicable, and in any event on 
or before the Business Day next preceding the 121st day 
next following the date of occurrence of such Event of 
Loss, in replacement for the Airframe, the Company shall 
convey or cause to be conveyed to the Loan Trustee a 
security interest in and to one or more Replacement 
Airframes (together with the same number of Replacement 
Engines as the Engines, if any, installed on the Airframe 
at the time such Event of Loss occurred), such Replacement 
Airframe and Replacement Engines to be duly certificated as 
airworthy by the central aviation authority of the 
jurisdiction of the registry of such Replacement Airframes 
and Engines, free and clear of all Liens (other than 
Permitted Liens), to have a value and utility at least 
equal to, and to be in as good operating condition as, the 
Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced (assuming such 
Airframe and Engines were in the condition and repair 
required by the terms of this Indenture); provided that, if 
the Company shall not perform its obligation to effect such 
replacement under this clause (i) during the period of time 
provided herein, then the Company shall promptly give 
notice to the Loan Trustee and shall pay on the Business 
Day next following the thirtieth day after the end of such 
period to the Loan Trustee, in U.S. currency, the amounts 
specified in clause (ii) below; or

(ii) on or before the Loss Payment Date (as defined 
below) the Company shall pay to the Loan Trustee an amount 
in cash which is sufficient to redeem each Outstanding 
Equipment Note pursuant to Section 6.01; provided that the 
Company may, to the extent provided and in accordance with 
Section 3.08 hereof, surrender, to the Loan Trustee for 
cancellation Equipment Notes held by the Company and in 
such event the Company shall be entitled to a credit 
against amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this 
clause (ii). As used herein, "Loss Payment Date" means the 
earliest of (x) 30 days following the date on which 
insurance proceeds are received with respect to such Event 
of Loss, (y) the Business Day next following the 121st day 
next following the date of occurrence of the Event of Loss 
and (z) a Business Day irrevocably specified by the Company 
at least thirty days in advance by notice to the Loan 
Trustee; provided, however, the
<PAGE> 151

50

Loss Payment Date shall be the date specified in the 
proviso to clause (i) above if applicable.

Upon compliance by the Company with the requirements of this 
Section 10(a)(ii), the Loan Trustee shall execute such 
instruments as may be reasonably requested by the Company 
releasing the Airframe and Engines from the Lien of this 
Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase 
Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge thereof 
hereunder.

At the time of or prior to any replacement of the 
Airframe and such Engines pursuant to Section 10(a)(i) of this 
Article, if any, the Company, at its own expense, will (A) 
cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement, substantially 
in the form of Exhibit C hereto for such Replacement Airframe 
and Replacement Engines, if any, to be delivered to the Loan 
Trustee for execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for 
recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act or, if 
necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction 
other than the United States of America in which such 
Replacement Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if any, are to be 
registered in accordance with Section 7(a) of this Article, as 
the case may be, (B) cause a financing statement or statements 
with respect to the Replacement Airframe and Replacement 
Engines, if any, or other requisite documents or instruments, 
to be filed in such place or places as necessary or advisable 
in order to perfect the security interest therein created by or 
pursuant to this Indenture, or, if necessary or advisable, 
pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which 
such Replacement Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if any, are 
to be registered in accordance with Section 7(a) of this 
Article, as the case may be, (C) furnish the Loan Trustee with 
a certificate of an independent aircraft engineer or appraiser 
reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee certifying that the 
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, have a 
value and utility at least equal to, and are in as good 
operating condition as, the Airframe and Engines, if any, so 
replaced assuming the Airframe and Engines were in the 
condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately 
prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss, (D) furnish the 
Loan Trustee with (i) such evidence of compliance with the 
insurance provisions of Section 11 of this Article with respect 
to such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines as the 
Loan Trustee may reasonably request and (ii) a certificate from 
a Responsible Officer of the Company certifying that at the 
time of such
<PAGE> 152

51

replacement, there is no continuing Indenture Event of Default, 
(E) furnish the Loan Trustee with an opinion of the Company's 
counsel (which may be the Company's General Counsel) addressed 
to the Loan Trustee that the substituted property will be 
subject to the Lien of the this Indenture and the Loan Trustee 
should be entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 of the 
United States Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, with respect 
to the Replacement Airframe, provided that (x) such opinion 
need not be delivered to the extent that the benefits of such 
Section 1110 were not, by reason of a change in law or 
governmental interpretation thereof, available to the Loan 
Trustee with respect to the Aircraft immediately prior to such 
substitution and (y) such opinion may contain qualifications of 
the tenor contained in the opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton 
delivered pursuant to Section 4(J) of the Participation 
Agreement on the Delivery Date. In the case of each 
Replacement Airframe and each Replacement Engine, if any, in 
which a security interest has been granted to the Loan Trustee 
under this Section 10, and each Replacement Engine, if any, in 
which a security interest has been granted to the Loan Trustee 
under this Section 10, promptly upon the recordation of the 
Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement covering such 
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, or such 
Replacement Engine pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act (or 
pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which 
such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, or 
such Replacement Engine, are registered in accordance with 
Section 7(a) of this Article), the Company will cause to be 
delivered to the Loan Trustee a favorable opinion of counsel to 
the Company as to the due registration of such Replacement 
Aircraft, the due recordation of such Trust Agreement and 
Indenture Supplement or other requisite documents or 
instruments and the validity and perfection of the security 
interest in the Replacement Airframe, Replacement Engines or 
Replacement Engine, as the case may be, granted to the Loan 
Trustee under this Indenture.

For all purposes hereof, upon grant of a security 
interest therein to the Loan Trustee, each Replacement Aircraft 
and the Replacement Engines, if any, shall be deemed part of 
the property secured hereunder; each such Replacement Airframe 
shall be deemed an "Airframe" as defined herein, and each such 
Replacement Engine shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined 
herein. Upon full compliance with the terms of the previous 
paragraph, the Loan Trustee shall execute and deliver to the 
Company an appropriate instrument releasing such replaced 
airframe and engines (if any) installed thereon at the time 
such Event of Loss occurred from the Lien of this
<PAGE> 153

52

Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase 
Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge hereunder.

(b) Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Upon 
the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine 
under circumstances in which there has not occurred an Event of 
Loss with respect to the Airframe, the Company shall give the 
Loan Trustee prompt written notice thereof and shall, within 90 
days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, convey or 
cause to be conveyed to the Loan Trustee, as replacement for 
the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, a 
security interest in and to a Replacement Engine free and clear 
of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and having a value 
and utility at least equal to, and being in as good operating 
condition as, the Engine with respect to which such Event of 
Loss occurred, assuming such Engine was of the value and 
utility and in the condition and repair required by the terms 
hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of 
Loss. Prior to or at the time of any such conveyance, the 
Company, at its own expense, will (i) cause a Trust Agreement 
and Indenture Supplement substantially in the form of Exhibit C 
hereto or other requisite documents or instruments for such 
Replacement Engine to be delivered to the Loan Trustee for 
execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for recordation 
pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act or, if necessary, pursuant 
to the applicable laws of such jurisdiction other than the 
United States of America in which the Aircraft is or is to be 
registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the case may be, 
(ii) furnish the Loan Trustee with a certificate of an aircraft 
engineer or appraiser (who may be an employee of the Company) 
certifying that such Replacement Engine has a value and utility 
at least equal to, and is in as good operating condition as, 
the Engine so replaced, assuming such Engine was in the 
condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately 
prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss and (iii) cause a 
financing statement or statements with respect to the 
Replacement Engine or other requisite documents or instruments 
to be filed in such place or places necessary or advisable in 
order to perfect the security interest in the Replacement 
Engine created by or pursuant to this Indenture or, if 
necessary or advisable, pursuant to the applicable laws of the 
jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is or is to be registered in 
accordance with Section 7(a), as the case may be, and (iv) 
furnish the Loan Trustee with such evidence of compliance with 
the insurance provisions of Section 11 of this Article with 
respect to such Replacement Engine as the
<PAGE> 154

53

Loan Trustee may reasonably request, and (v) furnish the Loan 
Trustee with an opinion of the Company's counsel (which may be 
the Company's General Counsel) addressed to the Loan Trustee to 
the effect that such substituted property will be subjected to 
the Lien of this Indenture. Upon full compliance by the 
Company with the terms of this paragraph (b), the Loan Trustee 
will transfer to the Company, without recourse or warranty 
(except as to the Trustee's Liens), all of Loan Trustee's 
right, title and interest in and to the Engine with respect to 
which such Event of Loss occurred, and Loan Trustee will assign 
to or as directed by the Company all claims of Loan Trustee 
against third Persons relating to such Engine arising from such 
Event of Loss. In addition, upon such transfer the Loan 
Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Company an appropriate 
instrument releasing such Engine from the Lien of this 
Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase 
Agreement Assignment (in respect of such Engine) from the 
assignment and pledge under this Indenture. For all purposes 
hereof, each such Replacement Engine shall, after such 
conveyance, be deemed part of the property secured hereunder 
and shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein.

(c) Application of Payments from Governmental 
Authorities for Requisition of Title or Use. Any payments 
(other than insurance proceeds the application of which is 
provided for in Section 11 of this Article) received at any 
time by the Loan Trustee or by the Company from any 
governmental authority or other Person with respect to an Event 
of Loss resulting from the condemnation, confiscation, theft or 
seizure of, or requisition of title to or use of, the Airframe 
or any Engine, other than a requisition for use by any 
Government or by the government of registry of the Aircraft not 
constituting an Event of Loss, will be applied as follows:

(i) if such payments are received with respect to the 
Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines 
installed on the Airframe that has been or is being 
replaced by the Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this 
Article, such payments shall be paid over to, or retained 
by, the Loan Trustee, and upon completion of such 
replacement be paid over to, or retained by, the Company;

(ii) if such payments are received with respect to the 
Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines 
installed on the Airframe that has not been and will not be 
replaced pursuant to Section 10(a) of this Article,
<PAGE> 155

such payments shall, after reimbursement of the Loan 
Trustee for costs and expenses, be applied in reduction of 
the Company's obligation to pay the amounts required to be 
paid by the Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this 
Article, if not already paid by the Company, or, if already 
paid by the Company, shall be applied to reimburse the 
Company for its payment of such amounts, and the balance, 
if any, of such payments remaining thereafter shall be paid 
over to, and retained by, the Company; and

(iii) if such payments are received with respect to an 
Engine under circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b) of 
this Article, so much of such payments remaining after 
reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and expenses 
shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Company; 
provided that the Company shall have fully performed the 
terms of Section 10(b) of this Article with respect to the 
Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

(d) Requisition for Use by the Government of the 
Airframe and the Engines Installed Thereon. In the event of 
the requisition for use by any Government or by the government 
of the country of registry of the Aircraft (including for this 
purpose any agency or instrumentality thereof), including, 
without limitation, pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet 
Program referred to in Section 7(b)(iv) of this Article of the 
Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on the Airframe, 
the Company shall promptly notify the Loan Trustee of such 
requisition and, except as otherwise provided in this 
Indenture, such requisition shall not constitute an Event of 
Loss and all of the Company's obligations under this Indenture 
with respect to the Aircraft shall continue to the same extent 
as if such requisition had not occurred unless or until such 
requisition shall constitute an Event of Loss. All payments 
received by the Loan Trustee or the Company from the Government 
or government for the use of the Airframe and Engines or 
engines prior to the occurrence of an Event of Loss shall be 
paid over to, or retained by, the Company.

(e) Requisition for Use by the Government of an 
Engine. In the event of the requisition for use by any 
Government or by the government of the country of registry of 
the Aircraft (including for this purpose any agency or 
instrumentality thereof) of any Engine (but not the Airframe), 
the Company will replace such Engine hereunder by
<PAGE> 156

55

complying with the terms of Section 10(b) of this Article to 
the same extent as if an Event of Loss had occurred with 
respect to such Engine, and any payments received by the Loan 
Trustee or the Company from such Government or government with 
respect to such requisition shall be paid over to, or retained 
by, the Company.

(f) Application of Payments During Existence of 
Indenture Event of Default. Any amount referred to in clause 
(i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 10(c), Section 10(d) or 
Section 10(e) of this Article which is payable to the Company 
shall not be paid to the Company, or if it has been previously 
paid directly to the Company, shall not be retained by the 
Company, if at the time of such payment an Indenture Event of 
Default, or an Indenture Default which would constitute an 
Indenture Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), 8.01(f), 
8.01(g), 8.01(h) or 8.01(i), shall have occurred and be 
continuing, but shall be paid to and held by the Loan Trustee 
as security for the obligations of the Company under this 
Indenture, and at such time as there shall not be continuing 
any such Indenture Event of Default or event, such amount shall 
be paid to the Company, provided that, if any such amount has 
been so held by the Loan Trustee as security for more than 90 
days after an Event of Default shall have occurred and during 
which period (x) the Loan Trustee shall not have been limited 
by operation of law or otherwise from exercising remedies 
hereunder and (y) the Loan Trustee shall not have commenced to 
exercise any remedy available to it under this Indenture, then 
such amount shall be paid to the Company.

Section 11. Insurance. (a) Public Liability and 
Property Damage Insurance. Subject to the rights of the 
Company to establish and maintain self-insurance with respect 
to public liability and property damage liability insurance for 
aircraft and engines (including the Aircraft and Engines) in 
the manner and to the extent specified in the next sentence, 
the Company will carry, or cause to be carried, at no expense 
to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, public 
liability (including, without limitation, contractual liability 
and passenger legal liability) and property damage liability 
insurance (exclusive of manufacturer's product liability 
insurance) with respect to the Aircraft (i) in amounts which 
are not less than the public liability and property damage 
insurance applicable to similar aircraft and engines which 
comprise the Company's fleet on which the Company carries 
insurance, provided that such liability insurance shall not be 
less than the amount certified to the
<PAGE> 157

56

Original Loan Participants on the Delivery Date, (ii) of the 
type usually carried by corporations engaged in the same or 
similar business, similarly situated with the Company, and 
owning or operating similar aircraft and engines and covering 
risks of the kind customarily insured against by the Company, 
and (iii) which is maintained in effect with insurers of 
recognized responsibility. The Company may self-insure, by way 
of deductible or premium adjustment provisions in insurance 
policies, the risks required to be insured against pursuant to 
the preceding sentence, but in no case shall the self-insurance 
(including the self-insurance permitted by Section 11(b) of 
this Article) with respect to all of the aircraft and engines 
in the Company's fleet (including, without limitation, the 
Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month policy year the lesser of (x) 
50% of the largest replacement value of any single aircraft in 
the Company's fleet or (y) 1-1/2% of the average aggregate 
insurable value (for the preceding year) of all aircraft 
(including, without limitation, the Aircraft) on which the 
Company carries insurance; provided that, in the event that 
there shall have occurred a material adverse change in the 
financial condition of the Company from such condition as is 
reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the 
Company at December 31, 1982, then, upon not less than 30 days' 
written notice from the Loan Trustee to the Company, the 
Company will, until the Company's financial condition is on an 
overall basis equivalent to its financial condition at December 
31, 1982, reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder to such 
reasonable amount as the Loan Trustee may require; provided, 
further, that a deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce 
handling that, in the case of the Aircraft, is not in excess of 
the amount customarily allowed as a deductible in the industry, 
shall be permitted in addition to the abovementioned 
self-insurance. Any policies of insurance carried in 
accordance with this Section 11(a) and any policies taken out 
in substitution or replacement for any of such policies (A) 
shall name the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee as 
additional insureds as their respective Interests may appear, 
(B) shall provide that in respect of the respective interests 
of the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee in such 
policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action 
or inaction of the Company and shall insure the Loan Trustee's 
and the Pass Through Trustee's Interests as they appear, 
regardless of any breach or violation of any warranty, 
declaration or condition contained in such policies by the 
Company, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is cancelled 
for any reason whatever, or any substantial change is made in 
the policy which affects the coverage certified
<PAGE> 158

57

hereunder to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, or 
if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of 
premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be 
effective as to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee 
for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as is customarily 
obtainable in the industry, in the case of any war risk and 
allied perils coverage) after receipt by the Loan Trustee nor 
the Pass Through Trustee, respectively, of written notice from 
such insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse, (D) shall 
provide that neither the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through 
Trustee shall have any obligation or liability for premiums, 
commissions, assessments or calls in connection with such 
insurance, (E) shall provide that the insurers shall waive (i) 
any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction, 
whether by attachment or otherwise, which they may have against 
the Loan Trustee nor the Pass Through Trustee and (ii) any 
rights of subrogation against the Loan Trustee or the Pass 
Through Trustee to the extent that the Company has waived its 
rights by its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant 
to this Indenture or the Participation Agreement; provided that 
the exercise by such insurers of rights of subrogation derived 
from the rights retained by the Company shall not, in any way, 
delay payment of any claim that would otherwise be payable by 
such insurers but for the existence of rights of subrogation 
derived from rights retained by the Company, (F) shall be 
primary without right of contribution from any other insurance 
which may be carried by the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through 
Trustee with respect to its Interests as such in the Aircraft 
and (G) shall expressly provide that all of the provisions 
thereof, except the limits of liability, shall operate in the 
same manner as if there were a separate policy covering each 
insured. "Interests" as used in this Section 11(a) and Section 
11(b) of this Article with respect to any person means the 
interests of such person in its capacity as Loan Trustee or 
Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, in the transaction 
contemplated by the Participation Agreement and this Indenture. 
The Company shall arrange for appropriate certification that 
the requirements of this Section 11(a) have been met to be made 
to the Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee may furnish such 
certificates to each Loan Participant) as soon as practicable 
by each insurer or its authorized representative with respect 
thereto, provided that all information contained therein shall 
be held confidential by the Loan Trustee and each Loan 
Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to 
anyone other than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, 
agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom any Loan 
Participant is in
<PAGE> 159

58

good faith conducting negotiations relating to the possible 
transfer and sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes, 
if such person shall have entered into an agreement similar to 
that contained in this Section 11(a) whereby such person agrees 
to hold such information confidential, and except as may be 
required by an order of any court or administrative agency or 
by any statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental 
authority. In the case of a lease or contract with any 
Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, or in the 
case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine 
by any Government, a valid agreement, reasonably satisfactory 
to the Loan Trustee, to indemnify the Company against any of 
the risks which the Company is required hereunder to insure 
against by such Government shall be considered adequate 
insurance to the extent of the risks and in the amounts that 
are the subject of any such agreement to indemnify.

(b) Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Aircraft. 
Subject to the rights of the Company to establish and maintain 
self-insurance with respect to loss or damage to aircraft 
(including the Aircraft) in the manner and to the extent 
specified in the next sentence, the Company shall maintain, or 
cause to be maintained, in effect with insurers of recognized 
responsibility, at no expense to the Loan Trustee or the Pass 
Through Trustee, all-risk aircraft hull insurance covering the 
Aircraft and all-risk coverage with respect to any Engines or 
parts while removed from the Aircraft (including, without 
limitation, war risk and allied perils insurance if and to the 
extent the same is maintained by the Company or any Permitted 
Air Carrier leasing the same with respect to other aircraft 
owned or operated by the Company or such Permitted Air Carrier, 
as the case may be, on the same routes) which is of the type 
and in substantially the amount usually carried by corporations 
engaged in the same or similar business and similarly situated 
with the Company; provided that (i) such insurance (including 
the permitted self-insurance) shall at all times while the 
Aircraft is subject to the Lien of this Indenture be for an 
amount not less than, at the date of determination thereof, the 
Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus six 
months interest thereon and (ii) such insurance need not cover 
an Engine while attached to an airframe not owned, leased or 
operated by the Company. The Company may self-insure, by way 
of deductible or premium adjustment provisions in insurance 
policies, the risks required to be insured against pursuant to 
the preceding sentence, but in no case shall the self-insurance 
(including the self-insurance
<PAGE> 160

59

permitted by Section 11(a) of this Article) with respect to all 
of the aircraft and engines in the Company's fleet (including, 
without limitation, the Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month 
policy year the lesser of (i) 50% of the largest replacement 
value of any single aircraft in the Company's fleet or (ii) 
1-1/2% of the average aggregate insurable value (for the 
preceding year) of all aircraft (including, without limitation, 
the Aircraft) on which the Company carries insurance; provided 
that, in the event that there shall have occurred a material 
adverse change in the financial condition of the Company from 
such condition as is reflected in the consolidated financial 
statements of the Company at December 31, 1982, then, upon not 
less than 30 days' written notice from the Loan Trustee to the 
Company, the Company will, until the Company's financial 
condition is on an overall basis equivalent to its financial 
condition at December 31, 1982, reduce the self-insurance 
permitted hereunder to such reasonable amount as the Loan 
Trustee may require; provided, further, that a deductible per 
occurrence utilized to reduce handling that, in the case of the 
Aircraft, is not in excess of the amount customarily allowed as 
a deductible in the industry, shall be permitted in addition to 
the above-mentioned self-insurance. Any policies carried in 
accordance with this Section 11(b) and any policies taken out 
in substitution or replacement for any such policies (A) shall 
provide that any loss up to the amount equal to the Outstanding 
principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest 
thereon, for any loss or damage constituting an Event of Loss 
with respect to the Aircraft, and any loss in excess of 
$7,000,000, up to the amount equal to the Outstanding principal 
amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon, 
for any loss or damage to the Aircraft (or Engines) not 
constituting an Event of Loss with respect to the Aircraft, 
shall be paid to the Loan Trustee as long as this Indenture 
shall not have been discharged pursuant to the terms and 
conditions thereof, and thereafter to the Company, unless, in 
each case, the insurer shall have received notice that an 
Indenture Event of Default exists, in which case all insurance 
proceeds up to an amount equal to the Outstanding principal 
amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon 
shall be payable to the Loan Trustee, (B) shall provide that in 
respect of the respective interests of the Loan Trustee and of 
the Pass Through Trustee in such policies the insurance shall 
not be invalidated by any action or inaction of the Company and 
shall insure the Loan Trustee's and the Pass Through Trustee's 
Interests, as they appear, regardless of any breach or 
violation of any warranty, declaration or condition contained 
in such policies
<PAGE> 161

60

by the Company, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is 
cancelled for any reason whatever, or any material change is 
made in the policy which affects the coverage certified 
hereunder to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, or 
if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of 
premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be 
effective as to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee 
for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as may from time 
to time be customarily obtainable in the industry, in the case 
of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt by 
the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, respectively, of 
written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, change 
or lapse, (D) shall be primary without right of contribution 
from any other insurance which may be carried by the Loan 
Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee with respect to its 
Interests as such in the Aircraft and (E) shall provide that 
the insurers shall waive (i) any rights of set-off, 
counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by attachment or 
otherwise, which they may have against the Loan Trustee or the 
Pass Through Trustee and (ii) any rights of subrogation against 
the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee to the extent 
that the Company has waived its rights by its agreements to 
indemnify any such party pursuant to this Indenture or the 
Participation Agreement; provided that the exercise by such 
insurers of rights of subrogation derived from rights retained 
by the Company shall not, in any way, delay payment of any 
claim that would otherwise be payable by such insurers but for 
the existence of rights of subrogation derived from rights 
retained by the Company. The Company shall arrange for 
appropriate certification that the requirements of this Section 
11(b) have been met to be made promptly to the Loan Trustee 
(and the Loan Trustee shall furnish such certification to each 
Loan Participant) by each insurer or its authorized 
representative with respect thereto, provided that all 
information contained therein shall be held confidential by the 
Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant and shall not be 
furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other than their bank 
examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and 
any person with whom any Loan Participant is in good faith 
conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and 
sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes, if such person 
shall have entered into an agreement similar to that contained 
in this Section 11(b) whereby such Person agrees to hold such 
information confidential, and except as may be required by an 
order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, 
rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. In 
the
<PAGE> 162

61

case of a lease or contract with any Government in respect of 
the Aircraft or any Engine, or in the case of any requisition 
for use of the Aircraft or any Engine by any Government, a 
valid agreement, reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee, 
to indemnify the Company against any of the risks which the 
Company is required hereunder to insure against by such 
Government in an amount, as at the date of determination 
thereof, equal to the Outstanding principal amount of the 
Equipment Notes plus six months interest thereon from time to 
time shall be considered adequate insurance to the extent of 
the risks and in the amounts that are the subject of any such 
agreement to indemnify.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company it is 
agreed that all insurance payments received under policies 
required to be maintained by the Company hereunder, exclusive 
of any payments received in excess of an amount, as at the date 
of determination thereof, equal to the Outstanding principal 
amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon 
from such policies, as the result of the occurrence of an Event 
of Loss with respect to the Airframe or an Engine will be 
applied as follows:

(x) if such payments are received with respect to the 
Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines 
installed on the Airframe that has been or is being 
replaced by the Company as contemplated by Section 10(a) of 
this Article, such payments shall be paid over to, or 
retained by, the Loan Trustee, and upon completion of such 
replacement be paid over to, or retained by, the Company;

(y) if such payments are received with respect to the 
Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines 
installed thereon that has not been and will not be 
replaced as contemplated by Section 10(a) of this Article, 
so much of such payments remaining after reimbursement of 
the Loan Trustee for costs and expenses as shall not exceed 
an amount, as at the date of determination thereof, equal 
to the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes 
plus accrued interest thereon required to be paid by the 
Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this Article shall be 
applied in reduction of the Company's obligation to pay 
such amount equal to the Outstanding principal amount of 
the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon, if not 
already paid by the Company, or, if already paid by the 
Company, shall be applied to reimburse the Company for
<PAGE> 163

62

its payment of such amount equal to the Outstanding 
principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued 
interest thereon, and the balance, if any, of such payment 
remaining thereafter will be paid over to, or retained by, 
the Company; and

(z) if such payments are received with respect to an 
Engine under the circumstances contemplated by Section 
10(b) of this Article, so much of such payments remaining 
after reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and 
expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by, the 
Company; provided that the Company shall have fully 
performed the terms of Section 10(b) of this Article with 
respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments are 
made.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the 
insurance payment of any property damage loss in excess of an 
amount equal to the Outstanding principal amount of the 
Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon shall be paid to 
the Company.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the 
insurance payments of any property damage loss not constituting 
an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe or an Engine will 
be applied in payment (or to reimburse the Company) for repairs 
or for replacement property in accordance with the terms of 
Sections 7 and 8 of this Article, and any balance remaining 
after compliance with such Sections with respect to such loss 
shall be paid to the Company. Any amount referred to in the 
preceding sentence or in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the second 
preceding paragraph which is payable to the Company shall not 
be paid to the Company or, if it has been previously paid 
directly to the Company, shall not be retained by the Company, 
if at the time of such payment an Indenture Event of Default 
(or an Indenture Default that with lapse of time would 
constitute an Indenture Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), 
8.01(f), 8.01(g), 8.01(h) or 8.01(i) of this Indenture) shall 
have occurred and be continuing, but shall be paid to and held 
by the Loan Trustee, as security for the obligations of the 
Company under this Indenture, and at such time as there shall 
not be continuing any such Indenture Event of Default or event, 
such amount shall be paid to the Company, provided that if any 
such amount has been so held by the Loan Trustee as security 
for more than 90 days after an Indenture Event of Default shall 
have occurred and during which period (i) the Loan Trustee 
shall not have been limited by operation of law
<PAGE> 164

63

or otherwise from exercising remedies hereunder and (ii) the 
Loan Trustee shall not have exercised any remedy available to 
it under Section 15 of this Article, then such amount shall be 
paid to the Company.

(c) Reports, Etc. Annually upon renewal of the 
Company's insurance coverage, the Company will furnish to the 
Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee shall furnish to each Loan 
Participant) a report signed by a firm of independent aircraft 
insurance brokers appointed by the Company, stating the opinion 
of such firm that the insurance then carried and maintained on 
the Aircraft complies with the terms hereof; provided that all 
information contained in such report shall be held confidential 
by the Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant and shall not be 
furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other than their bank 
examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and 
any Person with whom any Loan Participant is in good faith 
conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and 
sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes, if such Person 
shall have entered into an agreement similar to that contained 
in this Section 11(c) whereby such Person agrees to hold such 
information confidential, and except as may be required by an 
order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, 
rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. The 
Company will cause such firm to advise the Loan Trustee and the 
Pass Through Trustee, in writing promptly of any default in the 
payment of any premium and of any other act or omission on the 
part of the Company of which such firm has knowledge and which 
might invalidate or render unenforceable, in whole or in part, 
any insurance on the Aircraft. The Company will also cause 
such firm to advise the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through 
Trustee, in writing as promptly as practicable after such firm 
acquires knowledge that an interruption or reduction of any 
insurance carried and maintained on the Aircraft pursuant to 
the provisions of this Section 11 will occur.

(d) Insurance for Own Account. Nothing in this 
Section 11 shall limit or prohibit the Loan Trustee or the 
Company from obtaining insurance for its own account with 
respect to the Airframe or any Engine and any proceeds payable 
thereunder shall be payable as provided in the insurance policy 
relating thereto, provided that (i) no such insurance may be 
obtained which would limit or otherwise adversely affect the 
coverage or amounts payable under insurance required to be 
maintained pursuant to this Section 11, it being understood 
that all salvage rights to the
<PAGE> 165

64

Airframe or such Engine shall remain with the Company's 
insurers at all times, and (ii) the Loan Trustee may obtain 
hull insurance on the Aircraft only to the extent the 
procurement of such insurance does not have an adverse effect 
on the Company's ability or cost to obtain such insurance, 
except that the limitation in the foregoing clause (i) on the 
Loan Trustee's right to obtain liability insurance shall not 
apply during any period in which the Company is providing a 
Government indemnity in lieu of the liability insurance 
required by Section 11(a) of this Article and the limitations 
in clauses (i) and (ii) on the Loan Trustee's rights to obtain 
hull insurance shall not apply during any period in which the 
Company is providing a Government indemnity in lieu of the hull 
insurance required by Section 11(b) of this Article.

Section 12. Inspection. At all reasonable times so 
long as any Equipment Notes are outstanding, but upon at least 
5 days' prior written notice to the Company, the Loan Trustee 
or its authorized representatives may at their own expense and 
risk (including, without limitation, any risk of personal 
injury or death) conduct a visual walk-around inspection of the 
Aircraft and any Engine and may inspect the books and records 
of the Company relating thereto; provided that (a) such 
representative shall be fully insured to the reasonable 
satisfaction of the Company at no cost to the Company with 
respect to any risks incurred in connection with any such 
inspection, (b) any such inspection shall be subject to the 
safety, security and workplace rules applicable at the location 
where such inspection is conducted and any applicable 
governmental rules or regulations and (c) in the case of an 
inspection during a maintenance visit, such inspection shall 
not in any respect interfere with the normal conduct of such 
maintenance visit or extend the time required for such 
maintenance visit. All information obtained in connection with 
any such inspection shall be held confidential by the Loan 
Trustee and each Loan Participant and shall not be furnished or 
disclosed by them to anyone other than their accountants, 
agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom any such Loan 
Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations relating 
to the possible transfer and sale of such Loan Participant's 
Equipment Notes if such Person shall have entered into an 
agreement similar to that contained in this Section 12 whereby 
such Person agrees to hold such information confidential, and 
except as may be required by an order of any court or 
administrative agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or 
order of any governmental authority. Upon the Loan Trustee's 
request, the
<PAGE> 166

65

Company will notify the Loan Trustee of the next scheduled 
"heavy maintenance" visit to be conducted by the Company in 
respect of the Aircraft; provided that the Company shall have 
the right in its sole discretion to reschedule, or change the 
location of, any maintenance visit of which it shall have 
notified the Loan Trustee pursuant to this sentence, the 
Company hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts to notify the 
Loan Trustee of any such rescheduling or change. The Loan 
Trustee shall not have any duty to make such inspection and 
shall not incur any liability or obligation by reason of not 
making any such inspection. No inspection pursuant to this 
Section 12 shall interfere with the use, operation or 
maintenance of the Aircraft or the normal conduct of the 
Company's business, and the Company shall not be required to 
undertake or incur any additional liabilities in connection 
therewith.

Section 17. Further Assurances; Financial 
Information. Forthwith upon the execution and delivery of each 
Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement, the Company will 
cause such Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement to be duly 
filed and recorded in accordance with the Federal Aviation Act. 
In addition, the Company and the Loan Trustee will promptly 
and duly execute and deliver to the other party hereto such 
further documents and assurances and take such further action 
as such other party may from time to time reasonably request in 
order to effectively carry out the intent and purpose of this 
Indenture, including, without limitation, if requested by the 
Loan Trustee, the execution and delivery of supplements or 
amendments hereto, in recordable form, subjecting to this 
Indenture any Replacement Airframe or Replacement Engine and 
the recording or filing of counterparts hereof or thereof, in 
accordance with the laws of such jurisdictions as the Loan 
Trustee may from time to time deem advisable; provided that 
this sentence is not intended to impose upon the Company any 
additional liabilities not otherwise contemplated by this 
Indenture. The Company agrees to furnish the Loan Trustee (i) 
within 60 days after the end of each of the first three 
quarterly fiscal periods in each fiscal year of the Company, a 
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated 
subsidiaries prepared by it as of the close of such period, 
together with the related consolidated statements of income and 
cash flows for such period, (ii) within 120 days after the 
close of each fiscal year of the Company, a consolidated 
balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries

the obligations of the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture 
and Security Agreement and this Equipment Note except such 
obligations as could necessarily be performed exclusively by an

its individual capacity incurred on or prior to the Relevant 
Date or arising out of or based upon events occurring on or 
prior to the Relevant Date, which obligations and liabilities 
shall remain the responsibility of the Owner Trustee).

The Company confirms and ratifies the security 
interest which the Owner Trustee granted to the Loan Trustee 
pursuant to the Granting Clause of this Indenture in all of the 
Owner Trustee's right, title and interest in the Aircraft and 
its interest in the Purchase Agreement (to the extent assigned

of Section 28 of Article 15 hereof, be deemed to have been 
modified mutatis mutandis.

following conditions are met:

(a) Such change in registration complies with the provisions
of this Indenture.

(b) No Indenture Event of Default (and no event which, with
lapse of time or notice, or both, would become an Indenture Event of
Default) shall have occurred and be continuing at the date of such
request or at the effective date of the change in registration,
provided that it shall not be necessary to comply with this condition
(i) if the change in registration results in the registration of the

<PAGE> 28
17

United States of America or (ii) if the Loan Trustee in its discretion
believes the change in registration would be advantageous to the Loan
Participants.

(c) The Loan Trustee shall have received an opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to it to the effect that:

the Lien on the Aircraft and the other property included in
the Indenture Estate shall continue as a fully perfected Lien
and that all filing, recording or other action necessary to
perfect and protect the Lien of the Indenture has been
accomplished (or if such opinion cannot be given at the time
by which the Loan Trustee has been requested to consent to a
change in registration, (x) the opinion shall detail what
filing, recording or other action is necessary and (y) the
Loan Trustee shall have received a certificate from the
Company that all possible preparation to accomplish such
filing, recording and other action shall have been done, and
such filing, recording and other action shall be accomplished

to the Loan Trustee on or prior to the effective date of the
change in registration); and

limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors

limited by applicable laws which may affect the remedies
provided for in this Indenture, which laws, however, do not in
the opinion of such counsel make the remedies provided in this
Indenture inadequate for the practical realization of the
rights and benefits provided hereby.

(d) The Loan Trustee shall have received assurances
reasonably satisfactory to it that the insurance provisions contained
in Section 11 of Article 15 hereof will have been complied with after

satisfactory to the Loan Trustee for the payment of all expenses
connected with such change in registration.

The Loan Trustee shall execute such documents as the Company shall reasonably
request in order to satisfy the above conditions and upon satisfaction of such

Section 7.03. (Intentionally Omitted)

(H) Sections 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 and 8.04 thereof shall read as
follows:

Section 8.01. Indenture Events of Default. The following
events shall constitute "Indenture Events of Default" under this Indenture
(whether any such event shall be voluntary or involuntary or come about or be
effected by operation of law or pursuant to or in compliance with any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body) and each such Indenture Event of Default
shall be deemed to exist and continue so long as, but only as long as, it shall
not have been remedied:

(a) the Company shall fail to pay any installment of interest
upon any Equipment Note, or the principal of any Equipment Note or
premium, if any, in respect of any Equipment Note, in each case when

shall continue for more than 15 days after the same shall have become
due and payable; or

(b) the Company shall fail to carry and maintain insurance on
or with respect to the Aircraft in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11 of Article 15 hereof; provided that, in the case of
insurance with respect to which cancellation, change or lapse for
nonpayment of premium shall not be effective as to the Loan Trustee
for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as may from time to time
be customarily obtainable in the industry, in the case of any war risk
and allied perils coverage) after receipt of notice by the Loan
Trustee of such cancellation, change or lapse, no such failure to
carry and maintain insurance shall constitute an Indenture Event of
Default hereunder until the earlier of (i) the date such failure shall
have
<PAGE> 30
19

continued unremedied for a period of 20 days (five days in the case of
any war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt by the Loan
Trustee of the notice of cancellation, change or lapse referred to in
Section 11(a)(C) or 11(b)(C) of Article 15 hereof, or (ii) the date
such insurance not being in effect as to the Loan Trustee; or

(c) the Company shall operate the Aircraft at a time when
public liability insurance required by Section 11(a) of Article 15
hereof shall not be in effect; or

(d) the Company shall fail to perform or observe any covenant
or agreement to be performed or observed by it hereunder or under the
Participation Agreement and such failure shall continue unremedied for
a period of 30 days after written notice thereof has been given by the
Loan Trustee; provided that, if such failure is capable of being
remedied, no such failure shall constitute an Event of Default
hereunder for a period of 360 days from the date of such notice so
long as the Company is diligently proceeding to remedy such failure;
or

(e) any material representation or warranty made by the
Company in the Participation Agreement or in the Purchase Agreement
(to the extent applicable to the Aircraft) or in any document or
certificate furnished by the Company in connection herewith or
therewith or pursuant hereto or thereto shall prove to have been
incorrect in any material respect at the time made and such
incorrectness shall continue to be material and shall continue
unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof has
been given by the Loan Trustee; or

(f) the Company shall consent to the appointment of a
receiver, trustee or liquidator of itself or of a substantial part of
its property or the Company shall admit in writing its inability to
pay its debts generally as they come due, or shall make a general
assignment for the benefit of creditors; or

(g) the Company shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy
or a voluntary petition or an answer seeking reorganization in a
proceeding under any bankruptcy laws (as now or hereafter in effect)
or an answer admitting the material allegations of a petition filed
against the Company in any such proceeding, or the Company shall by
voluntary petition, answer or consent, seek relief under
<PAGE> 31
20

the provisions of any other now existing or future bankruptcy or other
similar law providing for the reorganization or winding-up of
corporations, or providing for an agreement, composition, extension or
adjustment with its creditors; or

(h) an order, judgment or decree shall be entered by any
court of competent jurisdiction appointing, without the consent of the
Company, a receiver, trustee or liquidator of the Company or of any

of appointment or sequestration shall remain in force undismissed,
unstayed or unvacated for a period of 90 days after the date of entry
thereof; or

(i) a petition against the Company in a proceeding under the
Federal bankruptcy laws or other insolvency laws, as now or hereafter
in effect, shall be filed and shall not be withdrawn or dismissed
within 90 days thereafter, or, under the provisions of any law
providing for reorganization or winding-up of corporations which may
apply to the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume
jurisdiction, custody or control of the Company or of any substantial
part of its property and such jurisdiction, custody or control shall
remain in force unrelinquished, unstayed or unterminated for a period
of 90 days;

provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Indenture, any failure of the Company to perform or observe any covenant,
condition, or agreement herein shall not constitute an Indenture Event of
Default if such failure is caused solely by reason of an event referred to in
the definition of "Event of Loss", so long as the Company is continuing to
comply with the applicable terms of Section 10 of Article 15 hereof.

Section 8.02. Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment. If an
Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Loan Trustee, by
notice to the Company, or the Loan Participants holding at least 25% in

Company and the Loan Trustee, may declare the principal of all the Equipment
Notes to be due and payable. Upon such declaration, the principal of all
Equipment Notes, together with accrued interest thereon from the date in
respect of which interest was last paid hereunder to the date payment of
<PAGE> 32
21

such principal has been made or duly provided for shall be due and payable
immediately. At any time after such declaration and prior to the sale or
disposition of the Indenture Estate, the Loan Participants in a majority in
aggregate principal amount of all of the Outstanding Equipment Notes, by notice
to the Loan Trustee and the Company, may rescind such a declaration and thereby
annul its consequences if (i) an amount sufficient to pay all principal of,
premium, if any, and interest thereon, at the rate prescribed therefor in such
Equipment Note and interest due or past due, if any, in respect of the
Outstanding Equipment Notes plus all other amounts payable to the Loan
Participants, other than by reason of such acceleration, and all sums due and
payable to the Loan Trustee has been deposited with the Loan Trustee, (ii) the
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (iii) all
existing Indenture Defaults and Indenture Events of Default under this
Indenture have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal of, premium,
if any, or interest on the Equipment Notes that has become due solely because
of such acceleration.

Section 8.03. Other Remedies Available to Loan Trustee. (a)
After an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and so long as the same
shall be continuing, then and in every such case the Loan Trustee, as trustee
of an express trust and as holder of a security interest in the Aircraft or
Engines or otherwise, may, at its option, declare this Indenture to be in
default by a written notice to the Company; and at any time thereafter, so long
as the Company shall not have remedied all outstanding Events of Default, the
Loan Trustee may do one or more of the following with respect to all or any
part of any Airframe or any Engines as the Loan Trustee in its sole discretion
shall elect, to the extent permitted by, and subject to compliance with any
mandatory requirements of, applicable law then in effect; provided, however,
that, during any period when the Aircraft is subject to the Civil Reserve Air
Fleet Program in accordance with the provisions of Section 7(b) of Article 15
hereof and in the possession of the United States government or an
instrumentality or agency thereof, and to the extent that any applicable law or
contractual provision covering the Aircraft so requires, the Loan Trustee shall
not, on account of any Indenture Event of Default, be entitled to do any of the
following in such manner as to limit the Company's control (or any lessee's
control under any lease permitted by the terms of Section 7(b) of Article 15
hereof) of any Airframe or any Engines, unless at least 60 days' (or such
<PAGE> 33
22

lesser period as may then be applicable under the Military Airlift Command
Program of the United States Government) prior written notice of default under
this Indenture with respect to the Company's obligations hereunder shall have
been given by the Loan Trustee by registered or certified mail to the Company
(and, if applicable, any such lessee) with a copy addressed to the Contracting
Office Representative for the Military Airlift Command of the United States Air
Force under any contract with the Company (or any such lessee) relating to the
Aircraft:

(i) cause the Company, upon the written demand of the Loan
Trustee and at the Company's expense, to return promptly, and the
Company shall return promptly, all or such part of any Airframe or any
Engine as the Loan Trustee may so demand to the Loan Trustee or its
order or the Loan Trustee, at its option, may enter upon the premises
where all or any part of such Airframe or any Engine are located and
take immediate possession of and remove the same (together with any
engine which is not an Engine but which is installed on the Airframe,
subject to all of the rights of the owner, lessor, lienor or secured
party of such engine; provided that the Airframe with an engine (which
is not an Engine) installed thereon may be flown or returned only to a
location within the continental United States, and such engine shall
be held for the account of any such owner, lessor, lienor or secured
party or, if owned by the Company, may, at the option of the Loan
Trustee, be exchanged with the Company for an Engine) all without
liability accruing to the Loan Trustee for or by reason of such entry
or taking of possession or removal, whether for the restoration of
damage to property caused by such taking or otherwise; or

(ii) sell all or any part of any Airframe and any Engine at
public or private sale, whether or not the Loan Trustee shall at the
time have possession thereof, as the Loan Trustee may determine, or
otherwise dispose of, hold, use, operate, lease to others or keep idle
all or any part of such Airframe or such Engine as the Loan Trustee,
in its sole discretion, may determine, all free and clear of any
rights of the Company and without any duty to account to the Company
with respect to such action or inaction or for any proceeds with
respect thereto.

(b) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and Section 8.03(h), if an
Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is
<PAGE> 34
23

continuing, the Loan Trustee may, if at the time such action may be lawful and
always subject to compliance with any mandatory legal requirements, either with
or without taking possession, and either before or after taking possession, and
without instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, and having first given
notice of such sale by registered mail to the Company once at least thirty days
prior to the date of such sale, and any other notice which may be required by
law, sell and dispose of the Indenture Estate, or any part thereof, or interest
therein, at public auction to the highest bidder, in one lot as an entirety or
in separate lots, and either for cash or on credit and on such terms as the
Loan Trustee may determine, and at any place (whether or not it be the location
of the Indenture Estate or any part thereof) and time designated in the notice
above referred to; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any provision
herein to the contrary, the Loan Trustee shall not sell any of the Indenture
Estate unless a declaration of acceleration has been made pursuant to Section
8.02. Any such sale or sales may be adjourned from time to time by
announcement at the time and place appointed for such sale or sales, or for any
such adjourned sale or sales, without further notice, and the Loan Trustee and
any Loan Participant may bid and become the purchaser at any such sale. The
Loan Trustee may exercise such right without possession or production of the
Equipment Notes or proof of ownership thereof, and as representative of the
Loan Participants may exercise such right without notice to the Loan
Participants or including the Loan Participants as parties to any suit or
proceeding relating to foreclosure of any property in the Indenture Estate.
The Company hereby irrevocably constitutes the Loan Trustee the true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of the Company (in the name of the Company or otherwise) for
the purpose of effectuating any sale, assignment, transfer or delivery for
enforcement of the Lien created under this Indenture, whether pursuant to
foreclosure or power of sale or otherwise, to execute and deliver all such
bills of sale, assignments and other instruments as the Loan Trustee may
consider necessary or appropriate, with full power of substitution, the Company
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney or any substitute shall
lawfully do by virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Loan
Trustee or any purchaser, the Company shall ratify and confirm any such sale,
assignment, transfer or delivery, by executing and delivering to the Loan
Trustee or such purchaser all bills of sale, assignments, releases and other
proper instruments to effect such ratification and confirmation as may be
designated in any such request.
<PAGE> 35
24

(c) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), if an Indenture
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall, at the
request of the Loan Trustee, promptly execute and deliver to the Loan Trustee
such instruments of title or other documents as the Loan Trustee may deem
necessary or advisable to enable the Loan Trustee or an agent or representative
designated by the Loan Trustee, at such time or times and place or places as
the Loan Trustee may specify, to obtain possession of all or any part of the
Indenture Estate. If the Company shall for any reason fail to execute and
deliver such instruments and documents after such request by the Loan Trustee,
the Loan Trustee shall be entitled, in a proceeding to which the Company will
be a necessary party, to a judgment for specific performance of the covenants
contained in the foregoing sentence, conferring upon the Loan Trustee the right
to immediate possession and requiring the Company to execute and deliver such
instruments and documents to the Loan Trustee. The Loan Trustee shall also be
entitled to pursue all or any part of the Indenture Estate wherever it may be
found and may enter any of the premises of the Company or any other Person
wherever the Indenture Estate may be or is supposed to be and search for the
Indenture Estate and take possession of any item of the Indenture Estate
pursuant to this Section 8.03(c). The Loan Trustee may, from time to time, at
the expense of the Indenture Estate, make all such expenditures for
maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and
improvements to and of the Indenture Estate, as it may deem proper. In each
such case, the Loan Trustee shall have the right to use, operate, store, lease,
control or manage the Indenture Estate, and to exercise all rights and powers
of the Company relating to the Indenture Estate as the Loan Trustee shall deem
appropriate, including the right to enter into any and all such agreements with
respect to the use, operation, storage, leasing, control or management of the
Indenture Estate or any part thereof; and the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to
collect and receive directly all tolls, rents, issues, profits, products,
revenues and other income of the Indenture Estate and every part thereof,
without prejudice, however, to the right of the Loan Trustee under any
provision of this Indenture to collect and receive all cash held by, or
required to be deposited with, the Loan Trustee hereunder. In accordance with
the terms of this Section 8.03(c), such tolls, rents, issues, profits,
products, revenues and other income shall be applied to pay the expenses of
using, operating, storing, leasing, controlling or managing the Indenture
Estate, and of all maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations,
<PAGE> 36
25

additions and improvements, and to make all payments which the Loan Trustee may
be required or may elect to make, if any, for taxes, assessments, insurance or
other proper charges upon the Indenture Estate or any part thereof (including
the employment of engineers and accountants to examine, inspect and make
reports upon the properties and books and records of the Company in accordance
with this Section 8.03(c)), and all other payments which the Loan Trustee may
be required or authorized to make under any provision of this Indenture,
including this Section 8.03(c), as well as just and reasonable compensation for
the services of the Loan Trustee, and of all Persons properly engaged and
employed by the Loan Trustee.

If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing and
the Loan Trustee shall have obtained possession of or title to the Aircraft,
the Loan Trustee shall not be obligated to use or operate the Aircraft or cause
the Aircraft to be used or operated directly or indirectly by itself or through
agents or other representatives or to lease, license or otherwise permit or
provide for the use or operation of the Aircraft by any other Person unless (i)
the Loan Trustee shall have been able to obtain insurance in kinds, at rates
and in amounts satisfactory to it in its discretion to protect the Indenture
Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and individually, against any and all
liability for loss or damage to the Aircraft and for public liability and
property damage resulting from use or operation of the Aircraft and (ii) funds
are available in the Indenture Estate to pay for all such insurance or, in lieu
of such insurance, the Loan Trustee is furnished with indemnification from the
holders of the Equipment Notes or any other Person upon terms and in amounts
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee in its discretion to protect the Indenture
Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and individually, against any and all
such liabilities.

(d) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), the Loan Trustee
may proceed to protect and enforce this Indenture and the Equipment Notes by
suit or suits or proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy, and whether
for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or
in execution or aid of any power herein granted; or for foreclosure hereunder,
or for the appointment of a receiver or receivers for the Indenture Estate or
any part thereof, or for the recovery of judgment for the indebtedness secured
by the Lien created under this Indenture or for the enforcement of any other
proper, legal or
<PAGE> 37
26

equitable remedy available under applicable law.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture to the
contrary, including, without limitation, Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(c) and 8.03(d),
so long as no Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Loan Trustee shall not take any action contrary to, or disturb, the
Company's rights to possession and use of, and quiet enjoyment of, the
Aircraft.

(f) Each and every right, power and remedy herein given to
the Loan Trustee specifically or otherwise in this Indenture shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to every other right, power and remedy
herein specifically given or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by
statute, and each and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein
given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time and as often in
such order as may be deemed expedient by the Loan Trustee, and the exercise or
the beginning of the exercise of any power or remedy shall not be construed to
be a waiver of the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other
right, power or remedy. No delay or omission by the Loan Trustee in the
exercise of any right, remedy or power or in pursuing any remedy shall impair
any such right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default
on the part of the Company or to be an acquiescence therein.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any
payment of principal of any Equipment Note shall not be made when and as the
same shall become due and payable, or if any payment of interest on any
Equipment Note shall not be made when and as the same shall become due and
payable, and such failure shall continue for the period prescribed in Section
8.01(a), the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to recover judgment, in its own
name and as trustee of an express trust, upon the Equipment Note for the whole
amount of such principal or interest, as the case may be, remaining unpaid.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, so long as the
Pass Through Trustee is the registered holder of any Equipment Note hereunder,
the Loan Trustee is not authorized or empowered to acquire title to all or any
portion of the Indenture Estate or take any action with respect to all or any
portion of the Indenture Estate so acquired by it if such acquisition or action
would cause any Pass Through Trust to fail to qualify as a "grantor trust"
<PAGE> 38
27

for Federal income tax purposes.

Section 8.04. Waiver of Company. To the extent now or at any
time hereafter enforceable under applicable law, the Company covenants that it
will not at any time insist upon or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or
take any benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law now or at any time
hereafter in force, nor claim, take nor insist upon any benefit or advantage of
or from any law now or hereafter in force providing for the valuation or
appraisement of the Indenture Estate or any part thereof, prior to any sale or
sales thereof to be made pursuant to any provision herein contained, or to the
decree, judgment or order of any court of competent jurisdiction; nor, after
such sale or sales, claim or exercise any right under any statute now or
hereafter made or enacted by any state or otherwise to redeem the property so
sold or any part thereof, and hereby expressly waives for itself and on behalf
of each and every Person, except decree or judgment creditors of the Company
acquiring any interest in or title to the Indenture Estate or any part thereof
subsequent to the date of this Indenture, all benefit and advantage of any such
law or laws, and covenants that it will not invoke or utilize any such law or
laws or otherwise hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein
granted and delegated to the Loan Trustee, but will suffer and permit the
execution of every such power as though no such law or laws had been made or
enacted.

The Loan Trustee may maintain such a proceeding even if it
does not possess any of the Equipment Notes or does not produce any of them in
the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Loan Trustee or any Loan
Participant in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Indenture Event
of Default under this Indenture shall not impair the right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in such Indenture Event of Default.

(I) Section 9.11 thereof shall read as follows:

Section 9.11. Assumption of Certain Obligations.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, any reference
in this Article 9 to the Owner Trustee or to any obligation of the Owner
Trustee shall be deemed to be a reference to the Company or to an obligation of
the Company, as the case may be, any reference to "Lease Event of Default"
shall be deemed to be a reference to an "Indenture Event of Default", all
provisions requiring notices to the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant
shall be deemed to be
<PAGE> 39
28

deleted for the purposes of this Article 9 and any provision in this Article 9
requiring the action or consent of the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to require
the action or approval of the Company.

satisfactory to the Loan Trustee to the effect that the protection afforded by
Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code to the existing Loan Participants would not

respect to the Aircraft immediately prior to such assumption; and provided
further that such opinion may contain qualifications of the tenor contained in
the opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton delivered pursuant to Section 3(k) of the

Engine or any interest therein, (v) materialmen's, mechanics', workmen's,
repairmen's, employees' or other like Liens arising in the ordinary course of
business for amounts the payment of which is either not yet delinquent or is
being contested in good faith (and for the payment of which adequate reserves
have been provided) by appropriate proceedings so long as such proceedings do
not involve any significant danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the
Airframe or any Engine or interest therein, (vi) Liens arising out of judgments
or awards against the Company or any lessee with respect to which an appeal or
proceeding for review is being prosecuted in good faith, so long as any such
judgment or award does not involve any significant risk of the sale, forfeiture
or loss of the Airframe or any Engine or any interest therein (unless the
Company or any lessee shall have provided a bond or other security in an amount
and under terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company) and (vii) salvage or
similar rights of insurers under insurance policies maintained pursuant to
Section 11 of this Article. The Company will promptly, at its own expense,

Section 7. Registration, Maintenance and Operation;
Possession; Insignia. (a) Registration, Maintenance and Operation. The
Company, at its own cost and expense, shall:

(i) at all times cause the Aircraft to remain duly registered
under the laws of the United States, in the name of the Company, as
owner; provided that the Loan Trustee shall execute and deliver all
such documents as the Company shall reasonably request for the purpose
of effecting and continuing such registration. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, but subject to the conditions and requirements of
Section 7.02 of this Indenture, at no expense or liability to any Loan
Participant or the Loan Trustee, the Company may cause the Aircraft to
be duly registered under the laws of any jurisdiction in the name of
the Company or of any nominee of the Company, or, if required by
applicable law, in the name of any other Person, and the Loan Trustee
will cooperate with the Company in effecting such foreign
registration;

(ii) maintain, service, repair, overhaul and test the
Aircraft in accordance with a maintenance program (as
<PAGE> 50
39

approved by the Federal Aviation Administration) for Boeing 767-323ER
aircraft and General Electric CF6-80C2B6 engines (or, at the Company's
option, in accordance with the aircraft maintenance standards for such
aircraft and engines approved by the central civil aviation authority
of any of Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Japan,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction with
aircraft maintenance standards that are, at the time that such
standards become applicable to the Aircraft, substantially similar to
those of the United States or substantially similar to those of any of
the foregoing countries on the Delivery Date) and in the same manner
and with the same care used by the Company with respect to comparable
aircraft and engines owned or operated by the Company and utilized in
similar circumstances so as to keep the Aircraft in as good an
operating condition as when delivered to the Company hereunder,
ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in such condition as may be
necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of the Aircraft to
be maintained in good standing at all times (other than during
temporary periods of storage in accordance with applicable regulations
or during periods of grounding by applicable governmental authorities)
under the Federal Aviation Act or, if the Aircraft is registered under
the laws of any other jurisdiction, the laws of such jurisdiction;

(iii) maintain all records, logs and other materials in
English and such other languages as are, from time to time, required
by the appropriate authorities in the jurisdiction where the Aircraft
is registered and maintained to be maintained in respect of the
Aircraft; and

(iv) promptly furnish to the Loan Trustee such information as
may be required to enable the Loan Trustee to file any reports,
returns or statements required to be filed by the Loan Trustee with
any governmental authority because of the Loan Trustee's interest in
the Aircraft.

The Company agrees that the Aircraft will not be maintained,
used or operated in violation of any law or any rule, regulation or order of
any government or governmental authority having jurisdiction (domestic or
foreign), or in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or
registration relating to the Aircraft issued by any such government or
authority; provided that the Company shall not
<PAGE> 51
40

be in default under this sentence if it is not possible for it to comply with
the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States (or the jurisdiction in
which the Aircraft is then registered) because of a conflict with the
applicable laws of the United States (or such jurisdiction in which the
Aircraft is then registered). In the event that any such law, rule, regulation
or order requires alteration of the Aircraft, the Company will conform thereto
or obtain conformance therewith at no expense to the Loan Trustee and will
maintain the Aircraft in proper operating condition under such laws, rules,
regulations and orders; provided, however, that the Company may, in good faith,
contest the validity or application of any such law, rule, regulation or order
in any reasonable manner which does not materially adversely affect the Loan
Trustee, the Aircraft, the Loan Participants or the Lien of this Indenture.
The Company also agrees not to operate or locate the Aircraft, or suffer the
Aircraft to be operated or located, (i) in any area excluded from coverage by
any insurance required by the terms of Section 11 of this Article, except in
the case of a requisition for use by any Government where the Company obtains
indemnity in lieu of such insurance from such Government against the risks and
in the amounts required by Section 11 of this Article, covering such area, or
(ii) in any war zone or recognized or, in the Company's reasonable judgment,
threatened area of hostilities unless covered by war risk insurance of the type
required to be maintained in Section 11 of this Article, or unless the Aircraft
is operated or used under contract with any Government, under which contract
such Government assumes liability for any damage, loss, destruction or failure
to return possession of the Aircraft at the end of the term of such contract
and for injury to persons and damage to property of others.

(b) Possession. The Company will not, without the prior
written consent of the Loan Trustee, lease or otherwise in any manner deliver,
transfer or relinquish possession of the Airframe or any Engine or install any
Engine, or permit any Engine to be installed, on any airframe other than the
Airframe; provided that, so long as no Indenture Event of Default (or in the
case of a lease described in clause (viii) or (ix) below, a Payment or
Bankruptcy Default) shall have occurred and be continuing, and so long as the
action to be taken shall not deprive the Loan Trustee of the perfected Lien of
this Indenture on the Airframe or (subject to subclause (B) of the "provided
further" clause to subsection (i) of this Section 7(b)) any Engine, and in any
event, so long as the Company shall comply with the provisions of
<PAGE> 52
41

Section 11 of this Article, the Company may, without the prior consent of the
Loan Trustee:

(i) subject the Airframe to normal interchange agreements or
any Engine to normal interchange or pooling agreements or arrangements
in each case customary in the airline industry and entered into by the
Company in the ordinary course of its business with any other United
States air carrier as to which there is in force a certificate issued
pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act or any successor
provision that gives like authority, and as to which there is in full
force and effect an air carrier operating certificate issued pursuant
to Part 121 of the regulations under such Act, or with any "foreign
air carrier" (as such term is defined in such Act) as to which there
is in force a permit issued pursuant to Section 402 of said Act and
which is principally based in and a domiciliary of either (A) a
country listed in Schedule I or Schedule I-A hereto or (B) a country
as to which the Company has delivered an opinion to the effect
specified in clause (y) of paragraph (ix) of this section 7(b) with
respect to such interchange agreement (mutatis mutandis) with such
foreign air carrier (any such United States certificated air carrier
and any such foreign air carrier being hereinafter called a "Permitted
Air Carrier"); provided that no transfer of the registration of such
Airframe shall be effected in connection therewith; and provided
further that (A) no such agreement or arrangement contemplates,
permits or requires or results in the transfer of title to the
Airframe and (B) if the Company's title to any such Engine shall be
divested under any such agreement or arrangement, such divestiture
shall be deemed to be an Event of Loss with respect to such Engine and
the Company shall comply with Section 10(b) of this Article in respect
thereof;

(ii) deliver possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the
manufacturer thereof for testing or other similar purposes or to any
organization for service, repair, maintenance or overhaul work on the
Airframe or such Engine or any part thereof or for alterations or
modifications in or additions to the Airframe or such Engine to the
extent required or permitted by the terms of Section 7(a) or 8(c) of
this Article;
<PAGE> 53

to the United States or any instrumentality or agency thereof in
accordance with applicable laws, rulings, regulations or orders
(including, without limitation, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program
authorized under 10 U.S.C. Sec. 9511 et seq. or any substantially
similar program);

(v) install an Engine on an airframe owned by the
Company free and clear of all Liens, except (A) those of the type
permitted under clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of
Section 6 of this Article and those which apply only to the engines
(other than Engines), appliances, parts, instruments,
appurtenances, accessories, furnishings and other equipment (other
than Parts) installed on such airframe (but not to the airframe as
an entirety) and (B) the rights of other Permitted Air Carriers
under normal interchange agreements which are customary in the
airline industry and do not contemplate, permit, require or result
in the transfer of title to the airframe or engines installed
thereon;

(vi) install an Engine on an airframe leased to the
Company or owned by the Company subject to a conditional sale or
other security agreement; provided that (A) such airframe is free
and clear of all Liens except the rights of the parties to the
lease or conditional sale or other security agreement covering such
airframe and except Liens of the type permitted by clauses (A) and
(B) of subparagraph (v) of this paragraph of Section 7(b) of this
Article and (B) the Company shall have obtained from the lessor or
secured party of such airframe a written agreement (which may be
the lease or conditional sale or other security agreement covering
such airframe), in form and substance satisfactory to the Loan
Trustee (it being understood that an agreement from such lessor or
secured party substantially in the form of the final sentence of
the penultimate paragraph of this Section 7(b) of this Article
shall be deemed to be satisfactory to the Loan Trustee) whereby
such lessor or secured party expressly agrees that neither it nor
<PAGE> 54
43

its successors or assigns will acquire or claim any right, title or
interest in any Engine by reason of such Engine being installed on
such airframe at any time while such Engine is subject to the Lien
of this Indenture;

(vii) install an Engine on an airframe owned by the
Company, leased to the Company or owned by the Company subject to a
conditional sale or other security agreement under circumstances
where neither subparagraph (v) nor subparagraph (vi) of this
Section 7(b) of this Article is applicable; provided that such
installation shall be deemed an Event of Loss with respect to such
Engine and the Company shall comply with Section 10(b) of this
Article in respect thereof if such installation shall adversely
affect the Loan Trustee's interest in such Engine, the Loan Trustee
not intending hereby to waive any right or interest it may have to
or in such Engine under applicable law until compliance by the
Company with such Section 10(b) of this Article;

(viii) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or
engines then installed on the Airframe to any United States air
carrier as to which there is in force a certificate issued pursuant
to Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act or successor provision
that gives like authority;

(ix) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or
engines then installed on the Airframe to (A) any foreign air
carrier that is principally based in and a domiciliary of a country
that is listed in Schedule 1 hereto, or (B) any foreign air carrier
that is principally based in and a domiciliary of a country listed
in Schedule 1-A hereto, or (C) any foreign air carrier not
described in clause (A) or (B) above, provided that (y) prior to
any lease to a foreign air carrier under clause (C) above, the Loan
Trustee shall have received an opinion of counsel to the Company
licensed in the country in which the lessee is domiciled and
principally based, such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to
the Loan Trustee, to the effect that (1) there exist no possessory
rights in favor of the lessee under the laws of the lessee's
country which would, upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of or other
default by the Company and assuming that at such time such lessee
is not insolvent or bankrupt, prevent the return of such
<PAGE> 55
44

Engine or the Airframe and such Engine or engine to the Loan
Trustee in accordance with and when permitted by terms hereof upon
the exercise by the Loan Trustee of its remedies hereunder, (2) the
remedies provided in the lease are enforceable in the country in
which such foreign air carrier is a domiciliary and principally
based, to substantially the same extent as such remedies would be
enforceable in the United States and the lease is subject and
subordinate to the Lien of this Indenture, (3) it is not necessary
for the Loan Trustee to qualify to do business in such country
solely as a result of the proposed lease and (4) the proposed lease
will not give rise to tort liability to the Loan Trustee as a
result of the Lien of this Indenture under the laws of such country
other than tort liability no more extensive or onerous than that
which might have been imposed on the Loan Trustee under the laws of
the United States in the absence of such lease (it being understood
that, in the event the opinion set forth in this subclause (4)
cannot be given in a form satisfactory to the Loan Trustee, such
opinion shall be waived if insurance reasonably satisfactory to the
Loan Trustee is provided by the Company to cover the risk of such
liability) and (z) in the case of any lease to a foreign air
carrier (other than a foreign air carrier principally based in
Taiwan) the United States of America maintains diplomatic relations
with the country in which such foreign air carrier is principally
based at the time such lease is entered into;

provided that the rights of any lessee or other transferee who receives
possession by reason of a transfer permitted by this Section 7(b) (other than
the transfer of an Engine which is deemed an Event of Loss) shall be subject
and subordinate to, and any lease permitted by this Section 7(b) shall be made
expressly subject and subordinate to, all the terms of this Indenture,
including, without limitation, Section 7(a) of this Article and the Loan
Trustee's rights to repossession pursuant to Article 8 hereof and to avoid such
lease upon such repossession and the Loan Trustee's rights to possession
pursuant to Section 8.03 of this Indenture, and the Company shall in all events
remain primarily liable hereunder for the performance and observance of all of
the terms and conditions of this Indenture to the same extent as if such lease
or transfer had not occurred, and any such lease shall include appropriate
provisions for the maintenance and insurance of the Aircraft. No interchange
agreement, pooling agreement,
<PAGE> 56
45

lease or other relinquishment of possession of the Airframe or any Engine shall
in any way discharge or diminish any of the Company's obligations to the Loan
Trustee hereunder. No sublease of the Airframe or Engines shall be permitted
except in connection with a transaction that involves such a sublease
commencing at the inception of the lease and in which each sublessee and
sublease satisfies the conditions contained in this Section 7(b) with respect
to lessees and leases, respectively. The Company shall not lease the Airframe
or any Engine to an air carrier that at the inception of the lease is subject
to bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings unless the lease shall have been
approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court and payments thereunder shall
have been accorded priority treatment in such bankruptcy or other insolvency
or, in the case of a lease to a foreign air carrier, the lease shall have been
approved by the corresponding foreign authority and payments thereunder shall
have been accorded priority treatment in such bankruptcy or other insolvency
and the Loan Trustee shall have received an opinion in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Loan Trustee of the Company's
counsel to the effect that such approval provides the Company with assurances
and priority treatment substantially equivalent to those that would be provided
by the corresponding United States Bankruptcy Court. The Company shall,
promptly (and in any event within 15 days) upon entering into a lease of the
Airframe or Engines, notify the Loan Trustee of the identity of the lessee and
the term of such lease and shall provide a copy of such lease agreement to the
Loan Trustee upon request therefrom (with economic and financial provisions and
information deleted therefrom if the Company shall so choose), provided that
such parties shall keep confidential the identity of the lessee and the
existence and terms of such lease, except that such parties may disclose such
information (A) to committed (subject to receipt of such information and other
customary closing conditions) transferees of the Loan Trustee's interest who
agree to hold such information confidential, (B) to the Loan Trustee's counsel,
independent insurance advisors or other agents who agree to hold such
information confidential and (C) as may be required by any statute, court or
administrative order or decree or governmental ruling or regulation. The Loan
Trustee hereby agrees, for the benefit of the lessor or secured party of any
airframe leased to the Company or owned by the Company subject to a conditional
sale or other security agreement, that the Loan Trustee will not acquire or
claim, as against such lessor or secured party, any right, title or interest in
any engine or engines owned
<PAGE> 57
46

by the lessor under such lease or subject to a security interest in favor of
the secured party under such conditional sale or other security agreement as
the result of such engine or engines being installed on the Airframe at any
time while such engine or engines are subject to such lease or conditional sale
or other security agreement.

The Loan Trustee acknowledges that any "wet lease" or other
similar arrangement under which the Company maintains operational control of
the Aircraft shall not constitute a delivery, transfer or relinquishment of
possession for purposes of this Section 7(b).

(c) Insignia. The Company agrees to at all times affix on or
to maintain in the cockpit of the Airframe adjacent to the airworthiness
certificate therein and (if not prevented by applicable law or regulations or
by any governmental authority) on each Engine a nameplate bearing the
inscription "MORTGAGED TO STATE STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CONNECTICUT,
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS LOAN TRUSTEE" (such nameplate to be replaced, if
necessary, with a name plate reflecting the name of any successor Loan
Trustee). Except as above provided, the Company will not allow the name of any
Person to be placed on the Airframe or on any Engine as a designation that
might be interpreted as a claim of ownership; provided that nothing herein
contained shall prohibit the Company (or any lessee) from placing its customary
colors and insignia on the Airframe or any Engine.

Section 8. Replacement and Pooling of Parts; Alterations,
Modifications and Additions. (a) Replacement of Parts. The Company, at its
own cost and expense, will promptly replace all Parts which may from time to
time be incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine
and which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed,
seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or rendered permanently unfit for
use for any reason whatsoever, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of
this Article. In addition, the Company may, at its own cost and expense,
remove in the ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or
testing, any Parts, whether or not worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized,
confiscated, damaged beyond repair or rendered permanently unfit for use;
provided that the Company, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of this
Article, will, at its own cost and expense, replace such Parts as promptly as
possible. All replacement Parts shall be free and clear of all Liens
<PAGE> 58
47

(except for Permitted Liens) and shall be in as good operating condition as,
and shall have a value and utility at least equal to, the Parts replaced,
assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition and repair required to be
maintained by the terms hereof. All Parts at any time removed from the
Airframe or any Engine shall remain subject to the Lien of this Indenture no
matter where located, until such time as such Parts be replaced by Parts which
have been incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any
Engine, which meet the requirements for replacement Parts specified above.
Immediately upon any replacement Part becoming incorporated or installed in or
attached to the Airframe or any Engine as above provided, without further act,
(i) title to such replacement Part shall thereupon shall be free and clear of
all Liens (except for Permitted Liens) and (ii) such replacement Part shall
become subject to the Lien of this Indenture and be deemed part of the Airframe
or such Engine for all purposes to the same extent as the Parts originally
incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or such Engine. Upon
such replacement Part becoming subject to the Lien of this Indenture, title to
the replaced Part shall thereupon vest in the Company, free and clear of all
rights of the Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant, and such replaced Part
shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder.

(b) Pooling of Parts. Any Part removed from the
Airframe or an Engine as provided in Section 8(a) of this Article may be
subjected by the Company to a normal pooling arrangement customary in the
airline industry entered into in the ordinary course of the Company's business
with Permitted Air Carriers; provided that the Part replacing such removed Part
shall be incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or such
Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article as promptly as
practicable after the removal of such removed Part. In addition, any
replacement Part when incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe
or an Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article may be owned by a
Permitted Air Carrier subject to such a normal pooling arrangement; provided
that the Company shall, at its expense, as promptly thereafter as practicable,
either (i) cause title to such replacement Part to vest in the Company free and
clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) at which time such replacement
Part shall in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article, become a Part and
subject to the Lien of this Indenture or (ii) replace such replacement Part by
incorporating or installing in or attaching to the Airframe
<PAGE> 59
48

or such Engine a further replacement Part owned by the Company free and clear
of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), which shall, without further act, be
subject to the Lien of this Indenture and by causing title to such further
replacement Part to vest in the Loan Trustee in accordance with Section 8(a) of
this Article. Upon title to such replacement Part vesting in the Company, such
replacement Part shall become subject to Lien of this Indenture and be deemed
part of the Airframe or such Engine for all purposes to the same extent as the
Part originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or
such Engine, and title to the replaced Part shall vest in the Company, free and
clear of all rights of the Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant, and such
replaced Part shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder.

(c) Alterations, Modifications and Additions. The
Company, at its own expense, will make such alterations and modifications in
and additions to the Airframe and the Engines as may be required from time to
time to meet the standards of the Federal Aviation Administration or other
governmental authority having jurisdiction in any country in or over which the
Aircraft is flown; provided, however, that the Company may, in good faith,
contest the validity or application of any such standard in any reasonable
manner which does not materially adversely affect the Loan Trustee or the Lien
of this Indenture or involve a significant risk of the imposition of criminal
liability on the Loan Trustee or any Loan Participant. In addition, the
Company, at its own expense, may from time to time make or cause to be made
such alterations and modifications in and additions to the Airframe or any
Engine as the Company may deem desirable in the proper conduct of its business,
including, without limitation, removal of Parts; provided that no such
alteration, modification, addition or removal shall diminish the value or
utility of the Airframe or such Engine, or impair the condition or
airworthiness thereof, below the value, utility, condition and airworthiness
thereof immediately prior to such alteration, modification, addition or removal
assuming the Airframe or such Engine was then of the value and utility and in
the condition and airworthiness required to be maintained by the terms of this
Indenture, except that the value (but not the utility, condition or
airworthiness) of the Aircraft may be reduced by the value of Parts which the
Company deems obsolete or no longer suitable or appropriate for use in the
Airframe or any Engine which shall have been removed, if the aggregate original
value of all such obsolete or unsuitable Parts
<PAGE> 60
49

removed from the Aircraft and not replaced during the Term shall not exceed
$400,000. All Parts incorporated or installed in or attached or added to the
Airframe or any Engine as the result of such alteration, modification or
addition shall, without further act, be subject to the Lien of this Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Indenture Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Company may, at any time, remove any Part;
provided that (i) such Part is in addition to, and not in replacement of or
substitution for, any Part originally incorporated or installed in or attached
to the Airframe or such Engine at the time of delivery thereof hereunder or any
Part in replacement of, or substitution for, any such Part, (ii) such Part is
not required to be incorporated or installed in or attached or added to such
Airframe or Engine pursuant to Section 7 of this Article or the first sentence
of this Section 8(c) other than the proviso thereto, and (iii) such Part can be
removed from the Airframe or such Engine without diminishing or impairing the
value, utility, condition or airworthinness required to be maintained by the
terms of this Indenture which the Airframe or such Engine would have had at
such time had such removal not occurred. Upon the removal by the Company of
any Part as provided in the immediately preceding sentence or the removal of
any obsolete or unsuitable Part permitted by this Section 8(c), such Part shall
no longer be deemed part of the Airframe or the Engine from which it was
removed and shall no longer be subject to the Lien of this Indenture. Any such
Part not removed by the Company as provided in Section 8(c)(iii) of this
Article shall remain subject to the Lien of this Indenture.

Section 10. Loss, Destruction, Requisition, Etc. (a)
Event of Loss with Respect to the Airframe. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Loss with respect to the Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines installed on
the Airframe, the Company shall forthwith (and, in any event, within 15 days
after such occurrence) give the Loan Trustee written notice of such Event of
Loss, specifying the date of such occurrence, and of its election to perform
one of the following options (it being agreed that if the Company shall not
have given notice of such election within such 15 days after such occurrence,
the Company shall be deemed to have elected to perform the option set forth in
the following clause (ii)):

(i) as promptly as practicable, and in any event on or
before the Business Day next preceding the 181st
<PAGE> 61
50

day next following the date of occurrence of such Event of Loss, in
replacement for the Airframe, the Company shall convey or cause to
be conveyed to the Loan Trustee a security interest in and to a
Replacement Airframe (together with the same number of Replacement
Engines as the Engines, if any, installed on the Airframe at the
time such Event of Loss occurred), such Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines to be free and clear of all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens), to have a value and utility at least equal to,
and to be in as good operating condition as, the Airframe and
Engines, if any, so replaced (assuming such Airframe and Engines
were in the condition and repair required by the terms of this
Indenture); provided that if the Company shall have elected to
replace the Airframe and such Engines, but shall not have performed
its obligation to effect such replacement under this clause (i)
during the period of time provided herein, then the Company shall
promptly give notice to the Loan Trustee and shall pay on the
Business day next following the thirtieth day after the end of such
period to the Loan Trustee.

(ii) on or before the Loss Payment Date (as defined
below) the Company shall pay to the Loan Trustee an amount in cash
which is sufficient to redeem each Outstanding Equipment Note
pursuant to Section 6.01; provided that the Company may, to the
extent provided and in accordance with Section 3.08 hereof,
surrender, to the Loan Trustee for cancellation Equipment Notes
held by the Company and in such event the Company shall be entitled
to a credit against amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
clause (ii). As used herein, "Loss Payment Date" means the earlier
of (x) the Business Day next following the 181st day next following
the date of occurrence of the Event of Loss and (y) a Business Day
irrevocably specified by the Company at least thirty days in
advance by notice to the Loan Trustee; provided, however, the Loss
Payment Date shall be the date specified in the proviso to clause
(i) above if applicable.

Upon compliance by the Company with the requirements of this Section 10(a)(ii),
the Loan Trustee shall execute such instruments as may be reasonably requested
by the Company releasing the Airframe and Engines from the Lien of this
Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement
Assignment from the assignment and pledge thereof hereunder.
<PAGE> 62
51

At the time of or prior to any replacement of the
Airframe and such Engines pursuant to Section 10(a)(i) of this Article, if any,
the Company, at its own expense, will (A) cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture
Supplement, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto for such Replacement
Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, to be delivered to the Loan Trustee
for execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to
the Federal Aviation Act or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of
the jurisdiction other than the United States of America in which such
Replacement Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if any, are to be registered in
accordance with Section 7(a) of this Article, as the case may be, (B) cause a
financing statement or statements with respect to the Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, or other requisite documents or instruments, to be
filed in such place or places as necessary or advisable in order to perfect the
security interest therein created by or pursuant to this Indenture, or, if
necessary or advisable, pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in
which such Replacement Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if any, are to be
registered in accordance with Section 7(a) of this Article, as the case may be,
(C) furnish the Loan Trustee with a certificate of an independent aircraft
engineer or appraiser reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee certifying
that the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, have a value and
utility at least equal to, and, in the case of the Airframe, are in as good
operating condition as, the Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced, assuming
the Airframe and Engines were in the condition and repair required by the terms
hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss, (D) furnish
the Loan Trustee with (i) such evidence of compliance with the insurance
provisions of Section 11 of this Article with respect to such Replacement
Airframe and Replacement Engines as the Loan Trustee may reasonably request and
(ii) a certificate from a Responsible Officer of the Company certifying that at
the time of such replacement, there is no continuing Indenture Event of
Default, (E) furnish the Loan Trustee with an opinion of the Company's counsel
(which may be the Company's General Counsel) addressed to the Loan Trustee that
the substituted property will be subject to the Lien of the this Indenture and
the Loan Trustee should be entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 of the
United States Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, with respect to the
Replacement Airframe, provided that (x) such opinion need not be delivered to
the extent that the benefits of
<PAGE> 63
52

such Section 1110 were not, by reason of a change in law or governmental
interpretation thereof, available to the Loan Trustee with respect to the
Aircraft immediately prior to such substitution and (y) such opinion may
contain qualifications of the tenor contained in the opinion of Debevoise &
Plimpton delivered pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Participation Agreement on
the Delivery Date. In the case of each Replacement Airframe and each
Replacement Engine, if any, in which a security interest has been granted to
the Loan Trustee under this Section 10, and each Replacement Engine, if any, in
which a security interest has been granted to the Loan Trustee under this
Section 10, promptly upon the recordation of the Trust Agreement and Indenture
Supplement covering such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any,
or such Replacement Engine pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act (or pursuant to
the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which such Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, or such Replacement Engine, are registered in
accordance with Section 7(a) of this Article), the Company will cause to be
delivered to the Loan Trustee a favorable opinion of counsel to the Company as
to the due recordation of such Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement or
other requisite documents or instruments and the validity and perfection of the
security interest in the Replacement Airframe, Replacement Engines or
Replacement Engine, as the case may be, granted to the Loan Trustee under this
Indenture.

For all purposes hereof, upon grant of a security
interest therein to the Loan Trustee, each Replacement Aircraft and the
Replacement Engines, if any, shall be deemed part of the property secured
hereunder; each such Replacement Airframe shall be deemed an "Airframe" as
defined herein, and each such Replacement Engine shall be deemed an "Engine" as
defined herein. Upon full compliance with the terms of the previous paragraph,
the Loan Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Company an appropriate
instrument releasing such replaced airframe and engines (if any) installed
thereon at the time such Event of Loss occurred from the Lien of this Indenture
and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from
the assignment and pledge hereunder.

(b) Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under circumstances in
which there has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe, the
Company shall give the Loan Trustee prompt written notice thereof and shall,
<PAGE> 64
53

within 90 days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, convey or cause to
be conveyed to the Loan Trustee, as replacement for the Engine with respect to
which such Event of Loss occurred, a security interest in and to a Replacement
Engine free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and having a
value and utility at least equal to, and being in as good operating condition
as, the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, assuming such
Engine was of the value and utility and in the condition and repair required by
the terms hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss.
Prior to or at the time of any such conveyance, the Company, at its own
expense, will (i) cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement
substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto or other requisite documents or
instruments for such Replacement Engine to be delivered to the Loan Trustee for
execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the
Federal Aviation Act or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of such
jurisdiction other than the United States of America in which the Aircraft is
or is to be registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the case may be,
(ii) furnish the Loan Trustee with a certificate of an aircraft engineer or
appraiser (who may be an employee of the Company) certifying that such
Replacement Engine has a value and utility at least equal to, and is in as good
operating condition as, the Engine so replaced, assuming such Engine was in the
condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior to the
occurrence of such Event of Loss and (iii) cause a financing statement or
statements with respect to the Replacement Engine or other requisite documents
or instruments to be filed in such place or places necessary or advisable in
order to perfect the security interest in the Replacement Engine created by or
pursuant to this Indenture or, if necessary or advisable, pursuant to the
applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is or is to be
registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the case may be, and (iv)
furnish the Loan Trustee with such evidence of compliance with the insurance
provisions of Section 11 of this Article with respect to such Replacement
Engine as the Loan Trustee may reasonably request, (v) furnish the Loan Trustee
with an opinion of the Company's counsel (which may be the Company's General
Counsel) addressed to the Loan Trustee to the effect that such substituted
property will be subjected to the Lien of this Indenture. Upon full compliance
by the Company with the terms of this paragraph (b), the Loan Trustee will
transfer to the Company, without recourse or warranty
<PAGE> 65
54

(except as to the Trustee's Liens), all of Loan Trustee's right, title and
interest in and to the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss
occurred, and Loan Trustee will assign to or as directed by the Company all
claims of Loan Trustee against third Persons relating to such Engine arising
from such Event of Loss. In addition, upon such transfer the Loan Trustee
shall execute and deliver to the Company an appropriate instrument releasing
such Engine from the Lien of this Indenture and releasing the Purchase
Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment (in respect of such Engine)
from the assignment and pledge under this Indenture. For all purposes hereof,
each such Replacement Engine shall, after such conveyance, be deemed part of
the property secured hereunder and shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined
herein.

(c) Application of Payments from Governmental
Authorities for Requisition of Title or Use. Any payments (other than
insurance proceeds the application of which is provided for in Section 11 of
this Article) received at any time by the Loan Trustee or by the Company from
any governmental authority or other Person with respect to an Event of Loss
resulting from the condemnation, confiscation, theft or seizure of, or
requisition of title to or use of, the Airframe or any Engine, other than a
requisition for use by the United States government, or any other Government
not constituting an Event of Loss, will be applied as follows:

(i) if such payments are received with respect to the
Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on
the Airframe that has been or is being replaced by the Company
pursuant to Section 10(a) of this Article, such payments shall be
paid over to, or retained by, the Loan Trustee, and upon completion
of such replacement be paid over to, or retained by, the Company;

(ii) if such payments are received with respect to the
Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on
the Airframe that has not been and will not be replaced pursuant to
Section 10(a) of this Article, such payments shall, after
reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and expenses, be
applied in reduction of the Company's obligation to pay the amounts
required to be paid by the Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of
this Article, if not already paid by the Company, or, if already
paid by the Company, shall be applied to reimburse the Company for
its payment of such amounts, and the balance, if any, of such
payments remaining
<PAGE> 66
55

thereafter shall be paid over to, and retained by, the Company; and

(iii) if such payments are received with respect to an
Engine under circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b) of this
Article, so much of such payments remaining after reimbursement of
the Loan Trustee for costs and expenses shall be paid over to, or
retained by, the Company; provided that the Company shall have
fully performed the terms of Section 10(b) of this Article with
respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

(d) Requisition for Use by the Government of the
Airframe and the Engines Installed Thereon. In the event of the requisition
for use by the United States government, or any other Government or government
(including for this purpose any agency or instrumentality thereof), not
constituting an Event of Loss, including, without limitation, pursuant to the
Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program referred to in Section 7(b)(iv) of this Article
of the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on the Airframe, the
Company shall promptly notify the Loan Trustee of such requisition and, except
as otherwise provided in this Indenture, such requisition shall not constitute
an Event of Loss and all of the Company's obligations under this Indenture with
respect to the Aircraft shall continue to the same extent as if such
requisition had not occurred unless or until such requisition shall constitute
an Event of Loss. All payments received by the Loan Trustee or the Company
from the Government or government for the use of the Airframe and Engines or
engines prior to the occurrence of an Event of Loss shall be paid over to, or
retained by, the Company.

(e) Requisition for Use by the Government of an Engine.
In the event of the requisition for use by any Government (including for this
purpose any agency or instrumentality thereof) of any Engine (but not the
Airframe), the Company will replace such Engine hereunder by complying with the
terms of Section 10(b) of this Article to the same extent as if an Event of
Loss had occurred with respect to such Engine, and any payments received by the
Loan Trustee or the Company from such Government with respect to such
requisition shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Company.

(f) Application of Payments During Existence of
Indenture Event of Default. Any amount referred to in clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) of Section 10(c), Section 10(d) or
<PAGE> 67
56

Section 10(e) of this Article which is payable to the Company shall not be paid
to the Company, or if it has been previously paid directly to the Company,
shall not be retained by the Company, if at the time of such payment an
Indenture Event of Default, or any Payment or Bankruptcy Default, shall have
occurred and be continuing, but shall be paid to and held by the Loan Trustee
as security for the obligations of the Company under this Indenture, and at
such time as there shall not be continuing any such Indenture Event of Default
or Indenture Default, such amount shall be paid to the Company, provided that,
if any such amount has been so held by the Loan Trustee as security for more
than 180 days after an Indenture Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy
Default shall have occurred and during which period (x) the Loan Trustee shall
not have been limited by operation of law or otherwise from exercising remedies
hereunder and (y) the Loan Trustee shall not have commenced to exercise any
remedy available to it under this Indenture, then such amount shall be paid to
the Company.

Section 11. Insurance. (a) Public Liability and
Property Damage Insurance. Subject to the rights of the Company to establish
and maintain self-insurance with respect to public liability and property
damage liability insurance for aircraft and engines (including the Aircraft and
Engines) in the manner and to the extent specified in the next sentence, the
Company will carry, or cause to be carried, at no expense to the Loan Trustee,
the Pass Through Trustee or any Loan Participant public liability (including,
without limitation, contractual liability and passenger legal liability) and
property damage liability insurance (exclusive of manufacturer's product
liability insurance) with respect to the Aircraft (i) in amounts which are not
less than the public liability and property damage insurance applicable to
similar aircraft and engines which comprise the Company's fleet on which the
Company carries insurance, provided that such liability insurance shall not be
less than the amount certified to the Original Loan Participants on the
Delivery Date, (ii) of the type usually carried by corporations engaged in the
same or similar business, similarly situated with the Company, and owning or
operating similar aircraft and engines and covering risks of the kind
customarily insured against by the Company, and (iii) which is maintained in
effect with insurers of recognized responsibility. The Company may
self-insure, by way of deductible or premium adjustment provisions in insurance
policies, the risks
<PAGE> 68
57

required to be insured against pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in no
case shall the self-insurance (including the self- insurance permitted by
Section 11(b) of this Article) with respect to all of the aircraft and engines
in the Company's fleet (including, without limitation, the Aircraft) exceed for
any 12-month policy year the lesser of (x) 50% of the largest replacement value
of any single aircraft in the Company's fleet or (y) 1-1/2% of the average
aggregate insurable value (for the preceding year) of all aircraft (including,
without limitation, the Aircraft) on which the Company carries insurance;
provided that, in the event that there shall have occurred a material adverse
change in the financial condition of the Company from such condition as is
reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company at December
3l, 1982, then, upon not less than 30 days' written notice from the Loan
Trustee to the Company, the Company will, until the Company's financial
condition is on an overall basis equivalent to its financial condition at
December 3l, 1982, reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder to such
reasonable amount as the Loan Trustee may require; provided further that a
deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce handling that, in the case of the
Aircraft, is not in excess of the amount customarily allowed as a deductible in
the industry, shall be permitted in addition to the above-mentioned
self-insurance. Any policies of insurance carried in accordance with this
Section 11(a) and any policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any
of such policies (A) shall name the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee
as additional insureds as their respective Interests may appear, (B) shall
provide that in respect of the respective Interests of the Loan Trustee and of
the Pass Through Trustee in such policies the insurance shall not be
invalidated by any action or inaction of the Company and shall insure the Loan
Trustee's and the Pass Through Trustee's Interests as they appear, regardless
of any breach or violation of any warranty, declaration or condition contained
in such policies by the Company, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is
cancelled for any reason whatever, or any substantial change is made in the
coverage which affects the coverage certified hereunder to the Loan Trustee or
the Pass Through Trustee, or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for
nonpayment of premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be
effective as to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee for 30 days (seven
days, or such other period as is customarily obtainable in the industry, in the
case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt by the Loan
Trustee or by the Pass Through Trustee, respectively, of written notice
<PAGE> 69
58

from such insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse, (D) shall provide
that neither the Loan Trustee nor the Pass Through Trustee shall have any
obligation or liability for premiums, commissions, assessments or calls in
connection with such insurance, (E) shall provide that the insurers shall waive
(i) any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by
attachment or otherwise, which they may have against the Loan Trustee or the
Pass Through Trustee and (ii) any rights of subrogation against the Loan
Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee to the extent that the Company has waived
its rights by its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to this
Indenture or the Participation Agreement and that the exercise by such insurers
of rights of subrogation derived from rights retained by the Company will not
delay payment of any claims that would otherwise be payable but for the
exercise of such rights of subrogation, (F) shall be primary without right of
contribution from any other insurance which may be carried by the Loan Trustee
or the Pass Through Trustee with respect to its Interest as such in the
Aircraft and (G) shall expressly provide that all of the provisions thereof,
except the limits of liability, shall operate in the same manner as if there
were a separate policy covering each insured. "Interests" as used in this
Section 11(a) and Section 11(b) of this Article with respect to any Person
means the interests of such Person in its individual capacity, as the Loan
Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, in the transactions
contemplated by this Indenture and the Participation Agreement. The Company
shall arrange for appropriate certification that the requirements of this
Section 11(a) have been met to be made to the Loan Trustee (and the Loan
Trustee may furnish such certificates to the Loan Participants) as soon as
practicable by each insurer or its authorized representative with respect
thereto, provided that all information contained therein shall be held
confidential by the Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant and shall not be
furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other than their bank examiners,
auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom any
Loan Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations relating to the
possible transfer and sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes, if such
Person shall have entered into an agreement similar to that contained in this
Section 11(a) whereby such Person agrees to hold such information confidential,
and except as may be required by an order of any court or administrative agency
or by any statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. In
the case of a lease or contract with any
<PAGE> 70
59

Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, or in the case of any
requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine by any Government, a valid
agreement to indemnify the Company against any of the risks which the Company
is required hereunder to insure against by such Government shall be considered
adequate insurance to the extent of the risks and in the amounts that are the
subject of any such agreement to indemnify.

(b) Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Aircraft.
Subject to the rights of the Company to establish and maintain self-insurance
with respect to loss or damage to aircraft (including the Aircraft) in the
manner and to the extent specified in the next sentence, the Company shall
maintain, or cause to be maintained, in effect with insurers of recognized
responsibility, at no expense to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee,
all-risk aircraft hull insurance covering the Aircraft and all-risk coverage
with respect to any Engines or Parts while removed from the Aircraft
(including, without limitation, war risk, political risk and allied perils
insurance if and to the extent the same is maintained by the Company or any
Permitted Air Carrier leasing the same with respect to other aircraft owned or
operated by the Company or such Permitted Air Carrier, as the case may be, on
the same routes) which is of the type and in substantially the amount usually
carried by corporations engaged in the same or similar business and similarly
situated with the Company; provided that (i) such insurance (including the
permitted self- insurance) shall at all times while the Aircraft is subject to
the Lien of this Indenture be for an amount not less than, at the date of the
determination thereof, an amount equal to the Outstanding principal amount of
the Equipment Notes plus six months interest thereon and (ii) such insurance
need not cover an Engine while attached to an airframe not owned, leased or
operated by the Company. The Company may self-insure, by way of deductible or
premium adjustment provisions in insurance policies, the risks required to be
insured against pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in no case shall the
self-insurance (including the self- insurance permitted by Section 11(a) of
this Article) with respect to all of the aircraft and engines in the Company's
fleet (including, without limitation, the Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month
policy year the lesser of (i) 50% of the largest replacement value of any
single aircraft in the Company's fleet or (ii) l-l/2% of the average aggregate
insurable value (for the preceding year) of all aircraft (including, without
limitation, the Aircraft) on which the Company carries
<PAGE> 71
60

insurance; provided that, in the event that there shall have occurred a
material adverse change in the financial condition of the Company from such
condition as is reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company at December 31, 1982, then, upon not less than 30 days' written notice
from the Loan Trustee to the Company, the Company will, until the Company's
financial condition is on an overall basis equivalent to its financial
condition at December 3l, 1982, reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder
to such reasonable amount as the Loan Trustee may require; provided, further,
that a deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce handling that, in the case
of the Aircraft, is not in excess of the amount customarily allowed as a
deductible in the industry, shall be permitted in addition to the
above-mentioned self-insurance. Any policies carried in accordance with this
Section 11(b) and any policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any
such policies (A) shall provide that any loss in excess of $10,000,000, up to
the amount of the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus
accrued interest thereon, for any loss or damage to the Aircraft (or Engines)
shall be paid to the Loan Trustee as long as this Indenture shall not have been
discharged pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof, and that all other
amounts shall be payable to the Company unless the insurer shall have received
notice that an Indenture Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default
exists, in which case all insurance proceeds up to amount equal to the
Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest
thereon payable by the Company shall be payable to the Loan Trustee, (B) shall
provide that in respect of the respective interests of the Loan Trustee and the
Pass Through Trustee in such policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by
any action or inaction of the Company and shall insure the Loan Trustee's and
the Pass Through Trustee's Interests, as they appear, regardless of any breach
or violation of any warranty, declaration or condition contained in such
policies by the Company, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is cancelled
for any reason whatever, or any material change is made in the policy which
affects the coverage certified hereunder to the Loan Trustee or the Pass
Through Trustee, or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of
premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be effective as to the
Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee for 30 days (seven days, or such other
period as may from time to time be customarily obtainable in the industry, in
the case of any war risk, political risk and allied perils coverage)
<PAGE> 72
61

after receipt by the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, respectively, of
written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse, (D)
shall provide that neither the Loan Trustee nor the Pass Through Trustee shall
have any obligation or liability for premiums, commissions, assessments or
calls in connection with such insurance, (E) shall provide that the insurers
shall waive any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction, whether
by attachment or otherwise, which they may have against the Loan Trustee or the
Pass Through Trustee and shall be primary without right of contribution from
any other insurance which may be carried by the Loan Trustee or the Pass
Through Trustee with respect to its interests as such in the Aircraft and (F)
shall provide that the insurers shall waive any rights of subrogation against
the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee to the extent that the Company
has waived its rights by its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to
this Indenture or the Participation Agreement; provided, that the exercise by
insurers of rights of subrogation derived from rights retained by the Company
shall not, in any way, delay payment of a claim that would otherwise be paid by
such insurers but for the existence of rights of subrogation derived from
rights retained by the Company. The Company shall arrange for appropriate
certification that the requirements of this Section 11(b) have been met to be
made promptly to the Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee may furnish such
certification to the Loan Participants) by each insurer or its authorized
representative with respect thereto, provided that all information contained
therein shall be held confidential by the Loan Trustee and each Loan
participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other
than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and
any Person with whom any Loan Participant is in good faith conducting
negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale of such Loan
Participant's Equipment Notes if such Person shall have entered into an
agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(b) whereby such Person
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be required by
an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule,
regulation or order of any governmental authority. In the case of a lease or
contract with any Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, or in
the case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine by any
Government, a valid agreement to indemnify the Company against any of the risks
which the Company is required hereunder to insure against by such Government in
any amount up to, at the date of determination
<PAGE> 73
62

thereof, an amout equal to the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment
Notes plus six months interest thereon from time to time shall be considered
adequate insurance to the extent of the risks and in the amounts that are the
subject of any such agreement to indemnify.

(c) Application of Insurance Payments. Between the Loan
Trustee and the Company it is as agreed that all insurance payments received
under policies required to be maintained by the Company hereunder, exclusive of
any payments received in excess of the Outstanding principal amount of the
Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon for the Aircraft from such
policies, as the result of the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to
the Airframe or an Engine will be applied as follows:

(x) if such payments are received with respect to the
Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines installed on
the Airframe that has been or is being replaced by the Company as
contemplated by Section 10(a) of this Article, such payments shall
be paid over to, or retained by, the Loan Trustee, and upon
completion of such replacement be paid over to, or retained by, the
Company;

(y) if such payments are received with respect to the
Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines installed
thereon that has not been and will not be replaced as contemplated
by Section 10(a) of this Article, so much of such payments
remaining after reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and
expenses as shall not exceed the Outstanding principal amount of
the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon required to be
paid by the Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this article shall
be applied in reduction of the Company's obligation to pay such
amount, if not already paid by the Company, or, if already paid by
the Company, shall be applied to reimburse the Company for its
payment of such amount, and the balance, if any, of such payment
remaining thereafter will be paid over to, or retained by, the
Company; and

(z) if such payments are received with respect to an
Engine under the circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b) of
this Article, so much of such payments remaining after
reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and expenses shall be
paid over to, or retained
<PAGE> 74
63

by, the Company; provided that the Company shall have fully
performed the terms of Section 10(b) of this Article with respect
to the Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the insurance
payment of any property damage loss received under policies maintained by the
Company in excess of the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes
plus accrued interest thereon for the Aircraft shall be paid to the Company.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the insurance
payments of any property damage loss received under policies required to be
maintained hereunder not constituting an Event of Loss with respect to the
Airframe or an Engine will be applied in payment (or to reimburse the Company)
for repairs or for replacement property in accordance with the terms of
Sections 7 and 8 of this Article, and any balance remaining after compliance
with such Sections with respect to such loss shall be paid to the Company. Any
amount referred to in the preceding sentence or in clause (x), (y) or (z) of
the second preceding paragraph which is payable to the Company shall not be
paid to the Company or, if it has been previously paid directly to the Company,
shall not be retained by the Company, if at the time of such payment an
Indenture Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, but shall be paid to and held by the Loan Trustee, as
security for the obligations of the Company under this Indenture, and at such
time as there shall not be continuing any such Indenture Event of Default or
Payment or Bankruptcy Default, such amount shall be paid to the Company,
provided that if any such amount has been so held by the Loan Trustee as
security for more than 90 days after such event or Indenture Event of Default
shall have occurred and during which period the Loan Trustee shall not have
exercised any remedy available to it under Section 8 hereof, then such amount
shall be paid to the Company, unless the Loan Trustee shall have been
prohibited by operation of law or otherwise from exercising such remedies.

(d) Reports, Etc. Annually upon renewal of the
Company's insurance coverage, the Company will furnish to the Loan Trustee (and
the Loan Trustee may furnish such reports to the Loan Participants) a report
signed by a firm of independent aircraft insurance brokers appointed by the
Company, stating the opinion of such firm that the insurance
<PAGE> 75
64

then carried and maintained on the Aircraft complies with the terms hereof;
provided that all information contained in such report shall be held
confidential by the Loan Trustee and each Loan Participant and shall not be
furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other than their accountants, agents
and legal counsel and any Person with whom such Loan Participant is in good
faith conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale of
such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes if such Person shall have entered into
an agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(d) whereby such
Person agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be
required by an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute,
rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. The Company will cause
such firm to advise the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee in writing
promptly of any default in the payment of any premium and of any other act or
omission on the part of the Company of which such firm has knowledge and which
might invalidate or render unenforceable, in whole or in part, any insurance on
the Aircraft. The Company will also cause such firm to advise the Loan Trustee
and the Pass Through Trustee in writing as promptly as practicable after such
firm acquires knowledge that an interruption or reduction of any insurance
carried and maintained on the Aircraft pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 11 will occur.

(e) Insurance for Own Account. Nothing in this Section
11 shall limit or prohibit the Loan Trustee or the Company from obtaining
insurance for its own account with respect to the Airframe or any Engine and
any proceeds payable thereunder shall be payable as provided in the insurance
policy relating thereto, provided that no such insurance may be obtained which
would limit or otherwise adversely affect the coverage or amounts payable under
insurance required to be maintained pursuant to this Section 11, it being
understood that all salvage rights to the Airframe or such Engine shall remain
with the Company's insurers at all times, and provided further, that the Loan
Trustee may obtain hull insurance on the Aircraft only to the extent the
procurement of such insurance does not have an adverse effect on the Company's
ability or cost to obtain such insurance.

Section 12. Inspection. At all reasonable times so long
as any Equipment Notes are outstanding, but upon at least 10 days' prior
written notice to the Company, the Loan Trustee or its authorized
representatives may at their own
<PAGE> 76
65

expense and risk (including, without limitation, any risk of personal injury or
death) conduct a visual walk-around inspection of the Aircraft and any Engine
and may inspect the books and records of the Company relating thereto; provided
that (a) such representative shall be fully insured to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Company at no cost to the Company with respect to any risks
incurred in connection with any such inspection, (b) any such inspection shall
be subject to the safety, security and workplace rules applicable at the
location where such inspection is conducted and any applicable governmental
rules or regulations and (c) in the case of an inspection during a maintenance
visit, such inspection shall not in any respect interfere with the normal
conduct of such maintenance visit or extend the time required for such
maintenance visit. All information obtained in connection with any such
inspection shall be held confidential by the Loan Trustee and each Loan
Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other
than their accountants, agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom any
such Loan Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations relating to the
possible transfer and sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes or
interest in the Aircraft if such Person shall have entered into an agreement
similar to that contained in this Section 12 whereby such Person agrees to hold
such information confidential, and except as may be required by an order of any
court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or order of
any governmental authority. So long as any Equipment Notes remain Outstanding,
upon Loan Trustee's request, the Company will notify the Loan Trustee of the
next scheduled "heavy maintenance" check or "C" check to be conducted by the
Company in respect of the Aircraft; provided that the Company shall have the
right in its sole discretion to reschedule, or change the location of, any
maintenance visit of which it shall have notified the Loan Trustee pursuant to
this sentence, the Company hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts to notify
the Loan Trustee of any such rescheduling or change. The Loan Trustee shall
not have any duty to make such inspection and shall not incur any liability or
obligation by reason of not making any such inspection. No inspection pursuant
to this Section 12 shall interfere with the use, operation or maintenance of
the Aircraft or the normal conduct of the Company's business, and the Company
shall not be required to undertake or incur any additional liabilities in
connection therewith.

Section 17. Further Assurances; Financial Information.
Forthwith upon the execution and delivery of
<PAGE> 77
66

each Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement, the Company will cause such
Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement to be duly filed and recorded in
accordance with the Federal Aviation Act. In addition, the Company and the
Loan Trustee will promptly and duly execute and deliver to the other party
hereto such further documents and assurances and take such further action as
such other party may from time to time reasonably request in order to
effectively carry out the intent and purpose of this Indenture, including,
without limitation, if requested by the Loan Trustee, the execution and
delivery of supplements or amendments hereto, in recordable form, subjecting to
this Indenture any Replacement Airframe or Replacement Engine and the recording
or filing of counterparts hereof or thereof, in accordance with the laws of
such jurisdictions as the Loan Trustee may from time to time deem advisable;
provided that this sentence is not intended to impose upon the Company any
additional liabilities not otherwise contemplated by this Indenture. The
Company also agrees to furnish the Loan Trustee (i) within 60 days after the
end of each of the first three quarterly periods in each fiscal year of the
Company, either (a) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries prepared by it as of the close of such period,
together with the related consolidated statements of income for such period,
certified by a Responsible Officer as presenting fairly, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, the information contained therein or
(b) a report of the Company on Form 10-Q in respect of such period filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, provided such report contains the
financial statements specified in clause (i)(a), (ii) within 120 days after the
close of each fiscal year of the Company, either (a) a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the close of such
fiscal year, together with the related consolidated statements of income for
such fiscal year, as certified by independent public accountants, or (b) a
report of the Company on Form 10-K in respect of such year filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, provided such report contains the financial
statements specified in (ii)(a), and (iii) within 120 days after the close of
each fiscal year of the Company, a certificate of the Company, signed by a
Responsible Officer to the effect that the signer has reviewed the relevant
terms of this Indenture and has made, or caused to be made under his
supervision, a review of the transactions and condition of the Company during
the accounting period covered by the financial statements referred to in clause
(ii) above, and
<PAGE> 78
67

that such review has not disclosed the existence during such accounting period,
nor does the signer have knowledge of the existence as at the date of such
certificate, of any condition or event which constitutes an Indenture Event of
Default or which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute an
Indenture Event of Default, or, if any such condition or event existed or
exists, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof and what action
the Company has taken or is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

Section 24. Maintenance of Certain Engines.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an aircraft engine
which is not an Engine, but which is installed on the Airframe, shall be
maintained in accordance with Section 7(a) of this Article.

Section 27. Company's Performance and Rights. Any
obligation imposed on the Company pursuant to Sections 7, 8, 11, 12 and 24 of
this Article shall require only that the Company perform or cause to be
performed such obligation, even if stated herein as a direct obligation, and
the performance of any such obligation by any permitted assignee, lessee or
transferee under an assignment, lease or transfer agreement then in effect
shall constitute performance by the Company and to the extent of such
performance, discharge such obligation by the Company. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, any right granted to the Company in this Indenture
shall grant the Company the right to exercise such right or permit such right
to be exercised by any such assignee, lessee or transferee; provided that no
such assignee, lessee or transferee shall be permitted to exercise the self-
insurance rights of the Company set forth in Section 11 of this Article. The
inclusion of specific references to obligations or rights of any such assignee,
lessee or transferee in certain provisions of this Indenture shall not in any
way prevent or diminish the application of the provisions of the two sentences
immediately preceding with respect to obligations or rights in respect of which
specific reference to any such assignee, lessee or transferee has not been made
in this Indenture.

Section 28. Statement of Intention. The Loan Trustee,
the Company and the Owner Trustee acknowledge that the intent of the provisions
contained in this Article 15 is, following the termination of the Lease
pursuant to Section 9(e), 9(f) or 20(b) thereof, to provide for the Loan
Trustee to have rights similar to those enjoyed by the Owner
<PAGE> 79
68

Trustee under the Lease and for the Company to have rights similar to those
enjoyed by it under the Lease. The Loan Trustee and the Company hereby agree
that this Article 15 shall be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent
with the intent expressed in this Section 28.

Section 29. Amendment of Exhibit to the Indenture. Each
Equipment Note issued after the Relevant Date shall be issued in substantially
the form set forth in Exhibit A to this Indenture as originally executed,
provided that the following legend shall be affixed to each such Equipment
Note:

"Pursuant to Section 7.03 of the Trust Indenture and
Security Agreement, American Airlines, Inc. has assumed all of the obligations
of the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture and Security Agreement and this
Equipment Note except such obligations as could necessarily be performed
exclusively by an entity acting in the capacity of the Owner Trustee."

In lieu of issuing Equipment Notes with a legend as described in the
immediately preceding sentence, at the option of the Loan Trustee or if
requested by the Company, any Equipment Note issued after the Relevant Date
shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit D-1 to this Indenture.

Section 30. General. Effective as of the Relevant Date
the Company assumes on a full recourse basis all of the duties and obligations
of the Owner Trustee under this Indenture and the Equipment Notes and shall be
entitled to all the rights and benefits of the Owner Trustee hereunder and
thereunder, in each case to the extent provided for in this Indenture, and the
Owner Trustee is, effective upon the Relevant Date, released from all duties,
obligations and rights under this Indenture and the Equipment Notes (other than
any obligations or liabilities of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity
incurred on or prior to the Relevant Date or arising out of or based upon
events occurring on or prior to the Relevant Date, which obligations and
liabilities shall remain the responsibility of the Owner Trustee).

The Company confirms and ratifies the security interest
which the Owner Trustee granted to the Loan Trustee pursuant to the Granting
Clause of this Indenture in all of the Owner Trustee's right, title and
interest in the
<PAGE> 80
69

Aircraft and its interest in the Purchase Agreement (to the extent assigned to
the Owner Trustee pursuant to the Purchase Agreement Assignment) and the
Company explicitly agrees that the Company is acquiring the Aircraft subject to
such security interest, which shall remain in full force and effect until this
Indenture is discharged in accordance with the terms hereof, and the Loan
Trustee acknowledges that the Lease and the obligations of the Company
hereunder as Company have been terminated, except as specifically provided for
therein, and each of the Company and the Loan Trustee hereby agree that the
Granting Clause hereof shall, subject always to the provisions of Section 28 of
Article 15 hereof, be deemed to have been modified mutatis mutandis.

-----------------------------------------

All provisions of the Indenture not specifically amended
by operation of this Exhibit D shall remain in full force and effect.

Participation Agreement and such failure shall continue unremedied for a
period of 30 days after written notice thereof has been given by the Loan
Trustee; provided that, if such failure is capable of being remedied, so
long as the Company is diligently proceeding to remedy such failure, no such
failure shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder for a period of up to
365 days; or

(e) any material representation or warranty made by the Company in
the Participation Agreement or in the Purchase Agreement (to the extent
applicable to the Aircraft) or in any document or certificate furnished by
the Company in connection herewith or therewith or pursuant hereto or

time made and such incorrectness shall continue to be material and shall
continue unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof has
been given by the Loan Trustee; or

(f) the Company shall consent to the appointment of a receiver,
trustee or liquidator of itself or of a substantial part of its property or
the Company shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally
as they come due, or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of
creditors; or

unterminated for a period of 90 days;

provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Indenture, any failure of the Company to perform or observe any covenant,
condition, or agreement herein shall not constitute an Indenture Event of
Default if such failure is caused solely by reason of an event referred to in
the definition of "Event of Loss", so long as the Company is continuing to
comply with the applicable terms of Section 10 of Article 15 hereof.

Section 8.02. Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment. If an
Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Loan Trustee, by

<PAGE> 32
21

of all the Equipment Notes to be due and payable. Upon such declaration, the
principal of all Equipment Notes, together with accrued interest thereon from
the date in respect of which interest was last paid hereunder to the date
payment of such principal has been made or duly provided for shall be due and
payable immediately. At any time after such declaration and prior to the sale
or disposition of the Indenture Estate, the Loan Participants in a majority in
aggregate principal amount of all of the Outstanding Equipment Notes, by notice
to the Loan Trustee and the Company, may rescind such a declaration and thereby
annul its consequences if (i) an amount sufficient to pay all principal of,
premium, if any, and interest thereon, at the rate prescribed therefor in such
Equipment Note and interest due or past due, if any, in respect of the
Outstanding Equipment Notes plus all other amounts payable to the Loan
Participants, other than by reason of such acceleration, and all sums due and
payable to the Loan Trustee has been deposited with the Loan Trustee, (ii) the
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (iii) all
existing Indenture Defaults and Indenture Events of Default under this
Indenture have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal of, premium,
if any, or interest on the Equipment Notes that has become due solely because
of such acceleration.

Section 8.03. Other Remedies Available to Loan Trustee. (a) After
an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and so long as the same shall
be continuing, then and in every such case the Loan Trustee, as trustee of an
express trust and as holder of a security interest in the Aircraft or Engines
or otherwise, may, at its option, declare this Indenture to be in default by a
written notice to the Company; and at any time thereafter, so long as the
Company shall not have remedied all outstanding Events of Default, the Loan
Trustee may do one or more of the following with respect to all or any part of
any Airframe or any Engines as the Loan Trustee in its sole discretion shall
elect, to the extent permitted by, and subject to compliance with any mandatory
requirements of, applicable law then in effect; provided, however, that, during
any period when the Aircraft is subject to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program
in accordance with the provisions of Section 7(b) of Article 15 hereof and in
the possession of the United States government or an instrumentality or agency
thereof, and to the extent that any applicable law or contractual provision
covering the Aircraft so requires, the Loan Trustee shall not, on account
<PAGE> 33
22

of any Indenture Event of Default, be entitled to do any of the following in
such manner as to limit the Company's control (or any lessee's control under
any lease permitted by the terms of Section 7(b) of Article 15 hereof) of any
Airframe or any Engines, unless at least 60 days' (or such lesser period as may
then be applicable under the Military Airlift Command Program of the United
States Government) prior written notice of default under this Indenture with
respect to the Company's obligations hereunder shall have been given by the
Loan Trustee by registered or certified mail to the Company (and, if
applicable, any such lessee) with a copy addressed to the Contracting Office
Representative for the Military Airlift Command of the United States Air Force
under any contract with the Company (or any such lessee) relating to the
Aircraft:

(i) cause the Company, upon the written demand of the Loan Trustee
and at the Company's expense, to return promptly, and the Company shall
return promptly, all or such part of any Airframe or any Engine as the Loan
Trustee may so demand to the Loan Trustee or its order or the Loan Trustee,
at its option, may enter upon the premises where all or any part of such
Airframe or any Engine are located and take immediate possession of and
remove the same (together with any engine which is not an Engine but which
is installed on the Airframe, subject to all of the rights of the owner,
lessor, lienor or secured party of such engine; provided that the Airframe
with an engine (which is not an Engine) installed thereon may be flown or
returned only to a location within the continental United States, and such
engine shall be held for the account of any such owner, lessor, lienor or
secured party or, if owned by the Company, may, at the option of the Loan
Trustee, be exchanged with the Company for an Engine) all without liability
accruing to the Loan Trustee for or by reason of such entry or taking of
possession or removal, whether for the restoration of damage to property
caused by such taking or otherwise; or

(ii) sell all or any part of any Airframe and any Engine at public or
private sale, whether or not the Loan Trustee shall at the time have
possession thereof, as the Loan Trustee may determine, or otherwise dispose
of, hold, use, operate, lease to others or keep idle all or any part of such
Airframe or such Engine as the Loan Trustee, in its sole discretion, may
determine, all free
<PAGE> 34
23

and clear of any rights of the Company and without any duty to account to
the Company with respect to such action or inaction or for any proceeds with
respect thereto.

(b) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and Section 8.03(h), if an Indenture
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Loan Trustee may, if at
the time such action may be lawful and always subject to compliance with any
mandatory legal requirements, either with or without taking possession, and
either before or after taking possession, and without instituting any legal
proceedings whatsoever, and having first given notice of such sale by
registered mail to the Company once at least thirty days prior to the date of
such sale, and any other notice which may be required by law, sell and dispose
of the Indenture Estate, or any part thereof, or interest therein, at public
auction to the highest bidder, in one lot as an entirety or in separate lots,
and either for cash or on credit and on such terms as the Loan Trustee may
determine, and at any place (whether or not it be the location of the Indenture
Estate or any part thereof) and time designated in the notice above referred
to; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, the Loan Trustee shall not sell any of the Indenture Estate unless a
declaration of acceleration has been made pursuant to Section 8.02. Any such
sale or sales may be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time
and place appointed for such sale or sales, or for any such adjourned sale or
sales, without further notice, and the Loan Trustee and any Loan Participant
may bid and become the purchaser at any such sale. The Loan Trustee may
exercise such right without possession or production of the Equipment Notes or
proof of ownership thereof, and as representative of the Loan Participants may
exercise such right without notice to the Loan Participants or including the
Loan Participants as parties to any suit or proceeding relating to foreclosure
of any property in the Indenture Estate. The Company hereby irrevocably
constitutes the Loan Trustee the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the
Company (in the name of the Company or otherwise) for the purpose of
effectuating any sale, assignment, transfer or delivery for enforcement of the
Lien created under this Indenture, whether pursuant to foreclosure or power of
sale or otherwise, to execute and deliver all such bills of sale, assignments
and other instruments as the Loan Trustee may consider necessary or
appropriate, with full power of substitution, the Company hereby ratifying and
confirming all that such attorney or any substitute shall lawfully do by virtue
hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested
<PAGE> 35
24

by the Loan Trustee or any purchaser, the Company shall ratify and confirm any
such sale, assignment, transfer or delivery, by executing and delivering to the
Loan Trustee or such purchaser all bills of sale, assignments, releases and
other proper instruments to effect such ratification and confirmation as may be
designated in any such request.

(c) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), if an Indenture Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall, at the request of
the Loan Trustee, promptly execute and deliver to the Loan Trustee such
instruments of title or other documents as the Loan Trustee may deem necessary
or advisable to enable the Loan Trustee or an agent or representative
designated by the Loan Trustee, at such time or times and place or places as
the Loan Trustee may specify, to obtain possession of all or any part of the
Indenture Estate. If the Company shall for any reason fail to execute and
deliver such instruments and documents after such request by the Loan Trustee,
the Loan Trustee shall be entitled, in a proceeding to which the Company will
be a necessary party, to a judgment for specific performance of the covenants
contained in the foregoing sentence, conferring upon the Loan Trustee the right
to immediate possession and requiring the Company to execute and deliver such
instruments and documents to the Loan Trustee. The Loan Trustee shall also be
entitled to pursue all or any part of the Indenture Estate wherever it may be
found and may enter any of the premises of the Company or any other Person
wherever the Indenture Estate may be or is supposed to be and search for the
Indenture Estate and take possession of any item of the Indenture Estate
pursuant to this Section 8.03(c). The Loan Trustee may, from time to time, at
the expense of the Indenture Estate, make all such expenditures for
maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and
improvements to and of the Indenture Estate, as it may deem proper. In each
such case, the Loan Trustee shall have the right to use, operate, store, lease,
control or manage the Indenture Estate, and to exercise all rights and powers
of the Company relating to the Indenture Estate as the Loan Trustee shall deem
appropriate, including the right to enter into any and all such agreements with
respect to the use, operation, storage, leasing, control or management of the
Indenture Estate or any part thereof; and the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to
collect and receive directly all tolls, rents, issues, profits, products,
revenues and other income of the Indenture Estate and every part thereof,
without prejudice, however, to the right of the Loan Trustee under any
provision of this Indenture to collect and receive all
<PAGE> 36
25

cash held by, or required to be deposited with, the Loan Trustee hereunder. In
accordance with the terms of this Section 8.03(c), such tolls, rents, issues,
profits, products, revenues and other income shall be applied to pay the
expenses of using, operating, storing, leasing, controlling or managing the
Indenture Estate, and of all maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements,
alterations, additions and improvements, and to make all payments which the
Loan Trustee may be required or may elect to make, if any, for taxes,
assessments, insurance or other proper charges upon the Indenture Estate or any
part thereof (including the employment of engineers and accountants to examine,
inspect and make reports upon the properties and books and records of the
Company in accordance with this Section 8.03(c)), and all other payments which
the Loan Trustee may be required or authorized to make under any provision of
this Indenture, including this Section 8.03(c), as well as just and reasonable
compensation for the services of the Loan Trustee, and of all Persons properly
engaged and employed by the Loan Trustee.

If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Loan
Trustee shall have obtained possession of or title to the Aircraft, the Loan
Trustee shall not be obligated to use or operate the Aircraft or cause the
Aircraft to be used or operated directly or indirectly by itself or through
agents or other representatives or to lease, license or otherwise permit or
provide for the use or operation of the Aircraft by any other Person unless (i)
the Loan Trustee shall have been able to obtain insurance in kinds, at rates
and in amounts satisfactory to it in its discretion to protect the Indenture
Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and individually, against any and all
liability for loss or damage to the Aircraft and for public liability and
property damage resulting from use or operation of the Aircraft and (ii) funds
are available in the Indenture Estate to pay for all such insurance or, in lieu
of such insurance, the Loan Trustee is furnished with indemnification from the
holders of the Equipment Notes or any other Person upon terms and in amounts
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee in its discretion to protect the Indenture
Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and individually, against any and all
such liabilities.

(d) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), the Loan Trustee may
proceed to protect and enforce this Indenture and the Equipment Notes by suit
or suits or proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy, and whether
<PAGE> 37
26

for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or
in execution or aid of any power herein granted; or for foreclosure hereunder,
or for the appointment of a receiver or receivers for the Indenture Estate or
any part thereof, or for the recovery of judgment for the indebtedness secured
by the Lien created under this Indenture or for the enforcement of any other
proper, legal or equitable remedy available under applicable law.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture to the contrary,
including, without limitation, Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(c) and 8.03(d), so long
as no Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Loan Trustee shall not take any action contrary to, or disturb, the Company's
rights to possession and use of, and quiet enjoyment of, the Aircraft.

(f) Each and every right, power and remedy herein given to the Loan
Trustee specifically or otherwise in this Indenture shall be cumulative and
shall be in addition to every other right, power and remedy herein specifically
given or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute, and each
and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein given or
otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time and as often in such
order as may be deemed expedient by the Loan Trustee, and the exercise or the
beginning of the exercise of any power or remedy shall not be construed to be a
waiver of the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other right,
power or remedy. No delay or omission by the Loan Trustee in the exercise of
any right, remedy or power or in pursuing any remedy shall impair any such
right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default on the
part of the Company or to be an acquiescence therein.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any payment of
principal of any Equipment Note shall not be made when and as the same shall
become due and payable, or if any payment of interest on any Equipment Note
shall not be made when and as the same shall become due and payable, and such
failure shall continue for the period prescribed in Section 8.01(a), the Loan
Trustee shall be entitled to recover judgment, in its own name and as trustee
of an express trust, upon the Equipment Note for the whole amount of such
principal or interest, as the case may be, remaining unpaid.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, so long as the Pass
Through Trustee is the registered holder of
<PAGE> 38
27

any Equipment Note hereunder, the Loan Trustee is not authorized or empowered
to acquire title to all or any portion of the Indenture Estate or take any
action with respect to all or any portion of the Indenture Estate so acquired
by it if such acquisition or action would cause any Pass Through Trust to fail
to qualify as a "grantor trust" for Federal income tax purposes.

Section 8.04. Waiver of Company. To the extent now or at any time
hereafter enforceable under applicable law, the Company covenants that it will
not at any time insist upon or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take
any benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law now or at any time
hereafter in force, nor claim, take nor insist upon any benefit or advantage of
or from any law now or hereafter in force providing for the valuation or
appraisement of the Indenture Estate or any part thereof, prior to any sale or
sales thereof to be made pursuant to any provision herein contained, or to the
decree, judgment or order of any court of competent jurisdiction; nor, after
such sale or sales, claim or exercise any right under any statute now or
hereafter made or enacted by any state or otherwise to redeem the property so
sold or any part thereof, and hereby expressly waives for itself and on behalf
of each and every Person, except decree or judgment creditors of the Company
acquiring any interest in or title to the Indenture Estate or any part thereof
subsequent to the date of this Indenture, all benefit and advantage of any such
law or laws, and covenants that it will not invoke or utilize any such law or
laws or otherwise hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein
granted and delegated to the Loan Trustee, but will suffer and permit the
execution of every such power as though no such law or laws had been made or
enacted.

The Loan Trustee may maintain such a proceeding even if it does not
possess any of the Equipment Notes or does not produce any of them in the
proceeding. A delay or omission by the Loan Trustee or any Loan Participant in
exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Indenture Event of Default
under this Indenture shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a
waiver of or acquiescence in such Indenture Event of Default.

(I) Section 9.11 thereof shall read as follows:

Section 9.11. Assumption of Certain Obligations. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained herein, any reference in this Article 9 to
the Owner Trustee
<PAGE> 39
28

or to any obligation of the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to be a reference to
the Company or to an obligation of the Company, as the case may be, any
reference to "Lease Event of Default" shall be deemed to be a reference to an
"Indenture Event of Default", all provisions requiring notices to the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant shall be deemed to be deleted for the purposes
of this Article 9 and any provision in this Article 9 requiring the action or
consent of the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to require the action or approval
of the Company.

Termination of Obligations. Subject to Section 10.02, this Indenture shall
cease to be of further effect, and the Company and the Loan Trustee shall be
deemed to have been discharged from their respective obligations with respect
to the Equipment Notes (and the Loan Trustee, on demand and at the expense of
the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture in respect of the Equipment Notes), when

hereunder has been paid and discharged from such trust, as provided in
Section 7.01) have been delivered to the Loan Trustee for cancellation; or

(ii) all Equipment Notes not theretofore delivered to the Loan
Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable (whether upon stated

Notes which have become due and payable), or to the maturity thereof, as the
case may be, plus all other amounts payable to the Loan Participants; or

certified public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof
delivered to the Loan Trustee, to pay and discharge each installment of
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Outstanding Equipment
Notes on the dates such payments of principal or interest are due (including

referred to above in clause (A), the right of the Company to cause the

ARTICLE 14

Section 14.01. Issuance of Equipment Notes After Redemption.
Following a redemption of the Equipment Notes of any Maturity in accordance

shall authenticate, one or more new series of Equipment Notes in an aggregate
principal amount up to the aggregate principal amount of the Equipment Notes
then being redeemed and having such terms and provisions (including, without
limitation, interest rate, amortization schedule, maturity date and redemption
provisions) as the Company shall deem appropriate; provided that if after such
redemption any Equipment Notes remain outstanding the new series of Equipment
Notes:

(i) shall be denominated and payable in United States Dollars and
shall not be in a principal amount greater than the Equipment Notes
redeemed;
<PAGE> 48
37

(ii) shall not rank senior in any respect to the Equipment Notes
which remain outstanding; and

(iii) shall not have a maturity after or have a weighted average life
longer than the Equipment Notes redeemed if any of the Equipment Notes which

maturity date of the Equipment Notes redeemed; and

provided further that prior to authentication and delivery of such new series
of Equipment Notes the Loan Trustee shall have received (i) written evidence
from Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. to the
effect that the issuance of such new series, by itself, would not result in a
downgrading of the credit rating assigned to the Pass Through Equipment Notes
then outstanding, and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel for the Company reasonably
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee to the effect that the protection afforded by
Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code to the existing Loan Participants would not
be adversely affected by the issuance of such new series of Equipment Notes;
provided that such opinion need not be delivered to the extent that the
benefits of such Section 1110 are not available to the Loan Participants with
respect to the Aircraft immediately prior to such assumption; and provided
further that such opinion may contain qualifications of the tenor contained in
the opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton delivered pursuant to Section 3(k) of the
Refunding Agreement on the Refunding Date.

(O) The Indenture shall include the following Article 15:

This Article 15 consists of Sections 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 17, 24, 27,

<PAGE> 49
38

Participant Liens and Trustee's Liens, (iv) Liens for Taxes either not yet due
or being contested in good faith (and for the payment of which adequate
reserves have been provided) by appropriate proceedings so long as such
proceedings do not involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss
of the Airframe or any Engine or interest therein, (v) materialmen's,
mechanics', workmen's, repairmen's, employees' or other like Liens arising in
the ordinary course of business for amounts the payment of which is either not
yet delinquent or is being contested in good faith (and for the payment of
which adequate reserves have been provided) by appropriate proceedings so long
as such proceedings do not involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture
or loss of the Airframe or any Engine or interest therein, (vi) Liens arising
out of judgments or awards against the Company with respect to which an appeal
or proceeding for review is being prosecuted in good faith and with respect to
which there shall have been secured a stay of execution pending such appeal or
proceeding for review and (vii) salvage or similar rights of insurers under
insurance policies maintained pursuant to Section 11 of this Article. The
Company will promptly, at its own expense, take such action as may be necessary
duly to discharge (by bonding or otherwise) any such Lien not excepted above if
the same shall arise at any time.

Section 7. Registration, Maintenance and Operation; Possession;
Insignia. (a) Registration, Maintenance and Operation. The Company, at its
own cost and expense, shall:

(i) cause the Aircraft at all times to be duly registered, under the
laws of the United States, in the name of the Company, as owner, except as
otherwise required by the Federal Aviation Act; provided that the Loan
Trustee shall execute and deliver all such documents as the Company shall
reasonably request for the purpose of effecting and continuing such
registration. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, but subject always to
the terms and conditions set forth in Section 7.02 of this Indenture, the
Company may cause the Aircraft to be duly registered under the laws of any
jurisdiction in which a lessee pursuant to Section 7(b)(ix) of this Article
could be principally based and shall thereafter maintain such registration
unless and until changed as provided herein and therein; and the Loan
Trustee will cooperate with the Company in effecting such foreign
registration;
<PAGE> 50
39

(ii) maintain, service, repair, overhaul and test the Aircraft in
accordance with a maintenance program (as approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration) for Boeing 757-200 series aircraft (or, at the Company's
option, (x) in the event that the Aircraft is re-registered in another
jurisdiction pursuant to Section 7(a)(i) of this Article, in accordance with
an aircraft maintenance program approved by the central civil aviation
authority of the jurisdiction of such registration or (y) in the event of
any lease to a foreign air carrier in accordance with Section 7(b)(ix) of
this Article, approved by the central civil aviation authority of one of the
jurisdictions specified in clause (y) of such Section 7(b)(ix)) and in the
same manner and with the same care used by the Company with respect to
comparable aircraft and engines owned or operated by the Company and
utilized in similar circumstances so as to keep the Aircraft in as good
operating condition as when delivered to the Company by the Manufacturer,
ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in such condition as may be necessary
to enable the airworthiness certification of the Aircraft to be maintained
in good standing at all times (other than during temporary periods of
storage in accordance with applicable regulations or during periods of
grounding by applicable governmental authorities, except where such periods
of grounding are the result of the failure by the Company to maintain the
Aircraft as otherwise required herein) under the Federal Aviation Act or, if
the Aircraft is registered under the laws of any other jurisdiction, the
laws of such jurisdiction and in compliance with all applicable
manufacturer's alert service bulletins;

(iii) maintain, in the English language, all records logs and other
materials required by the appropriate authorities in the jurisdiction where
the Aircraft is registered to be maintained in respect of the Aircraft; and

(iv) promptly furnish to the Loan Trustee such information as may be
required to enable the Loan Trustee to file any reports, returns or
statements required to be filed by the Loan Trustee with any governmental
authority because of the Loan Trustee's interest in the Aircraft.

The Company agrees that the Aircraft will not be maintained, used or
operated in violation of any law or any
<PAGE> 51
40

rule, regulation or order of any government or governmental authority having
jurisdiction (domestic or foreign), or in violation of any airworthiness
certificate, license or registration relating to the Aircraft issued by any
such authority; provided that the Company shall not be in default under this
sentence if it is not possible for it to comply with the laws of a jurisdiction
other than the United States (or other than any jurisdiction in which the
Aircraft is then registered) because of a conflict with the applicable laws of
the United States (or such jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is then
registered). In the event that any such law, rule, regulation or order
requires alteration of the Aircraft, the Company will conform thereto or obtain
conformance therewith at no expense to the Loan Trustee and will maintain the
Aircraft in proper operating condition under such laws, rules, regulations and
orders; provided, however, that the Company may, in good faith, contest the
validity or application of any such law, rule, regulation or order in any
reasonable manner which does not materially adversely affect the Loan Trustee,
the Aircraft, the Loan Participants or the Lien of this Indenture. The Company
also agrees not to operate or locate the Aircraft, or suffer the Aircraft to be
operated or located, (i) in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance
required by the terms of Section 11 of this Article, except in the case of a
requisition for use by any Government where the Company obtains indemnity
pursuant to Section 11 of this Article in lieu of such insurance from such
Government against the risks and in the amounts required by Section 11 of this
Article covering such area, or (ii) in any war zone or recognized or, in the
Company's judgment, threatened area of hostilities unless covered by war risk
insurance in accordance with Section 11 of this Article, but only so long as
the same remains in effect while the Aircraft is so operated or located, or
unless the Aircraft is operated or used under contract with any Government
entered into pursuant to Section 11 of this Article, under which contract such
Government assumes liability for any damage, loss, destruction or failure to
return possession of the Aircraft at the end of the term of such contract or
for injury to persons or damage to property of others.

(b) Possession. The Company will not, without the prior written
consent of the Loan Trustee, lease or otherwise in any manner deliver, transfer
or relinquish possession of the Airframe or any Engine or install any Engine,
or permit any Engine to be installed, on any airframe other than the Airframe;
provided that, so long as no Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, and so long as
<PAGE> 52
41

the action to be taken shall not deprive the Loan Trustee of the perfected lien
of this Indenture on the Airframe or (subject to subclause (B) of the "provided
further" clause to subsection (i) of this Section 7(b)) any Engine, and in any
event, so long as the Company shall comply with the provisions of Section 11,
the Company may, without the prior consent of the Loan Trustee:

(i) subject the Airframe to normal interchange agreements or any
Engine to normal interchange or pooling agreements or arrangements in each
case customary in the airline industry and entered into by the Company in
the ordinary course of its business with any other United States air carrier
as to which there is in force a certificate issued pursuant to Section 401
of the Federal Aviation Act or any successor provision that gives like
authority or with any "foreign air carrier" (as such term is defined in such
Act) as to which there is in force a permit issued pursuant to Section 402
of said Act (any such United States certificated air carrier and any such
foreign air carrier being hereinafter called a "Permitted Air Carrier");
provided that no transfer of the registration of such Airframe shall be
effected in connection therewith; and provided, further, that (A) no such
agreement or arrangement contemplates or requires the transfer of title to
the Airframe and (B) if the Company's title to any such Engine shall be
divested under any such agreement or arrangement, such divestiture shall be
deemed to be an Event of Loss with respect to such Engine and the Company
shall comply with Section 10(b) of this Article in respect thereof;

(ii) deliver possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the
manufacturer thereof for testing or other similar purposes or to any
organization for service, repair, maintenance or overhaul work on the
Airframe or such Engine or any part thereof or for alterations or
modifications in or additions to the Airframe or such Engine to the extent
required or permitted by the terms of Section 7(a) or 8(c) of this Article;

(iii) transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the United
States of America or any instrumentality or agency thereof pursuant to a
sublease, contract or other instrument, a copy of which shall be furnished
to the Loan Trustee;

(iv) transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the United
States of America or any
<PAGE> 53
42

instrumentality or agency thereof in accordance with applicable laws,
rulings, regulations or orders (including, without limitation, the Civil
Reserve Air Fleet Program authorized under 10 U.S.C. # 9511 et seq. or any
substantially similar program);

(v) install an Engine on an airframe owned by the Company free and
clear of all Liens, except (A) those of the type permitted under clauses
(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of Section 6 of this Article and
those which apply only to the engines (other than Engines), appliances,
parts, instruments, appurtenances, accessories, furnishings and other
equipment (other than Parts) installed on such airframe (but not to the
airframe as an entirety) and (B) the rights of other Permitted Air Carriers
under normal interchange agreements which are customary in the airline
industry and do not contemplate, permit or require the transfer of title to
the airframe or engines installed thereon;

(vi) install an Engine on an airframe leased to the Company or owned
by the Company subject to a conditional sale or other security agreement;
provided that (A) such airframe is free and clear of all Liens except the
rights of the parties to the lease or conditional sale or other security
agreement covering such airframe and except Liens of the type permitted by
clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (v) of this paragraph of Section 7(b) of
this Article and (B) the Company shall have obtained from the lessor or
secured party of such airframe a written agreement (which may be the lease
or conditional sale or other security agreement covering such airframe), in
form and substance satisfactory to the Loan Trustee (it being understood
that an agreement from such lessor or secured party substantially in the
form of the final sentence of the penultimate paragraph of this Section 7(b)
of this Article shall be deemed to be satisfactory to the Loan Trustee),
whereby such lessor or secured party expressly agrees that neither it nor
its successors or assigns will acquire or claim any right, title or interest
in any Engine by reason of such Engine being installed on such airframe at
any time while such Engine is subject to the lien of the Trust Indenture;

(vii) install an Engine on an airframe owned by the Company, leased
to the Company or owned by the Company subject to a conditional sale or
other security agreement under circumstances where neither subparagraph (v)
nor
<PAGE> 54
43

subparagraph (vi) of this Section 7(b) of this Article is applicable;
provided that such installation shall be deemed an Event of Loss with
respect to such Engine and the Company shall comply with Section 10(b) of
this Article in respect thereof, the Loan Trustee not intending hereby to
waive any right or interest it may have to or in such Engine under
applicable law until compliance by the Company with such Section 10(b) of
this Article;

(viii) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or engines then
installed on the Airframe to any United States air carrier as to which there
is in force a certificate issued pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal
Aviation Act or successor provision that gives like authority;

(ix) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or engines then
installed on the Airframe to (A) any foreign air carrier that is principally
based in and a domiciliary of a country (other than Cuba, El Salvador, Iran,
Iraq, Lebanon and Libya) that is at the inception of the lease a party to
the Mortgage Convention, or (B) any foreign air carrier that is principally
based in and a domiciliary of a country listed in Schedule I hereto, or (C)
any foreign air carrier not described in clause (A) or (B) above; provided
that (w) in the case only of a lease to a foreign air carrier under clause
(C) above, the Loan Trustee receives at the time of such lease an opinion of
counsel to the Company (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Loan Trustee to the effect that (a) the terms of the lease and the
Operative Documents are legal, valid, binding and enforceable in the country
in which such air carrier is principally based, to substantially the same
extent as the Operative Documents are at that time enforceable in the United
States, (b) it is not necessary for the Loan Trustee to qualify to do
business in such country solely as a result of the proposed lease, (c) there
is no tort liability of the Loan Trustee as a result of the Lien of this
Indenture under the laws of such country other than tort liability no more
extensive or onerous than that which might have been imposed on the Loan
Trustee under the laws of the United States or any state thereof (it being
understood that, in the event such opinion cannot be given in a form
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee, such opinion shall be waived if insurance
reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee is provided by the
<PAGE> 55
44

Company to cover the risk of such liability), (d) the laws of such country
require fair compensation by the government of such country for the loss of
the use of the Aircraft in the event of the requisition by such government
of the Aircraft (unless the Company shall have agreed to provide insurance
reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee covering the risk of requisition
of use of the Aircraft by the government of such jurisdiction so long as the
aircraft is leased in such country), and (e) there exist no possessory
rights in favor of such lessee under the laws of such country which would,
upon bankruptcy of or other default by the Company or the lessee, prevent
the return of such Engine or the Airframe and such Engine or engine to the
Loan Trustee in accordance with and when permitted by the terms of this
Indenture upon the exercise by the Loan Trustee of its remedies under this
Indenture, (x) in the case only of a lease to a foreign air carrier under
clause (C) above, the Loan Trustees receives assurances reasonably
satisfactory to it that the currency of such country is freely convertible
into U.S. Dollars (unless the Company shall have agreed to provide the
requisition insurance described in subclause (d) of clause (w) above,), (y)
in the case of any lease to a foreign air carrier, either the lease, or an
arrangement existing between the Company, the lessee and/or one or more
third parties that provide maintenance services, provides that the Aircraft
will be maintained, serviced, repaired, overhauled and tested in accordance
with maintenance standards for Boeing 757-200 series aircraft approved by,
or substantially similar to those approved or required by, the Federal
Aviation Administration or the central civil aviation authority of any of
Brazil, Canada, France, The Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland or the United Kingdom and (z) in the case
of any lease to a foreign air carrier (other than a foreign air carrier
principally based in Taiwan) the United States of America maintains
diplomatic relations with the country in which such foreign air carrier is
principally based at the time such lease is entered into;

provided that the rights of any transferee who receives possession by reason of
a transfer permitted by this Section 7(b) (other than the transfer of an Engine
which is deemed an Event of Loss) shall be subject and subordinate to, and any
lease permitted by this Section 7(b) shall be made expressly subject and
subordinate to, all the terms of this Indenture, including, without limitation,
the Loan Trustee's rights to repossession pursuant to Article 8 hereof and to
avoid such
<PAGE> 56
45

lease upon such repossession and the Loan Trustee's rights to possession
pursuant to Section 8.03 of this Indenture, and the Company shall in all events
remain primarily liable hereunder for the performance and observance of all of
the terms and conditions of this Indenture to the same extent as if such lease
or transfer had not occurred, and any such lease shall include appropriate
provisions for the maintenance (subject to clause (y) of the proviso to Section
7(b)(ix) of this Article) and insurance of the Aircraft. The Company shall not
lease the Aircraft to an air carrier that at the inception of the lease is
subject to bankruptcy proceedings unless the lease shall have been approved by
the receiver, liquidator, conservator, court or other governmental or
administrative authority or entity responsible for the adjudication or
administration of such proceedings. No interchange agreement, pooling
agreement, lease or other relinquishment of possession of the Airframe or any
Engine shall in any way discharge or diminish any of the Company's obligations
to the Loan Trustee hereunder or under the Participation Agreement. With the
prior written consent of the Loan Trustee, the Company may sublease the
Airframe or Engines in connection with a transaction that involves such a
sublease commencing at the inception of the transaction. The Loan Trustee
hereby agrees, for the benefit of the lessor or secured party of any airframe
leased by the Company or owned by the Company subject to a conditional sale or
other security agreement, that the Loan Trustee will not acquire or claim, as
against such lessor or secured party, any right, title or interest in any
engine or engines owned by the lessor under such lease or subject to a security
interest in favor of the secured party under such conditional sale or other
security agreement as the result of such engine or engines being installed on
the Airframe at any time while such engine or engines are subject to such lease
or conditional sale or other security agreement.

The Loan Trustee acknowledges that any "wet lease" or other similar
arrangement under which the Company maintains operational control of the
Aircraft shall not constitute a delivery, transfer or relinquishment of
possession for purposes of this Section 7(b).

(c) Insignia. The Company agrees to at all times maintain in the
cockpit of the Airframe adjacent to the airworthiness certificate therein and
(if not prevented by applicable law or regulations or by any governmental
authority) on each Engine a nameplate bearing the inscription "STATE STREET
BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CONNECTICUT, NATIONAL
<PAGE> 57
46

ASSOCIATION, AS LOAN TRUSTEE, MORTGAGEE" (such nameplate to be replaced, if
necessary, with a nameplate reflecting the name of any successor Loan Trustee).

Section 8. Replacement and Pooling of Parts; Alterations,
Modifications and Additions. (a) Replacement of Parts. The Company, at its
own cost and expense, will promptly replace all Parts which may from time to
time be incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine
and which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed,
seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or rendered permanently unfit for
use for any reason whatsoever, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of
this Article. In addition, the Company may, at its own cost and expense,
remove in the ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or
testing, any Parts, whether or not worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized,
confiscated, damaged beyond repair or rendered permanently unfit for use;
provided that the Company, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of this
Article, will, at its own cost and expense, replace such Parts as promptly as
possible. All replacement Parts shall be free and clear of all Liens (except
for pooling arrangements to the extent permitted by Section 8(b) of this
Article and Permitted Liens) and shall be in as good operating condition as,
and shall have a value and utility at least equal to, the Parts replaced,
assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition and repair required to be
maintained by the terms hereof. All Parts at any time removed from the
Airframe or any Engine shall remain subject to the Lien of this Indenture, no
matter where located, until such time as such Parts shall be replaced by Parts
which have been incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or
such Engine and which meet the requirements for replacement Parts specified
above. Immediately upon any replacement Part becoming incorporated or
installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine as above provided
without further act, (i) title to the replaced Part shall thereupon be free and
clear of all rights of the Loan Trustee, and shall no longer be deemed a Part
hereunder, (ii) title to such replacement Part shall thereupon be subject to
the Lien of this Indenture, free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted
Liens) and (iii) such replacement Part shall become subject to this Indenture
and be deemed part of the Airframe or such Engine for all purposes to the same
extent as the Parts originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the
Airframe or such Engine.

(b) Pooling of Parts. Any Part removed from the Airframe or any
Engine as provided in Section 8(a) of this
<PAGE> 58
47

Article may be subjected by the Company to a normal pooling arrangement
customary in the airline industry entered into in the ordinary course of the
Company's business with Permitted Air Carriers; provided that the Part
replacing such removed Part shall be incorporated or installed in or attached
to the Airframe or such Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article
as promptly as practicable after the removal of such removed Part. In
addition, any replacement Part, when incorporated or installed in or attached
to the Airframe or any Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article,
may be owned by a Permitted Air Carrier subject to such a normal pooling
arrangement; provided that the Company, at its expense, as promptly thereafter
as is practicable, either (i) causes title to such replacement Part to vest in
the Company free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens, at which time
such replacement Part shall, in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article
become a Part and become subject to the Lien of this Indenture or (ii) replaces
such replacement part by incorporating or installing in or attaching to the
Airframe or such Engine a further replacement Part owned by the Company free
and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), which shall without
further act be subject to the Lien of this Indenture.

(c) Alterations, Modifications and Additions. The Company, at its
own expense, will make such alterations and modifications in and additions to
the Airframe and the Engines as may be required from time to time to meet the
standards of the Federal Aviation Administration or other governmental
authority having jurisdiction in any country in or over which the Aircraft is
flown; provided, however, that the Company may, in good faith, contest the
validity or application of any such standard in any reasonable manner which
does not materially adversely affect the Loan Trustee or the Lien of this
Indenture, but only so long as such proceedings do not involve any material
danger of criminal liability or material danger of civil liability to the Loan
Trustee, or a material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Aircraft
or any Engine or any interest therein. In addition, the Company, at its own
expense, may from time to time make or cause to be made such alterations and
modifications in and additions to the Airframe or any Engine as the Company may
deem desirable in the proper conduct of its business, including, without
limitation, removal or Parts; provided that no such alterations, modification,
addition or removal shall materially diminish the value or utility of the
Airframe or such Engine or of the Aircraft, or materially impair the condition
or airworthiness thereof,
<PAGE> 59
48

below the value, utility, condition and airworthiness thereof immediately prior
to such alternation, modification, addition or removal assuming the Airframe or
such Engine was then of the value and utility and in the condition and
airworthiness required to be maintained by the terms of this Indenture, except
that the value (but not the utility, condition or airworthiness) of the
Aircraft may be reduced by the value of Parts which the Company deems obsolete
or no longer suitable or appropriate for use in the Airframe or any Engine
which shall have been removed, if the aggregate value of such obsolete or
unsuitable Parts removed from the Aircraft and not replaced shall not exceed
$500,000. All Parts incorporated or installed in or attached or added to the
Airframe or any Engine as the result of such alteration, modification or
addition shall, with our further act, be subject to the Lien of this Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, at any time, remove any Part;
provided that (i) such Part is in addition to, and not in replacement of or
substitution for, any Part originally incorporated or installed in or attached
to the Airframe or such Engine at the time of delivery thereof under the Lease
or hereunder or any Part in replacement of, or substitution for, any such Part,
(ii) such Part is not required to be incorporated or installed in or attached
or added to such Airframe or Engine pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 8(c), and (iii) such Part can be removed from the Airframe or such
Engine without materially diminishing or impairing the value, utility,
condition or airworthiness required to be maintained by the terms of this
Indenture which the Airframe or such Engine would have had at such time had
such removal not occurred. Upon the removal by the Company of any Part as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, or the removal of any obsolete
or unsuitable part permitted by this Section 8(c), such Part shall not longer
be deemed part of the Airframe or the Engine from which it was removed and
shall no longer be subject to the Lien of this Indenture. Any such Part not
removed by the Company as provided in Section 8(c)(iii) of this Article shall
remain subject to the Lien of this Indenture.

Section 10. Loss, Destruction, Requisition, Etc. (a) Event of Loss
with Respect to an Airframe. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss with
respect to the Airframe, the Company shall forthwith (and, in any event, within
30 days after such occurrence) give the Loan Trustee written notice of such
Event of Loss and of its election to perform one of the following options (it
being agreed that if the Company shall not have given notice of such election
within
<PAGE> 60
49

such 30 days after such occurrence, the Company shall be deemed to have elected
to perform the option set forth in the following clause (ii)):

(i) as promptly as practicable, and in any event on or before the
Business Day next preceding the 121st day next following the date of
occurrence of such Event of Loss, in replacement for the Airframe, the
Company shall convey or cause to be conveyed to the Loan Trustee a security
interest in and to one or more Replacement Airframes (together with the same
number of Replacement Engines as the Engines, if any, installed on the
Airframe at the time such Event of Loss occurred), such Replacement Airframe
and Replacement Engines to be duly certificated as airworthy by the central
aviation authority of the jurisdiction of the registry of such Replacement
Airframes and Engines, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens), to have a value and utility at least equal to, and to be in as good
operating condition as, the Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced
(assuming such Airframe and Engines were in the condition and repair
required by the terms of this Indenture); provided that, if the Company
shall not perform its obligation to effect such replacement under this
clause (i) during the period of time provided herein, then the Company shall
promptly give notice to the Loan Trustee and shall pay on the Business Day
next following the thirtieth day after the end of such period to the Loan
Trustee, in U.S. currency, the amounts specified in clause (ii) below; or

(ii) on or before the Loss Payment Date (as defined below) the
Company shall pay to the Loan Trustee an amount in cash which is sufficient
to redeem each Outstanding Equipment Note pursuant to Section 6.01; provided
that the Company may, to the extent provided and in accordance with Section
3.08 hereof, surrender, to the Loan Trustee for cancellation Equipment Notes
held by the Company and in such event the Company shall be entitled to a
credit against amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this clause (ii). As
used herein, "Loss Payment Date" means the earliest of (x) 30 days following
the date on which insurance proceeds are received with respect to such Event
of Loss, (y) the Business Day next following the 121st day next following
the date of occurrence of the Event of Loss and (z) a Business Day
irrevocably specified by the Company at least thirty days in advance by
notice to the Loan Trustee; provided, however, the
<PAGE> 61
50

Loss Payment Date shall be the date specified in the proviso to clause (i)
above if applicable.

Upon compliance by the Company with the requirements of this Section 10(a)(ii),
the Loan Trustee shall execute such instruments as may be reasonably requested
by the Company releasing the Airframe and Engines from the Lien of this
Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement
Assignment from the assignment and pledge thereof hereunder.

At the time of or prior to any replacement of the Airframe and such
Engines pursuant to Section 10(a)(i) of this Article, if any, the Company, at
its own expense, will (A) cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto for such Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, to be delivered to the Loan Trustee for execution
and, upon such execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal
Aviation Act or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of the
jurisdiction other than the United States of America in which such Replacement
Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if any, are to be registered in accordance
with Section 7(a) of this Article, as the case may be, (B) cause a financing
statement or statements with respect to the Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, or other requisite documents or instruments, to be
filed in such place or places as necessary or advisable in order to perfect the
security interest therein created by or pursuant to this Indenture, or, if
necessary or advisable, pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in
which such Replacement Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if any, are to be
registered in accordance with Section 7(a) of this Article, as the case may be,
(C) furnish the Loan Trustee with a certificate of an independent aircraft
engineer or appraiser reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee certifying
that the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, have a value and
utility at least equal to, and are in as good operating condition as, the
Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced assuming the Airframe and Engines
were in the condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior
to the occurrence of such Event of Loss, (D) furnish the Loan Trustee with (i)
such evidence of compliance with the insurance provisions of Section 11 of this
Article with respect to such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines as
the Loan Trustee may reasonably request and (ii) a certificate from a
Responsible Officer of the Company certifying that at the time of such
<PAGE> 62
51

replacement, there is no continuing Indenture Event of Default, (E) furnish the
Loan Trustee with an opinion of the Company's counsel (which may be the
Company's General Counsel) addressed to the Loan Trustee that the substituted
property will be subject to the Lien of the this Indenture and the Loan Trustee
should be entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, with respect to the Replacement Airframe,
provided that (x) such opinion need not be delivered to the extent that the
benefits of such Section 1110 were not, by reason of a change in law or
governmental interpretation thereof, available to the Loan Trustee with respect
to the Aircraft immediately prior to such substitution and (y) such opinion may
contain qualifications of the tenor contained in the opinion of Debevoise &
Plimpton delivered pursuant to Section 4(J) of the Participation Agreement on
the Delivery Date. In the case of each Replacement Airframe and each
Replacement Engine, if any, in which a security interest has been granted to
the Loan Trustee under this Section 10, and each Replacement Engine, if any, in
which a security interest has been granted to the Loan Trustee under this
Section 10, promptly upon the recordation of the Trust Agreement and Indenture
Supplement covering such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any,
or such Replacement Engine pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act (or pursuant to
the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which such Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, or such Replacement Engine, are registered in
accordance with Section 7(a) of this Article), the Company will cause to be
delivered to the Loan Trustee a favorable opinion of counsel to the Company as
to the due registration of such Replacement Aircraft, the due recordation of
such Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement or other requisite documents or
instruments and the validity and perfection of the security interest in the
Replacement Airframe, Replacement Engines or Replacement Engine, as the case
may be, granted to the Loan Trustee under this Indenture.

For all purposes hereof, upon grant of a security interest therein to
the Loan Trustee, each Replacement Aircraft and the Replacement Engines, if
any, shall be deemed part of the property secured hereunder; each such
Replacement Airframe shall be deemed an "Airframe" as defined herein, and each
such Replacement Engine shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein. Upon
full compliance with the terms of the previous paragraph, the Loan Trustee
shall execute and deliver to the Company an appropriate instrument releasing
such replaced airframe and engines (if any) installed thereon at the time such
Event of Loss occurred from the Lien of this
<PAGE> 63
52

Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement
Assignment from the assignment and pledge hereunder.

(b) Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Upon the occurrence of
an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under circumstances in which there
has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe, the Company
shall give the Loan Trustee prompt written notice thereof and shall, within 90
days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, convey or cause to be conveyed
to the Loan Trustee, as replacement for the Engine with respect to which such
Event of Loss occurred, a security interest in and to a Replacement Engine free
and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and having a value and
utility at least equal to, and being in as good operating condition as, the
Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, assuming such Engine
was of the value and utility and in the condition and repair required by the
terms hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss. Prior
to or at the time of any such conveyance, the Company, at its own expense, will
(i) cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement substantially in the form
of Exhibit C hereto or other requisite documents or instruments for such
Replacement Engine to be delivered to the Loan Trustee for execution and, upon
such execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation
Act or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of such jurisdiction
other than the United States of America in which the Aircraft is or is to be
registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the case may be, (ii) furnish
the Loan Trustee with a certificate of an aircraft engineer or appraiser (who
may be an employee of the Company) certifying that such Replacement Engine has
a value and utility at least equal to, and is in as good operating condition
as, the Engine so replaced, assuming such Engine was in the condition and
repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such
Event of Loss and (iii) cause a financing statement or statements with respect
to the Replacement Engine or other requisite documents or instruments to be
filed in such place or places necessary or advisable in order to perfect the
security interest in the Replacement Engine created by or pursuant to this
Indenture or, if necessary or advisable, pursuant to the applicable laws of the
jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is or is to be registered in accordance with
Section 7(a), as the case may be, and (iv) furnish the Loan Trustee with such
evidence of compliance with the insurance provisions of Section 11 of this
Article with respect to such Replacement Engine as the
<PAGE> 64
53

Loan Trustee may reasonably request, and (v) furnish the Loan Trustee with an
opinion of the Company's counsel (which may be the Company's General Counsel)
addressed to the Loan Trustee to the effect that such substituted property will
be subjected to the Lien of this Indenture. Upon full compliance by the
Company with the terms of this paragraph (b), the Loan Trustee will transfer to
the Company, without recourse or warranty (except as to the Trustee's Liens),
all of Loan Trustee's right, title and interest in and to the Engine with
respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, and Loan Trustee will assign to
or as directed by the Company all claims of Loan Trustee against third Persons
relating to such Engine arising from such Event of Loss. In addition, upon
such transfer the Loan Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Company an
appropriate instrument releasing such Engine from the Lien of this Indenture
and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment (in
respect of such Engine) from the assignment and pledge under this Indenture.
For all purposes hereof, each such Replacement Engine shall, after such
conveyance, be deemed part of the property secured hereunder and shall be
deemed an "Engine" as defined herein.

(c) Application of Payments from Governmental Authorities for
Requisition of Title or Use. Any payments (other than insurance proceeds the
application of which is provided for in Section 11 of this Article) received at
any time by the Loan Trustee or by the Company from any governmental authority
or other Person with respect to an Event of Loss resulting from the
condemnation, confiscation, theft or seizure of, or requisition of title to or
use of, the Airframe or any Engine, other than a requisition for use by any
Government or by the government of registry of the Aircraft not constituting an
Event of Loss, will be applied as follows:

(i) if such payments are received with respect to the Airframe or the
Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on the Airframe that has been
or is being replaced by the Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this
Article, such payments shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Loan
Trustee, and upon completion of such replacement be paid over to, or
retained by, the Company;

(ii) if such payments are received with respect to the Airframe or
the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on the Airframe that has
not been and will not be replaced pursuant to Section 10(a) of this Article,
<PAGE> 65
54

such payments shall, after reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and
expenses, be applied in reduction of the Company's obligation to pay the
amounts required to be paid by the Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this
Article, if not already paid by the Company, or, if already paid by the
Company, shall be applied to reimburse the Company for its payment of such
amounts, and the balance, if any, of such payments remaining thereafter
shall be paid over to, and retained by, the Company; and

(iii) if such payments are received with respect to an Engine under
circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b) of this Article, so much of such
payments remaining after reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and
expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Company; provided that
the Company shall have fully performed the terms of Section 10(b) of this
Article with respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

(d) Requisition for Use by the Government of the Airframe and the
Engines Installed Thereon. In the event of the requisition for use by any
Government or by the government of the country of registry of the Aircraft
(including for this purpose any agency or instrumentality thereof), including,
without limitation, pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program referred to
in Section 7(b)(iv) of this Article of the Airframe and the Engines or engines
installed on the Airframe, the Company shall promptly notify the Loan Trustee
of such requisition and, except as otherwise provided in this Indenture, such
requisition shall not constitute an Event of Loss and all of the Company's
obligations under this Indenture with respect to the Aircraft shall continue to
the same extent as if such requisition had not occurred unless or until such
requisition shall constitute an Event of Loss. All payments received by the
Loan Trustee or the Company from the Government or government for the use of
the Airframe and Engines or engines prior to the occurrence of an Event of Loss
shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Company.

(e) Requisition for Use by the Government of an Engine. In the event
of the requisition for use by any Government or by the government of the
country of registry of the Aircraft (including for this purpose any agency or
instrumentality thereof) of any Engine (but not the Airframe), the Company will
replace such Engine hereunder by
<PAGE> 66
55

complying with the terms of Section 10(b) of this Article to the same extent as
if an Event of Loss had occurred with respect to such Engine, and any payments
received by the Loan Trustee or the Company from such Government or government
with respect to such requisition shall be paid over to, or retained by, the
Company.

(f) Application of Payments During Existence of Indenture Event of
Default. Any amount referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 10(c),
Section 10(d) or Section 10(e) of this Article which is payable to the Company
shall not be paid to the Company, or if it has been previously paid directly to
the Company, shall not be retained by the Company, if at the time of such
payment an Indenture Event of Default, or an Indenture Default which would
constitute an Indenture Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), 8.01(f),
8.01(g), 8.01(h) or 8.01(i), shall have occurred and be continuing, but shall
be paid to and held by the Loan Trustee as security for the obligations of the
Company under this Indenture, and at such time as there shall not be continuing
any such Indenture Event of Default or event, such amount shall be paid to the
Company, provided that, if any such amount has been so held by the Loan Trustee
as security for more than 90 days after an Event of Default shall have occurred
and during which period (x) the Loan Trustee shall not have been limited by
operation of law or otherwise from exercising remedies hereunder and (y) the
Loan Trustee shall not have commenced to exercise any remedy available to it
under this Indenture, then such amount shall be paid to the Company.

Section 11. Insurance. (a) Public Liability and Property Damage
Insurance. Subject to the rights of the Company to establish and maintain
self-insurance with respect to public liability and property damage liability
insurance for aircraft and engines (including the Aircraft and Engines) in the
manner and to the extent specified in the next sentence, the Company will
carry, or cause to be carried, at no expense to the Loan Trustee or the Pass
Through Trustee, public liability (including, without limitation, contractual
liability and passenger legal liability) and property damage liability
insurance (exclusive of manufacturer's product liability insurance) with
respect to the Aircraft (i) in amounts which are not less than the public
liability and property damage insurance applicable to similar aircraft and
engines which comprise the Company's fleet on which the Company carries
insurance, provided that such liability insurance shall not be less than the
amount certified to the
<PAGE> 67
56

Original Loan Participants on the Delivery Date, (ii) of the type usually
carried by corporations engaged in the same or similar business, similarly
situated with the Company, and owning or operating similar aircraft and engines
and covering risks of the kind customarily insured against by the Company, and
(iii) which is maintained in effect with insurers of recognized responsibility.
The Company may self-insure, by way of deductible or premium adjustment
provisions in insurance policies, the risks required to be insured against
pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in no case shall the self-insurance
(including the self-insurance permitted by Section 11(b) of this Article) with
respect to all of the aircraft and engines in the Company's fleet (including,
without limitation, the Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month policy year the
lesser of (x) 50% of the largest replacement value of any single aircraft in
the Company's fleet or (y) 1-1/2% of the average aggregate insurable value (for
the preceding year) of all aircraft (including, without limitation, the
Aircraft) on which the Company carries insurance; provided that, in the event
that there shall have occurred a material adverse change in the financial
condition of the Company from such condition as is reflected in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company at December 31, 1982, then,
upon not less than 30 days' written notice from the Loan Trustee to the
Company, the Company will, until the Company's financial condition is on an
overall basis equivalent to its financial condition at December 31, 1982,
reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder to such reasonable amount as the
Loan Trustee may require; provided, further, that a deductible per occurrence
utilized to reduce handling that, in the case of the Aircraft, is not in excess
of the amount customarily allowed as a deductible in the industry, shall be
permitted in addition to the abovementioned self-insurance. Any policies of
insurance carried in accordance with this Section 11(a) and any policies taken
out in substitution or replacement for any of such policies (A) shall name the
Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee as additional insureds as their
respective Interests may appear, (B) shall provide that in respect of the
respective interests of the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee in such
policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction of
the Company and shall insure the Loan Trustee's and the Pass Through Trustee's
Interests as they appear, regardless of any breach or violation of any
warranty, declaration or condition contained in such policies by the Company,
(C) shall provide that, if such insurance is cancelled for any reason whatever,
or any substantial change is made in the policy which affects the coverage
certified
<PAGE> 68
57

hereunder to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, or if such insurance
is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premium, such cancellation, change or
lapse shall not be effective as to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee
for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as is customarily obtainable in
the industry, in the case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after
receipt by the Loan Trustee nor the Pass Through Trustee, respectively, of
written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse, (D)
shall provide that neither the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee shall
have any obligation or liability for premiums, commissions, assessments or
calls in connection with such insurance, (E) shall provide that the insurers
shall waive (i) any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction,
whether by attachment or otherwise, which they may have against the Loan
Trustee nor the Pass Through Trustee and (ii) any rights of subrogation against
the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee to the extent that the Company has
waived its rights by its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to
this Indenture or the Participation Agreement; provided that the exercise by
such insurers of rights of subrogation derived from the rights retained by the
Company shall not, in any way, delay payment of any claim that would otherwise
be payable by such insurers but for the existence of rights of subrogation
derived from rights retained by the Company, (F) shall be primary without right
of contribution from any other insurance which may be carried by the Loan
Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee with respect to its Interests as such in
the Aircraft and (G) shall expressly provide that all of the provisions
thereof, except the limits of liability, shall operate in the same manner as if
there were a separate policy covering each insured. "Interests" as used in
this Section 11(a) and Section 11(b) of this Article with respect to any person
means the interests of such person in its capacity as Loan Trustee or Pass
Through Trustee, as the case may be, in the transaction contemplated by the
Participation Agreement and this Indenture. The Company shall arrange for
appropriate certification that the requirements of this Section 11(a) have been
met to be made to the Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee may furnish such
certificates to each Loan Participant) as soon as practicable by each insurer
or its authorized representative with respect thereto, provided that all
information contained therein shall be held confidential by the Loan Trustee
and each Loan Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to
anyone other than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal
counsel and any Person with whom any Loan Participant is in
<PAGE> 69
58

good faith conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale
of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes, if such person shall have entered
into an agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(a) whereby such
person agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be
required by an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute,
rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. In the case of a lease
or contract with any Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, or in
the case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine by any
Government, a valid agreement, reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee, to
indemnify the Company against any of the risks which the Company is required
hereunder to insure against by such Government shall be considered adequate
insurance to the extent of the risks and in the amounts that are the subject of
any such agreement to indemnify.

(b) Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Aircraft. Subject to the
rights of the Company to establish and maintain self- insurance with respect to
loss or damage to aircraft (including the Aircraft) in the manner and to the
extent specified in the next sentence, the Company shall maintain, or cause to
be maintained, in effect with insurers of recognized responsibility, at no
expense to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, all-risk aircraft hull
insurance covering the Aircraft and all-risk coverage with respect to any
Engines or parts while removed from the Aircraft (including, without
limitation, war risk and allied perils insurance if and to the extent the same
is maintained by the Company or any Permitted Air Carrier leasing the same with
respect to other aircraft owned or operated by the Company or such Permitted
Air Carrier, as the case may be, on the same routes) which is of the type and
in substantially the amount usually carried by corporations engaged in the same
or similar business and similarly situated with the Company; provided that (i)
such insurance (including the permitted self-insurance) shall at all times
while the Aircraft is subject to the Lien of this Indenture be for an amount
not less than, at the date of determination thereof, the Outstanding principal
amount of the Equipment Notes plus six months interest thereon and (ii) such
insurance need not cover an Engine while attached to an airframe not owned,
leased or operated by the Company. The Company may self-insure, by way of
deductible or premium adjustment provisions in insurance policies, the risks
required to be insured against pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in no
case shall the self-insurance (including the self-insurance
<PAGE> 70
59

permitted by Section 11(a) of this Article) with respect to all of the aircraft
and engines in the Company's fleet (including, without limitation, the
Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month policy year the lesser of (i) 50% of the
largest replacement value of any single aircraft in the Company's fleet or (ii)
1-1/2% of the average aggregate insurable value (for the preceding year) of all
aircraft (including, without limitation, the Aircraft) on which the Company
carries insurance; provided that, in the event that there shall have occurred a
material adverse change in the financial condition of the Company from such
condition as is reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company at December 31, 1982, then, upon not less than 30 days' written notice
from the Loan Trustee to the Company, the Company will, until the Company's
financial condition is on an overall basis equivalent to its financial
condition at December 31, 1982, reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder
to such reasonable amount as the Loan Trustee may require; provided, further,
that a deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce handling that, in the case
of the Aircraft, is not in excess of the amount customarily allowed as a
deductible in the industry, shall be permitted in addition to the
above-mentioned self-insurance. Any policies carried in accordance with this
Section 11(b) and any policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any
such policies (A) shall provide that any loss up to the amount equal to the
Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest
thereon, for any loss or damage constituting an Event of Loss with respect to
the Aircraft, and any loss in excess of $7,000,000, up to the amount equal to
the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest
thereon, for any loss or damage to the Aircraft (or Engines) not constituting
an Event of Loss with respect to the Aircraft, shall be paid to the Loan
Trustee as long as this Indenture shall not have been discharged pursuant to
the terms and conditions thereof, and thereafter to the Company, unless, in
each case, the insurer shall have received notice that an Indenture Event of
Default exists, in which case all insurance proceeds up to an amount equal to
the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest
thereon shall be payable to the Loan Trustee, (B) shall provide that in respect
of the respective interests of the Loan Trustee and of the Pass Through Trustee
in such policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action or
inaction of the Company and shall insure the Loan Trustee's and the Pass
Through Trustee's Interests, as they appear, regardless of any breach or
violation of any warranty, declaration or condition contained in such policies
<PAGE> 71
60

by the Company, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is cancelled for any
reason whatever, or any material change is made in the policy which affects the
coverage certified hereunder to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee,
or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premium, such
cancellation, change or lapse shall not be effective as to the Loan Trustee or
the Pass Through Trustee for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as may
from time to time be customarily obtainable in the industry, in the case of any
war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt by the Loan Trustee or the
Pass Through Trustee, respectively, of written notice from such insurers of
such cancellation, change or lapse, (D) shall be primary without right of
contribution from any other insurance which may be carried by the Loan Trustee
or the Pass Through Trustee with respect to its Interests as such in the
Aircraft and (E) shall provide that the insurers shall waive (i) any rights of
set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by attachment or
otherwise, which they may have against the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through
Trustee and (ii) any rights of subrogation against the Loan Trustee and the
Pass Through Trustee to the extent that the Company has waived its rights by
its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to this Indenture or the
Participation Agreement; provided that the exercise by such insurers of rights
of subrogation derived from rights retained by the Company shall not, in any
way, delay payment of any claim that would otherwise be payable by such
insurers but for the existence of rights of subrogation derived from rights
retained by the Company. The Company shall arrange for appropriate
certification that the requirements of this Section 11(b) have been met to be
made promptly to the Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee shall furnish such
certification to each Loan Participant) by each insurer or its authorized
representative with respect thereto, provided that all information contained
therein shall be held confidential by the Loan Trustee and each Loan
Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other
than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and
any person with whom any Loan Participant is in good faith conducting
negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale of such Loan
Participant's Equipment Notes, if such person shall have entered into an
agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(b) whereby such Person
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be required by
an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule,
regulation or order of any governmental authority. In the
<PAGE> 72
61

case of a lease or contract with any Government in respect of the Aircraft or
any Engine, or in the case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any
Engine by any Government, a valid agreement, reasonably satisfactory to the
Loan Trustee, to indemnify the Company against any of the risks which the
Company is required hereunder to insure against by such Government in an
amount, as at the date of determination thereof, equal to the Outstanding
principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus six months interest thereon from
time to time shall be considered adequate insurance to the extent of the risks
and in the amounts that are the subject of any such agreement to indemnify.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company it is agreed that all
insurance payments received under policies required to be maintained by the
Company hereunder, exclusive of any payments received in excess of an amount,
as at the date of determination thereof, equal to the Outstanding principal
amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon from such policies,
as the result of the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to the
Airframe or an Engine will be applied as follows:

(x) if such payments are received with respect to the Airframe or the
Airframe and any Engines or engines installed on the Airframe that has been
or is being replaced by the Company as contemplated by Section 10(a) of this
Article, such payments shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Loan
Trustee, and upon completion of such replacement be paid over to, or
retained by, the Company;

(y) if such payments are received with respect to the Airframe or the
Airframe and any Engines or engines installed thereon that has not been and
will not be replaced as contemplated by Section 10(a) of this Article, so
much of such payments remaining after reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for
costs and expenses as shall not exceed an amount, as at the date of
determination thereof, equal to the Outstanding principal amount of the
Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon required to be paid by the
Company pursuant to Section 10(a) of this Article shall be applied in
reduction of the Company's obligation to pay such amount equal to the
Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest
thereon, if not already paid by the Company, or, if already paid by the
Company, shall be applied to reimburse the Company for
<PAGE> 73
62

its payment of such amount equal to the Outstanding principal amount of the
Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon, and the balance, if any, of
such payment remaining thereafter will be paid over to, or retained by, the
Company; and

(z) if such payments are received with respect to an Engine under the
circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b) of this Article, so much of such
payments remaining after reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and
expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Company; provided that
the Company shall have fully performed the terms of Section 10(b) of this
Article with respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the insurance payment of
any property damage loss in excess of an amount equal to the Outstanding
principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon shall be
paid to the Company.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the insurance payments of
any property damage loss not constituting an Event of Loss with respect to the
Airframe or an Engine will be applied in payment (or to reimburse the Company)
for repairs or for replacement property in accordance with the terms of
Sections 7 and 8 of this Article, and any balance remaining after compliance
with such Sections with respect to such loss shall be paid to the Company. Any
amount referred to in the preceding sentence or in clause (x), (y) or (z) of
the second preceding paragraph which is payable to the Company shall not be
paid to the Company or, if it has been previously paid directly to the Company,
shall not be retained by the Company, if at the time of such payment an
Indenture Event of Default (or an Indenture Default that with lapse of time
would constitute an Indenture Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), 8.01(f),
8.01(g), 8.01(h) or 8.01(i) of this Indenture) shall have occurred and be
continuing, but shall be paid to and held by the Loan Trustee, as security for
the obligations of the Company under this Indenture, and at such time as there
shall not be continuing any such Indenture Event of Default or event, such
amount shall be paid to the Company, provided that if any such amount has been
so held by the Loan Trustee as security for more than 90 days after an
Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and during which period (i) the
Loan Trustee shall not have been limited by operation of law
<PAGE> 74
63

or otherwise from exercising remedies hereunder and (ii) the Loan Trustee shall
not have exercised any remedy available to it under Section 15 of this Article,
then such amount shall be paid to the Company.

(c) Reports, Etc. Annually upon renewal of the Company's insurance
coverage, the Company will furnish to the Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee
shall furnish to each Loan Participant) a report signed by a firm of
independent aircraft insurance brokers appointed by the Company, stating the
opinion of such firm that the insurance then carried and maintained on the
Aircraft complies with the terms hereof; provided that all information
contained in such report shall be held confidential by the Loan Trustee and
each Loan Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone
other than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal
counsel and any Person with whom any Loan Participant is in good faith
conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale of such Loan
Participant's Equipment Notes, if such Person shall have entered into an
agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(c) whereby such Person
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be required by
an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule,
regulation or order of any governmental authority. The Company will cause such
firm to advise the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee, in writing
promptly of any default in the payment of any premium and of any other act or
omission on the part of the Company of which such firm has knowledge and which
might invalidate or render unenforceable, in whole or in part, any insurance on
the Aircraft. The Company will also cause such firm to advise the Loan Trustee
and the Pass Through Trustee, in writing as promptly as practicable after such
firm acquires knowledge that an interruption or reduction of any insurance
carried and maintained on the Aircraft pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 11 will occur.

(d) Insurance for Own Account. Nothing in this Section 11 shall
limit or prohibit the Loan Trustee or the Company from obtaining insurance for
its own account with respect to the Airframe or any Engine and any proceeds
payable thereunder shall be payable as provided in the insurance policy
relating thereto, provided that (i) no such insurance may be obtained which
would limit or otherwise adversely affect the coverage or amounts payable under
insurance required to be maintained pursuant to this Section 11, it being
understood that all salvage rights to the
<PAGE> 75
64

Airframe or such Engine shall remain with the Company's insurers at all times,
and (ii) the Loan Trustee may obtain hull insurance on the Aircraft only to the
extent the procurement of such insurance does not have an adverse effect on the
Company's ability or cost to obtain such insurance, except that the limitation
in the foregoing clause (i) on the Loan Trustee's right to obtain liability
insurance shall not apply during any period in which the Company is providing a
Government indemnity in lieu of the liability insurance required by Section
11(a) of this Article and the limitations in clauses (i) and (ii) on the Loan
Trustee's rights to obtain hull insurance shall not apply during any period in
which the Company is providing a Government indemnity in lieu of the hull
insurance required by Section 11(b) of this Article.

Section 12. Inspection. At all reasonable times so long as any
Equipment Notes are outstanding, but upon at least 5 days' prior written notice
to the Company, the Loan Trustee or its authorized representatives may at their
own expense and risk (including, without limitation, any risk of personal
injury or death) conduct a visual walk-around inspection of the Aircraft and
any Engine and may inspect the books and records of the Company relating
thereto; provided that (a) such representative shall be fully insured to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Company at no cost to the Company with respect
to any risks incurred in connection with any such inspection, (b) any such
inspection shall be subject to the safety, security and workplace rules
applicable at the location where such inspection is conducted and any
applicable governmental rules or regulations and (c) in the case of an
inspection during a maintenance visit, such inspection shall not in any respect
interfere with the normal conduct of such maintenance visit or extend the time
required for such maintenance visit. All information obtained in connection
with any such inspection shall be held confidential by the Loan Trustee and
each Loan Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone
other than their accountants, agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom
any such Loan Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations relating to
the possible transfer and sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes if
such Person shall have entered into an agreement similar to that contained in
this Section 12 whereby such Person agrees to hold such information
confidential, and except as may be required by an order of any court or
administrative agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or order of any
governmental authority. Upon the Loan Trustee's request, the
<PAGE> 76
65

Company will notify the Loan Trustee of the next scheduled "heavy maintenance"
visit to be conducted by the Company in respect of the Aircraft; provided that
the Company shall have the right in its sole discretion to reschedule, or
change the location of, any maintenance visit of which it shall have notified
the Loan Trustee pursuant to this sentence, the Company hereby agreeing to use
reasonable efforts to notify the Loan Trustee of any such rescheduling or
change. The Loan Trustee shall not have any duty to make such inspection and
shall not incur any liability or obligation by reason of not making any such
inspection. No inspection pursuant to this Section 12 shall interfere with the
use, operation or maintenance of the Aircraft or the normal conduct of the
Company's business, and the Company shall not be required to undertake or incur
any additional liabilities in connection therewith.

Section 17. Further Assurances; Financial Information. Forthwith
upon the execution and delivery of each Trust Agreement and Indenture
Supplement, the Company will cause such Trust Agreement and Indenture
Supplement to be duly filed and recorded in accordance with the Federal
Aviation Act. In addition, the Company and the Loan Trustee will promptly and
duly execute and deliver to the other party hereto such further documents and
assurances and take such further action as such other party may from time to
time reasonably request in order to effectively carry out the intent and
purpose of this Indenture, including, without limitation, if requested by the
Loan Trustee, the execution and delivery of supplements or amendments hereto,
in recordable form, subjecting to this Indenture any Replacement Airframe or
Replacement Engine and the recording or filing of counterparts hereof or
thereof, in accordance with the laws of such jurisdictions as the Loan Trustee
may from time to time deem advisable; provided that this sentence is not
intended to impose upon the Company any additional liabilities not otherwise
contemplated by this Indenture. The Company agrees to furnish the Loan Trustee
(i) within 60 days after the end of each of the first three quarterly fiscal
periods in each fiscal year of the Company, a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries prepared by it as of the close of
such period, together with the related consolidated statements of income and
cash flows for such period, (ii) within 120 days after the close of each fiscal
year of the Company, a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the close of such fiscal year, together with
the related consolidated statements of
<PAGE> 77
66

income and cash flows for such fiscal year, as certified by independent public
accountants, (iii) within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year of the
Company, a certificate of the Company signed by a Responsible Officer of the
Company and addressed to the Loan Trustee to the effect that the signer has
reviewed the relevant terms of this Indenture and the Participation Agreement
and has made, or caused to be made under his supervision, a review of the
transactions and condition of the Company during the accounting period covered
by the financial statements referred to in clause (ii) above, and that such
review has not disclosed the existence during such accounting period, nor does
the signer have knowledge of the existence as at the date of such certificate,
of any condition or event which constitutes an Indenture Event of Default or
which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute an Indenture
Event of Default, or, if any such condition or event existed or exists,
specifying the nature and period of existence thereof and what action the
Company has taken or is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto, and
(iv) from time to time such other non-confidential information as the Loan
Trustee may reasonably request.

Section 24. Maintenance of Certain Engines. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, an aircraft engine which is not an Engine,
but which is installed on the Airframe, shall be maintained in accordance with
Section 7(a) of this Article.

Section 27. Company's Performance and Rights. Any obligation imposed
on the Company pursuant to Sections 7, 8, 11, 12 and 24 of this Article shall
require only that the Company perform or cause to be performed such obligation,
even if stated herein as a direct obligation, and the performance of any such
obligation by any permitted assignee, lessee or transferee under an assignment,
lease or transfer agreement then in effect shall constitute performance by the
Company and to the extent of such performance, discharge such obligation by the
Company. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any right granted to
the Company in this Indenture shall grant the Company the right to exercise
such right or permit such right to be exercised by any such assignee, lessee or
transferee; provided that no such assignee, lessee or transferee shall be
permitted to exercise the self-insurance rights of the Company set forth in
Section 11 of this Article. The inclusion of specific references to
obligations or rights of any such assignee, lessee or transferee in certain
provisions of this Indenture shall not
<PAGE> 78
67

in any way prevent or diminish the application of the provisions of the two
sentences immediately preceding with respect to obligations or rights in
respect of which specific reference to any such assignee, lessee or transferee
has not been made in this Indenture.

Section 28. Statement of Intention. The Loan Trustee, the Company
and the Owner Trustee acknowledge that the intent of the provisions contained
in this Article 15 is, following the termination of the Lease pursuant to
Section 9(e), 9(f) or 20(b) thereof, to provide for the Loan Trustee to have
rights similar to those enjoyed by the Owner Trustee under the Lease and for
the Company to have rights similar to those enjoyed by it under the Lease. The
Loan Trustee and the Company hereby agree that this Article 15 shall be
construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with the intent expressed in
this Section 28.

Section 29. Amendment of Exhibit to the Indenture. Each Equipment
Note issued after the Relevant Date shall be issued in substantially the form
set forth in Exhibit A to this Indenture as originally executed, provided that
the following legend shall be affixed to each such Equipment Note:

"Pursuant to Section 7.03 of the Trust Indenture and Security
Agreement, American Airlines, Inc. has assumed all of the obligations of the
Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture and Security Agreement and this
Equipment Note except such obligations as could necessarily be performed
exclusively by an entity acting in the capacity of the Owner Trustee."

immediately preceding sentence, at the option of the Loan Trustee or if
requested by the Company, any Equipment Note issued after the Relevant Date
shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit D-1 to this Indenture.

Section 30. General. Effective as of the Relevant Date the Company
assumes on a full recourse basis all of the duties and obligations of the Owner
Trustee under this Indenture and the Equipment Notes and shall be entitled to
all the rights and benefits of the Owner Trustee hereunder and thereunder, in
each case to the extent provided for in this Indenture, and the Owner Trustee
is, effective upon the Relevant Date, released from all duties, obligations and
rights under this Indenture and the Equipment Notes (other than any obligations
or liabilities of the Owner Trustee in
<PAGE> 79
68

its individual capacity incurred on or prior to the Relevant Date or arising
out of or based upon events occurring on or prior to the Relevant Date, which
obligations and liabilities shall remain the responsibility of the Owner
Trustee).

The Company confirms and ratifies the security interest which the
Owner Trustee granted to the Loan Trustee pursuant to the Granting Clause of
this Indenture in all of the Owner Trustee's right, title and interest in the
Aircraft and its interest in the Purchase Agreement (to the extent assigned to
the Owner Trustee pursuant to the Purchase Agreement Assignment) and the
Company explicitly agrees that the Company is acquiring the Aircraft subject to
such security interest, which shall remain in full force and effect until this
Indenture is discharged in accordance with the terms hereof, and the Loan
Trustee acknowledges that the Lease and the obligations of the Company
hereunder as Company have been terminated, except as specifically provided for
therein, and each of the Company and the Loan Trustee hereby agree that the
Granting Clause hereof shall, subject always to the provisions of Section 28 of
Article 15 hereof, be deemed to have been modified mutatis mutandis.

All provisions of the Indenture not specifically amended by operation
of this Exhibit D shall remain in full force and effect.

applicable laws which may affect the remedies provided for in
this Indenture, which laws, however, do not in the opinion of
such counsel make the remedies provided in this Indenture
inadequate for the practical realization of the rights and
benefits provided hereby.

reasonably satisfactory to it that the insurance provisions contained
in Section 11 of Article 15 hereof will have been complied with after

(H) Sections 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 and 8.04 thereof shall read as
follows:

Section 8.01. Indenture Events of Default. The following
events shall constitute "Indenture Events of Default" under this Indenture
(whether any such event shall be voluntary or involuntary or come about or be
effected by operation of law or pursuant to or in compliance with any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body) and each such Indenture Event of Default

due and payable; or

(b) the Company shall fail to carry and maintain insurance on
or with respect to the Aircraft in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11 of Article 15 hereof; provided that, in the case of
insurance with respect to which cancellation, change or lapse for
nonpayment of premium shall not be effective as to the Loan Trustee
for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as may from time to time
be customarily obtainable in the industry, in the case of any war risk
and allied perils coverage) after receipt of notice by the Loan
Trustee of such cancellation, change or lapse, no such failure to
carry and maintain insurance shall
<PAGE> 30

19

constitute an Indenture Event of Default hereunder until the earlier
of (i) the date such failure shall have continued unremedied for a
period of 20 days (five days in the case of any war risk and allied
perils coverage) after receipt by the Loan Trustee of the notice of

Participation Agreement and such failure shall continue unremedied for
a period of 30 days after written notice thereof has been given by the
Loan Trustee; provided that, if such failure is capable of being
remedied, so long as the Company is diligently proceeding to remedy
such failure, no such failure shall constitute an Event of Default
hereunder for a period of up to 365 days; or

(e) any material representation or warranty made by the
Company in the Participation Agreement or in the Purchase Agreement
(to the extent applicable to the Aircraft) or in any document or
certificate furnished by the Company in connection herewith or
therewith or pursuant hereto or thereto shall prove to have been
incorrect in any material respect at the time made and such
incorrectness shall continue to be material and shall continue
unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof has
been given by the Loan Trustee; or

(f) the Company shall consent to the appointment of a
receiver, trustee or liquidator of itself or of a substantial part of
its property or the Company shall admit in writing its inability to
pay its debts generally as they come due, or shall make a general
assignment for the benefit of creditors; or

for an agreement, composition, extension or adjustment with its
creditors; or

Federal bankruptcy laws or other insolvency laws, as now or hereafter
in effect, shall be filed and shall not be withdrawn or dismissed
within 90 days thereafter, or, under the provisions of any law
providing for reorganization or winding-up of corporations which may
apply to the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume
jurisdiction, custody or control of the Company or of any substantial
part of its property and such jurisdiction, custody or control shall
remain in force unrelinquished, unstayed or unterminated for a period
of 90 days;

provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Indenture, any failure of the Company to perform or observe any covenant,
condition, or agreement herein shall not constitute an Indenture Event of
Default if such failure is caused solely by reason of an event referred to in
the definition of "Event of Loss", so long as the Company is continuing to
comply with the applicable terms of Section 10 of Article 15 hereof.

Section 8.02. Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment. If an

<PAGE> 32

21

of all the Equipment Notes to be due and payable. Upon such declaration, the
principal of all Equipment Notes, together with accrued interest thereon from
the date in respect of which interest was last paid hereunder to the date
payment of such principal has been made or duly provided for shall be due and
payable immediately. At any time after such declaration and prior to the sale
or disposition of the Indenture Estate, the Loan Participants in a majority in
aggregate principal amount of all of the Outstanding Equipment Notes, by notice
to the Loan Trustee and the Company, may rescind such a declaration and thereby
annul its consequences if (i) an amount sufficient to pay all principal of,
premium, if any, and interest thereon, at the rate prescribed therefor in such
Equipment Note and interest due or past due, if any, in respect of the
Outstanding Equipment Notes plus all other amounts payable to the Loan
Participants, other than by reason of such acceleration, and all sums due and
payable to the Loan Trustee has been deposited with the Loan Trustee, (ii) the
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and (iii) all
existing Indenture Defaults and Indenture Events of Default under this
Indenture have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal of, premium,
if any, or interest on the Equipment Notes that has become due solely because
of such acceleration.

Section 8.03. Other Remedies Available to Loan Trustee. (a)
After an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and so long as the same
shall be continuing, then and in every such case the Loan Trustee, as trustee
of an express trust and as holder of a security interest in the Aircraft or
Engines or otherwise, may, at its option, declare this Indenture to be in
default by a written notice to the Company; and at any time thereafter, so long
as the Company shall not have remedied all outstanding Events of Default, the
Loan Trustee may do one or more of the following with respect to all or any
part of any Airframe or any Engines as the Loan Trustee in its sole discretion
shall elect, to the extent permitted by, and subject to compliance with any
mandatory requirements of, applicable law then in effect; provided, however,
that, during any period when the Aircraft is subject to the Civil Reserve Air
Fleet Program in accordance with the provisions of Section 7(b) of Article 15
hereof and in the possession of the United States government or an
instrumentality or agency thereof, and to the extent that any applicable law or
contractual provision covering the Aircraft so requires, the Loan Trustee shall
not, on account
<PAGE> 33

22

of any Indenture Event of Default, be entitled to do any of the following in
such manner as to limit the Company's control (or any lessee's control under
any lease permitted by the terms of Section 7(b) of Article 15 hereof) of any
Airframe or any Engines, unless at least 60 days' (or such lesser period as may
then be applicable under the Military Airlift Command Program of the United
States Government) prior written notice of default under this Indenture with
respect to the Company's obligations hereunder shall have been given by the
Loan Trustee by registered or certified mail to the Company (and, if
applicable, any such lessee) with a copy addressed to the Contracting Office
Representative for the Military Airlift Command of the United States Air Force
under any contract with the Company (or any such lessee) relating to the
Aircraft:

(i) cause the Company, upon the written demand of the Loan
Trustee and at the Company's expense, to return promptly, and the
Company shall return promptly, all or such part of any Airframe or any
Engine as the Loan Trustee may so demand to the Loan Trustee or its
order or the Loan Trustee, at its option, may enter upon the premises
where all or any part of such Airframe or any Engine are located and
take immediate possession of and remove the same (together with any
engine which is not an Engine but which is installed on the Airframe,
subject to all of the rights of the owner, lessor, lienor or secured
party of such engine; provided that the Airframe with an engine (which
is not an Engine) installed thereon may be flown or returned only to a
location within the continental United States, and such engine shall
be held for the account of any such owner, lessor, lienor or secured
party or, if owned by the Company, may, at the option of the Loan
Trustee, be exchanged with the Company for an Engine) all without
liability accruing to the Loan Trustee for or by reason of such entry
or taking of possession or removal, whether for the restoration of
damage to property caused by such taking or otherwise; or

(ii) sell all or any part of any Airframe and any Engine at
public or private sale, whether or not the Loan Trustee shall at the
time have possession thereof, as the Loan Trustee may determine, or
otherwise dispose of, hold, use, operate, lease to others or keep idle
all or any part of such Airframe or such Engine as the Loan Trustee,
in its sole discretion, may determine, all free
<PAGE> 34

23

and clear of any rights of the Company and without any duty to account
to the Company with respect to such action or inaction or for any
proceeds with respect thereto.

(b) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and Section 8.03(h), if an
Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Loan Trustee
may, if at the time such action may be lawful and always subject to compliance
with any mandatory legal requirements, either with or without taking
possession, and either before or after taking possession, and without
instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, and having first given notice of
such sale by registered mail to the Company once at least thirty days prior to
the date of such sale, and any other notice which may be required by law, sell
and dispose of the Indenture Estate, or any part thereof, or interest therein,
at public auction to the highest bidder, in one lot as an entirety or in
separate lots, and either for cash or on credit and on such terms as the Loan
Trustee may determine, and at any place (whether or not it be the location of
the Indenture Estate or any part thereof) and time designated in the notice
above referred to; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any provision
herein to the contrary, the Loan Trustee shall not sell any of the Indenture
Estate unless a declaration of acceleration has been made pursuant to Section
8.02. Any such sale or sales may be adjourned from time to time by
announcement at the time and place appointed for such sale or sales, or for any
such adjourned sale or sales, without further notice, and the Loan Trustee and
any Loan Participant may bid and become the purchaser at any such sale. The
Loan Trustee may exercise such right without possession or production of the
Equipment Notes or proof of ownership thereof, and as representative of the
Loan Participants may exercise such right without notice to the Loan
Participants or including the Loan Participants as parties to any suit or
proceeding relating to foreclosure of any property in the Indenture Estate.
The Company hereby irrevocably constitutes the Loan Trustee the true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of the Company (in the name of the Company or otherwise) for
the purpose of effectuating any sale, assignment, transfer or delivery for
enforcement of the Lien created under this Indenture, whether pursuant to
foreclosure or power of sale or otherwise, to execute and deliver all such
bills of sale, assignments and other instruments as the Loan Trustee may
consider necessary or appropriate, with full power of substitution, the Company
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney or any substitute shall
lawfully do by virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested
<PAGE> 35

24

by the Loan Trustee or any purchaser, the Company shall ratify and confirm any
such sale, assignment, transfer or delivery, by executing and delivering to the
Loan Trustee or such purchaser all bills of sale, assignments, releases and
other proper instruments to effect such ratification and confirmation as may be
designated in any such request.

(c) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), if an Indenture
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall, at the
request of the Loan Trustee, promptly execute and deliver to the Loan Trustee
such instruments of title or other documents as the Loan Trustee may deem
necessary or advisable to enable the Loan Trustee or an agent or representative
designated by the Loan Trustee, at such time or times and place or places as
the Loan Trustee may specify, to obtain possession of all or any part of the
Indenture Estate. If the Company shall for any reason fail to execute and
deliver such instruments and documents after such request by the Loan Trustee,
the Loan Trustee shall be entitled, in a proceeding to which the Company will
be a necessary party, to a judgment for specific performance of the covenants
contained in the foregoing sentence, conferring upon the Loan Trustee the right
to immediate possession and requiring the Company to execute and deliver such
instruments and documents to the Loan Trustee. The Loan Trustee shall also be
entitled to pursue all or any part of the Indenture Estate wherever it may be
found and may enter any of the premises of the Company or any other Person
wherever the Indenture Estate may be or is supposed to be and search for the
Indenture Estate and take possession of any item of the Indenture Estate
pursuant to this Section 8.03(c). The Loan Trustee may, from time to time, at
the expense of the Indenture Estate, make all such expenditures for
maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and
improvements to and of the Indenture Estate, as it may deem proper. In each
such case, the Loan Trustee shall have the right to use, operate, store, lease,
control or manage the Indenture Estate, and to exercise all rights and powers
of the Company relating to the Indenture Estate as the Loan Trustee shall deem
appropriate, including the right to enter into any and all such agreements with
respect to the use, operation, storage, leasing, control or management of the
Indenture Estate or any part thereof; and the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to
collect and receive directly all tolls, rents, issues, profits, products,
revenues and other income of the Indenture Estate and every part thereof,
without prejudice, however, to the right of the Loan Trustee under any
provision of this Indenture to collect and receive all
<PAGE> 36

25

cash held by, or required to be deposited with, the Loan Trustee hereunder. In
accordance with the terms of this Section 8.03(c), such tolls, rents, issues,
profits, products, revenues and other income shall be applied to pay the
expenses of using, operating, storing, leasing, controlling or managing the
Indenture Estate, and of all maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements,
alterations, additions and improvements, and to make all payments which the
Loan Trustee may be required or may elect to make, if any, for taxes,
assessments, insurance or other proper charges upon the Indenture Estate or any
part thereof (including the employment of engineers and accountants to examine,
inspect and make reports upon the properties and books and records of the
Company in accordance with this Section 8.03(c)), and all other payments which
the Loan Trustee may be required or authorized to make under any provision of
this Indenture, including this Section 8.03(c), as well as just and reasonable
compensation for the services of the Loan Trustee, and of all Persons properly
engaged and employed by the Loan Trustee.

If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing and
the Loan Trustee shall have obtained possession of or title to the Aircraft,
the Loan Trustee shall not be obligated to use or operate the Aircraft or cause
the Aircraft to be used or operated directly or indirectly by itself or through
agents or other representatives or to lease, license or otherwise permit or
provide for the use or operation of the Aircraft by any other Person unless (i)
the Loan Trustee shall have been able to obtain insurance in kinds, at rates
and in amounts satisfactory to it in its discretion to protect the Indenture
Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and individually, against any and all
liability for loss or damage to the Aircraft and for public liability and
property damage resulting from use or operation of the Aircraft and (ii) funds
are available in the Indenture Estate to pay for all such insurance or, in lieu
of such insurance, the Loan Trustee is furnished with indemnification from the
holders of the Equipment Notes or any other Person upon terms and in amounts
satisfactory to the Loan Trustee in its discretion to protect the Indenture
Estate and the Loan Trustee, as trustee and individually, against any and all
such liabilities.

(d) Subject to Section 8.03(e) and 8.03(h), the Loan Trustee
may proceed to protect and enforce this Indenture and the Equipment Notes by
suit or suits or proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy, and whether
<PAGE> 37

26

for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or
in execution or aid of any power herein granted; or for foreclosure hereunder,
or for the appointment of a receiver or receivers for the Indenture Estate or
any part thereof, or for the recovery of judgment for the indebtedness secured
by the Lien created under this Indenture or for the enforcement of any other
proper, legal or equitable remedy available under applicable law.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture to the
contrary, including, without limitation, Sections 8.03(b), 8.03(c) and 8.03(d),
so long as no Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Loan Trustee shall not take any action contrary to, or disturb, the
Company's rights to possession and use of, and quiet enjoyment of, the
Aircraft.

(f) Each and every right, power and remedy herein given to
the Loan Trustee specifically or otherwise in this Indenture shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to every other right, power and remedy
herein specifically given or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by
statute, and each and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein
given or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time and as often in
such order as may be deemed expedient by the Loan Trustee, and the exercise or
the beginning of the exercise of any power or remedy shall not be construed to
be a waiver of the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter any other
right, power or remedy. No delay or omission by the Loan Trustee in the
exercise of any right, remedy or power or in pursuing any remedy shall impair
any such right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default
on the part of the Company or to be an acquiescence therein.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any
payment of principal of any Equipment Note shall not be made when and as the
same shall become due and payable, or if any payment of interest on any
Equipment Note shall not be made when and as the same shall become due and
payable, and such failure shall continue for the period prescribed in Section
8.01(a), the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to recover judgment, in its own
name and as trustee of an express trust, upon the Equipment Note for the whole
amount of such principal or interest, as the case may be, remaining unpaid.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, so long as the
Pass Through Trustee is the registered holder of
<PAGE> 38

27

any Equipment Note hereunder, the Loan Trustee is not authorized or empowered
to acquire title to all or any portion of the Indenture Estate or take any
action with respect to all or any portion of the Indenture Estate so acquired
by it if such acquisition or action would cause any Pass Through Trust to fail
to qualify as a "grantor trust" for Federal income tax purposes.

Section 8.04. Waiver of Company. To the extent now or at any
time hereafter enforceable under applicable law, the Company covenants that it
will not at any time insist upon or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or
take any benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law now or at any time
hereafter in force, nor claim, take nor insist upon any benefit or advantage of
or from any law now or hereafter in force providing for the valuation or
appraisement of the Indenture Estate or any part thereof, prior to any sale or
sales thereof to be made pursuant to any provision herein contained, or to the
decree, judgment or order of any court of competent jurisdiction; nor, after
such sale or sales, claim or exercise any right under any statute now or
hereafter made or enacted by any state or otherwise to redeem the property so
sold or any part thereof, and hereby expressly waives for itself and on behalf
of each and every Person, except decree or judgment creditors of the Company
acquiring any interest in or title to the Indenture Estate or any part thereof
subsequent to the date of this Indenture, all benefit and advantage of any such
law or laws, and covenants that it will not invoke or utilize any such law or
laws or otherwise hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein
granted and delegated to the Loan Trustee, but will suffer and permit the
execution of every such power as though no such law or laws had been made or
enacted.

The Loan Trustee may maintain such a proceeding even if it
does not possess any of the Equipment Notes or does not produce any of them in
the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Loan Trustee or any Loan
Participant in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Indenture Event
of Default under this Indenture shall not impair the right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in such Indenture Event of Default.

(I) Section 9.11 thereof shall read as follows:

Section 9.11. Assumption of Certain Obligations.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, any reference
in this Article 9 to the Owner Trustee
<PAGE> 39

the Company or to an obligation of the Company, as the case may be, any
reference to "Lease Event of Default" shall be deemed to be a reference to an
"Indenture Event of Default", all provisions requiring notices to the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant shall be deemed to be deleted for the purposes
of this Article 9 and any provision in this Article 9 requiring the action or
consent of the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to require the action or approval

the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified
public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof

Equipment Notes on the dates such payments of principal or interest
are due (including as a result of redemption in respect of which
irrevocable notice has been given to the Loan Trustee on or prior to

provided further that, upon the making of the deposit referred to
above in clause (A), the right of the Company to cause the redemption
of Equipment Notes (except redemption in respect of which irrevocable
notice has theretofore been given) shall terminate;

changed as provided herein and therein; and the Loan Trustee will
cooperate with the Company in effecting such foreign registration;
<PAGE> 50

(ii) maintain, service, repair, overhaul and test the Aircraft in
accordance with a maintenance program (as approved by the Federal
Aviation Administration) for Boeing 757-200 series aircraft (or, at
the Company's option, (x) in the event that the Aircraft is
re-registered in another jurisdiction pursuant to Section 7(a)(i) of
this Article, in accordance with an aircraft maintenance program
approved by the central civil aviation authority of the jurisdiction
of such registration or (y) in the event of any lease to a foreign air
carrier in accordance with Section 7(b)(ix) of this Article, approved
by the central civil aviation authority of one of the jurisdictions
specified in clause (y) of such Section 7(b)(ix)) and in the same
manner and with the same care used by the Company with respect to
comparable aircraft and engines owned or operated by the Company and
utilized in similar circumstances so as to keep the Aircraft in as
good operating condition as when delivered to the Company by the
Manufacturer, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in such condition
as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of the
Aircraft to be maintained in good standing at all times (other than
during temporary periods of storage in accordance with applicable
regulations or during periods of grounding by applicable governmental
authorities, except where such periods of grounding are the result of
the failure by the Company to maintain the Aircraft as otherwise
required herein) under the Federal Aviation Act or, if the Aircraft is
registered under the laws of any other jurisdiction, the laws of such
jurisdiction and in compliance with all applicable manufacturer's
alert service bulletins;

(iii) maintain, in the English language, all records logs and
other materials required by the appropriate authorities in the
jurisdiction where the Aircraft is registered to be maintained in
respect of the Aircraft; and

(iv) promptly furnish to the Loan Trustee such information as may
be required to enable the Loan Trustee to file any reports, returns or
statements required to be filed by the Loan Trustee with any
governmental authority because of the Loan Trustee's interest in the
Aircraft.

The Company agrees that the Aircraft will not be maintained,
used or operated in violation of any law or any
<PAGE> 51

40

rule, regulation or order of any government or governmental authority having
jurisdiction (domestic or foreign), or in violation of any airworthiness
certificate, license or registration relating to the Aircraft issued by any
such authority; provided that the Company shall not be in default under this
sentence if it is not possible for it to comply with the laws of a jurisdiction
other than the United States (or other than any jurisdiction in which the
Aircraft is then registered) because of a conflict with the applicable laws of
the United States (or such jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is then
registered). In the event that any such law, rule, regulation or order
requires alteration of the Aircraft, the Company will conform thereto or obtain
conformance therewith at no expense to the Loan Trustee and will maintain the
Aircraft in proper operating condition under such laws, rules, regulations and
orders; provided, however, that the Company may, in good faith, contest the
validity or application of any such law, rule, regulation or order in any
reasonable manner which does not materially adversely affect the Loan Trustee,
the Aircraft, the Loan Participants or the Lien of this Indenture. The Company
also agrees not to operate or locate the Aircraft, or suffer the Aircraft to be
operated or located, (i) in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance
required by the terms of Section 11 of this Article, except in the case of a
requisition for use by any Government where the Company obtains indemnity
pursuant to Section 11 of this Article in lieu of such insurance from such
Government against the risks and in the amounts required by Section 11 of this
Article covering such area, or (ii) in any war zone or recognized or, in the
Company's judgment, threatened area of hostilities unless covered by war risk
insurance in accordance with Section 11 of this Article, but only so long as
the same remains in effect while the Aircraft is so operated or located, or
unless the Aircraft is operated or used under contract with any Government
entered into pursuant to Section 11 of this Article, under which contract such
Government assumes liability for any damage, loss, destruction or failure to
return possession of the Aircraft at the end of the term of such contract or
for injury to persons or damage to property of others.

(b) Possession. The Company will not, without the prior
written consent of the Loan Trustee, lease or otherwise in any manner deliver,
transfer or relinquish possession of the Airframe or any Engine or install any
Engine, or permit any Engine to be installed, on any airframe other than the
Airframe; provided that, so long as no Indenture Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, and so long as 
<PAGE> 52

41

the action to be taken shall not deprive the Loan Trustee of the perfected lien
of this Indenture on the Airframe or (subject to subclause (B) of the "provided
further" clause to subsection (i) of this Section 7(b)) any Engine, and in any
event, so long as the Company shall comply with the provisions of Section 11,
the Company may, without the prior consent of the Loan Trustee:

(i) subject the Airframe to normal interchange agreements or any
Engine to normal interchange or pooling agreements or arrangements in
each case customary in the airline industry and entered into by the
Company in the ordinary course of its business with any other United
States air carrier as to which there is in force a certificate issued
pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act or any successor
provision that gives like authority or with any "foreign air carrier"
(as such term is defined in such Act) as to which there is in force a
permit issued pursuant to Section 402 of said Act (any such United
States certificated air carrier and any such foreign air carrier being
hereinafter called a "Permitted Air Carrier"); provided that no
transfer of the registration of such Airframe shall be effected in
connection therewith; and provided, further, that (A) no such
agreement or arrangement contemplates or requires the transfer of
title to the Airframe and (B) if the Company's title to any such
Engine shall be divested under any such agreement or arrangement, such
divestiture shall be deemed to be an Event of Loss with respect to
such Engine and the Company shall comply with Section 10(b) of this
Article in respect thereof;

(ii) deliver possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the
manufacturer thereof for testing or other similar purposes or to any
organization for service, repair, maintenance or overhaul work on the
Airframe or such Engine or any part thereof or for alterations or
modifications in or additions to the Airframe or such Engine to the
extent required or permitted by the terms of Section 7(a) or 8(c) of
this Article;

(iii) transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the
United States of America or any instrumentality or agency thereof
pursuant to a sublease, contract or other instrument, a copy of which
shall be furnished to the Loan Trustee;

(iv) transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the
United States of America or any
<PAGE> 53

42

instrumentality or agency thereof in accordance with applicable laws,
rulings, regulations or orders (including, without limitation, the
Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program authorized under 10 U.S.C. Section
9511 et seq. or any substantially similar program);

(v) install an Engine on an airframe owned by the Company free
and clear of all Liens, except (A) those of the type permitted under
clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of Section 6 of this
Article and those which apply only to the engines (other than
Engines), appliances, parts, instruments, appurtenances, accessories,
furnishings and other equipment (other than Parts) installed on such
airframe (but not to the airframe as an entirety) and (B) the rights
of other Permitted Air Carriers under normal interchange agreements
which are customary in the airline industry and do not contemplate,
permit or require the transfer of title to the airframe or engines
installed thereon;

(vi) install an Engine on an airframe leased to the Company or
owned by the Company subject to a conditional sale or other security
agreement; provided that (A) such airframe is free and clear of all
Liens except the rights of the parties to the lease or conditional
sale or other security agreement covering such airframe and except
Liens of the type permitted by clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (v)
of this paragraph of Section 7(b) of this Article and (B) the Company
shall have obtained from the lessor or secured party of such airframe
a written agreement (which may be the lease or conditional sale or
other security agreement covering such airframe), in form and
substance satisfactory to the Loan Trustee (it being understood that
an agreement from such lessor or secured party substantially in the
form of the final sentence of the penultimate paragraph of this
Section 7(b) of this Article shall be deemed to be satisfactory to the
Loan Trustee), whereby such lessor or secured party expressly agrees
that neither it nor its successors or assigns will acquire or claim
any right, title or interest in any Engine by reason of such Engine
being installed on such airframe at any time while such Engine is
subject to the lien of the Trust Indenture;

(vii) install an Engine on an airframe owned by the Company,
leased to the Company or owned by the Company subject to a conditional
sale or other security agreement under circumstances where neither
subparagraph (v) nor
<PAGE> 54

43

subparagraph (vi) of this Section 7(b) of this Article is applicable;
provided that such installation shall be deemed an Event of Loss with
respect to such Engine and the Company shall comply with Section 10(b)
of this Article in respect thereof, the Loan Trustee not intending
hereby to waive any right or interest it may have to or in such Engine
under applicable law until compliance by the Company with such Section
10(b) of this Article;

(viii) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or engines then
installed on the Airframe to any United States air carrier as to which
there is in force a certificate issued pursuant to Section 401 of the
Federal Aviation Act or successor provision that gives like authority;

(ix) lease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or engines then
installed on the Airframe to (A) any foreign air carrier that is
principally based in and a domiciliary of a country (other than Cuba,
El Salvador, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Libya) that is at the inception
of the lease a party to the Mortgage Convention, or (B) any foreign
air carrier that is principally based in and a domiciliary of a
country listed in Schedule I hereto, or (C) any foreign air carrier
not described in clause (A) or (B) above; provided that (w) in the
case only of a lease to a foreign air carrier under clause (C) above,
the Loan Trustee receives at the time of such lease an opinion of
counsel to the Company (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory
to the Loan Trustee to the effect that (a) the terms of the lease and
the Operative Documents are legal, valid, binding and enforceable in
the country in which such air carrier is principally based, to
substantially the same extent as the Operative Documents are at that
time enforceable in the United States, (b) it is not necessary for the
Loan Trustee to qualify to do business in such country solely as a
result of the proposed lease, (c) there is no tort liability of the
Loan Trustee as a result of the Lien of this Indenture under the laws
of such country other than tort liability no more extensive or onerous
than that which might have been imposed on the Loan Trustee under the
laws of the United States or any state thereof (it being understood
that, in the event such opinion cannot be given in a form satisfactory
to the Loan Trustee, such opinion shall be waived if insurance
reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee is provided by the
<PAGE> 55

44

Company to cover the risk of such liability), (d) the laws of such
country require fair compensation by the government of such country
for the loss of the use of the Aircraft in the event of the
requisition by such government of the Aircraft (unless the Company
shall have agreed to provide insurance reasonably satisfactory to the
Loan Trustee covering the risk of requisition of use of the Aircraft
by the government of such jurisdiction so long as the aircraft is
leased in such country), and (e) there exist no possessory rights in
favor of such lessee under the laws of such country which would, upon
bankruptcy of or other default by the Company or the lessee, prevent
the return of such Engine or the Airframe and such Engine or engine to
the Loan Trustee in accordance with and when permitted by the terms of
this Indenture upon the exercise by the Loan Trustee of its remedies
under this Indenture, (x) in the case only of a lease to a foreign air
carrier under clause (C) above, the Loan Trustees receives assurances
reasonably satisfactory to it that the currency of such country is
freely convertible into U.S. Dollars (unless the Company shall have
agreed to provide the requisition insurance described in subclause (d)
of clause (w) above,), (y) in the case of any lease to a foreign air
carrier, either the lease, or an arrangement existing between the
Company, the lessee and/or one or more third parties that provide
maintenance services, provides that the Aircraft will be maintained,
serviced, repaired, overhauled and tested in accordance with
maintenance standards for Boeing 757-200 series aircraft approved by,
or substantially similar to those approved or required by, the Federal
Aviation Administration or the central civil aviation authority of any
of Brazil, Canada, France, The Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland or the United Kingdom and
(z) in the case of any lease to a foreign air carrier (other than a
foreign air carrier principally based in Taiwan) the United States of
America maintains diplomatic relations with the country in which such
foreign air carrier is principally based at the time such lease is
entered into;

provided that the rights of any transferee who receives possession by reason of
a transfer permitted by this Section 7(b) (other than the transfer of an Engine
which is deemed an Event of Loss) shall be subject and subordinate to, and any
lease permitted by this Section 7(b) shall be made expressly subject and
subordinate to, all the terms of this Indenture, including, without limitation,
the Loan Trustee's rights to repossession pursuant to Article 8 hereof and to
avoid such
<PAGE> 56

45

lease upon such repossession and the Loan Trustee's rights to possession
pursuant to Section 8.03 of this Indenture, and the Company shall in all events
remain primarily liable hereunder for the performance and observance of all of
the terms and conditions of this Indenture to the same extent as if such lease
or transfer had not occurred, and any such lease shall include appropriate
provisions for the maintenance (subject to clause (y) of the proviso to Section
7(b)(ix) of this Article) and insurance of the Aircraft. The Company shall not
lease the Aircraft to an air carrier that at the inception of the lease is
subject to bankruptcy proceedings unless the lease shall have been approved by
the receiver, liquidator, conservator, court or other governmental or
administrative authority or entity responsible for the adjudication or
administration of such proceedings. No interchange agreement, pooling
agreement, lease or other relinquishment of possession of the Airframe or any
Engine shall in any way discharge or diminish any of the Company's obligations
to the Loan Trustee hereunder or under the Participation Agreement. With the
prior written consent of the Loan Trustee, the Company may sublease the
Airframe or Engines in connection with a transaction that involves such a
sublease commencing at the inception of the transaction. The Loan Trustee
hereby agrees, for the benefit of the lessor or secured party of any airframe
leased by the Company or owned by the Company subject to a conditional sale or
other security agreement, that the Loan Trustee will not acquire or claim, as
against such lessor or secured party, any right, title or interest in any
engine or engines owned by the lessor under such lease or subject to a security
interest in favor of the secured party under such conditional sale or other
security agreement as the result of such engine or engines being installed on
the Airframe at any time while such engine or engines are subject to such lease
or conditional sale or other security agreement.

The Loan Trustee acknowledges that any "wet lease" or other
similar arrangement under which the Company maintains operational control of
the Aircraft shall not constitute a delivery, transfer or relinquishment of
possession for purposes of this Section 7(b).

(c) Insignia. The Company agrees to at all times maintain in
the cockpit of the Airframe adjacent to the airworthiness certificate therein
and (if not prevented by applicable law or regulations or by any governmental
authority) on each Engine a nameplate bearing the inscription "STATE STREET
BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CONNECTICUT, NATIONAL
<PAGE> 57

46

ASSOCIATION, AS LOAN TRUSTEE, MORTGAGEE" (such nameplate to be replaced, if
necessary, with a nameplate reflecting the name of any successor Loan Trustee).

Section 8. Replacement and Pooling of Parts; Alterations,
Modifications and Additions. (a) Replacement of Parts. The Company, at its
own cost and expense, will promptly replace all Parts which may from time to
time be incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine
and which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed,
seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or rendered permanently unfit for
use for any reason whatsoever, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of
this Article. In addition, the Company may, at its own cost and expense,
remove in the ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or
testing, any Parts, whether or not worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized,
confiscated, damaged beyond repair or rendered permanently unfit for use;
provided that the Company, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c) of this
Article, will, at its own cost and expense, replace such Parts as promptly as
possible. All replacement Parts shall be free and clear of all Liens (except
for pooling arrangements to the extent permitted by Section 8(b) of this
Article and Permitted Liens) and shall be in as good operating condition as,
and shall have a value and utility at least equal to, the Parts replaced,
assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition and repair required to be
maintained by the terms hereof. All Parts at any time removed from the
Airframe or any Engine shall remain subject to the Lien of this Indenture, no
matter where located, until such time as such Parts shall be replaced by Parts
which have been incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or
such Engine and which meet the requirements for replacement Parts specified
above. Immediately upon any replacement Part becoming incorporated or
installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine as above provided
without further act, (i) title to the replaced Part shall thereupon be free and
clear of all rights of the Loan Trustee, and shall no longer be deemed a Part
hereunder, (ii) title to such replacement Part shall thereupon be subject to
the Lien of this Indenture, free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted
Liens) and (iii) such replacement Part shall become subject to this Indenture
and be deemed part of the Airframe or such Engine for all purposes to the same
extent as the Parts originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the
Airframe or such Engine.

(b) Pooling of Parts. Any Part removed from the Airframe or
any Engine as provided in Section 8(a) of this
<PAGE> 58

47

Article may be subjected by the Company to a normal pooling arrangement
customary in the airline industry entered into in the ordinary course of the
Company's business with Permitted Air Carriers; provided that the Part
replacing such removed Part shall be incorporated or installed in or attached
to the Airframe or such Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article
as promptly as practicable after the removal of such removed Part. In
addition, any replacement Part, when incorporated or installed in or attached
to the Airframe or any Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article,
may be owned by a Permitted Air Carrier subject to such a normal pooling
arrangement; provided that the Company, at its expense, as promptly thereafter
as is practicable, either (i) causes title to such replacement Part to vest in
the Company free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens, at which time
such replacement Part shall, in accordance with Section 8(a) of this Article
become a Part and become subject to the Lien of this Indenture or (ii) replaces
such replacement part by incorporating or installing in or attaching to the
Airframe or such Engine a further replacement Part owned by the Company free
and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), which shall without
further act be subject to the Lien of this Indenture.

(c) Alterations, Modifications and Additions. The Company, at
its own expense, will make such alterations and modifications in and additions
to the Airframe and the Engines as may be required from time to time to meet
the standards of the Federal Aviation Administration or other governmental
authority having jurisdiction in any country in or over which the Aircraft is
flown; provided, however, that the Company may, in good faith, contest the
validity or application of any such standard in any reasonable manner which
does not materially adversely affect the Loan Trustee or the Lien of this
Indenture, but only so long as such proceedings do not involve any material
danger of criminal liability or material danger of civil liability to the Loan
Trustee, or a material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Aircraft
or any Engine or any interest therein. In addition, the Company, at its own
expense, may from time to time make or cause to be made such alterations and
modifications in and additions to the Airframe or any Engine as the Company may
deem desirable in the proper conduct of its business, including, without
limitation, removal or Parts; provided that no such alterations, modification,
addition or removal shall materially diminish the value or utility of the
Airframe or such Engine or of the Aircraft, or materially impair the condition
or airworthiness thereof,
<PAGE> 59

48

below the value, utility, condition and airworthiness thereof immediately prior
to such alternation, modification, addition or removal assuming the Airframe or
such Engine was then of the value and utility and in the condition and
airworthiness required to be maintained by the terms of this Indenture, except
that the value (but not the utility, condition or airworthiness) of the
Aircraft may be reduced by the value of Parts which the Company deems obsolete
or no longer suitable or appropriate for use in the Airframe or any Engine
which shall have been removed, if the aggregate value of such obsolete or
unsuitable Parts removed from the Aircraft and not replaced shall not exceed
$500,000. All Parts incorporated or installed in or attached or added to the
Airframe or any Engine as the result of such alteration, modification or
addition shall, with our further act, be subject to the Lien of this Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, at any time, remove any Part;
provided that (i) such Part is in addition to, and not in replacement of or
substitution for, any Part originally incorporated or installed in or attached
to the Airframe or such Engine at the time of delivery thereof under the Lease
or hereunder or any Part in replacement of, or substitution for, any such Part,
(ii) such Part is not required to be incorporated or installed in or attached
or added to such Airframe or Engine pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 8(c), and (iii) such Part can be removed from the Airframe or such
Engine without materially diminishing or impairing the value, utility,
condition or airworthiness required to be maintained by the terms of this
Indenture which the Airframe or such Engine would have had at such time had
such removal not occurred. Upon the removal by the Company of any Part as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, or the removal of any obsolete
or unsuitable part permitted by this Section 8(c), such Part shall not longer
be deemed part of the Airframe or the Engine from which it was removed and
shall no longer be subject to the Lien of this Indenture. Any such Part not
removed by the Company as provided in Section 8(c)(iii) of this Article shall
remain subject to the Lien of this Indenture.

Section 10. Loss, Destruction, Requisition, Etc. (a) Event
of Loss with Respect to an Airframe. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss
with respect to the Airframe, the Company shall forthwith (and, in any event,
within 30 days after such occurrence) give the Loan Trustee written notice of
such Event of Loss and of its election to perform one of the following options
(it being agreed that if the Company shall not have given notice of such
election within
<PAGE> 60

49

such 30 days after such occurrence, the Company shall be deemed to have elected
to perform the option set forth in the following clause (ii)):

(i) as promptly as practicable, and in any event on or before
the Business Day next preceding the 121st day next following the date
of occurrence of such Event of Loss, in replacement for the Airframe,
the Company shall convey or cause to be conveyed to the Loan Trustee a
security interest in and to one or more Replacement Airframes
(together with the same number of Replacement Engines as the Engines,
if any, installed on the Airframe at the time such Event of Loss
occurred), such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines to be
duly certificated as airworthy by the central aviation authority of
the jurisdiction of the registry of such Replacement Airframes and
Engines, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), to
have a value and utility at least equal to, and to be in as good
operating condition as, the Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced
(assuming such Airframe and Engines were in the condition and repair
required by the terms of this Indenture); provided that, if the
Company shall not perform its obligation to effect such replacement
under this clause (i) during the period of time provided herein, then
the Company shall promptly give notice to the Loan Trustee and shall
pay on the Business Day next following the thirtieth day after the end
of such period to the Loan Trustee, in U.S. currency, the amounts
specified in clause (ii) below; or

(ii) on or before the Loss Payment Date (as defined below) the
Company shall pay to the Loan Trustee an amount in cash which is
sufficient to redeem each Outstanding Equipment Note pursuant to
Section 6.01; provided that the Company may, to the extent provided
and in accordance with Section 3.08 hereof, surrender, to the Loan
Trustee for cancellation Equipment Notes held by the Company and in
such event the Company shall be entitled to a credit against amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this clause (ii). As used herein, "Loss
Payment Date" means the earliest of (x) 30 days following the date on
which insurance proceeds are received with respect to such Event of
Loss, (y) the Business Day next following the 121st day next following
the date of occurrence of the Event of Loss and (z) a Business Day
irrevocably specified by the Company at least thirty days in advance
by notice to the Loan Trustee; provided, however, the
<PAGE> 61

50

Loss Payment Date shall be the date specified in the proviso to clause
(i) above if applicable.

Upon compliance by the Company with the requirements of this Section 10(a)(ii),
the Loan Trustee shall execute such instruments as may be reasonably requested
by the Company releasing the Airframe and Engines from the Lien of this
Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement
Assignment from the assignment and pledge thereof hereunder.

At the time of or prior to any replacement of the Airframe and
such Engines pursuant to Section 10(a)(i) of this Article, if any, the Company,
at its own expense, will (A) cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto for such Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, to be delivered to the Loan Trustee for execution
and, upon such execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal
Aviation Act or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of the
jurisdiction other than the United States of America in which such Replacement
Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if any, are to be registered in accordance
with Section 7(a) of this Article, as the case may be, (B) cause a financing
statement or statements with respect to the Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, or other requisite documents or instruments, to be
filed in such place or places as necessary or advisable in order to perfect the
security interest therein created by or pursuant to this Indenture, or, if
necessary or advisable, pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in
which such Replacement Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if any, are to be
registered in accordance with Section 7(a) of this Article, as the case may be,
(C) furnish the Loan Trustee with a certificate of an independent aircraft
engineer or appraiser reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee certifying
that the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, have a value and
utility at least equal to, and are in as good operating condition as, the
Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced assuming the Airframe and Engines
were in the condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior
to the occurrence of such Event of Loss, (D) furnish the Loan Trustee with (i)
such evidence of compliance with the insurance provisions of Section 11 of this
Article with respect to such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines as
the Loan Trustee may reasonably request and (ii) a certificate from a
Responsible Officer of the Company certifying that at the time of such
<PAGE> 62

51

replacement, there is no continuing Indenture Event of Default, (E) furnish the
Loan Trustee with an opinion of the Company's counsel (which may be the
Company's General Counsel) addressed to the Loan Trustee that the substituted
property will be subject to the Lien of the this Indenture and the Loan Trustee
should be entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, with respect to the Replacement Airframe,
provided that (x) such opinion need not be delivered to the extent that the
benefits of such Section 1110 were not, by reason of a change in law or
governmental interpretation thereof, available to the Loan Trustee with respect
to the Aircraft immediately prior to such substitution and (y) such opinion may
contain qualifications of the tenor contained in the opinion of Debevoise &
Plimpton delivered pursuant to Section 4(J) of the Participation Agreement on
the Delivery Date. In the case of each Replacement Airframe and each
Replacement Engine, if any, in which a security interest has been granted to
the Loan Trustee under this Section 10, and each Replacement Engine, if any, in
which a security interest has been granted to the Loan Trustee under this
Section 10, promptly upon the recordation of the Trust Agreement and Indenture
Supplement covering such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any,
or such Replacement Engine pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act (or pursuant to
the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which such Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, or such Replacement Engine, are registered in
accordance with Section 7(a) of this Article), the Company will cause to be
delivered to the Loan Trustee a favorable opinion of counsel to the Company as
to the due registration of such Replacement Aircraft, the due recordation of
such Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement or other requisite documents or
instruments and the validity and perfection of the security interest in the
Replacement Airframe, Replacement Engines or Replacement Engine, as the case
may be, granted to the Loan Trustee under this Indenture.

For all purposes hereof, upon grant of a security interest
therein to the Loan Trustee, each Replacement Aircraft and the Replacement
Engines, if any, shall be deemed part of the property secured hereunder; each
such Replacement Airframe shall be deemed an "Airframe" as defined herein, and
each such Replacement Engine shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein.
Upon full compliance with the terms of the previous paragraph, the Loan Trustee
shall execute and deliver to the Company an appropriate instrument releasing
such replaced airframe and engines (if any) installed thereon at the time such
Event of Loss occurred from the Lien of this
<PAGE> 63

52

Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement
Assignment from the assignment and pledge hereunder.

(b) Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under circumstances in
which there has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe, the
Company shall give the Loan Trustee prompt written notice thereof and shall,
within 90 days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, convey or cause to
be conveyed to the Loan Trustee, as replacement for the Engine with respect to
which such Event of Loss occurred, a security interest in and to a Replacement
Engine free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and having a
value and utility at least equal to, and being in as good operating condition
as, the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, assuming such
Engine was of the value and utility and in the condition and repair required by
the terms hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss.
Prior to or at the time of any such conveyance, the Company, at its own
expense, will (i) cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement
substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto or other requisite documents or
instruments for such Replacement Engine to be delivered to the Loan Trustee for
execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the
Federal Aviation Act or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of such
jurisdiction other than the United States of America in which the Aircraft is
or is to be registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the case may be,
(ii) furnish the Loan Trustee with a certificate of an aircraft engineer or
appraiser (who may be an employee of the Company) certifying that such
Replacement Engine has a value and utility at least equal to, and is in as good
operating condition as, the Engine so replaced, assuming such Engine was in the
condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior to the
occurrence of such Event of Loss and (iii) cause a financing statement or
statements with respect to the Replacement Engine or other requisite documents
or instruments to be filed in such place or places necessary or advisable in
order to perfect the security interest in the Replacement Engine created by or
pursuant to this Indenture or, if necessary or advisable, pursuant to the
applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is or is to be
registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the case may be, and (iv)
furnish the Loan Trustee with such evidence of compliance with the insurance
provisions of Section 11 of this Article with respect to such Replacement
Engine as the
<PAGE> 64

53

Loan Trustee may reasonably request, and (v) furnish the Loan Trustee with an
opinion of the Company's counsel (which may be the Company's General Counsel)
addressed to the Loan Trustee to the effect that such substituted property will
be subjected to the Lien of this Indenture. Upon full compliance by the
Company with the terms of this paragraph (b), the Loan Trustee will transfer to
the Company, without recourse or warranty (except as to the Trustee's Liens),
all of Loan Trustee's right, title and interest in and to the Engine with
respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, and Loan Trustee will assign to
or as directed by the Company all claims of Loan Trustee against third Persons
relating to such Engine arising from such Event of Loss. In addition, upon
such transfer the Loan Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Company an
appropriate instrument releasing such Engine from the Lien of this Indenture
and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment (in
respect of such Engine) from the assignment and pledge under this Indenture.
For all purposes hereof, each such Replacement Engine shall, after such
conveyance, be deemed part of the property secured hereunder and shall be
deemed an "Engine" as defined herein.

(c) Application of Payments from Governmental Authorities for
Requisition of Title or Use. Any payments (other than insurance proceeds the
application of which is provided for in Section 11 of this Article) received at
any time by the Loan Trustee or by the Company from any governmental authority
or other Person with respect to an Event of Loss resulting from the
condemnation, confiscation, theft or seizure of, or requisition of title to or
use of, the Airframe or any Engine, other than a requisition for use by any
Government or by the government of registry of the Aircraft not constituting an
Event of Loss, will be applied as follows:

(i) if such payments are received with respect to the Airframe
or the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on the Airframe
that has been or is being replaced by the Company pursuant to Section
10(a) of this Article, such payments shall be paid over to, or
retained by, the Loan Trustee, and upon completion of such replacement
be paid over to, or retained by, the Company;

(ii) if such payments are received with respect to the Airframe
or the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on the Airframe
that has not been and will not be replaced pursuant to Section 10(a)
of this Article,
<PAGE> 65

54

such payments shall, after reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs
and expenses, be applied in reduction of the Company's obligation to
pay the amounts required to be paid by the Company pursuant to Section
10(a) of this Article, if not already paid by the Company, or, if
already paid by the Company, shall be applied to reimburse the Company
for its payment of such amounts, and the balance, if any, of such
payments remaining thereafter shall be paid over to, and retained by,
the Company; and

(iii) if such payments are received with respect to an Engine
under circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b) of this Article, so
much of such payments remaining after reimbursement of the Loan
Trustee for costs and expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by,
the Company; provided that the Company shall have fully performed the
terms of Section 10(b) of this Article with respect to the Event of
Loss for which such payments are made.

(d) Requisition for Use by the Government of the Airframe and
the Engines Installed Thereon. In the event of the requisition for use by any
Government or by the government of the country of registry of the Aircraft
(including for this purpose any agency or instrumentality thereof), including,
without limitation, pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program referred to
in Section 7(b)(iv) of this Article of the Airframe and the Engines or engines
installed on the Airframe, the Company shall promptly notify the Loan Trustee
of such requisition and, except as otherwise provided in this Indenture, such
requisition shall not constitute an Event of Loss and all of the Company's
obligations under this Indenture with respect to the Aircraft shall continue to
the same extent as if such requisition had not occurred unless or until such
requisition shall constitute an Event of Loss. All payments received by the
Loan Trustee or the Company from the Government or government for the use of
the Airframe and Engines or engines prior to the occurrence of an Event of Loss
shall be paid over to, or retained by, the Company.

(e) Requisition for Use by the Government of an Engine. In
the event of the requisition for use by any Government or by the government of
the country of registry of the Aircraft (including for this purpose any agency
or instrumentality thereof) of any Engine (but not the Airframe), the Company
will replace such Engine hereunder by
<PAGE> 66

55

complying with the terms of Section 10(b) of this Article to the same extent as
if an Event of Loss had occurred with respect to such Engine, and any payments
received by the Loan Trustee or the Company from such Government or government
with respect to such requisition shall be paid over to, or retained by, the
Company.

(f) Application of Payments During Existence of Indenture
Event of Default. Any amount referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of
Section 10(c), Section 10(d) or Section 10(e) of this Article which is payable
to the Company shall not be paid to the Company, or if it has been previously
paid directly to the Company, shall not be retained by the Company, if at the
time of such payment an Indenture Event of Default, or an Indenture Default
which would constitute an Indenture Event of Default under Section 8.01(a),
8.01(f), 8.01(g), 8.01(h) or 8.01(i), shall have occurred and be continuing,
but shall be paid to and held by the Loan Trustee as security for the
obligations of the Company under this Indenture, and at such time as there
shall not be continuing any such Indenture Event of Default or event, such
amount shall be paid to the Company, provided that, if any such amount has been
so held by the Loan Trustee as security for more than 90 days after an Event of
Default shall have occurred and during which period (x) the Loan Trustee shall
not have been limited by operation of law or otherwise from exercising remedies
hereunder and (y) the Loan Trustee shall not have commenced to exercise any
remedy available to it under this Indenture, then such amount shall be paid to
the Company.

Section 11. Insurance. (a) Public Liability and Property
Damage Insurance. Subject to the rights of the Company to establish and
maintain self-insurance with respect to public liability and property damage
liability insurance for aircraft and engines (including the Aircraft and
Engines) in the manner and to the extent specified in the next sentence, the
Company will carry, or cause to be carried, at no expense to the Loan Trustee
or the Pass Through Trustee, public liability (including, without limitation,
contractual liability and passenger legal liability) and property damage
liability insurance (exclusive of manufacturer's product liability insurance)
with respect to the Aircraft (i) in amounts which are not less than the public
liability and property damage insurance applicable to similar aircraft and
engines which comprise the Company's fleet on which the Company carries
insurance, provided that such liability insurance shall not be less than the
amount certified to the
<PAGE> 67

56

Original Loan Participants on the Delivery Date, (ii) of the type usually
carried by corporations engaged in the same or similar business, similarly
situated with the Company, and owning or operating similar aircraft and engines
and covering risks of the kind customarily insured against by the Company, and
(iii) which is maintained in effect with insurers of recognized responsibility.
The Company may self-insure, by way of deductible or premium adjustment
provisions in insurance policies, the risks required to be insured against
pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in no case shall the self-insurance
(including the self-insurance permitted by Section 11(b) of this Article) with
respect to all of the aircraft and engines in the Company's fleet (including,
without limitation, the Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month policy year the
lesser of (x) 50% of the largest replacement value of any single aircraft in
the Company's fleet or (y) 1-1/2% of the average aggregate insurable value (for
the preceding year) of all aircraft (including, without limitation, the
Aircraft) on which the Company carries insurance; provided that, in the event
that there shall have occurred a material adverse change in the financial
condition of the Company from such condition as is reflected in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company at December 31, 1982, then,
upon not less than 30 days' written notice from the Loan Trustee to the
Company, the Company will, until the Company's financial condition is on an
overall basis equivalent to its financial condition at December 31, 1982,
reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder to such reasonable amount as the
Loan Trustee may require; provided, further, that a deductible per occurrence
utilized to reduce handling that, in the case of the Aircraft, is not in excess
of the amount customarily allowed as a deductible in the industry, shall be
permitted in addition to the abovementioned self-insurance. Any policies of
insurance carried in accordance with this Section 11(a) and any policies taken
out in substitution or replacement for any of such policies (A) shall name the
Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee as additional insureds as their
respective Interests may appear, (B) shall provide that in respect of the
respective interests of the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee in such
policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction of
the Company and shall insure the Loan Trustee's and the Pass Through Trustee's
Interests as they appear, regardless of any breach or violation of any
warranty, declaration or condition contained in such policies by the Company,
(C) shall provide that, if such insurance is cancelled for any reason whatever,
or any substantial change is made in the policy which affects the coverage
certified
<PAGE> 68

57

hereunder to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, or if such insurance
is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premium, such cancellation, change or
lapse shall not be effective as to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee
for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as is customarily obtainable in
the industry, in the case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after
receipt by the Loan Trustee nor the Pass Through Trustee, respectively, of
written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse, (D)
shall provide that neither the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee shall
have any obligation or liability for premiums, commissions, assessments or
calls in connection with such insurance, (E) shall provide that the insurers
shall waive (i) any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction,
whether by attachment or otherwise, which they may have against the Loan
Trustee nor the Pass Through Trustee and (ii) any rights of subrogation against
the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee to the extent that the Company has
waived its rights by its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to
this Indenture or the Participation Agreement; provided that the exercise by
such insurers of rights of subrogation derived from the rights retained by the
Company shall not, in any way, delay payment of any claim that would otherwise
be payable by such insurers but for the existence of rights of subrogation
derived from rights retained by the Company, (F) shall be primary without right
of contribution from any other insurance which may be carried by the Loan
Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee with respect to its Interests as such in
the Aircraft and (G) shall expressly provide that all of the provisions
thereof, except the limits of liability, shall operate in the same manner as if
there were a separate policy covering each insured. "Interests" as used in
this Section 11(a) and Section 11(b) of this Article with respect to any person
means the interests of such person in its capacity as Loan Trustee or Pass
Through Trustee, as the case may be, in the transaction contemplated by the
Participation Agreement and this Indenture. The Company shall arrange for
appropriate certification that the requirements of this Section 11(a) have been
met to be made to the Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee may furnish such
certificates to each Loan Participant) as soon as practicable by each insurer
or its authorized representative with respect thereto, provided that all
information contained therein shall be held confidential by the Loan Trustee
and each Loan Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to
anyone other than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal
counsel and any Person with whom any Loan Participant is in
<PAGE> 69

58

good faith conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale
of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes, if such person shall have entered
into an agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(a) whereby such
person agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be
required by an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute,
rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. In the case of a lease
or contract with any Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, or in
the case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine by any
Government, a valid agreement, reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Trustee, to
indemnify the Company against any of the risks which the Company is required
hereunder to insure against by such Government shall be considered adequate
insurance to the extent of the risks and in the amounts that are the subject of
any such agreement to indemnify.

(b) Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Aircraft. Subject to
the rights of the Company to establish and maintain self-insurance with respect
to loss or damage to aircraft (including the Aircraft) in the manner and to the
extent specified in the next sentence, the Company shall maintain, or cause to
be maintained, in effect with insurers of recognized responsibility, at no
expense to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee, all-risk aircraft hull
insurance covering the Aircraft and all-risk coverage with respect to any
Engines or parts while removed from the Aircraft (including, without
limitation, war risk and allied perils insurance if and to the extent the same
is maintained by the Company or any Permitted Air Carrier leasing the same with
respect to other aircraft owned or operated by the Company or such Permitted
Air Carrier, as the case may be, on the same routes) which is of the type and
in substantially the amount usually carried by corporations engaged in the same
or similar business and similarly situated with the Company; provided that (i)
such insurance (including the permitted self-insurance) shall at all times
while the Aircraft is subject to the Lien of this Indenture be for an amount
not less than, at the date of determination thereof, the Outstanding principal
amount of the Equipment Notes plus six months interest thereon and (ii) such
insurance need not cover an Engine while attached to an airframe not owned,
leased or operated by the Company. The Company may self-insure, by way of
deductible or premium adjustment provisions in insurance policies, the risks
required to be insured against pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in no
case shall the self-insurance (including the self-insurance
<PAGE> 70

59

permitted by Section 11(a) of this Article) with respect to all of the aircraft
and engines in the Company's fleet (including, without limitation, the
Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month policy year the lesser of (i) 50% of the
largest replacement value of any single aircraft in the Company's fleet or (ii)
1-1/2% of the average aggregate insurable value (for the preceding year) of all
aircraft (including, without limitation, the Aircraft) on which the Company
carries insurance; provided that, in the event that there shall have occurred a
material adverse change in the financial condition of the Company from such
condition as is reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company at December 31, 1982, then, upon not less than 30 days' written notice
from the Loan Trustee to the Company, the Company will, until the Company's
financial condition is on an overall basis equivalent to its financial
condition at December 31, 1982, reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder
to such reasonable amount as the Loan Trustee may require; provided, further,
that a deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce handling that, in the case
of the Aircraft, is not in excess of the amount customarily allowed as a
deductible in the industry, shall be permitted in addition to the
above-mentioned self-insurance. Any policies carried in accordance with this
Section 11(b) and any policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any
such policies (A) shall provide that any loss up to the amount equal to the
Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest
thereon, for any loss or damage constituting an Event of Loss with respect to
the Aircraft, and any loss in excess of $7,000,000, up to the amount equal to
the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest
thereon, for any loss or damage to the Aircraft (or Engines) not constituting
an Event of Loss with respect to the Aircraft, shall be paid to the Loan
Trustee as long as this Indenture shall not have been discharged pursuant to
the terms and conditions thereof, and thereafter to the Company, unless, in
each case, the insurer shall have received notice that an Indenture Event of
Default exists, in which case all insurance proceeds up to an amount equal to
the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest
thereon shall be payable to the Loan Trustee, (B) shall provide that in respect
of the respective interests of the Loan Trustee and of the Pass Through Trustee
in such policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action or
inaction of the Company and shall insure the Loan Trustee's and the Pass
Through Trustee's Interests, as they appear, regardless of any breach or
violation of any warranty, declaration or condition contained in such policies
<PAGE> 71

60

by the Company, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is cancelled for any
reason whatever, or any material change is made in the policy which affects the
coverage certified hereunder to the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through Trustee,
or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of premium, such
cancellation, change or lapse shall not be effective as to the Loan Trustee or
the Pass Through Trustee for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as may
from time to time be customarily obtainable in the industry, in the case of any
war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt by the Loan Trustee or the
Pass Through Trustee, respectively, of written notice from such insurers of
such cancellation, change or lapse, (D) shall be primary without right of
contribution from any other insurance which may be carried by the Loan Trustee
or the Pass Through Trustee with respect to its Interests as such in the
Aircraft and (E) shall provide that the insurers shall waive (i) any rights of
set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by attachment or
otherwise, which they may have against the Loan Trustee or the Pass Through
Trustee and (ii) any rights of subrogation against the Loan Trustee and the
Pass Through Trustee to the extent that the Company has waived its rights by
its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to this Indenture or the
Participation Agreement; provided that the exercise by such insurers of rights
of subrogation derived from rights retained by the Company shall not, in any
way, delay payment of any claim that would otherwise be payable by such
insurers but for the existence of rights of subrogation derived from rights
retained by the Company. The Company shall arrange for appropriate
certification that the requirements of this Section 11(b) have been met to be
made promptly to the Loan Trustee (and the Loan Trustee shall furnish such
certification to each Loan Participant) by each insurer or its authorized
representative with respect thereto, provided that all information contained
therein shall be held confidential by the Loan Trustee and each Loan
Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other
than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and
any person with whom any Loan Participant is in good faith conducting
negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale of such Loan
Participant's Equipment Notes, if such person shall have entered into an
agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(b) whereby such Person
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be required by
an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule,
regulation or order of any governmental authority. In the
<PAGE> 72

61

case of a lease or contract with any Government in respect of the Aircraft or
any Engine, or in the case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any
Engine by any Government, a valid agreement, reasonably satisfactory to the
Loan Trustee, to indemnify the Company against any of the risks which the
Company is required hereunder to insure against by such Government in an
amount, as at the date of determination thereof, equal to the Outstanding
principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus six months interest thereon from
time to time shall be considered adequate insurance to the extent of the risks
and in the amounts that are the subject of any such agreement to indemnify.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company it is agreed that
all insurance payments received under policies required to be maintained by the
Company hereunder, exclusive of any payments received in excess of an amount,
as at the date of determination thereof, equal to the Outstanding principal
amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon from such policies,
as the result of the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to the
Airframe or an Engine will be applied as follows:

(x) if such payments are received with respect to the
Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines installed on the
Airframe that has been or is being replaced by the Company as
contemplated by Section 10(a) of this Article, such payments shall be
paid over to, or retained by, the Loan Trustee, and upon completion of
such replacement be paid over to, or retained by, the Company;

(y) if such payments are received with respect to the
Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines installed thereon
that has not been and will not be replaced as contemplated by Section
10(a) of this Article, so much of such payments remaining after
reimbursement of the Loan Trustee for costs and expenses as shall not
exceed an amount, as at the date of determination thereof, equal to
the Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued
interest thereon required to be paid by the Company pursuant to
Section 10(a) of this Article shall be applied in reduction of the
Company's obligation to pay such amount equal to the Outstanding
principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon,
if not already paid by the Company, or, if already paid by the
Company, shall be applied to reimburse the Company for
<PAGE> 73

62

its payment of such amount equal to the Outstanding principal amount
of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest thereon, and the balance,
if any, of such payment remaining thereafter will be paid over to, or
retained by, the Company; and

(z) if such payments are received with respect to an Engine
under the circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b) of this Article,
so much of such payments remaining after reimbursement of the Loan
Trustee for costs and expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by,
the Company; provided that the Company shall have fully performed the
terms of Section 10(b) of this Article with respect to the Event of
Loss for which such payments are made.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the insurance
payment of any property damage loss in excess of an amount equal to the
Outstanding principal amount of the Equipment Notes plus accrued interest
thereon shall be paid to the Company.

As between the Loan Trustee and the Company the insurance
payments of any property damage loss not constituting an Event of Loss with
respect to the Airframe or an Engine will be applied in payment (or to
reimburse the Company) for repairs or for replacement property in accordance
with the terms of Sections 7 and 8 of this Article, and any balance remaining
after compliance with such Sections with respect to such loss shall be paid to
the Company. Any amount referred to in the preceding sentence or in clause
(x), (y) or (z) of the second preceding paragraph which is payable to the
Company shall not be paid to the Company or, if it has been previously paid
directly to the Company, shall not be retained by the Company, if at the time
of such payment an Indenture Event of Default (or an Indenture Default that
with lapse of time would constitute an Indenture Event of Default under Section
8.01(a), 8.01(f), 8.01(g), 8.01(h) or 8.01(i) of this Indenture) shall have
occurred and be continuing, but shall be paid to and held by the Loan Trustee,
as security for the obligations of the Company under this Indenture, and at
such time as there shall not be continuing any such Indenture Event of Default
or event, such amount shall be paid to the Company, provided that if any such
amount has been so held by the Loan Trustee as security for more than 90 days
after an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and during which period
(i) the Loan Trustee shall not have been limited by operation of law
<PAGE> 74

63

or otherwise from exercising remedies hereunder and (ii) the Loan Trustee shall
not have exercised any remedy available to it under Section 15 of this Article,
then such amount shall be paid to the Company.

(c) Reports, Etc. Annually upon renewal of the Company's
insurance coverage, the Company will furnish to the Loan Trustee (and the Loan
Trustee shall furnish to each Loan Participant) a report signed by a firm of
independent aircraft insurance brokers appointed by the Company, stating the
opinion of such firm that the insurance then carried and maintained on the
Aircraft complies with the terms hereof; provided that all information
contained in such report shall be held confidential by the Loan Trustee and
each Loan Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone
other than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal
counsel and any Person with whom any Loan Participant is in good faith
conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale of such Loan
Participant's Equipment Notes, if such Person shall have entered into an
agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(c) whereby such Person
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be required by
an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule,
regulation or order of any governmental authority. The Company will cause such
firm to advise the Loan Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee, in writing
promptly of any default in the payment of any premium and of any other act or
omission on the part of the Company of which such firm has knowledge and which
might invalidate or render unenforceable, in whole or in part, any insurance on
the Aircraft. The Company will also cause such firm to advise the Loan Trustee
and the Pass Through Trustee, in writing as promptly as practicable after such
firm acquires knowledge that an interruption or reduction of any insurance
carried and maintained on the Aircraft pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 11 will occur.

(d) Insurance for Own Account. Nothing in this Section 11
shall limit or prohibit the Loan Trustee or the Company from obtaining
insurance for its own account with respect to the Airframe or any Engine and
any proceeds payable thereunder shall be payable as provided in the insurance
policy relating thereto, provided that (i) no such insurance may be obtained
which would limit or otherwise adversely affect the coverage or amounts payable
under insurance required to be maintained pursuant to this Section 11, it being
understood that all salvage rights to the
<PAGE> 75

64

Airframe or such Engine shall remain with the Company's insurers at all times,
and (ii) the Loan Trustee may obtain hull insurance on the Aircraft only to the
extent the procurement of such insurance does not have an adverse effect on the
Company's ability or cost to obtain such insurance, except that the limitation
in the foregoing clause (i) on the Loan Trustee's right to obtain liability
insurance shall not apply during any period in which the Company is providing a
Government indemnity in lieu of the liability insurance required by Section
11(a) of this Article and the limitations in clauses (i) and (ii) on the Loan
Trustee's rights to obtain hull insurance shall not apply during any period in
which the Company is providing a Government indemnity in lieu of the hull
insurance required by Section 11(b) of this Article.

Section 12. Inspection. At all reasonable times so long as
any Equipment Notes are outstanding, but upon at least 5 days' prior written
notice to the Company, the Loan Trustee or its authorized representatives may
at their own expense and risk (including, without limitation, any risk of
personal injury or death) conduct a visual walk-around inspection of the
Aircraft and any Engine and may inspect the books and records of the Company
relating thereto; provided that (a) such representative shall be fully insured
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company at no cost to the Company with
respect to any risks incurred in connection with any such inspection, (b) any
such inspection shall be subject to the safety, security and workplace rules
applicable at the location where such inspection is conducted and any
applicable governmental rules or regulations and (c) in the case of an
inspection during a maintenance visit, such inspection shall not in any respect
interfere with the normal conduct of such maintenance visit or extend the time
required for such maintenance visit. All information obtained in connection
with any such inspection shall be held confidential by the Loan Trustee and
each Loan Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone
other than their accountants, agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom
any such Loan Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations relating to
the possible transfer and sale of such Loan Participant's Equipment Notes if
such Person shall have entered into an agreement similar to that contained in
this Section 12 whereby such Person agrees to hold such information
confidential, and except as may be required by an order of any court or
administrative agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or order of any
governmental authority. Upon the Loan Trustee's request, the
<PAGE> 76

65

Company will notify the Loan Trustee of the next scheduled "heavy maintenance"
visit to be conducted by the Company in respect of the Aircraft; provided that
the Company shall have the right in its sole discretion to reschedule, or
change the location of, any maintenance visit of which it shall have notified
the Loan Trustee pursuant to this sentence, the Company hereby agreeing to use
reasonable efforts to notify the Loan Trustee of any such rescheduling or
change. The Loan Trustee shall not have any duty to make such inspection and
shall not incur any liability or obligation by reason of not making any such
inspection. No inspection pursuant to this Section 12 shall interfere with the
use, operation or maintenance of the Aircraft or the normal conduct of the
Company's business, and the Company shall not be required to undertake or incur
any additional liabilities in connection therewith.

Section 17. Further Assurances; Financial Information.
Forthwith upon the execution and delivery of each Trust Agreement and Indenture
Supplement, the Company will cause such Trust Agreement and Indenture
Supplement to be duly filed and recorded in accordance with the Federal
Aviation Act. In addition, the Company and the Loan Trustee will promptly and
duly execute and deliver to the other party hereto such further documents and
assurances and take such further action as such other party may from time to
time reasonably request in order to effectively carry out the intent and
purpose of this Indenture, including, without limitation, if requested by the
Loan Trustee, the execution and delivery of supplements or amendments hereto,
in recordable form, subjecting to this Indenture any Replacement Airframe or
Replacement Engine and the recording or filing of counterparts hereof or
thereof, in accordance with the laws of such jurisdictions as the Loan Trustee
may from time to time deem advisable; provided that this sentence is not

Section 27. Company's Performance and Rights. Any obligation
imposed on the Company pursuant to Sections 7, 8, 11, 12 and 24 of this Article

contained in this Article 15 is, following the termination of the Lease

Trustee to have rights similar to those enjoyed by the Owner Trustee under the

shall be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with the intent
expressed in this Section 28.

Equipment Note issued after the Relevant Date shall be issued in substantially

of this Indenture in all of the Owner Trustee's right, title and interest in
the Aircraft and its interest in the Purchase Agreement (to the extent assigned

hereunder as Company have been terminated, except as specifically provided for
therein, and each of the Company and the Loan Trustee hereby agree that the
Granting Clause hereof shall, subject always to the provisions of Section 28 of

purpose of selecting the durations of the Interest Periods to be applicable
from time to time to calculations of interest on the Certificates and
designating the Debt Rate from time to time to be borne on the Certificates,
and the Lessee accepts such appointment on the terms herein contained. Such
appointment and authorization shall be suspended during any period when an
Event of Default under Section 14(a), insofar as Section 14(a) relates to
payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value or Termination Value, 14(f),
14(g), 14(h) or 14(i) of the Lease shall have occurred and be continuing. Each
of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Participant and each LOAN PARTICIPANT
hereby consents to such appointment and authorization. In taking any actions
as agent of the Owner Trustee as aforesaid, the Lessee shall be authorized to
deal directly with the Indenture Trustee and the LOAN PARTICIPANTs, and the
Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, each LOAN PARTICIPANT and the Indenture
Trustee each agrees to cooperate with the Lessee and the ORIGINAL LOAN
PARTICIPANT and otherwise to do all things and take all

5

actions reasonably necessary to effect the actions taken by the Owner Trustee
(or the Lessee as the agent of the Owner Trustee under this Section 1(c)).
Except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 2.01 of the Trust Indenture,
the Debt Rate applicable to the Loan Certificates for each Interest Period
shall be determined by election of the Owner Trustee (or the Lessee as agent
for the Owner Trustee) by delivering telephonic notice to each ORIGINAL LOAN
PARTICIPANT (whether or not it at the time holds any Loan Certificates),
followed in each case by telexed, telecopied or other written confirmation
(with a copy to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee), not less than
three London Business Days prior to the beginning of the applicable Interest
Period, in the case of a LIBOR Loan, and not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the New York Business Day immediately preceding the beginning of
the applicable Interest Period, in the case of a Short Period Loan, specifying
the duration of such Interest Period and whether the Debt Rate for such
Interest Period shall be determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate or the Short
Period Rate. The Indenture Trustee shall provide to each LOAN PARTICIPANT
other than an ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT a copy of any notice provided by the
Lessee pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence promptly after receipt
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lessee (or the Owner Trustee, as
the case may be) may only select a Short Period Rate (i) during any period, and
from time to time during such period, in which, in the case of the Lessee, the
Lessee is in contemplation of a proposed prepayment of the Loan Certificates
pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14 of the Trust Indenture (whether or not a
notice of prepayment has been given pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14 of the
Trust Indenture) or in which, in the case of the Owner Trustee, the Owner
Trustee is in contemplation of a proposed purchase of the Loan Certificates
pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture or (ii) at any time when the
selection of a LIBOR Rate would result in the succeeding Interest Period
commencing on a day other than the sixteenth day of a calendar month. Each
ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT (whether or not it at the time holds any Loan
Certificates) shall provide to each of the Owner Participant, the Owner
Trustee, each other LOAN PARTICIPANT, the Indenture Trustee and the Lessee an
officer's certificate setting forth the applicable interest rate and the
interest expected to accrue on the Certificates during the applicable Interest
Period promptly after the commencement of such Interest Period and, as soon as
practicable prior to each Lease Period Date (but in no event later than 10:00
A.M. New York City time on the Business Day

6

immediately preceding such Lease Period Date), to provide such notification of
the aggregate amount of interest that will be actually due and payable on the
Loan Certificates on such Lease Period Date.

that (i) any ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT shall for any reason fail or refuse to
make the full amount of its Commitment for the Aircraft available to the Owner
Trustee in accordance with the terms of Section 2 hereof, or (ii)
notwithstanding the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4
(other than the conditions set forth in

17

MF-1
<PAGE> 21

paragraphs (M), (Q), (V) and (X) thereof), the Owner Participant shall fail or
refuse to make the full amount of its Commitment for the Aircraft available to
the Owner Trustee in accordance with the terms of Section 2 hereof, the Owner
Trustee will forthwith give each party hereto telex or telegraphic notice of
such default and the Delivery Date for the Aircraft will be postponed to the
fifth succeeding Business Day (and the term "Delivery Date" as used in this
Agreement shall mean such postponed "Delivery Date"); provided that such
postponed Delivery Date shall not be a date later than June 12, 1992. During
such period, the Lessee shall have the right to find another leasing or
financial institution to be substituted for the defaulting ORIGINAL LOAN
PARTICIPANT or Owner Participant, as the case may be, provided that the
institution so substituted shall sign and deliver an agreement, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Lessee, by which it will assume the Commitment of
the defaulting ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or Owner Participant, as the case may
be. Upon the execution and delivery of such agreement, the institution so
substituted shall become an ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or Owner Participant, as
the case may be, and shall be deemed substituted for the defaulting ORIGINAL
LOAN PARTICIPANT or Owner Participant, as the case may be, for all purposes of
this Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Trust Indenture, the Lease and the
other Operative Documents and to have assumed all obligations of the defaulting
ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or Owner Participant, as the case may be, thereunder
which accrue after the date of execution and delivery of such agreement. No
action by the Lessee under this Section 5(a) shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver or release of any right which the Lessee may have against the defaulting
ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or Owner Participant, as the case may be. In the
event that the Lessee cannot find another institution to be substituted for the
defaulting ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or Owner Participant, as the case may be,
within such five Business Day period, then, in such event (i) the Owner Trustee
shall not accept delivery of the Aircraft and (ii) this Agreement, the Trust
Agreement, the Trust Indenture, the Lease and the Purchase Agreement Assignment
shall terminate and be of no further force or effect except as expressly
provided herein or therein.

(b) A scheduled Delivery Date for the Aircraft may be
postponed from time to time for any reason (but no later than June 12, 1992),
other than pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, if the Lessee gives the Owner
Participant, each ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT, the Indenture Trustee and

18

MF-1
<PAGE> 22

the Owner Trustee telex, telegraphic, facsimile or telephonic (confirmed in
writing) notice of such postponement and notice of the date to which such
Delivery Date has been postponed, such notice of postponement to be received by
each party no later than 5:30 P.M., New York City time, on the originally
scheduled Delivery Date, and the term "Delivery Date" as used in this Agreement
shall mean any such postponed "Delivery Date".

(c) In the event of any postponement of the Delivery Date
pursuant to Section 5(b) hereof, or if on an originally scheduled Delivery Date
not postponed as above provided the Aircraft is not delivered or, if delivered,
is not accepted by the Owner Trustee for any reason (any such originally
scheduled Delivery Date being referred to as the "Scheduled Delivery Date" for
the purposes of this Section 5): (i) the Lessee will reimburse each
Participant for the loss of the use of its funds occasioned by such
postponement or failure to deliver or accept (unless such failure to accept is
caused solely by a default by such Participant hereunder) by paying to such
Participant on demand interest, if to the Owner Participant, at an interest
rate equal to the Base Rate, and, if to any ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT, at an
interest rate equal to 4.8875% per annum, in either case, for the period from
and including the Scheduled Delivery Date to but excluding the earlier of the
date upon which such funds are returned by the Owner Trustee or the actual date
of delivery; provided that the Lessee shall in any event pay to the Owner
Participant and such ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT at least one day's interest at
the aforesaid applicable rates on the amount of such funds, unless the Owner
Participant or such ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT, respectively, shall have
received, prior to 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Business Day preceding
the Scheduled Delivery Date, a notice of postponement of the Scheduled Delivery
Date pursuant to Section 5(b) hereof, and (ii) the Owner Trustee will return on
the fifth Business Day following the Scheduled Delivery Date, or earlier, if so
instructed by the Lessee, any funds which it shall have received from any
Participant as its Commitment, absent joint instruction from the Lessee and
such Participant to retain funds until the specified date of postponement
established under Section 5(b).

(d) The Owner Trustee agrees that, in the event it has
received telephonic notice (to be confirmed promptly in writing) from the
Lessee on the Scheduled Delivery Date for the Aircraft that the Aircraft has
not been tendered for

19

MF-1
<PAGE> 23

delivery, or, if so tendered, has not been accepted by the Owner Trustee, it
will if instructed in the aforementioned notice from the Lessee (which notice
shall specify the securities to be purchased) use reasonable efforts to invest,
at the risk of the Lessee (except as provided below), the funds received by it
from each Participant in Permitted Investments in accordance with the Lessee's
instructions. Any such Permitted Investments purchased by the Owner Trustee
upon instructions from the Lessee shall be held in trust by the Owner Trustee
(but not as part of the Trust Estate under the Trust Agreement and not as part
of the Indenture Estate under the Trust Indenture) for the benefit of the
Participant delivering such funds and any net profits on the investment of such
funds (including interest), if any, shall be for the account of, and shall on
the date the Aircraft is delivered under this Agreement and accepted under the
Lease (such date being herein called the "Closing Date"), or on the date such
funds are returned to such Participant, as the case may be, be paid over to,
the Lessee; provided, that Lessee shall have paid to each Participant the
interest that has accrued on the amount of their respective Commitments as
determined in accordance with Section 5(c). The Lessee shall pay to the Owner
Trustee on the Closing Date the amount of any net loss on the investment of
such funds invested at the instruction of the Lessee. If the funds furnished
by the Participants with respect to the Aircraft are required to be returned to
the Participants, the Lessee shall, on the date on which such funds are so
required to be returned, reimburse the Owner Trustee, for the benefit of the
Participants, for any net losses incurred on such investments. The Owner
Trustee shall not be liable for failure to invest such funds or for any losses
incurred on such investments except for its own willful misconduct or gross
negligence. In order to obtain funds for the payment of Lessor's Cost for the
Aircraft or to return funds furnished by the Participants to the Owner Trustee
for the benefit of the Participants with respect to the Aircraft, as the case
may be, the Owner Trustee is authorized to sell any Permitted Investments
purchased as aforesaid with the funds received by it from the Participants in
connection with the Aircraft.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, no
Participant shall be under any obligation to make its Commitment available

HEREBY. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS PARAGRAPH IS INTENDED TO BE, NOR SHALL
ANYTHING HEREIN BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT, OR INTERPRETED TO BE IN DEROGATION OF,
THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE LESSEE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER OPERATIVE

Section 2.13 or Article IV of the Trust Indenture arising as a result
of an Event of Default under the Lease;

(vii) Any Claim attributable to a failure on the part of the

Agreement, as the case may be, any amounts received and distributable
by it thereunder;

(viii) Any Claim attributable to the authorization or giving

28

MF-1
<PAGE> 32

(xii) Any ordinary and usual operating or overhead expense
that such Indemnitee would have incurred regardless of the existence

amounts payable by the Owner Trustee to the Indenture Trustee in
respect of the Break Amount, if any, payable with respect to the

pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture or (y) an Indenture
Default that does not also constitute an Event of Default;

(xiv) Any Claim attributable to the Owner Participant's
failure to be a "citizen of the United States" (within the meaning of
Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act and the rules and
regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration thereunder) if the
Owner Participant is then required to be such a citizen hereunder; and

(xv) With respect to any particular Indemnitee, any Claim
arising by reason of a violation attributable to such Indemnitee or a
member of its Related Indemnitee Group of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code.

(5) Insured Claims. In the case of any Claim indemnified by
the Lessee hereunder which is covered by a policy of insurance maintained by
the Lessee pursuant to Section 11 of the Lease, so long as no Event of Default
under the Lease shall have occurred and be continuing, each Indemnitee agrees
to cooperate, at the Lessee's expense, with the insurers in the exercise of
such insurers' rights to investigate, defend or compromise such Claim as may be
required to retain the benefits of such insurance with respect to such Claim,
provided that an Indemnitee shall not be required to so cooperate to the extent
that such cooperation would involve a significant risk of the imposition of
criminal liability on such Indemnitee.

(6) Claims Procedure. An Indemnitee shall promptly notify
the Lessee of any Claim as to which indemnification is sought; provided that no
delay in notifying the Lessee of any such Claim shall derogate from the
Lessee's indemnification obligations hereunder unless the

29

MF-1
<PAGE> 33

Lessee is adversely affected thereby. Subject to the rights of insurers under
policies of insurance maintained pursuant to Section 11 of the Lease, so long
as no Event of Default under the Lease shall have occurred and be continuing,
the Lessee shall have the right to investigate, and the right in its sole
discretion to defend or compromise, any Claim for which indemnification is
sought under this Section 7(b), and the Indemnitee shall cooperate with all
reasonable requests of the Lessee in con-nection therewith, provided that an
Indemnitee shall not be required to so cooperate to the extent that such
cooperation would involve a significant risk of the imposition of criminal
liability on such Indemnitee; and provided, further, that Lessee shall not have
the ability to compromise any Claim with respect to any Indemnitee to the
extent that such Claim involves the imposition of criminal liability on such
Indemnitee. Where the Lessee or the insurers under a policy of insurance
maintained by the Lessee undertake the defense of an Indemnitee with respect to
a Claim, no additional legal fees or expenses of such Indemnitee in connection
with the defense of such Claim shall be indemnified hereunder unless such fees
or expenses were incurred at the request of the Lessee or such insurers;
provided, however, that if (i) in the written opinion of counsel to such
Indemnitee an actual or potential material conflict of interest exists where it
is advisable for such Indemnitee to be represented by separate counsel or (ii)
such Indemnitee has been indicted or otherwise charged in a criminal complaint
and such Indemnitee informs the Lessee that such Indemnitee desires to be
represented by separate counsel, the reasonable fees and expenses of any such
separate counsel shall be borne by the Lessee. Subject to the requirements of
any policy of insurance, an Indemnitee may participate at its own expense in
any judicial proceeding controlled by the Lessee pursuant to the preceding
provisions; provided that such party's participation does not, in the written
opinion of counsel appointed by the Lessee or its insurers to conduct such
proceedings, materially interfere with such control; and such participation
shall not constitute a waiver of the indemnification provided in this Section
7(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Lessee
shall not under any circumstances be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnitees, except in the case
specified in the proviso to the third sentence of this paragraph (6).

(7) Subrogation. To the extent that a Claim indemnified by
the Lessee under this Section 7(b) is in fact

30

MF-1
<PAGE> 34

paid in full by the Lessee and/or an insurer under a policy of insurance
maintained by the Lessee pursuant to Section 11 of the Lease, the Lessee and/or
such insurer, as the case may be, shall be subrogated to the rights and
remedies of the Indemnitee on whose behalf such Claim was paid (other than
rights of such Indemnitee under insurance policies maintained at its own
expense) with respect to the transaction or event giving rise to such Claim,
except that Lessee shall not be subrogated to any rights or remedies (a) that
the Owner Trustee may have against the Owner Participant under Section 7.01 of
the Trust Agreement in any case where the Owner Participant, if it had paid the
Owner Trustee under Section 7.01 of the Trust Agreement, would have had a right
to be indemnified by Lessee under this Section 7(b) or (b) that the Indenture
Trustee may have against the Owner Trustee under Sec- tion 7.01 of the Trust
Indenture in any case where the Owner Trustee, if it had paid the Indenture
Trustee under Section 7.01 of the Trust Indenture, would have had a right to be
indemnified by Lessee under this Section 7(b). Should an Indemnitee receive any
refund, in whole or in part, with respect to any Claim paid by the Lessee
hereunder, it shall promptly pay the amount refunded (but not an amount in
excess of the amount the Lessee or any of its insurers has paid in respect of
such Claim) to the Lessee.

(8) No Guaranty. Nothing set forth in this Section 7(b)
shall constitute a guarantee by the Lessee that the Aircraft shall have any
particular useful life or residual value or a guarantee to the Indenture
Trustee or any LOAN PARTICIPANT or holder of the Certificates that the
Certificates will be paid.

(9) Waiver of Certain Claims. In the event of any loss,
destruction or damage to the Aircraft or other property of Lessee or any
personal injury to Lessee's employees resulting from the use or operation of
the Aircraft by the Lessee or any sublessee or other user during the Term, the
Lessee hereby waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any Claim
against Lessor, the Owner Participant or any LOAN PARTICIPANT in respect of
such loss, destruction, damage or injury to the extent such Claim involves a
cause of action against Lessor, the Owner Participant or the LOAN PARTICIPANT
based solely on the ownership or interest of Lessor, the Owner Participant or
any LOAN PARTICIPANT, as the case may be, in the Aircraft. Nothing contained
in the preceding sentence shall be interpreted to be in derogation of the
obligation of Lessor,

31

MF-1
<PAGE> 35

the Owner Participant or any LOAN PARTICIPANT under any of this Agreement, the
Lease or the other Operative Documents to which Lessor, the Owner Participant
or any LOAN PARTICIPANT is a party.

(c) General Tax Indemnity. (1) General. In the event that
the Lessee is required to deduct or withhold from any payment of Basic Rent any
Tax imposed by any taxing authority or governmental subdivision of any foreign
country for which the Lessee is obligated to indemnify the Owner Participant
pursuant to the following provisions of this Section 7(c), then the Lessee
shall pay to the Owner Participant an additional amount such that the net
amount of Basic Rent actually received by the Owner Participant will equal the
amount that would have been received had such Tax not been deducted or
withheld. The Lessee hereby agrees to indemnify and keep harmless each Tax
Indemnitee from and against any and all license and documentation fees and all
taxes, levies, duties, charges or withholdings, whether now existing or
hereafter adopted, together with any penalties, fines or interest thereon or
other additions thereto (hereinafter collectively called "Taxes" and
individually called a "Tax") that may be imposed on or payable by any Tax
Indemnitee, the Lessee, any sublessee, sub-sublessee or other user of the
Aircraft, the Airframe or any Engine, or any Affiliate of any such user, or
imposed on the Aircraft, the Airframe, any Engine or any Part, by any Federal,
state or local government or taxing authority in the United States or any
territory or possession thereof, or by any taxing authority or governmental
subdivision of any foreign country or any international authority, upon or with
respect to: (A) the Aircraft, the Airframe, any Engine or any Part or any
interest therein; (B) the purchase, acceptance, rejection, delivery,
nondelivery, transport, location, insurance, registration, assembly,
possession, maintenance, abandonment, storage, modification, transfer of title,
acquisition, ownership, delivery, lease, sublease, financing, possession, use,
operation, construction, manufacture, repair, sale, return, transfer or other
disposition of the Aircraft, the Airframe, any Engine or any Part or any
interest therein; (C) any amount payable under any Operative Document; (D) any
or all of the Operative Documents, or the issuance of the Certificates (or the
refinancing thereof) or any interest therein or any other documents
contemplated hereby or thereby and any amendments and supplements thereto, (E)
any change in the Owner Trustee made pursuant to Article IX of the Trust
Agreement or the situs of the Trust Estate made pursuant to Section 9 of this
Agreement,

32

MF-1
<PAGE> 36

(F) the property, or the income, earnings, receipts or other proceeds received
with respect to the property, held by the Indenture Trustee under the Trust
Indenture or (G) otherwise with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
Operative Documents.

(2) Certain Exceptions. The provisions of Section 7(c)(1)
shall not apply to, and the Lessee shall have no indemnity liability to any Tax
Indemnitee under Section 7(c)(1) with respect to:

(A) Taxes on, based on, measured by or with respect to net or
gross income (including minimum taxes and taxes on items of tax
preference), capital, net worth, net or gross receipts, franchises or
conduct of business (except for sales or use Taxes) of the Owner
Participant imposed by (x) the Federal government of the United
States, (y) any state or local government or other taxing authority in
the United States or any territory or possession thereof unless such
Taxes would have been imposed had the use or operation of the Aircraft
or the activities of the Lessee been the sole connection between the
Owner Participant and the jurisdiction of such government or taxing
authority and (z) any taxing authority or governmental subdivision of
any foreign country or any international authority unless such Taxes
would have been imposed had the use, operation or registration of the
Aircraft or the activities of the Lessee been the sole connection
between the Owner Participant and the jurisdiction of such taxing
authority or governmental subdivision;

(B) Taxes on, based on, measured by or with respect to net or
gross income (including minimum taxes and taxes on items of tax
preference), capital, net worth, net or gross receipts, franchises or

government of the United States or (y) any state or local government
or taxing authority in the United States or any territory or
possession thereof or any taxing authority or governmental subdivision
of any foreign country or any international authority except to the
extent that such Taxes would have been due had the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Documents been the sole connection
between the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and such LOAN
PARTICIPANT,provided that there shall not be excluded under clause (x)
or

33

MF-1
<PAGE> 37

(y) of this subparagraph (B) Taxes to the extent imposed by reason of
such LOAN PARTICIPANT being treated as having a taxable exchange as a
result of an assumption by the Lessee of the rights and obligations of
the Owner Trustee under the Indenture and the Certificates pursuant to
Section 2.16 of the Indenture (it being understood that nothing in
this paragraph (B) shall impair the right of any LOAN PARTICIPANT to
an indemnity pursuant to Section 2.04 of the Indenture);

(C) Taxes imposed on any Tax Indemnitee by any Federal,
state or local government or taxing authority in the United States or
any territory or possession thereof, or by any taxing authority or

Indemnitee and the jurisdiction of such government, taxing authority
or governmental subdivision unrelated to the transactions contemplated
by the Operative Documents;

(D) Taxes imposed on or in connection with any sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition (whether voluntary or
involuntary) (other than a transfer pursuant to Section 2.04(i) of the

the Airframe, any Engine, any Part or any Operative Document or any
Certificate (for the avoidance of doubt, the assumption by the Lessee

(S) Taxes imposed in lieu of or in substitution for any Taxes

(3) Payment on After-Tax Basis. The Lessee further agrees
that, with respect to any payment or indemnity to an Indemnitee under Section
7(b) hereof or a Tax Indemnitee under this Section 7(c), the Lessee's indemnity
obligations shall include any amount necessary to hold such Indemnitee or Tax
Indemnitee harmless on an after-tax basis from all Taxes required to be paid by
such Indemnitee or Tax Indemnitee with respect to such payment or indemnity
(including any payments under this Section 7(c)(3)) under the laws of any
Federal, state or local government or taxing authority in the United States or
any territory or possession thereof or under the laws of any taxing authority

37

MF-1
<PAGE> 41

or governmental subdivision of any foreign country or any international
authority.

(4) Tax Benefit Payback. If any Indemnitee or Tax Indemnitee
shall realize a tax benefit as a result of any Claims or Taxes paid or
indemnified against by the Lessee under Section 7(b) hereof or this Section
7(c) (whether by way of deduction, credit, allocation or apportionment of
income or otherwise), such Indemnitee or Tax Indemnitee shall pay to the Lessee
an amount which, after subtraction of any further tax savings such Indemnitee
or Tax Indemnitee realizes as a result of the payment thereof, is equal to the
amount of such tax benefit. Each Indemnitee and Tax Indemnitee shall in good
faith use diligence in filing its tax returns and in dealing with taxing
authorities (x) to seek and claim any such tax benefit or any refund of any
Taxes payable or indemnifiable by the Lessee hereunder (provided that no LOAN
PARTICIPANT shall have any obligation to claim any credit or any deduction in
priority to any other claims, reliefs, credits or deductions available to it)
and (y) to minimize the Taxes payable or indemnifiable by the Lessee hereunder.

(5) Payment. Any amount payable to any Tax Indemnitee
pursuant to this Section 7(c) shall be paid within 30 days after receipt of a
written demand therefor from such Tax Indemnitee accompanied by a written
statement describing in reasonable detail the Taxes which are the subject of
and basis for such indemnity and the computation of the amount so payable, but
not prior to the latest of (A) the payment of such Taxes, (B) in the case of
amounts for which verification has been requested pursuant to Section 7(c)(10),
30 days after completion of the verification or (C) in the case of amounts
which are being contested, the time such contest (including all judicial
appeals, if any) is finally resolved. Upon the written request of an
appropriate Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee shall furnish such Tax Indemnitee the
original or a certified copy of a receipt (if any is available to the Lessee)
for the Lessee's payment of any Tax that is subject to indemnification pursuant
to this Section 7(c), or such other evidence of payment of such Tax as is
acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee (and available to the Lessee).

(6) Contests; Refunds. If written claim is made against any
Tax Indemnitee for any Taxes that the Lessee is required to indemnify against
pursuant to this Section 7(c), such Tax Indemnitee shall promptly notify the
Lessee in

38

MF-1
<PAGE> 42

writing. If requested by the Lessee in writing, such Tax Indemnitee shall in
good faith diligently contest (including pursuing all judicial appeals, but not
to the United States Supreme Court) in the name of such Tax Indemnitee or, (i)
if permitted by law, (ii) if the Tax to be contested does not involve issues
with respect to which the Lessee would not be required to indemnify the Owner
Participant hereunder that cannot be severed from all issues with respect to
which the Lessee would be required to indemnify the Owner Participant hereunder
and (iii) if so requested in writing by the Lessee, contest in the name of the
Lessee (or permit the Lessee, if requested by the Lessee, except as otherwise
provided below, to contest in the name of the Lessee or such Tax Indemnitee) at
the Lessee's direction, except as otherwise provided below, the validity,
applicability and amount of such Taxes by (A) resisting payment thereof, (B)
not paying the same except under protest, if protest is necessary and proper,
or (C) if payment shall be made, seeking a refund thereof in appropriate
administrative and judicial proceedings; provided that (x) prior to taking such
action the Lessee shall have agreed to pay such Tax Indemnitee, and shall pay
on demand, all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses that such Tax
Indemnitee may incur in connection with contesting such claim, including,
without limitation, all reasonable out-of-pocket legal and accounting fees and
disbursements, (y) if such contest is to be initiated by the payment of, and
the claiming of a refund for, such Taxes, then notwithstanding Section 7(c)(5),
the Lessee shall provide such Tax Indemnitee with sufficient funds on an
interest-free basis and with no additional net after-tax cost to such Tax
Indemnitee to make such payment and (z) such proceedings do not involve any
material danger of the forfeiture or loss of the Aircraft, unless the Lessee
shall have agreed to provide security therefor reasonably satisfactory to such
Tax Indemnitee. In the case of a contest of income taxes of a Tax Indemnitee
involving issues with respect to which the Lessee would not be required to
indemnify such Tax Indemnitee hereunder that cannot be severed from all issues
with respect to which the Lessee would be required to indemnify such Tax
Indemnitee hereunder, (I) such Tax Indemnitee may in its sole discretion select
the forum for such contest and determine the manner in which such contest shall
be conducted, provided that such Tax Indemnitee shall afford the Lessee and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to discuss with such Tax Indemnitee the
Lessee's interests with respect to such contest and (II) the following
conditions shall apply in addition to the conditions

39

MF-1
<PAGE> 43

contained in clauses (x) through (z) above: (1) no contest will be required in
a judicial proceeding unless the Lessee shall have provided such Tax Indemnitee
with an opinion of tax counsel selected by the Lessee and reasonably acceptable
to such Tax Indemnitee (it being agreed that Lessee's internal tax counsel will
be reasonably acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee) that a Realistic Possibility
of Success exists for such contest and (2) no Event of Default of the type
specified in Section 14(a) (but only insofar as Section 14(a) relates to
payments of Basic Rent or Supplemental Rent not then in dispute), (f), (g), (h)
or (i) of the Lease shall have occurred and be continuing, unless the Lessee
shall have provided security reasonably acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee for
the amount of the Tax being contested and for the amount of all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses that such Tax Indemnitee may incur in
connection with the contest of such claim. Any Tax Indemnitee may elect not to
contest pursuant to this Section 7(c)(6), or to settle any contest, but such
election shall constitute a waiver by such Tax Indemnitee of any right to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7(c) with respect to the claim which
was the subject of such proposed contest and, if the Lessee has theretofore
provided such Tax Indemnitee with funds to pay such amount, such Tax Indemnitee
shall promptly repay such funds, together with interest on the amount of such
funds from the date the Lessee provided such funds to such Tax Indemnitee to
the date of repayment pursuant to this sentence at the rate that would have
been payable by the relevant taxing authority if such contest had resulted in a
refund.

If any Tax Indemnitee shall obtain a refund of all or any part
of any Taxes that the Lessee shall have paid for such Tax Indemnitee or for
which the Lessee shall have reimbursed such Tax Indemnitee, such Tax Indemnitee
shall, so long as no Event of Default under Section 14(a) (but only insofar as
Section 14(a) relates to payments of Basic Rent or Supplemental Rent not then
in dispute), (f), (g), (h) or (i) of the Lease shall have occurred and be
continuing, pay to the Lessee an amount which, after subtracting any further
tax benefit realized by such Tax Indemnitee as a result of the payment thereof,
is equal to the sum of the amount of such refund, plus any interest received on
such refund attributable to any Taxes paid by the Lessee to or for such Tax
Indemnitee.

(7) Reports. In case any report or return is required to be
made with respect to any obligation of the

40

MF-1
<PAGE> 44

Lessee under this Section 7(c) relating to property Taxes, the Lessee will
either make such report or return in such manner as will show the ownership of
the Aircraft in the Owner Trustee, or will notify the Owner Trustee of such
requirement and make such report or return in such manner as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Trustee.

(8) Forms. Each Tax Indemnitee agrees to furnish from time
to time to the Lessee or to such other person as the Lessee may designate, at
the Lessee's request, such duly executed and properly completed forms as may be
necessary or appropriate in order to claim any reduction of or exemption from
any withholding or other Tax which the Lessee may be required to indemnify
against hereunder, if (x) such reduction or exemption is available to such Tax
Indemnitee and (y) the Lessee has provided such Tax Indemnitee with any
information necessary to complete such form not otherwise reasonably available
to such Tax Indemnitee.

(9) Non-Parties. If a Tax Indemnitee is not a party to this
Agreement, the Lessee may require such Tax Indemnitee to agree in writing, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Lessee, to the terms of this Section 7(c)
prior to making any payment to such Tax Indemnitee under this Section 7(c).

(10) Verification. At the Lessee's request, the amount of
any indemnity payment by the Lessee to an Indemnitee or Tax Indemnitee pursuant
to this Section 7 or any payment by an Indemnitee or Tax Indemnitee to the
Lessee pursuant to this Section 7 shall be verified and certified by a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants selected by the
Lessee and reasonably acceptable to such Indemnitee or Tax Indemnitee, provided
that, in the case of any LOAN PARTICIPANT, the amount of any payment by such
LOAN PARTICIPANT to the Lessee pursuant to this Section 7 shall be verified and
certified by the independent public accounting firm that audits the financial
statements of such LOAN PARTICIPANT. The fee of such independent public
accounting firm shall be paid by the Lessee unless such verification shall
disclose an error in such Indemnitee's or Tax Indemnitee's favor exceeding the
lesser of (A) 5% of the amount of such payment determined by such Indemnitee or
Tax Indemnitee and (B) $50,000, in which case such fee shall be paid by such
Indemnitee or Tax Indemnitee.

(11) Definition. For purposes of this Section 7(c), "Tax
Indemnitee" shall mean the Owner Trustee (in

41

MF-1
<PAGE> 45

its individual capacity and as trustee), the Owner Participant, the Trust
Estate, the LOAN PARTICIPANTs, the Indenture Trustee (in its individual
capacity and as trustee) and the Indenture Estate, and each reference to a Tax
Indemnitee shall include its respective agents, servants, officers, directors,
successors and permitted assigns.

(12) Application of Payments During Existence of Event of
Default. Any amount not paid to the Lessee under this Section 7(c) because an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing shall be held by the
relevant Indemnitee or Tax Indemnitee as security for the obligations of the
Lessee under the Operative Documents and, if the Lessor declares the Lease to
be in default pursuant to Section 15 thereof, applied against the Lessee's
obligations under the Operative Documents as and when due, provided that no
such amount shall be held as security for more than 180 days unless the Lessor
or the Indenture Trustee shall be precluded by law or court order from
exercising remedies under Section 15 of the Lease; provided, further, that any
amount so held as security shall, until paid to the Lessee pursuant to this
Section 7(c) or applied against the Lessee's obligations as provided herein, be
invested in Permitted Investments by such Indemnitee or Tax Indemnitee as
directed in writing by the Lessee with any gain or loss from such investment
for the Lessee's account. At such time as there shall not be continuing any
such Event of Default or such 180-day period shall have elapsed, such amount
shall be paid to the Lessee to the extent not previously applied in accordance
with the preceding sentence.

(13) All Tax Obligations in this Section, etc.
Notwithstanding any other provision anywhere contained in the Operative
Documents, it is agreed that all of the Lessee's obligations with respect to
Taxes are set forth in this Section 7(c) and in the Tax Indemnity Agreement and
if the Lessee shall be required under any provision of the Operative Documents
to pay any other Tax not indemnifiable for by the Lessee under this Section
7(c) or the Tax Indemnity Agreement, the party for or on behalf of whom such
Tax is paid by the Lessee shall on an after-tax basis pay to the Lessee on
demand an amount equal to the sum of such Tax paid by the Lessee plus interest
computed at the Overdue Rate for the period commencing on the date of the
payment of such Tax by the Lessee to but excluding the date of the receipt of
such amount by the Lessee; provided that nothing in this paragraph 13 shall
affect the Lessee's obligations

42

MF-1
<PAGE> 46

under clause (iii) of the second sentence of Section 3(c) of the Lease.

(d) Survival. The representations, warranties, indemnities
and agreements of the Lessee provided for in this Section 7 and the Lessee's
obligations in this Section 7, and the obligations of any Indemnitee or Tax
Indemnitee under this Section 7, shall survive the Owner Participant's making
of its Commitment, the delivery of the Aircraft and the expiration or other
termination of the Operative Documents.

(e) Payments; Interest. Any payments made pursuant to this
Section 7 directly to an Indemnitee or a Tax Indemnitee or to the Lessee, as
the case may be, shall be made in immediately available funds at such bank or
to such account as is specified by the payee in written directions to the payor
or, if no such directions shall have been given, by check of the payor payable
to the order of the payee and mailed to the payee by certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid to its address referred to in Section 15(c)
of this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest at the
Overdue Rate shall be paid, on demand, on any amount or indemnity not paid when
due pursuant to this Section 7 until the same shall be paid. Such interest
shall be paid in the same manner as the unpaid amount in respect of which such
interest is due.

(f) Effect of Other Indemnities. The Lessee's obligations
under the indemnities provided for in this Agreement shall be those of a
primary obligor whether or not the Person indemnified shall also be indemnified
with respect to the same matter under the terms of this Agreement, the Lease,
the Trust Indenture, the Trust Agreement or any other document or instrument,
and the Person seeking indemnification from the Lessee pursuant to any
provisions of this Agreement may proceed directly against the Lessee without
first seeking to enforce any other right of indemnification.

(g) Records. The Lessee shall make, or cause to be made,
available such records relating to the Aircraft that are regularly maintained
by the Lessee in the ordinary course of its business as may be reasonably
necessary to enable the Owner Trustee to fulfill its tax return filing
obligations.

43

MF-1

Indenture solely at the Lessee's request and direction.

conditions of Sections 8(h) and 8(i) hereof, such ORIGINAL LOAN
PARTICIPANT hereby agreeing that (x) any such sale, assignment, pledge,

(h) Except to the extent provided in Section 8(i) hereof and
Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture, each LOAN PARTICIPANT agrees that it will
not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer all or any portion of any
Certificate or the indebtedness evidenced thereby without the prior written
consent of the Lessee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each LOAN PARTICIPANT may sell, assign, pledge
or otherwise transfer all or any portion of any of its Certificates or the
indebtedness evidenced thereby to a Permitted Transferee without such consent
at any time (i) from the Delivery Date until December 31, 1992 and (ii) after
May 31, 1995, provided that such sale, assignment, pledge or transfer is made
in accordance with all applicable laws and such LOAN PARTICIPANT and such
Permitted Transferee shall have executed and delivered a transfer agreement in
the form attached as Exhibit XIV hereto, and provided, further, that no LOAN
PARTICIPANT may grant participations in any Loan Certificate or Certificates
other than an ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or any Initial Transferee, which grant

agrees that (x) any such sale, assignment, pledge, transfer or grant of

51

MF-1
<PAGE> 55

agrees that it will not grant participations (including, without limitation,
"risk participations") in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations
in respect of the Certificates and any amounts from time to time payable to it
in respect thereof, unless (A) notwithstanding any such participation, (i) such
ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT'S or Initial Transferee's, as applicable, obligations
under the Operative Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such ORIGINAL LOAN
PARTICIPANT or Initial Transferee, as applicable, shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties to the Operative Documents for the performance
of such obligations and (iii) such ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or Initial
Transferee, as applicable, shall remain the Holder of the Certificates, and the
other parties to the Operative Documents shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or Initial Transferee, as
applicable, in connection with the Certificates and each LOAN PARTICIPANT'S
rights and obligations under the Operative Documents and (B) in the case of
each such participation, such participation is made in accordance with all
applicable laws and is made to a Permitted Transferee. The liability of the
Owner Trustee in respect of increased costs, Break Amount and withholding taxes
under Section 2.04, 2.17 or 2.18 of the Trust Indenture shall not, as a result
of any participation granted by such ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or any Initial
Transferee, exceed what would have been its liability thereunder if such
ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or Initial Transferee, as applicable, had not granted
any such participation. Such ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT and each Initial
Transferee may, in connection with any participation or proposed participation
pursuant to this Section 8(i), disclose to the participant or proposed
participant any information relating to the Operative Documents or to the
parties thereto furnished to such ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or such Initial
Transferee, as applicable, thereunder or in connection therewith and permitted
to be disclosed by such ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or Initial Transferee, as
applicable; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure that includes
any confidential information, the participant or proposed participant shall
agree in writing for the benefit of such Owner Participant and the Lessee to
preserve the confidentiality of such confidential information included therein.

(j) If (i) all or any part of the Trust Estate becomes the
property of, or the Owner Participant becomes, a debtor subject to the
reorganization provisions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 or any successor
provision,

52

MF-1
<PAGE> 56

(ii) pursuant to such reorganization provisions the Owner Trustee (in its
individual capacity) or the Owner Participant is required, by reason of the
Owner Trustee (in its individual capacity) or the Owner Participant being held
to have recourse liability to the holder(s) of the Certificates or to the
Indenture Trustee, directly or indirectly (other than the recourse liability of
the Owner Participant under Section 16(a)(ii) of this Agreement), to make
payment on account of any amount payable as principal, Break Amount, if any, or
interest on the Certificates and (iii) any holder(s) of the Certificates or the
Indenture Trustee actually receives any Excess Payment (as hereinafter defined)
which reflects any payment by the Owner Trustee (in its individual capacity) or
the Owner Participant on account of (ii) above, then such holder(s) or the
Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, shall promptly refund to the Owner
Trustee or the Owner Participant (whichever shall have made such payment) such
Excess Payment. For purposes of this Section 8(j), "Excess Payment" means the
amount by which such payment exceeds the amount which would have been received
by the holder(s) of the Certificates or the Indenture Trustee if the Owner
Trustee (in its individual capacity) or the Owner Participant has not become
subject to the recourse liability referred to in (ii) above. Nothing contained
in this Section 8(j) shall prevent the holder of a Certificate or the Indenture
Trustee from enforcing any personal recourse obligation (and retaining the
proceeds thereof) of the Owner Trustee (in its individual capacity) or the
Owner Participant under this Participation Agreement or the Trust Indenture
(and any exhibits or annexes thereto) that is expressed as being an obligation
of the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee (in its individual capacity),
respectively.

SECTION 9. Other Covenants. (a) If the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Owner Participant agrees promptly to
pay or, if previously paid by the Lessee, to reimburse the Lessee for, (x) the
initial fees of the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) all the reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, each
ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT and the Owner Participant in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the other
Operative Documents and any other documents or instruments referred to herein
or therein, including, without limitation,

Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts, special counsel for the ORIGINAL

Indenture Trustee, (C) Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon, special
counsel for the Owner Trustee, (D) Prokop & Prokop, special
Pennsylvania counsel for the Owner Trustee, and (E) Crowe & Dunlevy,

(ii) the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of White &

(iii) all other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with

one) aircraft appraiser in respect of the appraisals referred to in
Section 4, printing and document production or reproduction expenses,
all fees, taxes and other charges payable in connection with the
placement of the Certificates and with the recording or filing of the

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lessee shall pay, in amounts separately
agreed, the fees, expenses and disbursements of Debevoise & Plimpton, special
counsel for the Lessee and the fees and expenses of Babcock & Brown, the
Lessee's financial advisor.

Each of the Owner Trustee, the Lessee, the ORIGINAL LOAN
PARTICIPANTs and the Indenture Trustee shall promptly submit to the Owner
Participant copies of the invoices in respect of the foregoing transaction
costs as they are received. The Owner Participant prior to the payment thereof
will send copies of any invoices received by it with respect to any of the
foregoing fees, expenses and

54

MF-1
<PAGE> 58

disbursements constituting transaction costs to the Lessee for the Lessee's
review and approval.

In the event that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the agreements referred to herein are not consummated, the Lessee
shall bear and pay all costs, expenses and fees referred to above; provided
that if the transaction fails to be consummated as a result of failure of the
Owner Participant to fulfill its funding obligations or otherwise to close the
transaction notwithstanding the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 4 (other than the conditions set forth in paragraphs (M), (Q), (V) and
(X) thereof), then the Owner Participant shall bear and pay its own fees and
expenses and those of its counsel (including, without limitation, the fees and
expenses of its special counsel, its Bermuda counsel, MBI and its airline
advisor) and the Lessee shall pay all other reasonable transaction fees, costs
and expenses as aforesaid.

(b) The Owner Participant covenants that if (i) at any time
during which the Aircraft is registered in the United States, the Owner
Participant ceases to be a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning of
Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act and the Aircraft shall or would
thereupon become ineligible for registration in the name of the Owner Trustee
under the Federal Aviation Act as in effect at such time, and the regulations
then applicable thereunder (without regard to any "based and primarily used"
provision), or (ii) at any time during which the Aircraft is registered in a
jurisdiction other than the United States of America (A) the Lessee proposes to
register the Aircraft within four months in the United States and (B) the Owner
Participant is not a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning of
Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act and the Aircraft for that reason
would be ineligible for registration in the name of the Owner Trustee under the
Federal Aviation Act as in effect at such time and the regulations then
applicable thereunder (without regard to any "based and primarily used"
provision), then the Owner Participant at its own expense shall promptly (and,
in any event, within a period of 30 days) either transfer, pursuant to Article
VIII of the Trust Agreement and Section 16(c) hereof, such of its right, title
and interest in and to the Trust Agreement, the Trust Estate, and this
Agreement, or take such other action, as may be necessary to prevent any
deregistration of the Aircraft or to make possible its registration in the
United States of America, as the case may be, and in each case to prevent the
Lessee and the LOAN

55

MF-1
<PAGE> 59

PARTICIPANT from being adversely affected as a result thereof.

(c) Meridian Trust Company represents and warrants that it is
a "citizen of the United States" as defined in Section 101(16) of the Federal
Aviation Act and the rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation
Administration thereunder (without making use of a voting trust agreement or a
voting powers agreement). The Owner Trustee in its individual capacity
covenants that, if at any time it shall cease to be a "citizen of the United
States" within the meaning of Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act, it
will resign immediately as Owner Trustee (if and so long as such citizenship is
necessary under the Federal Aviation Act, or the law of the current
jurisdiction of the registry of the Aircraft, as the case may be, as in effect
at such time or, if it is not necessary, if and so long as the Owner Trustee's
citizenship (in its individual capacity) would have any adverse effect on the
Lessee, the Owner Participant or the LOAN PARTICIPANT), effective upon the
appointment of a successor Owner Trustee in accordance with the provisions of
Section 9.01 of the Trust Agreement. The Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity hereby unconditionally agrees with and for the benefit of the parties
to this Agreement that the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity will not
directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lessor's
Liens on or against any part of the Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate or the
Aircraft arising out of any act or omission of or claim against the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity, and the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity agrees that it will at its own cost and expense promptly take such
action as may be necessary to duly discharge and satisfy in full (i) all
Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the definition
thereof) attributable to the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity and (ii)
any other Liens attributable to the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity on
any part of the Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate which result from claims
against the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity not related to the
ownership of the Aircraft, the administration of the Trust Estate or the
Indenture Estate or the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents.
The Owner Trustee, in its individual capacity, hereby agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Lessee, the Indenture Trustee and each Participant from and
against any loss, cost or expense (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) which may be suffered or incurred by any of them as the

56

MF-1
<PAGE> 60

result of the failure of the Owner Trustee to discharge and satisfy any such
Lessor's Lien or such other Lien.

(d) Each of the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee
hereby agrees (i) with the Lessee, each LOAN PARTICIPANT, and the Indenture
Trustee to comply with all of the terms of the Trust Agreement (as the same may
hereafter be amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the
terms thereof) applicable to it in its respective capacities the noncompliance
with which would materially adversely affect any such party, (ii) with the
Lessee not to amend, supplement, or otherwise modify any provision of the Trust
Agreement in a manner adversely affecting the Lessee without the prior written
consent of the Lessee, and (iii) with the Lessee and each LOAN PARTICIPANT,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Trust Agreement, not
to terminate or revoke the trust created by the Trust Agreement without the
prior written consent of the Lessee (such consent of the Lessee not to be
unreasonably denied), and each LOAN PARTICIPANT (such consents of the LOAN
PARTICIPANTs not to be withheld unless the Lien of the Indenture would be
adversely affected by such termination or revocation), provided, that (x) the
Lessee's consent shall not be required if an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing and (y) neither the Lessee's nor any LOAN
PARTICIPANT'S consent shall be required if the Owner Trustee shall be in breach
of any of its obligations under the Trust Agreement (unless, in the case of the
LOAN PARTICIPANTs, the Lien of the Indenture would be adversely affected
thereby). Nothing in the next preceding sentence shall impair any right of
Meridian Trust Company to resign as the Owner Trustee under Section 9.01 of the
Trust Agreement. The Owner Trustee or any successor may resign or be removed
by the Owner Participant, a successor Owner Trustee may be appointed, and a
corporation may become the Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement, only in
accordance with the provisions of Article IX of the Trust Agreement. The Owner
Trustee confirms for the benefit of the Lessee that it will comply with the
provisions of Article IV of the Trust Agreement. The Owner Participant further
agrees not to remove the institution acting as Owner Trustee, and not to
replace the institution acting as Owner Trustee in the event that such
institution resigns as Owner Trustee, without in either case having obtained
the prior written consent of the Lessee (such consent not to be unreasonably
denied); provided that the Lessee's consent shall not be required if the Owner
Trustee is in breach of any of its obligations under the Trust Agreement or if
an

57

MF-1
<PAGE> 61

Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default shall have occurred and be
continuing; provided, further, that in any such event a new Owner Trustee
selected by the Owner Participant which is a United States citizen within the
meaning of Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act and, unless an Event of
Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
is reasonably acceptable to the Lessee, shall be substituted for the Owner
Trustee; and provided, further, that the Owner Participant shall not choose a
replacement Owner Trustee which, in the good faith opinion of the Lessee, may
(or, if an Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Owner Participant shall use its best efforts to
select a replacement Owner Trustee which will not) result in additional
liability to the Lessee pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof, except in the case of
a mandatory or voluntary resignation of the Owner Trustee where the Lessee has
not proposed an alternative Owner Trustee that is reasonably satisfactory to
the Owner Participant. So long as no Event of Default and no Payment or
Bankruptcy Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Owner Trustee and
the Owner Participant agree that no co-trustee or separate trustee shall be
appointed during the Term pursuant to Section 9.02 of the Trust Agreement
without the Lessee's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. The Owner Participant agrees that if, at any time, the Lessee
certifies that the Lessee has, or in the good faith opinion of the Lessee will,
become obligated to pay an amount pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof and the
amount that has or will become payable would be reduced or eliminated if the
situs of the Trust Estate were changed and if, as a consequence thereof, the
Lessee should request that the situs of the trust be moved to another state in
the United States of America from the state in which it is then located, the
Owner Participant shall direct such change in situs of the Trust Estate as may
be specified in writing by the Lessee and the Owner Participant will take
whatever action as may be reasonably necessary to accomplish such change. The
Indenture Trustee shall execute such documents and take such action as may be
necessary to effect such change in the situs of the Trust Estate; provided that
the Lien created by the Indenture with respect to the Aircraft shall continue
to be perfected and enforceable and the trust, as thus removed, will remain a
validly established trust, in each case, to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, and financing statements (including
precautionary statements) shall have

58

MF-1
<PAGE> 62

been filed in such places as necessary in order to perfect the interests
created by the Indenture and Lease.

(e) The Owner Participant agrees that, upon the request of
the Lessee, the Owner Participant will negotiate promptly in good faith with
respect to any arrangements pursuant to which the Trust Indenture may be
satisfied and discharged in respect of the Certificates in accordance with
Section 10.01 of the Trust Indenture and the Owner Trustee agrees to act upon
the instructions of the Owner Participant in connection therewith. The Owner
Trustee agrees that it will not, and the Owner Participant agrees that it will
not cause the Owner Trustee to, take any action to effect such a satisfaction
and discharge except upon the request of the Lessee made pursuant to this
Section 9(e).

(f) Subject to the provisions of Section 9 of the Lease, the
Owner Participant agrees that, in the event of the termination of the Lease
pursuant to such Section 9, the Owner Participant will pay any fees and
commissions of any broker or finder appointed by the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant, or any fees and commissions payable to the Lessee pursuant to such
Section 9, in connection with the sale of the Aircraft. In addition, the Owner
Participant agrees to pay or cause to be paid to the Lessee such amounts as are
stated to be payable by the Owner Participant to the Lessee pursuant to Section
9 or 15 of the Lease as a rebate of any Basic Rent theretofore paid under the
Lease or pursuant to Section 5(a), 5(d), 5(f), or 12 of the Lease.

(g) So long as no Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Owner Trustee shall promptly pay to
the Lessee any amounts received by it (i) from any LOAN PARTICIPANT pursuant to
Section 2.04(h) of the Trust Indenture or (ii) in respect of Break Funding Gain
under Section 2.17 of the Trust Indenture (other than any Break Funding Gain
payable with respect to the Certificates as a result of (A) any prepayment of
the Certificates or purchase of the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.13 of
the Trust Indenture or (B) an Indenture Default that does not also constitute
an Event of Default, it being agreed that any such Break Funding Gain shall be
for the account of the Owner Participant); provided that if any such amount has
been so held by the Owner Trustee as security for more than 180 days after such
Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default shall have occurred and
during which period (x) the Owner Trustee shall not have been limited by
operation of law or otherwise from

59

MF-1
<PAGE> 63

exercising remedies under the Lease or (y) the Owner Trustee shall not have
commenced to exercise any remedy available to it under Section 15 of the Lease,
then the Owner Trustee shall promptly pay such amount to the Lessee.

(h) The Owner Trustee, in its capacity as Owner Trustee, will
not incur any indebtedness for money borrowed, or enter into any business or
other activity, except as contemplated hereby and by the other Operative
Documents.

(i) Each LOAN PARTICIPANT hereby unconditionally agrees to
perform its respective obligations under the Trust Indenture (including,
without limitation, those contained in Sections 2.04, 2.17 and 2.18 of the
Trust Indenture) as though such obligations were fully set forth herein.

(j) Each LOAN PARTICIPANT hereby unconditionally agrees with
and for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement that it will not directly
or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any LOAN PARTICIPANT
Liens on or against any part of the Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate or the
Aircraft arising out of any act or omission of or claim against such LOAN
PARTICIPANT, and such LOAN PARTICIPANT agrees that it will, at its own cost and
expense, promptly take such action as may be necessary duly to discharge and
satisfy in full any such LOAN PARTICIPANT Lien.

(k) The Indenture Trustee, in its individual capacity, hereby
unconditionally agrees with and for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement that the Indenture Trustee will not directly or indirectly create,
incur, assume or suffer to exist any Liens on or against any part of the Trust
Estate, the Indenture Estate or the Aircraft arising out of any act or omission
of or claim against the Indenture Trustee, in its individual capacity, and the
Indenture Trustee, in its individual capacity, agrees that it will at its own
cost and expense promptly take such action as may be necessary duly to
discharge and satisfy in full (i) all such Liens attributable to the Indenture
Trustee and (ii) any other liens or encumbrances attributable to the Indenture
Trustee, in its individual capacity, on any part of the Trust Estate or the
Indenture Estate which result from claims against the Indenture Trustee, in its
individual capacity, not related to the administration of the Indenture Estate.
The Indenture Trustee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Lessee,
the Owner Trustee and each Participant from and

60

MF-1
<PAGE> 64

against any loss, cost or expense (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) which may be suffered or incurred by any of them as the result of the
failure of the Indenture Trustee to discharge and satisfy any such Lien or
other lien or encumbrance.

(l) The Owner Trustee agrees that any profit, income,
interest, dividend or gain realized upon the maturity, sale or other
disposition of any Permitted Investment made by the Indenture Trustee pursuant
to Section 3.07(b) of the Trust Indenture, and paid to the Lessee on behalf of
the Owner Trustee by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with the terms of such
Section 3.07(b), shall be entirely for the account of, and the sole property
of, the Lessee who, for such purposes, shall not be deemed to be acting as
agent of the Owner Trustee, and the Lessee shall have no obligation to pay over
such income, interest, dividend or gain to the Owner Trustee.

(m) The Lessee hereby agrees, for the benefit of the Owner
Participant, that the Lessee shall cause the Aircraft to be registered pursuant
to Section 7(a)(i) of the Lease under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction only
with the prior written consent of the Owner Participant, such consent not to be
unreasonably denied; provided, that if the Owner Participant shall have
consented to such registration, then the Owner Participant agrees to cooperate
with the Lessee in effecting any such foreign registration. At any time during
which the Aircraft is registered in a jurisdiction other than the United
States, the Lessee may cause the Aircraft to be registered under the laws of
the United States and the Owner Participant agrees to cooperate with the Lessee
in effecting such registration. Lessee shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of professional advisors) of the
Owner Participant and Lessor in connection with any reregistration or the
obtaining of any consent pursuant to this Section.

(n) Each LOAN PARTICIPANT hereby agrees, for the benefit of
the Lessee, to cooperate with the Lessee in effecting any foreign registration

to any such change in the country of registry of the Aircraft the following
conditions are met: (i) such LOAN PARTICIPANT shall have received a legal
opinion from counsel and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to it to
the effect that: (A) after giving effect to such change in registration, the
Lien on the Aircraft and the other

MF-1

property included in the Indenture Estate shall continue as a valid and duly
perfected lien and that all filing, recording or other action necessary to
perfect and protect the Lien of the Indenture has been accomplished (or if such
opinion cannot be given at the time by which the LOAN PARTICIPANT has been
requested to consent to a change in registration, (x) the opinion shall detail

has been taken with respect to the recording, filing,
re-recording and refiling of the Lease, the Trust Indenture,
the Trust Agreement and any supplements thereto, including any
financing or continuation statements, as is necessary to
maintain, for the 15-month period succeeding the date of such
opinion, the perfection of the security interests created
thereby and reciting the details of such action; or

(ii) that in the opinion of such counsel no such 
action is necessary to maintain, for the 15-month period 
succeeding the date of such opinion, the perfection of such 
security interests.

(D) The Lessee shall at all times maintain its corporate
existence except as permitted by Section 13(E). The Lessee will do or

preserve any right or franchise if

67

MF-1

<PAGE> 71

its Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof
is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Lessee.

carrier" within the meaning of Section 101(13) of the Federal Aviation
Act certificated under Sections 401 and 604(b) of the Federal Aviation
Act, and otherwise certificated and registered to the extent necessary
to fall within the purview of, and to provide to Lessor the benefits

(E) The Lessee shall not consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or convey, transfer or lease in one or more related
transactions all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety to
any Person, unless:

into which the Lessee is merged or the Person which acquires
by conveyance, transfer or lease all or substantially all of
the assets of the Lessee as an entirety shall be a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the United States of
America or any State or the District of Columbia, shall be a
"citizen of the United States" as defined in Section 101(16)
of the Federal Aviation Act, and shall execute and deliver to
the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant and the Indenture
Trustee an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to
each thereof containing the assumption by such successor
corporation of the due and punctual performance and observance
of each covenant and condition of this Agreement, the Lease,
the Purchase Agreement Assignment and the Tax Indemnity
Agreement and each other Operative Document to be performed or
observed by the Lessee;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such 
transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after 
notice or lapse of time, or both, would become such an Event 
of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(iii) the Lessee shall have delivered to the Owner
Trustee, the Owner Participant and the In-

68

MF-1

<PAGE> 72

denture Trustee a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer
of the Lessee, and an opinion of counsel to the Lessee (which
may be Lessee's General Counsel or other counsel satisfactory
to the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant and the Indenture
Trustee), each stating that such consolidation, merger,
conveyance, transfer or lease and the assumption agreement
mentioned in clause (i) comply with this Section 13(E) and
that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to
such transaction have been complied with (except that such
opinion need not cover the matters referred to in clause 
(ii) above and may rely, as to factual matters, on a 
certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Lessee) and, in 
the case of such opinion, that such assumption agreement has 
been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such successor
corporation, and is enforceable against such successor
corporation in accordance with its terms, except as the same
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally and by general principles of
equity.

Upon any consolidation or merger, or any conveyance, transfer
or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the Lessee as an
entirety in accordance with this Section 13(E), the successor
corporation formed by such consolidation or into which the Lessee is
merged or to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall
succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Lessee under this Agreement and the other Operative
Documents with the same effect as if such successor corporation had
been named as the Lessee herein. No such conveyance, transfer or
lease of all or substantially all of the assets of Lessee shall have
the effect of releasing Lessee or any successor corporation which
shall theretofore have become such in the manner prescribed in this
Section 13(E) from its liability hereunder. Nothing contained herein
shall permit any lease, sublease or other arrangement for the use,
operation or possession of the Aircraft except in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Lease.

Indenture Trustee, to their respective addresses or numbers set forth below the
signatures of such parties at the foot of this Agreement, or (ii) if to the
Owner Participant or any LOAN PARTICIPANT, to its address set forth in Schedule
I hereto.

SECTION 16. Certain Covenants of the Owner Participant. (a)
(i) The Owner Participant hereby unconditionally agrees with the Lessee, and
only with the Lessee (and not with any other party to this Agreement), that it
will pay or cause to be paid to the Indenture Trustee $1,345,440.50 (the
"Interim Payment Amount", subject to adjustment pursuant to the following
paragraph) on the Base Lease Commencement Date (such payment, the "Interim
Payment"). The Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee hereby direct the
Indenture Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee hereby agrees, to apply the
Interim Payment, first, to the payment of interest on the Certificates and,
second, to the payment of principal, which interest and principal may be due
and payable pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Indenture on the Base Lease
Commencement Date. The Owner Participant agrees to make the Interim Payment in
immediately available funds on or before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the
Base Lease Commencement Date. The Owner Participant agrees to give the Lessee
notice by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Base Lease Commencement Date
if it has failed to make the Interim Payment due on such date.

Although the amount of the Interim Payment has been computed
on the assumption that the Certificates will bear interest at the Assumed Debt
Rate throughout the Interim Period, the Owner Participant and the Lessee
recognize that the actual rate of interest on the Certificates may be a rate
from time to time which may be greater or less than the Assumed Debt Rate and
that the related basis upon which interest on the Certificates will be computed
will be as provided in the Trust Indenture. Accordingly, the Interim Payment
Amount shall be increased or decreased (but not below zero), as the case may
be, by an amount (the "Interim Differential Amount") equal to, as of the Base
Lease Commencement Date, the difference between (i) the aggregate amount of
interest actually due and payable on the Base Lease Commencement Date on the
Certificates, and (ii) the aggregate amount of interest on the Certificates
that would have been due and payable on the Base Lease Commencement Date if
such Certificates had borne interest at the Assumed Debt Rate for the period
from and

76

MF-1
<PAGE> 80

including the Delivery Date to but excluding the Base Lease Commencement Date.
If, as of the Base Lease Commencement Date, the amount determined in accordance
with clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be greater than the
amount determined in accordance with clause (ii) of such sentence, the Interim
Payment Amount shall be increased by the Interim Differential Amount. If, as
of the Base Lease Commencement Date, the amount determined in accordance with
such clause (ii) shall be greater than the amount determined in accordance with
such clause (i), the Interim Payment Amount shall be decreased by the Interim
Payment Differential Amount. In the event the Owner Participant fails to make
all or any part of such payment, the Lessee may seek direct reimbursement from
the Owner Participant or obtain reimbursement in the manner and to the extent
provided in Section 3(f) of the Lease for any Advance, together with interest
on such portion of such amount remaining unpaid at a rate per annum equal to
the sum of 2% and the Base Rate from (and including) the date of such Interim
Payment Date to (but excluding) the date of reimbursement by the Owner
Participant or the date the Lessee deducts such Advance from other payments to
the extent and as provided in Section 3(f) of the Lease and, without
duplication of the foregoing, shall have such remedies as may be avail-able to
it against the Owner Participant at law or in equity in respect of any such
Advance. All amounts paid to the Lessee by the Owner Participant in respect of
an Advance or deducted by the Lessee pursuant to Section 3(f) of the Lease
shall be applied first to payment to Lessee of interest and then to payment to
Lessee of amounts equal to the Advance.

(ii) The Owner Participant hereby unconditionally agrees that it
will pay or cause to be paid to the Indenture Trustee $3,275,000.00 (the
"Deferred Equity Amount"), on the Base Lease Commencement Date (the "Deferred
Equity Payment"). The Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee hereby direct
the Indenture Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee hereby agrees, to apply the
Deferred Equity Payment to the payment of principal, which principal may be due
and payable pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Indenture on such date.
The Owner Participant agrees to make the Deferred Equity Payment in immediately
available funds on or before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on such date. The
Owner Participant agrees to give the Lessee notice by 12:00 noon, New York City
time, on such date if it has failed to make the Deferred Equity Payment due on
such date. In the event the Owner Participant fails to make all or any part of
such

77

<PAGE> 81

payment, the Lessee may seek direct reimbursement from the Owner Participant or
obtain reimbursement in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 3(f)
of the Lease for any Deferred Equity Advance, together with interest on such
portion of such amount remaining unpaid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of
2% and the Base Rate from (and including) the date of such Base Lease
Commencement Date to (but excluding) the date of reimbursement by the Owner
Participant or the date the Lessee deducts such Deferred Equity Advance from
other payments to the extent and as provided in Section 3(f) of the Lease and,
without duplication of the foregoing, shall have such remedies as may be
available to it against the Owner Participant at law or in equity in respect of
any such Deferred Equity Advance. All amounts paid to the Lessee by the Owner
Participant in respect of a Deferred Equity Advance or deducted by the Lessee
pursuant to Section 3(f) of the Lease shall be applied first to payment to
Lessee of interest and then to payment to Lessee of amounts equal to the
Deferred Equity Advance.

(b) The Owner Participant hereby unconditionally agrees with
and for the benefit of the other parties to this Agreement that the Owner
Participant will not directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to
exist any Lessor's Lien attributable to it on or against any part of the Trust
Estate or the Aircraft, and the Owner Participant agrees that it will, at its
own cost and expense, take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge
and satisfy in full any such Lessor's Lien (by bonding or otherwise, so long as
Lessee's operation and use of the Aircraft is not impaired).

(c) The Owner Participant shall not directly or indirectly
assign, convey or otherwise transfer any of its right, title or interest in and
to all or any part of this Agreement, the Trust Estate, the Purchase Agreement
or any of the other Operative Documents except that the Owner Participant may
assign, convey or otherwise transfer all or any part thereof if:

(i) (A) the Person to whom such transfer is made (the
"Transferee") is a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning
of Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act without the utilization
of a voting trust agreement, voting powers agreement or similar
arrangement by the Transferee or any Affiliate thereof, and has the
requisite power, authority and legal right to enter into and carry out
the transactions

78

MF-1
<PAGE> 82

contemplated hereby; (B) such conveyance does not violate any
provisions of the Federal Aviation Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (and no registration pursuant to such Act or the rules and
regulations thereunder shall be required in connection with such
conveyance), or any other applicable law, or create a relationship
which would be in violation thereof, or result in a "prohibited
transaction" under Section 406 or 407 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code; (C) the Transferee enters into an agreement or agreements
substantially in the form of Exhibit XV hereto (the "Assumption
Agreement") for the benefit of the Lessee, the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and each Holder of a Certificate, whereby the
Transferee confirms that, to the extent of the interest so transferred
to such Transferee, such Transferee shall be deemed a party to this
Participation Agreement and each other Operative Document to which the
Owner Participant is a party, and the party named as the "Owner
Participant" in the Trust Agreement, the Lease and the Trust Indenture
and agrees to be bound by all of the terms of, and to undertake all of
the obligations of the Owner Participant contained in, this Agreement
and each other Operative Document to which the Owner Participant is a
party or by which the Owner Participant is bound, and in which the
Transferee shall make representations, warranties and covenants
substantially equivalent to those of the Owner Participant contained
herein; (D) after giving effect to such assignment, conveyance or
transfer, there would be no more than two Owner Participants; (E) the
Owner Participant shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee (unless the lien of the Trust Indenture is discharged) and the
Lessee an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee,
that the Assumption Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Transferee, constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation and is enforceable against such Transferee in accordance
with its terms, except as the same may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally or by general principles
of equity; (F) the Owner Participant shall deliver to the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee (unless the lien of the Trust Indenture
is discharged) and the Lessee one or more certificates of a duly
authorized officer of the transferror and, if necessary, transferee
Owner Participant concerning,

79

MF-1
<PAGE> 83

when taken together, all of the matters contained in clauses (A) and
(D) of this paragraph (i) and an opinion delivered by counsel of the
type referred to in clause (E) of this paragraph (i) to the effect
that such transfer complies with the provisions of clause (A) (except
as to citizenship) and clause (B) of this paragraph (i); (G) the Owner
Participant by an instrument in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Lessee (x) assumes the risk of any adverse tax
consequences to each Tax Indemnitee resulting from such conveyance and
(y) indemnifies the Lessee for any breach or other violation of the
disclosure requirements of any applicable securities laws; and (H) the
terms of the transaction are not altered other than to the extent set
forth in the foregoing clauses (A) through (G); and

(ii) either (A) the Transferee is a bank or lending institution
with a combined capital and surplus of at least $75,000,000, or is a
domestic corporation or other domestic entity, other than a
partnership, with a net worth of at least $75,000,000, exclusive of
goodwill, all of the foregoing determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (hereinafter referred to as a
"Qualifying Institution"), or (B) if the Transferee is not itself a
Qualifying Institution, a parent corporation of the Transferee which
qualifies as a Qualifying Institution shall have executed and
delivered to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee (unless the lien
of the Trust Indenture has been discharged) and the Lessee an absolute
and unconditional guaranty, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Lessee, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Trustee (in its individual capacity), with respect to the obligations
of the Transferee as the Owner Participant assumed by the Transferee
under the Assumption Agreement referred to above, and the Transferee
shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee (unless the lien of the Trust
Indenture is discharged), the Lessee and the Owner Trustee an opinion
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee that such guaranty
has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the guarantor,
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation and is enforceable
against the guarantor in accordance with its terms.

80

MF-1
<PAGE> 84

If at any time any Owner Participant is an institution the
obligations of which were guaranteed at the time such Owner Participant became
an Owner Participant hereunder by a parent entity that was at such time a
Qualifying Institution (the "Owner Participant Guarantor"), any transfer by
direct sale, consolidation, merger or otherwise of 50% or more of the capital
stock of the Owner Participant (including, for this purpose, any such transfer
of the capital stock of any one of its direct or indirect parent companies or
other parent entities, other than its ultimate parent entity, any such transfer
being referred to as a "Change in Control") shall be deemed to be a conveyance
by such Owner Participant of its interests in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement subject to this Section 16(c), and accordingly no such Change in
Control shall take place without the Lessee's consent unless (x) it satisfies
the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 16(c), including without
limitation those set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above or (y) following a
Change in Control, the Transferee remains both a member of the controlled or
consolidated group of companies of which the Owner Participant Guarantor is a
part and an Affiliate of the Owner Participant Guarantor, and such guaranty of
the Owner Participant Guarantor is confirmed by the Owner Participant Guarantor
as being, or amended to remain, in full force and effect in respect of the
Transferee and the Transferee delivers to the Indenture Trustee (unless the
lien of the Trust Indenture is discharged) and the Lessee a certificate of a
duly authorized officer of the Owner Participant or the Owner Participant
Guarantor as to the continued legality, validity and enforceability of such
guaranty.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in no event shall the Owner
Participant assign, convey or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly, any
such interest without the Lessee's consent prior to the payment of all amounts
required to be paid by it pursuant to Section 16(a) hereof or if it is in
default in respect of any of its obligations under Section 16(a) and (ii) as
long as the Lease is in effect, there shall not be more than five transfers
(including as a transfer any Change in Control permitted under the next
preceding sentence) by the Owner Participant (including its successors and
permitted assigns) pursuant to this Section 16(c) without the prior written
consent of the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee. As between the parties
hereto, the transferring Owner Participant will pay or cause the transferee
Owner Participant to pay any fees, charges

81

MF-1
<PAGE> 85

and expenses incurred by the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Lessee
in connection with any transfer pursuant to this Section 16(c), including,
without limitation, the out-of-pocket expenses of the Lessee and its reasonable
legal fees and expenses, and in no case will the Lessee be responsible for any
such fees, charges or expenses. Without the consent of the Lessee, no transfer
shall be permitted pursuant to this Section 16(c) to a Transferee that is an
airline or other commercial operator of aircraft or a corporation or other
entity that is an Affiliate of such an airline or other commercial operator of
aircraft.

Upon any such conveyance by the Owner Participant to a
Transferee permitted by this Section 16(c), the Transferee shall be deemed the
"Owner Participant" for all purposes hereof (unless the context is
inappropriate) and shall be deemed to have made to the extent of such transfer
all the investments in beneficial ownership of the Aircraft previously made by
the Owner Participant in respect of the right, title and interest so conveyed;
and each reference in this Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Lease, the Tax
Indemnity Agreement, the Trust Indenture and the other Operative Documents to
the Owner Participant making the transfer shall thereafter be deemed a
reference to the Transferee as the Owner Participant (unless the context is
inappropriate). Upon any such conveyance by the Owner Participant to a
Transferee permitted by the foregoing provisions of this Section 16(c), the
transferror Owner Participant shall be relieved of all of its liabilities and
obligations hereunder and under the Trust Agreement to the extent of the
interest so transferred, provided that in no event will any such conveyance
release the transferror Owner Participant from any liability on account of any
breach existing at the time of such conveyance by the Owner Participant of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations contained herein,
in the Trust Agreement or any other Operative Document. If the Owner
Participant proposes to transfer its interests pursuant to this Section 16(c),
it shall give 20 days (unless the Transferee is an Affiliate of the Owner
Participant making the transfer, in which case the Owner Participant will
notify the Lessee, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee of such transfer
within 10 days of such transfer) prior written notice thereof to the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Lessee, specifying the name and address
of the transferee and specifying the facts necessary

82

MF-1
<PAGE> 86

to determine whether the conditions of this paragraph (c) have been or shall be
satisfied.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
16(c), there shall be no restriction on the Owner Participant's right to
transfer all or any part of its interests if an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, provided, that after any such Event of Default, the
Owner Participant shall not be entitled to transfer such interests unless
either (i) the conditions to transfer set forth in this Section 16(c) (other
than any conditions requiring the satisfaction of, or notice to or consent of,
the Lessee, and other than conditions relating solely to the Lessee) shall have
been satisfied or (ii) the Indenture Trustee and the LOAN PARTICIPANTs shall
have consented thereto, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld.

SECTION 17. Optional Redemption of Certificates. (a) So
long as no Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Lessee shall have the right to request the
Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee to effect an optional redemption of all
of the Certificates (the "Outstanding Certificates," such term to include the
Certificates originally issued under the Trust Indenture and any refunding
indebtedness issued pursuant to this Section 17 or Section 20) pursuant to
Section 2.12 of the Trust Indenture as part of a refunding or refinancing
operation (such refunding referred to herein as a "Section 17 Refunding").
Promptly on receipt of such request, the Owner Participant will negotiate in
good faith to conclude an agreement or agreements with the Lessee as to the
terms of such refunding or refinancing operation (it being understood that,
without limiting the Owner Participant's obligation to negotiate in good faith
as aforesaid, the Owner Participant shall not be obligated to enter into any
such agreements in connection with such a refunding or refinancing operation
unless terms and conditions customary in aircraft leveraged lease refundings or
refinancings shall have been satisfied) and upon such agreement:

(i) the Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee, and any other appropriate parties will enter into a
financing or loan agreement (which may involve an underwriting
agreement in connection with a public offering; provided, however,
that in the case of a refunding or refinancing involving a public
offering of debt securities, the

83

MF-1
<PAGE> 87

Owner Participant shall not be named in any prospectus distributed in
connection therewith (unless the Owner Participant shall at the time
consent thereto) and Lessee shall have the right to purchase such debt
securities and apply such debt securities as a credit against its
obligations to pay Rent, so long as Lessee shall at no time hold all
or substantially all of such debt securities and, for the purpose of
any vote of such debt securities, any such debt securities held by the
Lessee shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding)
providing for (x) the issuance and sale by the Owner Trustee or such
other party as may be appropriate to such institution or institutions
on the date specified in such agreement (for the purposes of this
Section 17, the "Refunding Date") of debt securities in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Outstanding
Certificates on the Refunding Date and (y) the application of the
proceeds of the sale of such debt securities to the redemption of all
such Certificates on the Refunding Date;

(ii) the Lessee and the Owner Trustee will amend the Lease such
that (w) if the Refunding Date is not a Lease Period Date, the Lessee
shall on the Refunding Date prepay that portion of the next succeeding
installment of Basic Rent as shall equal the aggregate interest
accrued on the Outstanding Certificates to the Refunding Date
(provided that if the Refunding Date occurs on or prior to the Base
Lease Commencement Date, the Owner Participant shall, on the Refunding
Date prepay that portion of the amounts payable by it as the Interim
Payment Amount pursuant to Section 16(a)(i) as shall equal the
aggregate interest accrued on the Outstanding Certificates to the
Section 17 Refunding Date and shall prepay the amounts payable by it
as the Deferred Equity Amount pursuant to Section 16(a)(ii)), (x) Basic
Rent payable in respect of the period from and after the Refunding
Date shall be recalculated to preserve the Owner Participant's Revised 
Net Economic Return taking into account all reasonable fees, costs and
expenses of such refunding or refinancing paid by the Owner
Participant, (y) amounts payable in respect of Stipulated Loss Value
and Termination Value from and after the Refunding Date shall be
appropriately recalculated to preserve the Owner Participant's
Revised Net Economic Return, and the Special Purchase Price Percentage
and the Special Purchase Option Date shall

84

MF-1
<PAGE> 88

be recalculated as provided in Section 18, and z) in the event that 
the debt instruments issued in such refunding or refinancing 
transaction are denominated in a foreign currency (it being understood
that the terms of any such foreign denominated loan and the provisions
of the operative documents relating thereto are to be reasonably 
acceptable to the Owner Participant), those portions of Basic Rent, 
Termination Value and Stipulated Loss Value payments allocable to the 
payments required to be made in a foreign currency with respect to 
such debt instruments shall likewise be denominated in and made in 
such currency or, in the alternative, the Lessee shall indemnify the 
Owner Participant against any losses resulting from foreign currency 
exchange rate fluctuations; and

(iii) the Owner Trustee will enter into an agreement to provide
for the securing thereunder of the debt securities issued by the Owner
Trustee pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 17 in like manner as
the Certificates issuable under the Trust Indenture and/or will enter
into such amendments and supplements to the Trust Indenture effective
as of the date of the relevant refunding or refinancing, as may be
necessary to effect such refunding or refinancing, provided that no
such amendment or supplement will increase or impair the rights of the
Owner Participant under the Operative Documents without the consent of
the Owner Participant; 

provided, however, that (x) there shall be no more than two such
refundings or refinancings (not including any refunding or refinancing of
temporary bridge financing, if any, or the Section 20 Refinancing), (y) Lessee
shall pay the Owner Participant a fee of $25,000 in connection with each
refunding or refinancing pursuant to this Section 17 occurring subsequent to
the first such refunding or refinancing, and (z) if within 20 days after
receipt of a request from the Lessee to effect a refunding or refinancing
pursuant to this Section 17, which request specifies the proposed structural
terms and the amount thereof, the Owner Participant provides the Lessee with a
written opinion of independent tax counsel selected by the Owner Participant
and reasonably acceptable to the Lessee to the effect that there will be a
material risk or increase in risk of adverse tax consequences to the Owner
Participant resulting from the refunding or refinancing (other than the
consequence that the refinanced loan constitutes "qualified nonrecourse

85

MF-1
<PAGE> 89

indebtedness" within the meaning of Temporary Regulations Section 1.861-10T(b)
unless there shall have occurred a relevant Tax Change), then the Owner Trustee
and the Owner Participant shall be required to effect such refunding or
refinancing only if the Lessee shall have agreed to indemnify the Owner
Participant against such identified adverse tax consequences in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant; provided, however, the
parties agree that in the absence of a relevant amendment to, or change in, the
Code or any other Federal tax statute or any regulation promulgated under any
of the foregoing (or official interpretation of any of the foregoing) after the
execution and delivery of the Participation Agreement a refinancing or
refunding as such will not result in any such risk.

(b) The Certificates, and any other debt instruments issued
in connection with any refunding or refinancing operation permitted by this
Section 17, shall not be subject to optional redemption by the Owner Trustee
without the consent of the Lessee, except as provided in the Indenture.

SECTION 18. Calculation of Adjustments to Basic Rent,
Stipulated Loss Value, Termination Value, etc.; Confirmation and Verification.
(a) Calculation of Adjustments. In the event that (A) the expenses paid by
the Owner Participant pursuant to Section 9(a) hereof (except for any expenses
paid or payable to any financial advisor to the Owner Participant) (the
"Transaction Costs") are not equal to 1.0% of Lessor's Cost, or (B) prior to
the acceptance of the Aircraft on the Delivery Date: (1) there shall have
occurred a Tax Change and (2) after having been advised in writing by the Owner
Participant of such Tax Change and the proposed adjustment to the payments of
Basic Rent resulting therefrom, Lessee shall have waived its right under
Section 11 hereof to decline to proceed with the transaction, or (C) a
refinancing or refunding as contemplated by Section 17 hereof occurs, or (D)
the Delivery Date is other than May 28, 1992, or (E) if the Certificates are
not refunded or refinanced on or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date, the
Interim Payment Amount (after adjustment for any Interim Payment Differential
Amount) is other than $1,345,440.50, or (F) any amount is paid by Lessee to the
Owner Participant pursuant to the Tax Indemnity Agreement, or (G) if the
Certificates are not refunded or refinanced on or prior to the Base Lease
Commencement Date, the Deferred Equity Amount is other than

86

MF-1
<PAGE> 90

$3,275,000.00 then the Owner Participant shall recalculate the payments of
Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values, Termination Values, and, if the Refunding
Date occurs on or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date, the Interim
Payment Amount payable pursuant to Section 16(a) hereof (such recalculation of
the Interim Payment Amount to take into account any prepayment by the Owner
Participant on such Refunding Date of all or part of the Interim Payment Amount
under clause (w) of Section 17(a)(ii)) (or, in the case of an event described
in clause (F) above, payments of Stipulated Loss Values and Termination Values
only) with respect to the Term (i) to preserve the Owner Participant's Net
Economic Return (or, in the case of a Section 17 Refunding or any event
occurring subsequent to a Section 20 Refinancing, the Owner Participant's
Revised Net Economic Return) and (ii) to minimize, to the greatest extent
possible, consistent with the foregoing clause (i), the present value
(discounted semiannually at an interest rate per annum to be supplied by the
Lessee) of (1) the payments of Basic Rent or, at Lessee's option, (2) the
payments of Basic Rent scheduled to be paid prior to the Special Purchase
Option Date and the Special Purchase Price. In addition, (x) in the event of a
Section 17 Refunding, the Special Purchase Price Percentage and the Special
Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated in a manner consistent with the
procedures specified in Section 20(c) and (y) with respect to an event
described in clause (A), (B), (D), (E) or (G) of the preceding sentence, the
Special Purchase Price Percentage as of any date shall be recalculated such
that the Special Purchase Price equals the greatest of (i) the appraised value
of the Aircraft as of such date as set forth in Exhibit E to the Rent Schedule,
(ii) 103% of the sum of the present values, as of the Special Purchase Option
Date (as the same may have been adjusted theretofore), of (a) Basic Rent
payable with respect to the period from such Special Purchase Option Date to
and including the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Base Lease Commencement Date
and (b) an amount equal to 53% of Lessor's Cost (such present value calculation
to utilize a discount rate equal to 13.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually),
(iii) 103% of the amount that preserves Original After-Tax Yield as of such
date and (iv) the amount that satisfies the aggregate after-tax cash flow and
after-tax yield (using the multiple investment sinking fund method of
calculation) constraints used by the Owner Participant in its pricing
assumptions to determine the alternate Special Purchase Price Percentage
(contained in the Optimal File), such constraints and such alternate Special
Purchase Price Percentage having been furnished to

87

MF-1
<PAGE> 91

the Lessee and placed in escrow with White & Case. In performing any such
recalculations, the Owner Participant shall utilize the same methods and
assumptions originally used to calculate the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated
Loss Values, Termination Values with respect to the Term (or, in the case of
any Section 17 Refunding, the same methods and assumptions originally used by
the original Owner Participant in the calculation of the alternate schedules
referred to in the definition of the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic
Return and the Special Purchase Price Percentage and held in escrow by White &
Case pursuant to Section 18(d)) (in each case as such assumptions may be
changed as a result of the event described in clause (A), (B), (C), (D), (E),
(F) or (G) of the second preceding sentence necessitating such recalculation or
due to the prior occurrence of any such event or the prior occurrence of the
Section 20 Refinancing (except that the amortization schedule in the Optimal
File shall not be adjusted in the case of an event of the type specified in
Section 3(e)(iii) of the Lease)).

(b) Confirmation and Verification. Upon completion of any
recalculation described above in Section 18(a), a duly authorized officer of
the Owner Participant shall provide a certificate to the Lessee either (x)
stating that the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values and Termination
Values with respect to the Term and, in the case of the second sentence of
Section 18(a), the Special Purchase Price Percentage, as are then set forth in
the Lease do not require change, or (y) setting forth such adjustments to the
payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values or Termination Values with
respect to the Term and, in the case of the second sentence of Section 18(a),
the Special Purchase Price Percentage, as have been calculated by the Owner
Participant in accordance with Section 18(a) above and Section 3(e) of the
Lease. Such certificate shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for any
such adjustments. If the Lessee shall so request, the recalculation of any
such adjustments described in this Section 18 shall be verified by, at Lessee's
option, (i) Babcock & Brown or (ii) a nationally-recognized firm of independent
accountants selected by the Lessee and reasonably acceptable to the Owner
Participant. A representative of such firm shall be shown, on a confidential
basis, the original assumptions used by the Owner Participant and held in
escrow by White & Case pursuant to Section 18(d) and the methods used by the
Owner Participant in the original calculation of and any recalculation of,
Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values and

88

MF-1
<PAGE> 92

Termination Values and, in the case of the second sentence of Section 18(a),
the Special Purchase Price Percentage (or, in the case of any recalculation
hereunder in connection with a Section 17 Refunding, the same methods and
assumptions originally used by the original Owner Participant in the
calculation of the alternate schedules referred to in the definition of the
Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return and the Special Purchase Price
Percentage in connection with a Section 17 Refunding, held in escrow by White &
Case pursuant to Section 18(d)). The reasonable costs of such verification
shall be borne by the Lessee, unless as a result of such verification process
the payments of Basic Rent are adjusted and such adjustment causes (i) the
present value of the payments of Basic Rent, discounted semi-annually at the
Assumed Debt Rate to decline by 7.5 basis points or more from the present value
of the payments of Basic Rent, discounted semi-annually at the Assumed Debt
Rate, certified by the Owner Participant pursuant to this Section 18(b) or (ii)
any Stipulated Loss Value or Termination Value percentage or, in the case of
the second sentence of Section 18(a), the Special Purchase Price Percentage, to
be materially below that certified by the Owner Participant pursuant to this
Section 18(b), in which case the Owner Participant shall be responsible for the
reasonable costs of such verification.

(c) Limitation on Adjustments. No adjustment may be made to
the payments of Basic Rent or to Stipulated Loss Values or Termination Values,
unless (i) each installment of Basic Rent (together with any Advance payable
under Section 3(f) of the Lease and any payment made by the Owner Participant
under Section 16(a)), as so adjusted, under any circumstances and in any event,
will be in an amount at least sufficient for the Owner Trustee to pay in full
as of the due date of such installment any payment of principal of and interest
on the Certificates required to be paid on the due date of such installment of
Basic Rent and (ii) Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value, as so
adjusted, under any circumstances and in any event, will be an amount which,
together with any other amounts required to be paid by the Lessee under the
Lease in connection with an Event of Loss or a termination of the Lease, as the
case may be, will be at least sufficient to pay in full, as of the date of
payment thereof, the aggregate unpaid principal of and all unpaid interest on
the Certificates accrued to the date on which Stipulated Loss Value or
Termination Value, as the case may be, is paid in accordance with the terms of
the Lease.

(d) Escrow. The Owner Participant agrees to place in escrow
with White & Case, and to cause White & Case to retain, (i) the assumptions and
methods utilized by the Owner Participant in the calculation of the schedules
of Basic Rent, Termination Value and Stipulated Loss Value referred to in the
definition of the Owner Participant's Net Economic Return, and in the
calculation of the Special Purchase Price Percentage as of the Delivery Date,
(ii) the assumptions and methods utilized by the Owner Participant in the
calculation of the alternate schedules of Basic Rent, Termination Value and
Stipulated Loss Value referred to in the definition of the Owner Participant's
Revised Net Economic Return, together with such alternate schedules, and the
Special Purchase Price Percentage applicable to a lease financing accomplished
pursuant to such alternate schedules, copies of which alternate schedules and
such Special Purchase Price Percentage have been provided to the Lessee, and
(iii) any adjustments made to any of the assumptions referred to in clause (i)
or (ii) of this sentence to take into account the effect of any change of the
type specified in Section 3(e) of the Lease which theretofore has resulted in
an adjustment of the percentages of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value,
Termination Value or Special Purchase Price Percentage (except that the
amortization schedule in the Optimal File shall not be adjusted in the case of
an event of the type specified in Section 3(e)(iii) of the Lease). In
connection with the foregoing, the Owner Participant will provide White & Case
with such supporting documents and materials, and access to such computer
programs and/or software, as would be complete and sufficient, without more, to
enable the verification, as contemplated by Section 18(b), of any calculations
made by the Owner Participant under this Section 18 or Section 20.

SECTION 19. Concerning the Owner Trustee. Meridian Trust
Company is entering into this Agreement solely in its capacity as Owner Trustee
under the Trust Agreement and not in its individual capacity (except as
expressly stated herein) and in no case shall Meridian Trust Company (or any
entity acting as successor Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement) be
personally liable for or on account of any of the statements, representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations stated to be those of the Owner Trustee
hereunder, provided, however, that Meridian Trust Company (or any such
successor Owner Trustee) shall be personally liable hereunder for its own gross
negligence or its simple negligence in the handling of money or willful
misconduct or for its breach of its covenants,

90

MF-1
<PAGE> 94

representations and warranties contained herein, to the extent covenanted or
made in its individual capacity.

SECTION 20. Section 20 Refinancing. (a) In addition to the
provisions set forth in Section 17, whether or not a refunding or refinancing
pursuant to such Section 17 shall have previously occurred, at any time the
Lessee shall have the right to request the Owner Participant and the Owner
Trustee to effect an optional redemption of all of the Outstanding Certificates
as part of a refunding or refinancing operation with refinancing indebtedness
with respect to which the final maturity date is more than six months after the
final maturity date of the Outstanding Certificates (such refinancing
hereinafter referred to as the "Section 20 Refinancing"). Promptly on receipt
of such request (which request shall specifically designate such refinancing as
the Section 20 Refinancing), the Owner Participant will, in good faith, use all
reasonable efforts to conclude an agreement or agreements with the Lessee as to
the terms of such Section 20 Refinancing (it being understood that, without
limiting the Owner Participant's obligation to use all reasonable efforts as
aforesaid, the Owner Participant shall not be obligated to enter into any such
agreements in connection with such a refinancing operation unless terms and
conditions customary in similar aircraft leveraged lease refinancings shall
have been satisfied) and upon such agreement:

(i) the Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee, and any other appropriate parties will enter into a 
financing or loan agreement (which may involve an underwriting agreement in 
connection with a public offering; provided, however, that in the case of a 
refunding or refinancing involving a public offering of debt securities, the 
Owner Participant shall not be named in any prospectus distributed in connection
therewith (unless the Owner Participant shall at the time consent thereto) and
Lessee shall have the right to purchase such debt securities and apply such
debt securities as a credit against its obligations to pay Rent, so long as
Lessee shall at no time hold all or substantially all of such debt securities
and, for the purpose of any vote of such debt securities, any such debt
securities held by the Lessee shall be disregarded and deemed not to be
outstanding) providing for (x) the issuance and sale by the Owner Trustee or
such other party as may be appropriate to such institution or institutions on
the date specified in such agreement (for the purposes of this Section 20, the
"Section 20 Refunding Date") of debt

91

securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of
the Outstanding Certificates on the Section 20 Refunding Date and (y) the
application of the proceeds of the sale of such debt securities to the
redemption of all such Certificates on the Section 20 Refunding Date;

(ii) the Lessee and the Owner Trustee will amend the Lease 
such that (w) if the Section 20 Refunding Date is not a Lease Period Date, the 
Lessee shall on the Section 20 Refunding Date prepay that portion of the next 
succeeding installment of Basic Rent as shall equal the aggregate interest 
accrued on the Outstanding Certificates to the Section 20 Refunding Date, 
provided that if the Section 20 Refunding Date occurs on or prior to the Base 
Lease Commencement Date, the Owner Participant shall prepay that portion of the 
amounts payable by it as the Interim Payment Amount pursuant to Section 16(a) 
as shall equal the aggregate interest accrued on the Outstanding Certificates 
to the Section 20 Refunding Date and shall prepay the amounts payable by it as 
the Deferred Equity Amount pursuant to Section 16(a), (x) Basic Rent payable 
in respect of the period from and after the Section 20 Refunding Date shall be 
recalculated pursuant to Section 20(c) to preserve the Owner Participant's 
Revised Net Economic Return taking into account all reasonable fees, costs and 
expenses of such refunding or refinancing paid by the Owner Participant, (y) 
amounts payable in respect of Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value from 
and after the Section 20 Refunding Date shall be appropriately recalculated
pursuant to Section 20(c) to preserve the Owner Participant's Revised Net
Economic Return, and the Special Purchase Price Percentage and the Special
Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated as provided in Section 20(c), and
(z) in the event that the debt instruments issued in such refunding or
refinancing transaction are denominated in a foreign currency (it being
understood that the terms of any such foreign denominated loan and the
provisions of the operative documents relating thereto are to be reasonably
acceptable to the Owner Participant), those portions of Basic Rent, Termination
Value and Stipulated Loss Value payments allocable to the payments required to
be made in a foreign currency with respect to such debt instruments shall
likewise be denominated in and made in such currency or, in the alternative,
the Lessee shall indemnify the Owner Participant against any losses resulting
from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and

92

<PAGE> 96

(iii) the Owner Trustee will enter into an agreement to 
provide for the securing thereunder of the debt securities issued by the Owner 
Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 20 in like manner as the 
Certificates issuable under the Trust Indenture and/or will enter into such 
amendments and supplements to the Trust Indenture as may be necessary to 
effect such refunding or refinancing;

provided, however, that if within 10 days after receipt of a request from the
Lessee to effect a refunding or refinancing pursuant to this Section 20, which
request specifies the proposed structural terms and the amount thereof, the
Owner Participant provides the Lessee with a written opinion of independent tax
counsel selected by the Owner Participant and reasonably acceptable to the
Lessee to the effect that there will be a material risk or increase in risk of
adverse tax consequences to the Owner Participant resulting from the refunding
or refinancing (other than the consequence that the refinanced loan constitutes
"qualified nonrecourse indebtedness" within the meaning of Temporary
Regulations Section 1.861-10T(b)), then the Owner Trustee and the Owner
Participant shall be required to effect such refunding or refinancing only if
the Lessee shall have agreed to indemnify the Owner Participant against such
identified adverse tax consequences in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Owner Participant; provided, further, the parties agree that in the absence of
a relevant Tax Change (x) a refinancing or refunding as such will not result in
any such risk and (y) applying the requirements of Rev. Proc. 75-21, 1975-1
C.B. 715, including as applied for purposes of section 467 of the Code, in the
manner described in Section 20(c) will not result in any such risk.

Each of the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, each LOAN
PARTICIPANT and the Indenture Trustee agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
facilitate the Section 20 Refinancing, including, without limitation, by making
such modifications to, or entering into such amendments and supplements to, the
Operative Documents as may be appropriate or necessary to effect the Section 20
Refinancing.

(b) The Section 20 Refinancing shall not constitute a
refunding or refinancing for the purposes of Section 17. Any debt instruments
issued in connection with the Section 20 Refinancing shall not be subject to
optional redemption by the Owner Trustee without the consent of the Lessee,
except as specified in the Indenture.

<PAGE> 97

(c) In connection with the Section 20 Refinancing, the Owner
Participant shall recalculate the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss
Values and Termination Values with respect to the Term and, if the Section 20
Refunding Date occurs on or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date, the
Interim Payment Amount payable pursuant to Section 16(a) hereof (such
recalculation of the Interim Payment Amount to take into account any prepayment
by the Owner Participant on such Section 20 Refunding Date of all or part of
the Interim Payment Amount under clause (w) of Section 20(a)(ii)), (i) to
achieve the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return, and (ii) to
minimize, to the greatest extent possible consistent with the foregoing clause
(i), the present value (discounted semiannually at an interest rate per annum
to be supplied by the Lessee) of (1) the payments of Basic Rent or, at Lessee's
option, (2) the payments of Basic Rent scheduled to be paid prior to the
Special Purchase Option Date and the Special Purchase Price. In addition, in
such event, the Special Purchase Price Percentage shall be recalculated such
that the Special Purchase Price equals the greatest of (i) the appraised value
of the Aircraft as of such date as set forth in Exhibit E to the Rent Schedule,
(ii) 103% of the sum of the present values, as of the adjusted Special Purchase
Option Date, of (a) Basic Rent payable with respect to the period from such
Special Purchase Option Date to and including the twenty-fourth anniversary of
the Base Lease Commencement Date and (b) the amount equal to 53% of Lessor's
Cost (such present value calculation to utilize a discount rate equal to 13.5%
per annum, compounded semi-annually), (iii) 103% of the amount that preserves
Original After-Tax Yield as of such date and (iv) the amount that satisfies the
aggregate after-tax cash flow and after-tax yield (using the multiple
investment sinking fund method of calculation) constraints used by the Owner
Participant in its pricing assumptions to determine the alternate Special
Purchase Price Percentage (contained in the Optimal File), such constraints and
such alternate Special Purchase Price Percentage having been furnished to the
Lessee and placed in escrow with White & Case; provided, that the Special
Purchase Option Date shall be changed (and that the Special Purchase Price
Percentage be recalculated as of such changed date) to whichever of the five
Lease Period Dates preceding the Special Purchase Option Date or the five Lease
Period Dates following the Special Purchase Option Date (each, an "Alternate
Special Purchase Option Date") would result in the lowest possible sum of (1)
the present value (discounted semiannually at an interest rate per annum to be
supplied by the Lessee) of the payments

94

MF-1
<PAGE> 98

of Basic Rent for the period from the Section 20 Refunding Date to and
including the applicable Alternate Special Purchase Option Date (but excluding
any Basic Rent designated as payable in advance on such Alternate Special
Purchase Option Date) and (2) the present value (discounted semiannually at an
interest rate per annum to be supplied by the Lessee) of the Special Purchase
Price as of such Alternate Special Purchase Option Date, and, if necessary, the
Lease shall be amended to reflect the change in the Special Purchase Option
Date from November 26, 2008 to whichever of the Alternate Special Purchase
Option Dates as would give rise to the lowest such sum. It is further agreed
that, in the case of the Section 20 Refinancing, the requirements of Section
5.01 of Rev. Proc. 75-21, 1975-1 C.B. 715, including as applied for purposes
of Section 467 of the Code, shall be applied, if possible, from the Base Lease
Commencement Date (using the Assumed Rent (as defined below) with respect to
periods prior to the Section 20 Refunding Date) and, if necessary, by adjusting
any payment of Basic Rent not due prior to the Section 20 Refunding Date
(including, if necessary, the payment of Basic Rent immediately succeeding the
Section 20 Refunding Date). For purposes of this Section 20, "Assumed Rent"
for each Lease Year or portion thereof shall mean the payments of Basic Rent
(prior to the adjustments contemplated by this Section 20) allocated to such
year or such portion under the Lease (computed assuming that the Loan
Certificates actually accrued interest at the Assumed Debt Rate, i.e., as set
forth in Exhibit D-1 to the Lease) and "Lease Year" shall mean any annual
period during the Basic Term commencing on the Base Lease Commencement Date or
on any anniversary of the Base Lease Commencement Date. In performing any such
recalculations in respect of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value and Termination
Value, the Owner Participant shall utilize the same methods and assumptions
originally used to calculate the alternate schedules of Basic Rent, Stipulated
Loss Values and Termination Values referred to in the definition of the Owner
Participant's Revised Net Economic Return and in performing any such
recalculations in respect of the Special Purchase Price Percentage, the Owner
Participant shall, subject to the proviso to the third preceding sentence,
utilize the same methods and assumptions originally used to calculate the
Special Purchase Price Percentage held in escrow by White & Case pursuant to
Section 18(d).

Upon completion of any recalculation described above in this
Section 20(c), a duly authorized officer of the Owner Participant shall provide
a certificate to the

95

MF-1
<PAGE> 99

Lessee either (x) stating that the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss
Values and Termination Values with respect to the Term, and the Special
Purchase Price Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date, as are then set
forth in the Lease do not require change, or (y) setting forth such adjustments
to the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values or Termination Values
with respect to the Term and the Special Purchase Price Percentage and the
Special Purchase Option Date, as have been calculated by the Owner Participant
in accordance with the above provisions. Such certificate shall describe in
reasonable detail the basis for any such adjustments. If the Lessee shall so
request, the recalculation of any such adjustments described in this Section 20
shall be verified by procedures substantially identical to the verification
procedures set forth in Section 18(b). No adjustment may be made to the
payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values or Termination Values with
respect to the Term pursuant to this Section 20 except in accordance with the
provisions of Section 18(c) and this Section 20.

SECTION 21. Miscellaneous. (a) Nothing contained in this
Agreement (including Section 7(b) hereof), the Lease, the Trust Indenture, the
Trust Agreement or the Tax Indemnity Agreement shall be construed as a
guarantee by the Lessee of payments due pursuant to the Certificates or of the
residual value or useful life of the Aircraft or any portion thereof.

(b) Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited and
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. This Agreement may be
executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall
together constitute but one and the same instrument. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended, supplemented, waived or
modified orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party
against whom the enforcement of the termination, amendment, supplement, waiver
or modification is sought; and no such termination, amendment, supplement,
waiver or modification shall be effective unless a signed copy thereof shall
have been delivered to the Lessee, the

96

Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee. The section and paragraph headings in
this Agreement and the index preceding this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not modify, define, expand or limit any of the terms
or provisions hereof and all references herein to numbered sections, unless
otherwise indicated, are to sections of this Agreement. This Agreement is made
solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and the terms of this Agreement
shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Lessee and,
subject to the terms of Section 13(E) hereof, its successors and permitted
assigns, the Indenture Trustee under the Trust Indenture, the Owner Trustee and
its successors as Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement and the Owner
Participant and, subject to the provisions of Section 16(c) hereof, its
successors and permitted assigns, and the ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANTs and,
subject to the provisions of Section 8(h) hereof, the other LOAN PARTICIPANTs.
Each LOAN PARTICIPANT other than an ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT, by its
acceptance of any Certificate, shall be deemed to have irrevocably and
unconditionally agreed to perform the obligations of a LOAN PARTICIPANT
hereunder and under the Trust Indenture.

(c) The representations, warranties, indemnities and
agreements of the Lessee, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, each LOAN
PARTICIPANT and the Owner Participant provided for in this Agreement, and the
Lessee's, the Owner Trustee's, the Indenture Trustee's, each LOAN PARTICIPANT'S
and the Owner Participant's obligations under this Agreement, shall survive the
making available of the respective Commitments by the Participants, the
delivery of the Aircraft and the expiration or other termination (to the extent
arising prior to such expiration or termination) of this Agreement and the
other Operative Documents.

THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND SHALL IN ALL
RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND
PERFORMANCE.

"(h) So long as no Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Owner Trustee shall,
promptly upon receipt of monies from the Loan Trustee pursuant to
Section 7.01 or 10.04 of the Trust Indenture, pay such monies to the
Lessee; provided that, if such Event of Default as specified in
Sections 14(b), 14(c), 14(d) or 14(e) of the Lease shall have occurred
and is continuing, no such monies may be withheld from the Lessee by
the Owner Trustee for more than 90 days, during which period (i) the

available to it under Section 15 of the Lease."

"(i) [Intentionally Omitted]."

"(j) If (i) all or any part of the Trust Estate becomes the
property of, or the Owner Participant becomes, a debtor subject to the
reorganization provisions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 or any
successor provision, (ii) pursuant to such reorganization provisions
the Owner Trustee (in its individual capacity) or the Owner
Participant is required, by reason of the Owner Trustee (in its

shall have received written notice that the payment constitutes an
Excess Payment prior to the time such payment is distributed by the
Pass Through Trustee or the Loan Trustee; provided that no such
distribution shall be made prior to a date which is at least five
Business Days after the Pass Through Trustee or the Loan Trustee, as
the case may be, shall have given written notice to the Owner
Participant that such distribution will take place, then the Pass
Through

5

Series AA
<PAGE> 6

Trustee or the Loan Trustee, as the case may be, shall promptly refund
to the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant (whichever shall have
made such payment) such Excess Payment. For purposes of this Section
8(j), "Excess Payment" means the amount by which such payment exceeds
the amount which would have been received by the Pass Through Trustee
or the Loan Trustee if the Owner Trustee (in its individual capacity)
or the Owner Participant had not become subject to the recourse
liability referred to in (ii) above. Nothing contained in this
Section 8(j) shall prevent the Pass Through Trustee or the Loan
Trustee from enforcing any personal recourse obligation (and retaining
the proceeds thereof) of the Owner Trustee (in its individual
capacity) or the Owner Participant under this Participation Agreement
or the Trust Indenture (and any exhibits or annexes thereto) that is
expressed as being an obligation of the Owner Participant or the Owner
Trustee (in its individual capacity), respectively."

the Pass Through Trust Documents" after the words "Operative Documents".

with the Lessee, each Loan Participant, and the Loan Trustee (i) to
comply with all of the terms of the Trust Agreement (as the same may
hereafter be amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance
with the terms thereof) applicable to it in its respective capacities
the noncompliance with which would materially adversely affect any
such party, (ii) not to amend, supplement, or otherwise modify any
provision of the Trust Agreement in a manner adversely affecting the
Lessee without the prior written consent of the Lessee or in a manner

refinancing) as used by such Owner Participant (including the Tax
Assumptions set forth in Section 1 of the Tax Indemnity Agreement) in
determining the Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value and Termination
Value schedules with respect to the Term and the Special Purchase
Price Percentage attached as an Exhibit to, or provided in, as the
case may be, the Rent Schedule (the "Refinancing File"), as such
assumptions may be adjusted from time to time to take into account the

Lease which theretofore has resulted in an adjustment of the
percentages for Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value, Termination Value
or Special Purchase Price Percentage."

"(a) So long as no Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee shall have
the right to request the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee to
effect an optional redemption of all of the Equipment Notes issued
under the Trust Indenture or an optional redemption of all of the
Equipment Notes of the same maturity and bearing the same interest
rate issued under the Trust Indenture pursuant to Section 6.01(b)(2)
or (3) of the Trust Indenture (in each case, such term to include the
Equipment Notes originally issued under the Trust Indenture and any
refunding indebtedness pursuant to this Section 17), as part of a
refunding or refinancing operation. Promptly on receipt of such
request, the Owner Participant will negotiate in good faith to
conclude an agreement with the Lessee as to the terms of such
refunding or refinancing operation (it being understood that, without
limiting the Owner Participant's obligation to negotiate in good faith
as aforesaid, the Owner Participant shall not be obligated to enter
into any such agreements in connection with such a refunding or
refinancing operation unless terms and conditions customary in
aircraft leveraged lease refundings or refinancings shall have been
satisfied), and upon such agreement:

(i) the Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Loan
Trustee (to the extent not inconsistent with the Trust
Indenture), the Owner Trustee, and any other appropriate
parties will enter into a financing or loan agreement (which
may involve an underwriting agreement in connection with a
public offering or the sale of the Owner Trustee's interest in
the Trust Estate and/or the Aircraft and a

11

Series AA
<PAGE> 12

resale thereof to such Owner Trustee; provided, however, that in the
case of a refunding or refinancing involving a public offering of debt
securities the Owner Participant shall not be named in any prospectus
distributed in connection therewith (unless the Owner Participant
shall at the time consent thereto), the Lessee shall have the right to
purchase such debt securities and apply such debt securities as a
credit against its obligations to pay Rent, so long as Lessee shall
not at any time hold all or substantially all of such debt securities
and, for the purpose of any vote of such debt securities, any such
debt securities held by the Lessee shall be disregarded and deemed not
to be outstanding) providing for (x) the issuance and sale by the
Owner Trustee or such other party as may be appropriate to such
institution or institutions on the date specified in such agreement
(for the purposes of this Section 17, the "Refinancing Date") of debt
securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal
amount of the Equipment Notes to be redeemed, on the Refinancing Date,
and (y) the application of the proceeds of the sale of such debt
securities to the redemption of all such Equipment Notes on the
Refinancing Date;

(ii) the Lessee and the Owner Trustee will amend the
Lease such that (w) if the Refinancing Date is not a Lease
Period Date, the Lessee shall on the Refinancing Date prepay
that portion of the next succeeding installment of Basic Rent
as shall equal the aggregate interest accrued on the Equipment
Notes then being redeemed on the Refinancing Date, (x) Basic
Rent payable in respect of the period from and after the
Refinancing Date shall be recalculated to preserve the Owner
Participant's Revised Net Economic Return taking into account
all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such refunding or
refinancing paid by the Owner Participant, (y) amounts payable
in respect of Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value from
and after the Refinancing Date shall be appropriately
recalculated to preserve the Owner Participant's Revised Net
Economic Return, and the Special Purchase Price Percentage and
the Special Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated as
provided in Section 18, and (z) in the event that the

12

Series AA
<PAGE> 13

debt instruments issued in such refunding or refinancing transaction
are denominated in a foreign currency (it being understood that the
terms of any such foreign denominated loan and the provisions of the
operative documents relating thereto are to be reasonably acceptable
to the Owner Participant), those portions of Basic Rent, Termination
Value and Stipulated Loss Value payments allocable to the payments
required to be made in a foreign currency with respect to such debt
instruments shall likewise be denominated in and made in such currency
or, in the alternative, the Lessee shall indemnify the Owner
Participant against any losses resulting from foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations; and

(iii) the Owner Trustee will enter into an agreement to
provide for the securing thereunder of the debt securities
issued by the Owner Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this
Section 17 in like manner as the Equipment Notes issuable
under the Trust Indenture and/or will enter into such
amendments and supplements to the Trust Indenture effective as
of the date of the relevant refunding or refinancing, as may
be necessary to effect such refunding or refinancing, provided
that no such amendment or supplement will increase the
obligations or materially impair the rights of the Owner
Participant under the Operative Documents without the consent
of the Owner Participant;

provided, however, that (w) the Lessee shall not request that less
than all of the Equipment Notes issued under the Trust Indenture be
redeemed as part of a refunding operation hereunder unless it
simultaneously requests that all the outstanding equipment notes held
in the same Pass Through Trust issued under the Other Indentures be
simultaneously redeemed, (x) there shall be no more than two such
refundings or refinancings (not including the Section 20 Refinancing),
(y) Lessee shall pay the Owner Participant a fee of $25,000 in
connection with each refunding or refinancing pursuant to this Section
17 occurring subsequent to the first such refunding or refinancing and
(z) if within 20 days after receipt of a request from the Lessee to
effect a refunding or refinancing pursuant to this Section 17, which
request specifies the proposed structural terms and the amount
thereof, the Owner Participant provides

13

Series AA
<PAGE> 14

the Lessee with a written opinion of independent tax counsel selected
by the Owner Participant and reasonably acceptable to the Lessee to
the effect that there will be a material risk or increase in risk of
adverse tax consequences to the Owner Participant resulting from the
refunding or refinancing (other than the consequence that the
refinanced loan constitutes "qualified nonrecourse indebtedness"
within the meaning of Temporary Regulations Section 1.861-10T(b)
unless there shall have occurred a relevant Tax Change), then the
Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant shall be required to effect
such refunding or refinancing only if the Lessee shall have agreed to
indemnify the Owner Participant against such identified adverse tax
consequences in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Owner
Participant; provided, however, the parties agree that in the absence
of a relevant amendment to, or change in, the Code or any other
Federal tax statute or any regulation promulgated under any of the
foregoing (or official interpretation of any of the foregoing) after
the execution and delivery of the Participation Agreement a
refinancing or refunding as such will not result in any such risk."

"(b) The Equipment Notes, and any other debt instruments
issued in connection with any refunding or refinancing operation
permitted by this Section 17, shall not be subject to optional
redemption by the Owner Trustee without the consent of the Lessee,
except as provided in the Trust Indenture."

12. Amendment of Section 18 of the Participation Agreement.
(a) Section 18(a) is amended in its entirety to read as follows:

"(a) Calculation of Adjustments. In the event that (A) the
Transaction Costs are less or more than 1.46772034% of Lessor's Cost,
or (B) prior to the acceptance of the Aircraft on the Delivery Date:
(1) there shall have occurred a Tax Change and (2) after having been
advised in writing by the Owner Participant of such Tax Change and the
proposed adjustment to the payments of Basic Rent resulting therefrom,
Lessee shall have waived its right under Section 11 of the
Participation Agreement to decline to proceed with the transaction, or
(C) a refinancing or refunding as contemplated by Section 17 hereof
occurs, or (D) the Delivery Date is other than May 28, 1992, or (E) if
the

14

Series AA
<PAGE> 15

Certificates are not refunded or refinanced on or prior to the Base
Lease Commencement Date, the Interim Payment Amount (after adjustment
for any Interim Payment Differential Amount) is other than
$1,345,440.50, or (F) any amount is paid by the Lessee to the Owner
Participant pursuant to the Tax Indemnity Agreement, or (G) if the
Certificates are not refunded or refinanced on or prior to the Base
Lease Commencement Date, the Deferred Equity Amount is other than
$3,275,000.00, then the Owner Participant shall recalculate the
payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values, Termination Values,
(or, in the case of an event described in clause (F) above, payments
of Stipulated Loss Values and Termination Values only) with respect to
the Term (i) to preserve the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic
Return and (ii) to minimize, to the greatest extent possible,
consistent with the foregoing clause (i), the present value
(discounted semiannually at an interest rate per annum to be supplied
by the Lessee) of (1) the payments of Basic Rent or, at Lessee's
option, (2) the payments of Basic Rent scheduled to be paid prior to
the Special Purchase Option Date (as such date may be adjusted
pursuant to the Operative Documents) and the Special Purchase Price.
In addition, (x) in the event of a Section 17 Refunding, the Special
Purchase Price Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date shall
be recalculated in a manner consistent with the procedures specified
in Section 20(c) of the Original Participation Agreement and (y) with
respect to an event described in clause (A), (B), (D), (E) or (G) of
the preceding sentence, the Special Purchase Price Percentage as of
any date shall be recalculated such that the Special Purchase Price
equals the greatest of (i) the appraised value of the Aircraft as of
such date as set forth in Exhibit E to the Rent Schedule, (ii) 103% of
the sum of the present values, as of the Special Purchase Option Date
(as such date may be adjusted pursuant to the Operative Documents), of
(a) Basic Rent payable with respect to the period from such Special
Purchase Option Date to and including the twenty-fourth anniversary of
the Base Lease Commencement Date and (b) an amount equal to 53% of
Lessor's Cost (such present value calculation to utilize a discount
rate equal to 13.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually), (iii) 103%
of the amount that preserves Original After-Tax Yield as of such date
and (iv) the amount that satisfies the aggregate after-tax cash flow
and after-tax yield (using the multiple

15

Series AA
<PAGE> 16

investment sinking fund method of calculation) constraints used by the Owner
Participant in its pricing assumptions to determine the Special Purchase Price
Percentage (contained in the Refinancing File). In performing any such
recalculations, the Owner Participant shall utilize the same methods and
assumptions used by the Owner Participant in the calculation of the schedules
(referred to in the definition of Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic
Return) and the Special Purchase Price Percentage included in the Refinancing
File as such assumptions may be changed as a result of the event described in
clause (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F) or (G) of the second preceding sentence
necessitating such recalculation or due to the prior occurrence of any such
event."

(b) Section 18(b) is amended in its entirety to read as
follows:

"(b) Confirmation and Verification. Upon completion of any
recalculation described above in Section 18(a), a duly authorized
officer of the Owner Participant shall provide a certificate to the
Lessee either (x) stating that the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated
Loss Values and Termination Values with respect to the Term and, in
the case of the second sentence of Section 18(a), the Special Purchase
Price Percentage, as are then set forth in the Lease do not require
change, or (y) setting forth such adjustments to the payments of Basic
Rent, Stipulated Loss Values or Termination Values with respect to the
Term and, in the case of the second sentence of Section 18(a), the
Special Purchase Price Percentage, as have been calculated by the
Owner Participant in accordance with Section 18(a) above and Section
3(e) of the Lease. Such certificate shall describe in reasonable
detail the basis for any such adjustments. If the Lessee shall so
request, the recalculation of any such adjustments described in this
Section 18 shall be verified by, at Lessee's option, (i) Babcock &
Brown or (ii) a nationally-recognized firm of independent accountants
selected by the Lessee and reasonably acceptable to the Owner
Participant. A representative of such firm shall be shown, on a
confidential basis, the methods and assumptions originally used by the
Owner Participant (party to this Agreement as of May 26, 1994) in the
calculation of the schedules contained in the Refinancing File and the
Special Purchase Price

16

Series AA
<PAGE> 17

Percentage contained in the Refinancing File. The reasonable costs of
such verification shall be borne by the Lessee, unless as a result of
such verification process the payments of Basic Rent are adjusted and
such adjustment causes (i) the present value of the payments of Basic
Rent, discounted semi-annually at the Assumed Debt Rate to decline by
7.5 basis points or more from the present value of the payments of
Basic Rent, discounted semi-annually at the Assumed Debt Rate,
certified by the Owner Participant pursuant to this Section 18(b) or
(ii) any Stipulated Loss Value or Termination Value percentage or, in
the case of the second sentence of Section 18(a), the Special Purchase
Price Percentage, to be materially below that certified by the Owner
Participant pursuant to this Section 18(b), in which case the Owner
Participant shall be responsible for the reasonable costs of such
verification."

(c) Section 18(d) is amended by deleting it in its entirety.

13. DELETION OF SECTION 20 OF THE PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT.
Section 20 is hereby deleted and the words "Section 20. [Intentionally Omitted;
provided that Section 20(c) of the Original Participation Agreement shall
remain in effect solely for purposes of performing certain calculations as
provided in Section 18 of the Participation Agreement.]" are substituted
therefor.

14. AMENDMENT OF SECTION 21 OF THE PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT.
Section 21 is hereby renumbered Section 22.

15. NEW SECTION 21 OF THE PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT. The
following new Section 21 is added:

"Section 21. Successor Loan Trustee; Amendment of Pass
Through Trust Documents. (a) In the event that the Loan Trustee
gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Section 9.06(b) of the
Trust Indenture, the Lessee may direct the Owner Trustee to appoint,
and the Owner Trustee shall promptly appoint, a successor Loan
Trustee.

(b) In the event that either the Owner Trustee or the Lessee
obtains knowledge of the existence of any of the grounds for removal
of the Loan Trustee set forth in Section 9.06 of the Trust Indenture,
the Owner Trus-

17

Series AA
<PAGE> 18

tee or the Lessee, as the case may be, shall promptly
give notice (the "Removal Notice") to the other by telephone,
confirmed in writing. Within five Business Days after the giving of
the Removal Notice, the Lessee may direct the Owner Trustee to remove,
and the Owner Trustee shall remove, the Loan Trustee and appoint a
successor Loan Trustee, provided that, if within ten Business Days
after the giving of the Removal Notice the Loan Trustee shall not have
been removed, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed without further act to
have delegated to the Lessee the right, on behalf of the Owner
Trustee, to remove the Loan Trustee and appoint a successor, and, in
the event of the removal of the Loan Trustee in accordance with such
delegation, the Lessee agrees to appoint promptly a successor Loan
Trustee.

(c) The Lessee shall not enter into any modification or
amendment of any Pass Through Trust Document in any manner affecting
the Pass Through Trusts created pursuant to the Pass Through Trust
Supplements, without the consent of the Owner Trustee, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, except that the Owner Trustee shall
not be required to consent to any such modification or amendment which
adversely affects its interests (as trustee or in its individual
capacity) or the interests of the Owner Participant."

16. AMENDMENT OF SCHEDULE I TO THE PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT.
Schedule I is amended in its entirety as set forth in Schedule I to the
Refunding Agreement (AA 1994 PTC Series AA).

for Aircraft; Terms of Certificates. A. Sale and Purchase. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Lessee agrees to sell to the Owner
Trustee, and the Owner Trustee agrees to purchase from the Lessee, the Aircraft
on the Delivery Date, and, in connection therewith, the Owner Trustee agrees to
pay to the Lessee the purchase price of $46,000,000 ("Lessor's Cost").

investment in the beneficial ownership of the Aircraft in the amount determined
by multiplying Lessor's Cost by the percentage set forth opposite its name in

the ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT'S "Commitment" for the Aircraft.

(c) Prepayment of Certificates; Determination of Debt Rate.
Each of the LOAN PARTICIPANTS and the Owner Participant hereby agrees that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Participation
Agreement, the Lease, the Trust Indenture, the Certificates, or the Trust
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Lessee, the Owner Trustee
shall not take any action with respect to the Certificates concerning the
optional prepayment of such Certificates (except as provided in Section 2.13 of
the Trust Indenture), or the selection of the Debt Rate to be borne at any time
or from time to time by such Certificates, or the Interest Periods to be
applicable to the calculation of interest on the Certificates. The Owner
Trustee hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Lessee to act as its
exclusive agent (and agrees that it will not act other than through the Lessee,
as such agent) for the purpose of selecting the durations of the Interest
Periods to be applicable from time to time to calculations of interest on

4
<PAGE> 9
the Certificates and designating the Debt Rate from time to time to be borne on
the Certificates. Each of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Participant and
each LOAN PARTICIPANT hereby consents to such appointment and authorization.
In taking any actions as agent of the Owner Trustee as aforesaid, the Lessee
shall be authorized to deal directly with the Indenture Trustee and the LOAN
PARTICIPANTS, and the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, each LOAN
PARTICIPANT and the Indenture Trustee each agrees to cooperate with the Lessee

actions reasonably necessary to effect the actions taken by the Lessee as the
agent of the Owner Trustee under this Section 1(c). Except to the extent
otherwise provided in Section 2.01 of the Trust Indenture, the Debt Rate
applicable to the Loan Certificates for each Interest Period shall be
determined by election of the Lessee (as agent for the Owner Trustee) by
delivering telephonic notice to the ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT (whether or not
it at the time holds any Loan Certificates), followed in each case by telexed,
telecopied or other written confirmation (with a copy to the Indenture Trustee
and the Owner Trustee), not less than three London Business Days prior to the
beginning of the applicable Interest Period, in the case of a LIBOR Loan, and
not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the New York Business Day
immediately preceding the beginning of the applicable Interest Period, in the
case of a Short Period Loan, specifying the duration of such Interest Period
and whether the Debt Rate for such Interest Period shall be determined by
reference to the LIBOR Rate or the Short Period Rate. The Indenture Trustee
shall provide to each LOAN PARTICIPANT other than the ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT
a copy of any notice provided by the Lessee pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence promptly after receipt thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Lessee may only select a Short Period Rate (i) during any
period, and from time to time during such period, in which the Lessee is in
contemplation of a proposed prepayment of the Loan Certificates pursuant to
Section 2.12 or 2.14 of the Trust Indenture (whether or not a notice of
prepayment has been given pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14 of the Trust
Indenture) or (ii) at any time when the selection of a LIBOR Rate would result
in the succeeding Interest Period commencing on a day other than the second day
of a calendar month. The ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT (whether or not it at the
time holds any Loan Certificates) shall provide to each of the Owner
Participant, the Owner Trustee, each other LOAN PARTICIPANT, the Indenture
Trustee and the Lessee an officer's certificate setting forth the applicable
interest

subdivision or instrumentality of the United States, and all orders,

modification, addition, or change in or to the provisions of the Code
(including for this purpose, any non- Code provisions of legislation

Promptly upon the registration of the Aircraft and the
recording of the Manufacturer's FAA Bill of Sale, the FAA Bill of Sale, the
Lease (with the Lease Supplement covering the Aircraft, the Trust Indenture and
the Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement covering the Aircraft attached)
and the Trust Indenture (with such Lease Supplement and such Trust Agreement
and Trust Indenture Supplement attached) pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act,
the Lessee will cause Crowe & Dunlevy, P.C., special counsel in Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma, to deliver to the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee and the Lessee an opinion as to the due registration of the Aircraft,
and the due recording of such instruments and the lack of filing of any
intervening documents with respect to the Aircraft.

SECTION V. Postponement of Delivery Date. A. In the event
that (i) the ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT shall for

16
<PAGE> 21
any reason fail or refuse to make the full amount of its Commitment for the
Aircraft available to the Owner Trustee in accordance with the terms of Section
2 hereof, or (ii) the Owner Participant shall for any reason fail or refuse to
make the full amount of its Commitment for the Aircraft available to the Owner
Trustee in accordance with the terms of Section 2 hereof, the Owner Trustee
will forthwith give each party hereto telex or telegraphic notice of such
default and the Delivery Date for the Aircraft will be postponed up to the
fifth succeeding Business Day as the Lessee may direct (and the term "Delivery
Date" as used in this Agreement shall mean such postponed "Delivery Date");
provided that such postponed Delivery Date shall not be a date later than
September 30, 1991. During such period, the Lessee shall have the right to
find another leasing or financial institution to be substituted for the
defaulting ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or Owner Participant, as the case may be;
provided that in either event the institution so substituted shall sign and
deliver an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Lessee, by
which it will assume the balance of the Commitment of the defaulting ORIGINAL
LOAN PARTICIPANT or Owner Participant, as the case may be. Upon the execution
and delivery of such agreement, the institution so substituted shall become the
ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT or the Owner Participant, as the case may be, and
shall be deemed substituted for the defaulting Participant, for all purposes of
this Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Trust Indenture, and the Lease and to
have assumed all obligations of the defaulting Participant thereunder which
accrue after the date of execution and delivery. No action by the Lessee under
this Section 5(a) shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or release of any
right which the Lessee may have against the defaulting Participant. In the
event that the Lessee cannot find another institution to be substituted for the
defaulting Participant within such five Business Day period, then, in such
event (i) the Owner Trustee shall not accept delivery of the Aircraft and (ii)
this Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Trust Indenture, the Lease and the
Purchase Agreement Assignment shall terminate and be of no further force or
effect except as expressly provided herein or therein.

B. A scheduled Delivery Date for the Aircraft may be
postponed from time to time for any reason (but no later than September 30,
1991), other than pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, if the Lessee gives the
Owner Participant, the ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT, the Indenture Trustee and the
Owner Trustee telex, telegraphic, facsimile or telephonic (confirmed in
writing) notice of such postponement and

17
<PAGE> 22
notice of the date to which such Delivery Date has been postponed, such notice
of postponement to be received by each party no later than 2:00 P.M., New York
City time, on the originally scheduled Delivery Date.

C. In the event of any postponement of the Delivery Date
pursuant to Section 5(b) hereof, or if on an originally scheduled Delivery Date
not postponed as above provided the Aircraft is not delivered to the Lessor by
3:00 P.M. or, if delivered, is not accepted by the Owner Trustee for any
reason, the Owner Trustee will return by 4:00 P.M. on such date, any funds
which it shall have received from any Participant as its Commitment for the
Aircraft, absent joint instruction from the Lessee and such Participant to
retain funds until the specified date of postponement established under Section
5(b).

D. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, no
Participant shall be under any obligation to make its Commitment available
beyond 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on September 30, 1991.

SECTION VI. Extent of Interest of LOAN PARTICIPANTs. A LOAN
PARTICIPANT shall have no further interest in, or other right with respect to,
the Indenture Estate when and if the principal of and interest on all
Certificates held by such LOAN PARTICIPANT and all other sums payable to such
LOAN PARTICIPANT hereunder, under the Trust Indenture and under such
Certificates shall have been paid in full. By acceptance of a Certificate,
each LOAN PARTICIPANT agrees that it will look solely to the income and
proceeds from the Indenture Estate to the extent available for distribution to
such LOAN PARTICIPANT as provided in Section 2.05 of the Trust Indenture and
that neither the Owner Participant nor the Owner Trustee shall be personally
liable to such LOAN PARTICIPANT for any amounts payable under the Certificates,
the Trust Indenture or hereunder, except as expressly provided in the Operative
Documents.

the Lessee is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be
bound or affected;

(3) neither the execution and delivery by the Lessee of the
Operative Documents to which it is a party, nor the consummation of
any of the transactions by the Lessee contemplated hereby or thereby,
requires the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, or the
registration with, or the taking of any other action in respect of,
the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration,
or any other Federal, state or foreign governmental authority or
agency, other than the registration and filings referred to in Section

19
<PAGE> 24
rights of creditors generally and by general principles of equity and

practical realization of the rights and benefits provided thereby;

(5) there are no pending or threatened actions or proceedings
before any court or administrative agency or arbitrator which would
materially adversely affect the consolidated financial condition of
the Lessee and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the

provided) paid for all years prior to and including the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1984; the Federal income tax returns of the Lessee
for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1985 to December 31, 1989,
inclusive, are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service;

(7) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Lessee and 
its subsidiaries as of the end of each of its last three fiscal years,
and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash
flows for the three fiscal years then ended, fairly present the
consolidated financial position of the Lessee and its consolidated
subsidiaries as at the end of each such fiscal year and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for each such
fiscal year in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis (except as may be

20
<PAGE> 25
noted in such financial statements); since December 31, 1990, there
has been no material adverse change in such consolidated financial
position of the Lessee and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a
whole;

(8) except for the registration of the Aircraft, pursuant to 
the Federal Aviation Act, and except for the filing for recording

covering the Aircraft, the Trust Indenture and the Trust Agreement and
Indenture Supplement covering the Aircraft attached), the Trust
Agreement and the Trust Indenture (with such Lease Supplement and such
Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement attached), no further action,

financing statement in respect thereof under Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction), is necessary or
advisable in order to establish and perfect the Owner Trustee's
interest in the Aircraft as against the Lessee and any third parties
(other than the filing of a financing statement in respect thereof
under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the
State of Texas), or to perfect the security interest in the Owner
Trustee's interest in the Aircraft created under the Trust Indenture
in favor of the Indenture Trustee (with respect to such portion of the
Aircraft as is covered by the recording system established by the
Federal Aviation Administration pursuant to Section 503(a) of the
Federal Aviation Act) in any applicable jurisdiction in the United
States;

(9) the Lessee is not an investment company or a company

defined in Regulation G of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System; and

(12) the Lessee has not voluntarily subjected the Aircraft to

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN, IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT
ASSIGNMENT, OR IN THE LEASE TO THE CONTRARY, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SPECIFICALLY
PROVIDED IN THE WARRANTY BILL OF SALE REFERRED TO IN Section 4(E)(x), THE
LESSEE DOES NOT MAKE NOR SHALL THE LESSEE BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE, AND THE
LESSEE HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS
TO THE WORKMANSHIP, DESIGN, PATENT INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
USE OF THE AIRCRAFT AS OF THE DELIVERY DATE. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THE
PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL BE INTERPRETED TO BE IN DEROGATION OF OR CONSTRUED TO
LIMIT THE LESSEE'S INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER.

subsection (4) below, whether or not any of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be consummated, the Lessee agrees to indemnify, protect, defend
and hold harmless on an After-Tax Basis each Indemnitee against Claims in any

as a party to any of the Operative Documents);

(4) Any Claim to the extent caused by the noncompliance by
such Indemnitee or any of the Related Indemnitee Group with any of the

that occur as a result of an Event of Default that shall have occurred
and is continuing, or such as are required or contemplated by (and, if

Documents in order to give effect thereto;

(10) Any Claim to the extent caused by an Indenture Default
that does not also constitute an Event of Default under the Lease;

(11) Any Claim that would not have arisen but for the
appointment of a successor or an additional Owner Trustee without the
consent of the Lessee;

(12) Any Claim to the extent caused by the failure of a
Person other than the Lessee to pay a cost, fee or expense payable by
such Person in accordance with Section 9(a), 9(b), 9(c), 9(e), 9(f),

normally occurring administrative tasks but shall not include any
administrative obligations of the Lessee under the Operative Documents
performed by any Indemnitee);

(14) Any Claim to the extent that such Claim relates to
amounts payable by the Owner Trustee to the Indenture Trustee in
respect of the Break Amount, if

25
<PAGE> 30
any, payable with respect to the Certificates as a result of x) any
prepayment of the Certificates or purchase of the Certificates

Default; and

(15) Any Claim made by a direct or indirect corporate parent
of an Indemnitee, to the extent that such Claim is based on losses
suffered by or any decline in the net worth of such Indemnitee (but
only to the extent that such losses or such decline in net worth is
caused by events for which such Indemnitee is not indemnifiable by the
Lessee under the Operative Documents).

A limitation on the Claims of one Indemnitee under this Section 7(b)(4) shall
not provide a basis for limiting any Claim of any other Indemnitee.

e. Insured Claims. In the case of any Claim indemnified by
the Lessee hereunder which is covered by a policy of insurance maintained by
the Lessee pursuant to Section 11 of the Lease, each Indemnitee agrees to
cooperate with the insurers in the exercise of their rights to investigate,
defend or compromise such Claim as may be required to retain the benefits of
such insurance with respect to such Claim.

f. Claims Procedure. An Indemnitee shall promptly notify the
Lessee of any Claim as to which indemnification is sought. Subject to the
rights of insurers under policies of insurance maintained pursuant to Section
11 of the Lease, so long as no Event of Default under Section 14(f), 14(g),
14(h) or 14(i) of the Lease shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee
(at its sole cost and expense) shall have the right to investigate, and the
right in its sole discretion to defend or compromise, any Claim for which
indemnification is sought under this Section 7(b), and the Indemnitee shall
cooperate with all reasonable requests of the Lessee in connection therewith;
provided, however, that so long as an Event of Default under Section 14(a) of
the Lease has occurred and is continuing, such Indemnitee shall have the right,
along with the concomitant right of the Lessee, to investigate, defend or
compromise any such Claim. Where the Lessee or the insurers under a policy of
insurance maintained by the Lessee undertake the defense of an Indemnitee with
respect to a Claim, no additional legal fees or

26
<PAGE> 31
expenses of such Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Claim shall
be indemnified hereunder unless such fees or expenses were incurred at the
request of the Lessee or such insurers; provided, however, that if (i) in the
written opinion of counsel to such Indemnitee an actual or potential material
conflict of interest exists where it is advisable for such Indemnitee to be
represented by separate counsel or (ii) such Indemnitee has been indicted or
otherwise charged in a criminal complaint and such Indemnitee informs the
Lessee that such Indemnitee desires to be represented by separate counsel, the
reasonable fees and expenses of any such separate counsel shall be borne by the
Lessee. Subject to the requirements of any policy of insurance, an Indemnitee
may participate at its own expense in any judicial proceeding controlled by the
Lessee pursuant to the preceding provisions; provided that such party's
participation does not, in the opinion of the independent counsel appointed by
the Lessee or its insurers to conduct such proceedings, interfere with such
control; and such participation shall not constitute a waiver of the
indemnification provided in this Section 7(b). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Lessee shall not under any circumstances be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnitees
except in the case specified in the proviso to the third sentence of this
paragraph (6).

g. Subrogation. To the extent that a Claim indemnified by
the Lessee under this Section 7(b) is in fact paid in full by the Lessee and/or
an insurer under a policy of insurance maintained by the Lessee pursuant to
Section 11 of the Lease, the Lessee and/or such insurer, as the case may be,
shall be subrogated to the rights and remedies of the Indemnitee on whose
behalf such Claim was paid (other than rights of such Indemnitee under
insurance policies maintained at its own expense) with respect to the
transaction or event giving rise to such Claim, except that the Lessee shall
not be subrogated to any rights or remedies that the Owner Trustee may have
against the Owner Participant under Section 7.01 of the Trust Agreement or that
the Indenture Trustee may have against the Owner Trustee under Section 7.01 of
the Trust Indenture. Should an Indemnitee receive any refund, in whole or in
part, with respect to any Claim paid by the Lessee hereunder, it shall promptly
pay the amount refunded (but not an amount in excess of the amount the Lessee
or any of its insurers has paid in respect of such Claim) over to the Lessee.
Moreover, if, by reason of any Claim that the Lessee has paid or indemnified
against pursuant to this Section 7(b),

27
<PAGE> 32
an Indemnitee realizes an actual reduction in any Taxes that was not previously
taken into account in computing a payment by the Lessee pursuant to this
Section 7(b), then such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Lessee an amount
equal to the actual net reduction in Taxes realized by such Indemnitee
attributable thereto plus the actual reduction in Taxes realized by such
Indemnitee as a result of any payment to the Lessee pursuant to this sentence.
Each Indemnitee shall in good faith use reasonable diligence in filing its tax
returns and in dealing with taxing authorities to seek and claim any tax
benefits that would result in such net reductions in Taxes.

h. No Guaranty. Nothing set forth in this Section 7(b) shall
constitute a guarantee by the Lessee that the Aircraft shall have any
particular useful life or residual value or a guarantee to the Indenture
Trustee or the LOAN PARTICIPANTS that the Certificates will be paid. Each of
the LOAN PARTICIPANTS agrees that the provisions of Section 2.18 of the Trust
Indenture constitute its sole remedy for the reimbursement of Increased Costs
described therein and that nothing in this Section 7(b) shall constitute an
indemnity for any Increased Cost or any cost or loss in the nature of an
Increased Cost.

(c) General Tax Indemnity. (1) Indemnity. Except as
provided in Section 7(c)(2) hereof, the Lessee shall pay or indemnify and hold
harmless on an After-Tax Basis each Tax Indemnitee from and against any and all
fees (including without limitation license, documentation and registration
fees) and all taxes, whether now existing or hereafter adopted (including,
without limitation, income, gross receipts, sales, use, value-added, property
(tangible and intangible), excise and stamp taxes), levies, imposts, duties,
charges or withholdings, together with any penalties, fines or interest thereon
or other additions thereto (hereinafter collectively called "Taxes" and
individually called a "Tax") imposed against or payable by any Tax Indemnitee
(including amounts so payable by any such Tax Indemnitee solely as withholding
agent), the Lessee, any sublessee, sub-sublessee or other user of the Aircraft,
any Engine, or any Part, or any Affiliate of any such user, or imposed against
the Aircraft, any Engine or any Part, by any Federal, state or local government
or other taxing authority in the United States or by any foreign government or
by any territory or possession of the United States or by any international
authority or by any political subdivision or taxing authority of any of the
foregoing (hereinafter, a "Taxing Authority") in connection with or relating to

registration, reregistration, issuance, acquisition, assumption, modification,
reissuance, refinancing or refunding of any or all thereof, and any other
documents contemplated hereby or thereby and amendments and supplements hereto
and thereto, (f) the payment of the principal of, or interest or premium on, or

understood that the date of the placement of the Aircraft in storage
as provided in Section 5(d) of the Lease constitutes the date of
return of the Aircraft and Engines under the Lease) and y) the
expiration or earlier termination of the Lease under circumstances not
requiring the return of the Aircraft; provided that the exclusion set

extent such Taxes relate to events or conditions occurring or matters
arising prior to or simultaneously with such time;

(ix) Taxes that would not have been imposed but for (A) in
the case of Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Owner Trustee, the

(B) in the case of Taxes imposed on or with respect to any Tax
Indemnitee (other than Wilmington Trust Company or C&S/Sovran Trust
Company (Georgia), National Association, their respective successors
and assigns (including, without limitation, each and any Person who is
at any time a replacement Owner Trustee or Indenture Trustee), their

covenant by such Tax Indemnitee or such related Tax Indemnitee, but
only if, in any such case described in the immediately preceding

whole or in part of (I) any act or omission of the Lessee or any
sublessee or Person

32
<PAGE> 37
(other than a Tax Indemnitee) that is a user of the Aircraft or any
Engine or any Affiliate of any thereof or II) the breach or inaccuracy
of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Lessee or any
Affiliate, or D) in the case of Taxes imposed on or with respect to
the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Estate, any LOAN PARTICIPANT or
any related Tax Indemnitee with respect to any of the foregoing, the
existence of any LOAN PARTICIPANT Lien;

(x) Taxes imposed on any Tax Indemnitee (other than any LOAN
PARTICIPANT, the Indenture Trustee or the Indenture Estate) to the
extent such Taxes are increased (A) as a result of a change in the
situs of the Trust Estate (other than a change at the Lessee's request
or a change that is consented to by the Lessee in writing, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld and the request for which
shall have specified this subparagraph (x)) or B) as a result of the

negligence of the Owner Trustee in complying with the Lessee's request
pursuant to Section 9(d) hereof to move the situs of the Trust Estate
to another jurisdiction;

(xi) Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnitee (other than the

Indemnitee or any related Tax Indemnitee to comply with x)
certification, information, documentation, reporting or other similar
requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or
connection with the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, if such Tax
Indemnitee's or any related Tax Indemnitee's compliance is required by
statute or by regulation of the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes as a
precondition to relief or exemption from such Taxes and the Tax
Indemnitee or such related Tax Indemnitee was eligible for such relief
or exemption or y) any other certification, information,
documentation, reporting or other similar requirements under the Tax
laws or regulations of the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes that would
establish entitlement to otherwise applicable relief or exemption from
such Taxes,provided that the exclusion set forth in this subparagraph
(xi) shall not apply if such failure to comply was due to a failure of
the Lessee A) timely to notify such Tax Indemnitee of such requirement
or (B) to provide reasonable assistance in complying with

33
<PAGE> 38
such requirement or, in the case of the Owner Participant, if such
failure was the result of the Owner Trustee's negligence or the Owner
Trustee's actions or failure to act in accordance with instructions of
the Owner Participant or, in the case of any LOAN PARTICIPANT, if such
failure was the result of the Indenture Trustee's negligence or the
Indenture Trustee's actions or failure to act in accordance with
instructions of such LOAN PARTICIPANT;

(xii) Taxes in the nature of any intangible or
similar tax upon or with respect to the value of the interest of the
Owner Participant in the Trust Estate imposed by any government or
taxing authority in which the Owner Participant is subject to tax
without regard to the ownership or lease of the Aircraft;

(xiii) Taxes that would not have been imposed but for an
amendment to any Operative Documents not consented to by the Lessee in
writing (other than any amendment that occurs after an Event of
Default has occurred and while it is continuing);

(xiv) Taxes imposed on the Owner Participant, the Owner
Trustee or the Trust Estate by the United States or by any state or
local government or taxing authority in the United States (including
any territory or possession thereof) by reason of the trust described
in the Trust Agreement being taxed in the same manner as a
corporation;

(xv) Taxes (other than Taxes in the nature of property,
sales, use or rental Taxes) imposed on any LOAN PARTICIPANT that are
on, based on or measured by gross or net income or gross or net
receipts of such LOAN PARTICIPANT or any related Tax Indemnitee
(including any minimum Taxes and any Taxes on or measured by any items
of tax preference) or that are franchise Taxes, Taxes on doing
business or Taxes on, based on or measured by capital or net worth of
such LOAN PARTICIPANT or any related Tax Indemnitee by x) the Federal
government of the United States or (y) any state or local government
or taxing authority in the United States or any foreign government or
any territory or possession of the United States or any international
authority or any political subdivision or taxing authority of any of
the foregoing except to the extent that such Taxes would have been due
had the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents

34
<PAGE> 39
been the sole connection between the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes
and such LOAN PARTICIPANT,provided that there shall not be excluded
under clause (x) or (y) of this subparagraph (xv) Taxes to the extent
imposed by reason of such LOAN PARTICIPANT being treated as having a
taxable exchange as a result of an assumption by the Lessee of the
rights and obligations of the Owner Trustee under the Indenture and
the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.16 of the Indenture (it being
understood that nothing in this paragraph (xv) shall impair the right
of any LOAN PARTICIPANT to an indemnity pursuant to Section 2.04 of
the Indenture); and

(xvi) Taxes imposed on any LOAN PARTICIPANT in the nature of any
intangible or similar tax upon or with respect to the value of the
interest of such LOAN PARTICIPANT in any Certificate or the loan
evidenced thereby, except to the extent that such Taxes would have
been due had the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents
been the sole connection between the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes
and such LOAN PARTICIPANT.

(3) Tax Benefit Payback. If, by reason of the payment or
accrual of any Taxes indemnified hereunder, a Tax Indemnitee realizes an actual
reduction in any Taxes, which reduction in Taxes was not taken into account in
calculating any indemnity payments made by the Lessee hereunder, then such Tax
Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Lessee an amount equal to such actual
reduction in Taxes, if any, plus the actual reduction in Taxes realized by such
Tax Indemnitee or any related Tax Indemnitee as the result of any payment made
by such Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this sentence. Each Tax Indemnitee shall in
good faith use diligence in filing its tax returns and in dealing with Taxing
Authorities to seek and claim any tax benefit that would result in any such
reduction in Taxes or any refund of any Taxes payable or indemnifiable by the
Lessee hereunder, provided that no LOAN PARTICIPANT shall have any obligation
to claim any credit or any deduction in priority to any other claims, reliefs,
credits or deductions available to it. Any Taxes that are imposed on any Tax
Indemnitee as a result of the disallowance or reduction of any reduction in
Taxes referred to in the second preceding sentence as to which (and to the
extent) such Tax Indemnitee has made any payment to the Lessee required hereby
shall be treated as a Tax for which the Lessee is obligated to indemnify such
Tax Indemnitee pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7(c)

35
<PAGE> 40
without regard to the exclusions set forth in Section 7(c)(2). For the
purposes of this Section 7(c)(3), items of foreign Tax of any Tax Indemnitee
(other than any LOAN PARTICIPANT) shall be deemed to be utilized by such Tax
Indemnitee as credits or deductions in any taxable year in accordance with the
following:

(i) First, all available foreign Taxes other than those
arising out of leveraged lease transactions; and

(ii) Second, foreign Taxes arising from leveraged lease
transactions for which such Tax Indemnitee was not indemnified or held
harmless by anyone; and

(iii) Third, all available foreign Taxes for which such Tax
Indemnitee was indemnified or held harmless by the Lessee and all
other available foreign Taxes indemnified under any other leveraged
lease transactions (other than those arising from any transaction in
which there is an express agreement that such Taxes shall be utilized
last), on apari passu basis; and

(iv) Fourth, any remaining foreign Taxes arising from any
transaction in which there is an express agreement that such Taxes
shall be utilized after such Taxes described above.

(4) Contests. If a written claim shall be made against any
Tax Indemnitee for any Tax for which the Lessee is obligated pursuant to this
Section 7(c), such Tax Indemnitee shall notify the Lessee in writing promptly
of such claim, provided that the Lessee shall not be relieved of its
obligations hereunder by reason of a failure by the Tax Indemnitee to give such
notice unless such failure materially interferes with or prevents the Lessee
from exercising its contest rights hereunder. If the Lessee shall so request
in writing within 30 days after receipt of such notice, such Tax Indemnitee
shall in good faith at the Lessee's expense contest the imposition of such Tax
(including taking an appeal of any adverse judicial decision) by (a) resisting
payment of such Tax, (b) paying such Tax under protest or (c) paying such Tax
and seeking a refund or other repayment thereof, provided that, at such Tax
Indemnitee's option, such contest shall be conducted by the Lessee in the name
of such Tax Indemnitee or, if permitted by law, in the name of the Lessee, and
that in no event shall such Tax Indemnitee be required to contest, or the
Lessee permitted to contest in the name of such Tax

36
<PAGE> 41
Indemnitee or the Lessee, the imposition of any Tax for which the Lessee is
obligated pursuant to this Section 7(c) unless (v) the Lessee shall have
delivered a written opinion of its internal counsel or outside counsel to the
effect that there is a reasonable basis (consistent with Formal Opinion 85-352
of the American Bar Association) for contesting such claim, (w) if an Event of
Default shall have occurred or be continuing, the Lessee shall have provided
security for its obligations hereunder reasonably satisfactory to the Tax
Indemnitee, (x) the Lessee shall have agreed to pay such Tax Indemnitee on
demand all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses that such Tax Indemnitee
may incur in connection with contesting such claim (including, without
limitation, all reasonable legal and accounting fees and disbursements), (y)
the action to be taken will not result in any material danger of sale,
forfeiture or loss of the Aircraft, Airframe, any Engine or any material Part
or any interest in any thereof and (z) if such contest shall be conducted in a
manner requiring the payment of the claim, the Lessee shall pay such claim or
shall advance to the Tax Indemnitee on an interest-free basis and with no
additional net after-tax cost to the Tax Indemnitee sufficient funds to pay the
claim. Except as otherwise provided herein, the contest shall be conducted in
the manner determined by the Lessee unless it involves issues with respect to
which the Lessee would not be required to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee
hereunder which can not be severed by reasonable efforts of such Tax Indemnitee
from all issues with respect to which the Lessee would be liable hereunder. If
the contest involves issues with respect to which the Lessee would not be
required to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee hereunder that can not be severed by
reasonable efforts of such Tax Indemnitee from all issues with respect to which
the Lessee would be liable hereunder, such Tax Indemnitee may in its sole
discretion select the forum for such contest and determine the manner in which
such contest shall be conducted, provided that such Tax Indemnitee shall afford
the Lessee and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to discuss with such Tax
Indemnitee the Lessee's interests with respect to such contest. No contest of
any issue with respect to which the Lessee would be required to indemnify
hereunder shall be settled without the prior written consent of the Lessee
unless the Tax Indemnitee waives (by written notice to the Lessee) the payment
by the Lessee of any amount that might otherwise be payable by the Lessee under
this Section 7(c) in respect of such issue and any related issue the contest of
which is effectively foreclosed by the settlement of such issue, including any
payment arising from such issue in subsequent

37
<PAGE> 42
years or which arises by reason of the fact that such issue is of a continuing
nature, and promptly pays to the Lessee any amount previously paid or advanced
by the Lessee with respect to such issue or the contest of such issue, provided
that if there has been an adverse judicial decision with respect to such issue
or related issue the Tax Indemnitee, in determining whether it will terminate
the contest of such issue, shall afford the Lessee and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to discuss with such Tax Indemnitee the Lessee's interests with
respect to such contest. If any Tax Indemnitee shall obtain a refund of all or
any part of any Tax paid by the Lessee or with funds provided by the Lessee,
such Tax Indemnitee shall pay the Lessee, net of any payments theretofore due
to such Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 7(c) but unpaid and any other
payments theretofore due to such Tax Indemnitee under any of the Operative
Documents but unpaid, an amount equal to the amount of such refund, including
interest received attributable thereto, reduced by any Taxes incurred by such
Tax Indemnitee or a related Tax Indemnitee by reason of the receipt or accrual
of such refund and interest, and increased by any tax benefit realized by such
Tax Indemnitee or a related Tax Indemnitee as a result of any payment by such
Tax Indemnitee made pursuant to this sentence.

(5) Reports. If any report, return or statement is required
to be filed with respect to any Tax that is a property tax (or a tax in the
nature of a property tax) subject to indemnification under this Section 7(c),
the Lessee shall timely file the same (except for any such report, return or
statement which the Tax Indemnitee has notified the Lessee that the Tax
Indemnitee intends to file, provided that such Tax Indemnitee shall have
furnished the Lessee, at the Lessee's request and expense, with such
information, not within the control of the Lessee, as is in such Tax
Indemnitee's control and is reasonably available to such Tax Indemnitee and
reasonably necessary to file such returns. The Lessee shall either file such
report, return or statement so as to show the ownership of the Aircraft in the
Owner Trustee and send a copy of such report, return or statement to the Tax
Indemnitee, and the Owner Trustee if the Tax Indemnitee is not the Owner
Trustee, or, where the Lessee is not permitted to so file, shall notify the Tax
Indemnitee of such requirement and prepare and deliver such report, return or
statement to the Tax Indemnitee in a manner satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee
within a reasonable time prior to the time such report, return or statement is
to be filed. The Lessee shall also furnish promptly upon written request such
data in its possession or

38
<PAGE> 43
otherwise reasonably available to it as any Tax Indemnitee may reasonably
request to enable such Tax Indemnitee to comply with the requirements of any
Taxing Authority. The Lessee shall hold each Tax Indemnitee harmless from and
against the penalties, additions to tax and fines arising from any
insufficiency or inaccuracy in any such report, return or statement or fairly
attributable to the inaccuracy of any data supplied to any Tax Indemnitee by
the Lessee, without regard to whether such penalties, additions to tax and
fines are otherwise indemnifiable under this Section 7(c). If any report,
return or statement is required to be filed with respect to any Tax (other than
a property tax or a tax in the nature of a property tax) subject to
indemnification under this Section 7(c), the Lessee will promptly notify the
appropriate Tax Indemnitee upon the Lessee's obtaining actual knowledge of such
requirement. If the Lessee receives written notice from a Taxing Authority of
a Tax that is imposed upon a Tax Indemnitee but not indemnified against by the
Lessee hereunder, the Lessee will forward a copy of such notice to such Tax
Indemnitee.

(6) Payment. The Lessee shall pay any Tax for which it is
liable pursuant to this Section 7(c), directly to the appropriate taxing
authority or upon demand of a Tax Indemnitee to such Tax Indemnitee, within 30
Business Days of a written demand, but in no event prior to the date such Tax
is due (including all extensions), or, in the case of Taxes which are being
contested, the time such contest is finally resolved. Any such demand shall
specify in reasonable detail the calculation to the payment and the facts upon
which the right to payment is based. Each Tax Indemnitee shall promptly
forward to the Lessee any notice, bill or advice received by it concerning any
Tax which the Lessee may be required to indemnify against hereunder. Upon the
written request of an appropriate Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee shall furnish such
Tax Indemnitee the original or a certified copy of a receipt (if any is
available to the Lessee) for the Lessee's payment of any Tax that is subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7(c), or such other evidence of
payment of such Tax as is acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee (and available to
the Lessee).

(7) Application of Payments During Existence of Event of
Default. Any amount payable to the Lessee pursuant to the terms of this
Section 7(c) shall not be paid to the Lessee if at the time such payment would
otherwise be made an Event of Default or event that with lapse of time would
constitute an Event of Default under Section 14(a), 14(h) or 14(i) of the Lease
shall have occurred and be continuing but

39
<PAGE> 44
shall be held by the Tax Indemnitee as security for the obligations of the
Lessee under the Operative Documents and, if the Lessor declares the Lease to
be in default pursuant to Section 15 thereof (or the Lease is deemed to be
declared in default), applied against the Lessee's obligations under the
Operative Documents as and when due, provided that no such amount shall be held
as security for more than 180 days unless the Lessor or the Indenture Trustee
shall be precluded by law or court order from exercising remedies under Section
15 of the Lease. At such time as there shall not be continuing any such Event
of Default or other event or such 180-day period shall have elapsed, such
amount shall be paid to the Lessee to the extent not previously applied in
accordance with the preceding sentence.

(8) Forms, Etc. Each Tax Indemnitee agrees to furnish from
time to time to the Lessee or to such other person as the Lessee may designate,
at the Lessee's request in writing and expense, such duly executed and properly
completed forms as may be necessary or appropriate in order to claim any
reduction of or exemption from any withholding or other Tax imposed by any
Taxing Authority which the Lessee may be required to indemnify against
hereunder, if (x) such reduction or exemption is available to such Tax
Indemnitee and (y) the Lessee has provided such Tax Indemnitee with any
information necessary to complete such form not otherwise reasonably available
to such Tax Indemnitee.

(9) Non-Parties. If a Tax Indemnitee is not a party to this
Agreement, the Lessee may require the Tax Indemnitee to agree in writing, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Lessee, to the terms of this Section 7(c)
prior to making any payment to such Tax Indemnitee under this Section 7(c).

(10) Verification. At the Lessee's request, the amount of any
indemnity payment by the Lessee pursuant to this Section 7 or any payment by a
Tax Indemnitee to the Lessee pursuant to this Section 7 shall be verified and
certified by either the independent public accounting firm that audits the
financial statements of such Tax Indemnitee (provided that such firm shall have
its headquarters in the United States) or another independent public accounting
firm selected by such Tax Indemnitee and reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee,
provided that, in the case of any LOAN PARTICIPANT, the amount of any payment
by such LOAN PARTICIPANT to the Lessee pursuant to this Section 7 shall be
verified and certified by the independent public accounting firm that audits
the financial statements of such

40
<PAGE> 45
LOAN PARTICIPANT. The fee of such independent public accounting firm shall be
paid by the Lessee unless such verification shall disclose an error in such Tax
Indemnitee's favor exceeding 10% of the amount of such payment determined by
the Tax Indemnitee, in which case such fee shall be paid by such Tax
Indemnitee. The Lessee will have no right to examine the tax returns of the
Tax Indemnitee in connection with the verification procedure described in this
Section 7(c)(10); each Tax Indemnitee agrees to cooperate with the independent
public accounting firm performing the verification and to supply such firm with
all information reasonably necessary to permit it to accomplish such
verification, provided that the information provided to such firm by such Tax
Indemnitee shall be for its confidential use.

(11) Definition. For purposes of this Section 7(c), "Tax
Indemnitee" shall mean the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, in its
individual capacity and as trustee, the Trust Estate, each LOAN PARTICIPANT,
the Indenture Trustee, in its individual capacity and as trustee, and the
Indenture Estate, and any reference to a Tax Indemnitee, the Owner Participant,
the Owner Trustee, the Trust Estate, any LOAN PARTICIPANT, the Indenture
Trustee or the Indenture Estate shall include its respective successors,
permitted assigns, officers, directors, agents, servants and Affiliates and
shall also include any member of the Affiliated Group of which such Tax
Indemnitee, the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Estate, such
LOAN PARTICIPANT, the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture Estate, as the case
may be, is a member.

(12) Subrogation. Upon payment of any Tax by the Lessee
pursuant to this Section 7(c) to or on behalf of a Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee,
without any further action, shall be subrogated (unless a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered a final judgment ordering the return of such
payment to the Lessee) to any claims that such Tax Indemnitee may have relating
thereto other than claims in respect of insurance policies maintained by such
Tax Indemnitee at its own expense. Such Tax Indemnitee shall give such further
reasonable assurances or agreements and cooperate with the Lessee to permit the
Lessee to pursue such claims; provided that the Lessee shall reimburse such Tax
Indemnitee for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated with such
assurances, agreements or cooperation.

(d) Survival. The representations, warranties, indemnities
and agreements of the Lessee provided for in

41
<PAGE> 46
this Section 7 and the Lessee's obligations under any and all thereof, and the
obligations of any Indemnitee or Tax Indemnitee under this Section 7, shall
survive the Owner Participant's making of its Commitment, the delivery of the
Aircraft and the expiration or other termination of the Operative Documents.

(e) Payments; Interest. Any payments made pursuant to this
Section 7 directly to an Indemnitee or a Tax Indemnitee or to the Lessee, as

or, if no such directions shall have been given, by check of the payor payable
to the order of the payee and mailed to the payee by certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid to its address referred to in Section 15(c)
to this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest at the
Overdue Rate shall be paid, on demand, on any amount or indemnity not paid when
due pursuant to this Section 7 until the same shall be paid. Such interest
shall be paid in the same manner as the unpaid amount in respect of which such
interest is due.

(f) Effect of Other Indemnities. The Lessee's obligations
under the indemnities provided for in this Agreement shall be those of a
primary obligor whether or not the Person indemnified shall also be indemnified
with respect to the same matter under the terms of this Agreement, the Lease,
the Trust Indenture, the Trust Agreement or any other document or instrument,
and the Person seeking indemnification from the Lessee pursuant to any
provisions of this Agreement may proceed directly against the Lessee without
first seeking to enforce any other right of indemnification.

(g) Exercise of Right. The Owner Trustee agrees with the
Lessee that it will exercise its rights under Section 2.04(j) of the Trust
Indenture solely at the Lessee's request and direction.

SECTION 8. Representations and Warranties.

Each of the Owner Trustee, the Lessee, the ORIGINAL LOAN
PARTICIPANT and the Indenture Trustee shall promptly submit to the Owner
Participant copies of the invoices in respect of the foregoing transaction
costs as they are received, and in all events not later than December 31, 1991.
The Owner Participant prior to the payment thereof will send copies of any

disbursements constituting transaction costs to the Lessee for the Lessee's
review and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

In the event that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the agreements referred to herein are not consummated, the Lessee
shall bear and pay all costs, expenses and fees referred to above; provided
that (x) if the transaction fails to be consummated as a result of failure of
the Owner Participant to act in good faith in consummating the transactions, or
to fulfill its funding obligations or otherwise to comply with the terms hereof
or

50
<PAGE> 55
thereof, the Owner Participant shall bear and pay its own fees, costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of its special
counsel), and (y) if the transaction fails to be consummated as a result of
failure of the ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT to act in good faith in consummating

pay its own fees, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, the fees

(b) The Owner Participant covenants that if (i) it ceases to
be a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning of Section 101(16) of
the Federal Aviation Act and (ii) either (A) the Aircraft shall or would
thereupon become ineligible for registration in the name of the Owner Trustee
under the Federal Aviation Act as in effect at such time, or under the law of
the current jurisdiction of registry of the Aircraft, as the case may be, and
the regulations then applicable thereunder, or (B) the Aircraft is registered
in a jurisdiction other than the United States in circumstances in which clause
(A) does not apply and the Lessee at any time proposes to register the Aircraft
within four months in any jurisdiction to which clause (A) would apply upon
such reregistration, then the Owner Participant at its own expense shall
promptly (and, in any event, within a period of 30 days) either transfer,
pursuant to Article VIII of the Trust Agreement and Section 16(c) hereof, such
of its right, title and interest in and to the Trust Agreement, the Trust
Estate, and this Agreement, or take such other action, as may be necessary to
prevent any deregistration of the Aircraft or to make possible its registration
in the United States. Each party hereto agrees to take such steps as the Owner
Participant shall reasonably request in order to assist the Owner Participant
in complying with its obligations under this Section 9(b). The Owner
Participant hereby agrees to indemnify the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee
against any and all losses, liabilities and expenses incurred by the Lessee or
the Indenture Trustee to the extent that any such losses, liabilities or
expenses are caused by the Aircraft's so becoming ineligible or ceasing to
remain eligible for such registration.

(c) The Owner Trustee in its individual capacity covenants
that if at any time it shall cease to be a "citizen of the United States"
within the meaning of Sec-

51
<PAGE> 56
tion 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act, it will resign immediately as Owner
Trustee (if and so long as such citizenship is necessary under the Federal
Aviation Act, or the law of the current jurisdiction of the registry of the
Aircraft, as the case may be, as in effect at such time or, if it is not
necessary, if and so long as the Owner Trustee's citizenship (in its individual
capacity) would have any adverse effect on the Lessee). The Owner Trustee in
its individual capacity hereby unconditionally agrees with and for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement that the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity will not directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to
exist any Lessor's Liens on or against any part of the Trust Estate, the
Indenture Estate or Aircraft arising out of any act or omission of or claim
against the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, and the Owner Trustee in
its individual capacity agrees that it will at its own cost and expense
promptly take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge and satisfy in
full (i) all Lessor's Liens attributable to the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity and (ii) any other liens or encumbrances attributable to the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity on any part of the Trust Estate or the
Indenture Estate which result from claims against the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity not related to the ownership of the Aircraft, the
administration of the Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate or the transactions
contemplated by the Operative Documents.

(d) Each of the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee
agrees with the Lessee that it shall not take any action, or cause any action
to be taken, which would amend, modify or supplement any provision of the Trust
Agreement in a manner adversely affecting the Lessee without the prior written
consent of the Lessee and (so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been
discharged) the Indenture Trustee, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Owner Trustee confirms for the benefit of the Lessee that it
will comply with the provisions of Article IV of the Trust Agreement. The
Owner Participant agrees not to terminate or revoke the trust created by the
Trust Agreement without the prior written consent of the Lessee and (so long as
the Trust Indenture shall not have been discharged) the Indenture Trustee,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Owner Participant
further agrees not to remove the institution acting as Owner Trustee, and not
to replace the institution acting as Owner Trustee in the event that such
institution resigns as Owner Trustee, unless the Owner Participant shall have
consulted in good faith with the Lessee prior to such removal or replacement as
to the

52
<PAGE> 57
identity, location and fee schedules of the proposed successor trustee,
provided that (i) the Owner Participant shall retain the right, notwithstanding
any such consultation, to act in its sole discretion (provided that the Owner
Participant shall not choose a replacement Owner Trustee which, in the good
faith opinion of the Lessee, may result in additional liability to the Lessee
pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof, except in the case of a mandatory or voluntary
resignation of the Owner Trustee where the Lessee has not proposed an
alternative Owner Trustee which is reasonably satisfactory to the Owner
Participant) and (ii) no such consultation shall be required if an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing. So long as no Event of Default
shall occur and be continuing, the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant
agree that no co-trustee or separate trustee shall be appointed pursuant to
Section 9.02 of the Trust Agreement without the Lessee's prior written consent,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The Owner Participant agrees
that if, at any time, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Lessee certifies that the Lessee has, or in the good faith
opinion of the Lessee will, become obligated to pay an amount pursuant to
Section 7(c) hereof and the amount that has or will become payable would be
reduced or eliminated if the situs of the Trust Estate were changed and if, as
a consequence thereof, the Lessee should request that the situs of the trust
be moved to another state in the United States from the state in which it is
then located, the Owner Participant shall direct such change in situs of the
Trust Estate as may be specified in writing by the Lessee and the Owner
Participant will take whatever action as may be reasonably necessary to
accomplish such change; provided that the Lessee shall provide such additional
indemnification for Taxes imposed by the jurisdiction to which the Trust Estate
is to be moved as the Owner Participant may reasonably request. The Indenture
Trustee shall execute such documents and take such action as may be necessary
to effect such change in the situs of the Trust Estate; provided that the Lien
created by the Indenture with respect to the Aircraft shall continue to be
perfected.

(e) So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Owner Trustee shall promptly pay to the Lessee any amounts
received by it (i) from any LOAN PARTICIPANT pursuant to Section 2.04 of the
Trust Indenture or (ii) in respect of Break Funding Gain under Section 2.17 of
the Trust Indenture (other than any Break Funding Gain payable with respect to
the Certificates as a result of (A) any prepayment of the Certificates or
purchase of the

53
<PAGE> 58
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture as a result of an
Indenture Default that does not also constitute an Event of Default or (B) an
Indenture Default that does not also constitute an Event of Default, it being
agreed that any such Break Funding Gain shall be for the account of the Owner
Participant); provided that if any such amount has been so held by the Owner
Trustee as security for more than 90 days after an Event of Default shall have
occurred and during which period (x) the Owner Trustee shall not have been
limited by operation of law or otherwise from exercising remedies under the
Lease or (y) the Owner Trustee shall not have commenced to exercise any remedy
available to it under Section 15 of the Lease, then the Owner Trustee shall
promptly pay such amount to the Lessee.

(f) The Owner Participant agrees that, in the event of the
termination of the Lease pursuant to Section 9 thereof, the Owner Participant
will pay any fees and commissions of any broker or finder appointed by the
Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant, or any fees and commissions payable to
the Lessee pursuant to such Section 9, in connection with the sale of the
Aircraft. In addition, the Owner Participant agrees to pay or cause to be paid
to the Owner Trustee such amounts as may be necessary to enable the Owner
Trustee to pay any amounts to the Lessee pursuant to Section 9 or 15 of the
Lease as a rebate of any Basic Rent theretofore paid under the Lease.

(g) Each LOAN PARTICIPANT hereby unconditionally agrees to
perform its respective obligations under the Trust Indenture (including,
without limitation, those contained in Sections 2.04, 2.17 and 2.18 of the
Trust Indenture) as though such obligations were fully set forth herein.

(h) The Owner Trustee, in its capacity as Owner Trustee, will
not incur any indebtedness for money borrowed, or enter into any business or
other activity, except as contemplated hereby and by the other Operative
Documents.

(i) The Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity
hereby unconditionally agrees with and for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement that the Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity will not
directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Liens on or
against any part of the Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate or Aircraft arising
out of any act or omission of or claim against the Indenture Trustee in its
individual capacity, and the Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity
agrees that it will at its own cost and

54
<PAGE> 59
expense promptly take such action as may be necessary duly to discharge and
satisfy in full (i) all such Liens attributable to the Indenture Trustee in its
individual capacity and (ii) any other liens or encumbrances attributable to
the Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity on any part of the Trust
Estate or the Indenture Estate which result from claims against the Indenture
Trustee in its individual capacity not related to the administration of the
Indenture Estate.
(j) The Owner Trustee agrees that any profit, income,
interest, dividend or gain realized upon the maturity, sale or other
disposition of any Permitted Investment made by the Indenture Trustee pursuant
to Section 3.07(b) of the Trust Indenture, and paid to the Lessee on behalf of
the Owner Trustee by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with the terms of such
Section 3.07(b), shall be entirely for the account of, and the sole property
of, the Lessee who, for such purposes, shall not be deemed to be acting as
agent of the Owner Trustee, and the Lessee shall have no obligation to pay over
such income, interest, dividend or gain to the Owner Trustee.

(k) Each of the Indenture Trustee and each LOAN PARTICIPANT,
by its acceptance of a Certificate, hereby irrevocably agree, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, that, in any case in which any Person (other than the
Lessee alone) is the debtor or one of the debtors under the Bankruptcy Code,
each of the Indenture Trustee and each LOAN PARTICIPANT shall be deemed to have
made a timely election pursuant to Section 1111(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Bankruptcy
Code (or any substantively comparable provision which is the successor thereto)
as to the Indenture Estate (which is acknowledged and agreed not to include
Excepted Property).

(l) Each LOAN PARTICIPANT hereby unconditionally agrees with
and for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement that it will not directly
or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any LOAN PARTICIPANT
Liens attributable to it on or against any part of the Trust Estate, the
Indenture Estate or the Aircraft, and each LOAN PARTICIPANT agrees that it
will, at its own cost and expense, promptly take such action as may be
necessary duly to discharge and satisfy in full any such Lien attributable to
it; and each LOAN PARTICIPANT hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the Lessee,
the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Participant, and any subsequent holders of
Certificates or any subsequent Owner Participant from

55
<PAGE> 60
and against any loss, cost, expense or damages (excluding consequential
damages) which may be suffered by any of them as a result of its failure to
discharge and satisfy any such Lien attributable to it.

(m) Each of the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee
hereby agrees, for the benefit of the Lessee, to cooperate with the Lessee in
effecting any foreign registration of the Aircraft pursuant to Section 7(a)(i)
of the Lease; provided that prior to any such change in the country of registry
of the Aircraft (other than a change in the country of registry that results in
the registration of the Aircraft under the laws of the United States of
America), the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee shall have received from
counsel to the Lessee reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant an
opinion to the effect that (i) the terms of any relevant sublease and the Lease
are legal, valid, binding and enforceable in such country to substantially the
same extent as such documents are at that time enforceable in the United
States, (ii) there is no statutory, regulatory or case law in such country
imposing tort liability on the owner of an aircraft not in possession thereof
under the laws of such country other than tort liability no more extensive or
onerous than that which might have been imposed on such owner under the laws of
the United States or any state thereof (it being understood that, in the event
such opinion cannot be given in a form satisfactory to the Owner Participant,
such opinion shall be waived if insurance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner
Participant is provided by the Lessee to cover the risk of such liability),
(iii) such re-registration will not result in the imposition by such country of
any Taxes on the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant for which the Lessee is
not required to indemnify the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee, as the
case may be (provided that in lieu of the opinion referred to in this clause
(iii) the Lessee may indemnify the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee, as
the case may be, for any Taxes imposed by such country in connection with or
relating to the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents which
would not have been imposed but for such re-registration); (iv) there exist no
possessory rights in favor of the Lessee or any sublessee under the laws of
such country which would, upon bankruptcy of or other default by the Lessee or
any sublessee, prevent the return of the Aircraft to the Owner Trustee in
accordance with and when permitted by the terms of Sections 14 and 15(a) of the
Lease upon the exercise by the Owner Trustee of its remedies under Section
15(a) of

56
<PAGE> 61
the Lease; (v) it is not necessary for the Owner Participant or the Owner
Trustee to qualify to do business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of
the proposed re-registration; (vi) the laws of such country require fair
compensation by the government of such country for the loss of use of the
Aircraft in the event of the requisition by such government of the Aircraft
(unless the Lessee shall have provided contemporaneously with such
re-registration insurance reasonably satisfactory to the Lessor and the Owner
Participant covering the risk of requisition of use of the Aircraft by the
government of such country so long as the Aircraft is registered under the laws

organized and existing under the laws of the United States of
America or any State or the District of Columbia, shall be a
citizen of the United States as defined in Section 101(16) of

of each covenant and condition of

66
<PAGE> 71
this Agreement, the Lease, the Purchase Agreement Assignment
and the Tax Indemnity Agreement to be performed or observed by
the Lessee;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction,
no Event of Default under the Lease, and no event which, after
notice or lapse of time, or both, would become such an Event 
of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(iii) the Lessee shall have delivered to the Owner
Trustee, the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee a
certificate signed by the Responsible Officer of the Lessee,
and an opinion of counsel to the Lessee (which may be Lessee's

agreement mentioned in clause (i) comply with this Section
13(E) and that all conditions precedent herein provided for
relating to such transaction have been complied with (except
that such opinion need not cover the matters referred to in
clause (ii) above and may rely, as to factual matters, on a
certificate of an officer of the Lessee) and, in the case of
such opinion, that such assumption agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by such successor
corporation and is enforceable against such successor
corporation in accordance with its terms, except as the same
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally and by general principles of
equity.

Upon any consolidation or merger, or any conveyance, transfer or lease
of substantially all of the assets of the Lessee as an entirety in
accordance with this Section 13(E), the successor corporation formed
by such consolidation or into which the Lessee is merged or to which
such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be
substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Lessee
under this Agreement and the other Operative Documents with the same
effect as if such successor corporation had been named as the Lessee
herein. No such conveyance, transfer or lease of substantially all of
the assets of the Lessee as an entirety shall

67
<PAGE> 72
have the effect of releasing the Lessee or any successor corporation
which shall theretofore have become such in the manner prescribed in
this Section 13(E) from its liability hereunder. Nothing contained
herein shall permit any lease, sublease or other arrangement for the
use, operation or possession of the Aircraft except in compliance with

SECTION 16. Certain Covenants of the Owner Participant. (a)
The Owner Participant hereby agrees to notify the Lessee or cause the Lessee to
be notified by telephone, telecopier or telegram not later than 1:00 p.m. New
York City time, on the third Business Day prior to the Base Lease Commencement
Date stating whether or not the Owner Participant intends to pay an amount
equal to $1,947,948.23 (the "Excess Payment Amount", subject to adjustment
pursuant to the following paragraph) in full by 1:00 p.m., New York City time,
on the Base Lease Commencement Date. The Owner Participant shall also have the
right to reimburse the Lessee at any time for all or any portion of the
Reimbursement Amount for which the Lessee has not received an offset pursuant
to Section 3(f) of the Lease.

Although the amount of the Excess Payment Amount has been
computed on the assumption that each Certificate will bear interest at the
Assumed Debt Rate for such Certificate throughout the Interim Period, the Owner
Participant and the Lessee recognize that the actual rate of interest on each
Certificate may be a rate from time to time which may be greater or less than
the Assumed Debt Rate for such Certificate and that the related basis upon
which interest on the Certificates will be computed will be as provided in the
Trust Indenture. Accordingly, the Excess Payment Amount shall be increased or
decreased (but not below zero), as the case may be, by an amount (the "Excess
Payment Differential Amount") equal to, as of the Base Lease Commencement Date,
the difference between (i) the aggregate amount of interest actually due and
payable on the Base Lease Commencement Date on the Certificates for the period
from and including the Delivery Date to but excluding the Base Lease
Commencement Date, determined as provided in the Trust Indenture, and (ii) the
aggregate amount of interest on the Loan Certificates that would have been due
and payable on the Base Lease Commencement Date if the outstanding principal
amount of such Loan Certificates had borne interest at the Assumed Debt Rate
for the period from and including the Delivery Date to but excluding the Base
Lease Commencement Date. If, as of the Base Lease Commencement Date, the
amount determined in accordance with clause (i) of the immediately preceding
sentence shall be greater than the amount determined in accordance with clause
(ii) of such sentence, the Excess Payment Amount shall be increased by the
Excess Payment 

75
<PAGE> 80
Differential Amount. If, as of the Base Lease Commencement Date, the amount
determined in accordance with such clause (ii) shall be greater than the amount
determined in accordance with such clause (i), the Excess Payment Amount shall
be decreased by the Excess Payment Differential Amount. The interest actually
accruing with respect to the Certificates shall be as specified by the
notification to be delivered by the ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT (whether or not
it at the time holds any Loan Certificates) to each of the Owner Participant,
the Owner Trustee, each other LOAN PARTICIPANT, the Indenture Trustee and the
Lessee as provided in Section 1(c).

(b) The Owner Participant hereby unconditionally agrees with
and for the benefit of the other parties to this Agreement that the Owner
Participant will not directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to
exist any Lessor's Liens on or against any part of the Trust Estate or the
Aircraft arising out of any act or omission of or claim against the Owner
Participant, and the Owner Participant agrees that it will, at its own cost and
expense, take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge and satisfy in
full any such Lessor's Lien (by bonding or otherwise, so long as Lessee's
operation and use of the Aircraft is not impaired and the lien of the Indenture
is not impaired). The Owner Participant hereby indemnifies and holds harmless
the Lessee, the Indenture Trustee and each LOAN PARTICIPANT against any loss,
cost or expense (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) which may be
suffered or incurred by any of them as the result of the failure of the Owner
Participant to discharge and satisfy any such Lessor's Lien. In addition, the
Owner Participant agrees to indemnify, protect, save and keep harmless each
LOAN PARTICIPANT from and against any reduction in the amount payable out of
the Indenture Estate to such LOAN PARTICIPANT in respect of the Certificates
held by such LOAN PARTICIPANT or any other loss, cost or expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by such LOAN PARTICIPANT, as a
result of the imposition or enforcement of, or the Owner Participant's failure
to satisfy, any Lessor's Lien or claim against the Indenture Estate by any
taxing authority because of the nonpayment by the Owner Participant of any
Taxes imposed on or measured by the net income or revenues of the Owner
Participant that are not required to be indemnified against by the Lessee.

(c) The Owner Participant shall not directly or indirectly
assign, convey or otherwise transfer any of its

76
<PAGE> 81
right, title or interest in and to all or any part of this Agreement, the Tax
Indemnity Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Trust Estate, the Indenture
Estate, the Purchase Agreement Assignment, the Purchase Agreement or any of the
other Operative Documents except that the Owner Participant may assign, convey
or otherwise transfer all (but not less than all) thereof if:

(i) (A) the Person to whom such transfer is made (the
"Transferee") is a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning
of Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act (without the
utilization of a voting trust agreement, voting powers agreement or
similar arrangement by the Transferee or any Affiliate thereof unless
the Owner Participant obtains the consent of the Lessee, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), and has the requisite power,
authority and legal right to enter into and carry out the transactions
contemplated hereby; B) such conveyance does not violate any
provisions of the Federal Aviation Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (and no registration pursuant to such Act or the rules and
regulations thereunder shall be required in connection with such
conveyance), or any other applicable law, or create a relationship
which would be in violation thereof, or result in a "prohibited
transaction" under ERISA or the Code; (C) the Transferee enters into
an agreement or agreements, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Lessee, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee (the "Assumption Agreement") for the benefit of the Lessee,
the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, whereby the Transferee
confirms that it shall be deemed a party to this Participation
Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Tax Indemnity Agreement and each
other Operative Document to which the Owner Participant is a party,
and the party named as the "Owner Participant" in the Trust Agreement,
the Lease and the Trust Indenture and agrees to be bound by all of the
terms of, and to undertake all of the obligations of the Owner
Participant contained in, this Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Tax
Indemnity Agreement and each other Operative Document to which the
Owner Participant is a party or by which the Owner Participant is
bound, and in which the Transferee shall make representations and
warranties comparable to those of the Owner Participant contained
herein and, in the event such Transferee is a partnership, such
additional documents and/or amend-

77
<PAGE> 82
ments to the Operative Documents (in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Lessee, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee) as the Lessee, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may
reasonably request; (D) after giving effect to such assignment,
conveyance or transfer, there would be no more than one Owner
Participant with respect to the Aircraft; (E) the Owner Participant
shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee (unless the
lien of the Trust Indenture is discharged) and the Lessee an opinion
of counsel (which shall be the general counsel of the Transferee or
other counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee and the Indenture
Trustee), that the Assumption Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Transferee and is enforceable against
such Transferee in accordance with its terms, except as the same may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally
or by general principles of equity; (F) the Owner Participant shall
deliver to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee (unless the lien
of the Trust Indenture is discharged) and the Lessee one or more
certificates of a duly authorized officer of the transferor and if
necessary transferee Owner Participant concerning, when taken
together, all of the matters contained in clauses (A) and (D) of this
paragraph (i) and (except in connection with any such assignment,
transfer or conveyance to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of American Telephone and Telegraph Company) an opinion delivered by
counsel of the type referred to in clause (E) to the effect that such
transfer complies with the provisions of clauses (A) (except as to
citizenship), (B) and (D) of this paragraph (i); and (G) the
transferor and/or transferee Owner Participant assumes by an
instrument in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee
and the Indenture Trustee the risk of any adverse tax consequences to
any Tax Indemnitee resulting from such conveyance; and

(ii) either A) the Transferee is a bank or lending institution
with a combined capital and surplus of at least $75,000,000, or is a
corporation or domestic partnership with net worth of at least
$75,000,000, exclusive of goodwill, all of the foregoing determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (hereinafter
referred to

78
<PAGE> 83
as a "Qualifying Institution"), or B) if the Transferee is not itself
a Qualifying Institution, a parent corporation of the Transferee which
qualifies as a Qualifying Institution shall have executed and
delivered to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee (unless the lien
of the Trust Indenture is discharged) and the Lessee an absolute and
unconditional guaranty, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Lessee and the Indenture Trustee, with respect to the obligations of
the Transferee as the Owner Participant assumed by the Transferee
under the Assumption Agreement referred to above, and the Transferee
shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee (unless the lien of the Trust
Indenture is discharged), the Owner Trustee and the Lessee an opinion
of counsel (which shall be the general counsel of the Qualifying
Institution providing such guaranty or other counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee) that such
guaranty is enforceable against the guarantor in accordance with its
terms.

In the event that the Owner Participant is at any time the
subsidiary of another Person, any transfer by direct sale, consolidation,
merger or otherwise of 50% or more of the capital stock of the Owner
Participant (including, for this purpose, any such transfer of the capital
stock of any one of its direct or indirect parent companies or other parent
entities, other than its ultimate parent entity) (any such transfer being
referred to as a "Change in Control") shall be deemed to be a conveyance by
such Owner Participant of its interests in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement subject to this Section 16(c), and accordingly no such Change in
Control shall take place without the Lessee's consent unless it satisfies the
terms and conditions set forth in this Section 16(c), including without
limitation those set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, if (x) the obligations of such Owner Participant were
guaranteed at the time such Owner Participant became the Owner Participant
hereunder by a parent entity that was at such time a Qualifying Institution
(the "Parent Guarantor"), and (y) following a Change in Control, the Transferee
remains both a member of the controlled or consolidated group of companies of
which the Parent Guarantor is a part and a subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor,
such Transferee shall comply with the conditions set forth in paragraph (i)
above, but shall not be required to satisfy the conditions set forth in
paragraph (ii) above; provided that such guaranty of the

79
<PAGE> 84
Parent Guarantor is amended to remain in full force and effect in respect of
the Transferee and the Transferee delivers to the Indenture Trustee (unless the
lien of the Trust Indenture is discharged), the Owner Trustee and the Lessee an
opinion of counsel (which shall be the general counsel of the Parent Guarantor
or other counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee) in form and substance
satisfactory to the Lessee and the Owner Trustee as to the continued legality,
validity and enforceability of such guaranty.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Lease is in
effect, there shall not be more than five transfers (not including any transfer
within two years after the Delivery Date to any Affiliate of American Telephone
and Telegraph Company) by the Owner Participant (including its successors and
permitted assigns) pursuant to this Section 16(c) without the prior written
consent of the Lessee, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Any fees,
charges and expenses incurred by the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or
the Lessee in connection with any transfer pursuant to this Section 16(c),
including, without limitation the out-of-pocket expenses of the Lessee and
reasonable legal fees and expenses, will be paid by the transferring Owner
Participant and in no case will the Lessee be responsible for any such fees,
charges or expenses. Without the consent of the Lessee, no transfer shall be
permitted pursuant to this Section 16(c) to a Transferee that is (i) an airline
or other commercial operator of aircraft that is a competitor of the Lessee or
any of its Affiliates or (ii) a corporation or other entity that is an
Affiliate of any such airline or other commercial operator of aircraft.

Upon any such conveyance by the Owner Participant to a
Transferee permitted by this Section 16(c), the Transferee shall be deemed the
"Owner Participant" for all purposes hereof (unless the context is
inappropriate) and shall be deemed to have made all the investments in
beneficial ownership of the Aircraft previously made by the Owner Participant
in respect of the right, title and interest so conveyed; and each reference in
this Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Lease, the Tax Indemnity Agreement,
the Trust Indenture and the other Operative Documents to the Owner Participant
making the transfer shall thereafter be deemed a reference to the Transferee as
the Owner Participant (unless the context is inappropriate). Upon any such
conveyance by the Owner Participant to a Transferee permitted by the foregoing
provisions

80
<PAGE> 85
of this Section 16(c), the transferor Owner Participant shall be relieved of
all of its liabilities and obligations hereunder and under the Trust Agreement
to the extent of the interest so transferred, provided that in no event will
any such conveyance release the transferor Owner Participant from any liability
to the extent caused by any breach existing at the time of such conveyance by
the Owner Participant of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations contained herein or in the Trust Agreement. If the Owner
Participant proposes to transfer its interests pursuant to this Section 16(c),
it shall give 20 days' (or, in the case of a transfer where the Transferee is
an Affiliate of the Owner Participant making the transfer, 10 days') prior
written notice thereof to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the
Lessee, specifying the name and address of the transferee and specifying the
facts necessary to determine whether the conditions of this paragraph (c) have
been or shall be satisfied.

SECTION 17. Optional Redemption of Certificates. (a) So
long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee
shall have the right to request the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee to
effect an optional redemption of all of the Certificates (the "Outstanding
Certificates") (such term to include the Certificates originally issued under
the Trust Indenture and any refunding indebtedness issued pursuant to this
Section 17 or Section 20) pursuant to the Trust Indenture as part of a
refunding or refinancing operation. Promptly on receipt of such request, the
Owner Participant will negotiate promptly in good faith to conclude an
agreement with the Lessee as to the terms of such refunding or refinancing
operation and upon such agreement:

(i) the Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee, and any other appropriate parties will enter into a
financing or loan agreement (which may involve an underwriting
agreement in connection with a public offering; provided, however,
that in the case of a refunding or refinancing involving a public
offering of debt securities, the Lessee shall have the right to
purchase such debt securities and apply such debt securities as a
credit against its obligations to pay Rent) providing for (x) the
issuance and sale by the Owner Trustee or such other party as may be
appropriate to such institution or institutions on the date specified
in such agreement (for the purposes of this

81
<PAGE> 86
Section 17, the "Refunding Date") of United States Dollar-denominated
debt securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the sum of
the principal amount of the Outstanding Certificates on the Refunding
Date and, subject to clause (w) of Section 17(a)(ii), all interest
accrued thereon to the Refunding Date and (y) the application of the
proceeds of the sale of such debt securities to the redemption of all
such Certificates on the Refunding Date;

(ii) the Lessee and the Owner Trustee will amend the Lease 
such that (w) if the Refunding Date is not a Lease Period Date, the 
Lessee shall on the Refunding Date prepay that portion of the next 
succeeding installment of Basic Rent as shall equal the aggregate 
interest accrued on the Outstanding Certificates to the Refunding Date 
in the event that such interest is not financed through the issuance 
of debt securities on the Refunding Date (provided that if the 
Refunding Date occurs on or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date, 
the Owner Participant may, pursuant to Section 16(a) on the Refunding 
Date prepay the Excess Payment Amount), x) Basic Rent payable in 
respect of the period from and after the Refunding Date shall be 
recalculated to preserve the Owner Participant's Net Economic Return 
(or, in the case of any recalculation hereunder subsequent to any 
Section 20 Refinancing, the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic 
Return), y) amounts payable in respect of Stipulated Loss Value and 
Termination Value from and after the Refunding Date shall be 
appropriately recalculated to preserve the Owner Participant's Net 
Economic Return (or, in the case of any recalculation hereunder 
subsequent to the Section 20 Refinancing, the Owner Participant's 
Revised Net Economic Return) and (z) the Special Purchase Price and 
the Special Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated as provided in 
Section 18;

(iii) the Owner Trustee will enter into an agreement to provide
for the securing thereunder of the debt securities issued by the Owner
Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 17 in like manner as
the Certificates issuable under the Trust Indenture and/or will enter
into such amendments and supplements to the Trust Indenture as may be
necessary to effect such refunding or refinancing,provided that no
such amendment or supplement will materially

82
<PAGE> 87
increase the liabilities of or impair the rights of the Owner
Participant under the Operative Documents without the consent of the
Owner Participant; and

(iv) unless otherwise agreed by the Owner Par-ticipant, the
Lessee shall pay as Supplemental Rent on an After-Tax Basis all
reasonable fees, costs, and expenses of such refunding or refinancing;

provided, however, that (w) there shall be no more than two such refundings or
refinancings (not including the Section 20 Refinancing, (x) if within 15 days
after receipt of a request from the Lessee to effect a refunding or refinancing
pursuant to this Section 17, which request specifies the proposed structural
terms and the amount thereof, the Owner Participant provides the Lessee with a
written notice to the effect that there will be a risk of adverse tax
consequences to the Owner Participant resulting from the refunding or
refinancing and, if then requested by the Lessee in writing, within 15 days
after receipt of such request, the Owner Participant provides the Lessee with a
written opinion of independent tax counsel selected by the Owner Participant
and reasonably acceptable to the Lessee to the effect that there will be a risk
of such adverse tax consequences to the Owner Participant resulting from the
refunding or refinancing (other than the consequence that the refinanced loan
constitutes "qualified nonrecourse indebtedness" within the meaning of
Temporary Regulations Section 1.861-10T(b) for the purpose of the computation
of the FSC Benefits (as defined in the Tax Indemnity Agreement)), then the
Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant shall be required to effect such
refunding or refinancing only if the Lessee shall have agreed to indemnify the
Owner Participant against such identified adverse tax consequences in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant; provided, however, the
parties agree that in the absence of a change in applicable laws, regulations,
revenue rulings, revenue procedures or judicial precedents enacted, adopted or
decided after the Delivery Date, a refinancing or refunding will not be deemed
for this purpose to result in a risk of the Owner Participant not being
considered the owner of the Aircraft, Airframe, any Engine or any Part for
Federal or other income tax purposes, (y) no such refinancing or refunding
shall require an increase in the amount of the Owner Participant's investment
in the beneficial ownership of the Aircraft or shall cause the ratio of the
newly issued debt to the Owner Participant's then outstanding investment in the

83
<PAGE> 88
Aircraft to be more than 4 to 1 and (z) except with respect to matters relating
to taxes, no such refunding or refinancing will materially increase the
liabilities of or impair the rights of the Owner Participant.

(b) The Certificates, and any other debt instruments issued
in connection with any refunding or refinancing operation permitted by this
Section 17, shall not be subject to optional redemption by the Owner Trustee
without the consent of the Lessee (except as provided in Section 2.13 of the
Trust Indenture).
SECTION 18. Calculation of Adjustments to Basic Rent,
Stipulated Loss Value, Termination Value, etc.; Confirmation and Verification.
(a) Calculation of Adjustments. In the event that (A) the expenses paid by
the Owner Participant pursuant to Section 9(a) hereof (except for any expenses
paid or payable to any financial advisor to the Owner Participant) and such
other expenses as the Lessee shall expressly agree in writing shall be deemed
to be "Transaction Costs" (collectively, the "Transaction Costs") are less or
more than 1.0% of Lessor's Cost, or (B) prior to the acceptance of the Aircraft
on the Delivery Date: (1) there shall have occurred a Change in Tax Law and
(2) after having been advised in writing by the Owner Participant of such
Change in Tax Law and the proposed adjustment to the payments of Basic Rent
resulting therefrom, Lessee shall have waived its right under Section 11 of the
Participation Agreement to decline to proceed with the transaction, or (C) a
refinancing or refunding as contemplated by Section 17 hereof occurs (it being
understood that if the Refunding Date occurs on or prior to the Base Lease
Commencement Date, any recalculations pursuant to this clause (C) shall take
into account any prepayment by the Owner Participant on such Refunding Date of
the Excess Payment Amount pursuant to Section 16(a) hereof under clause (w) of
Section 17(a)(ii) hereof or under clause (w) of Section 20(a)(ii) hereof), or
(D) the Delivery Date is other than July 2, 1991, or (E) if the Certificates
are not refunded or refinanced on or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date,
the Excess Payment Amount (after adjustment for any Excess Payment Differential
Amount) is other than $1,947,948.23, then, in each case, the Owner Participant
shall recalculate the payments of Basic Rent and Stipulated Loss Values,
Termination Values and the Excess Payment Amount with respect to the Term (i)
to preserve the Owner Participant's Net Economic Return (or, in the case of any
recalculation hereunder subsequent to the Section 20 Refinancing, the

84
<PAGE> 89
Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return) and (ii) to minimize to the
greatest extent possible, consistent with the foregoing clause (i), the present
value (discounted semiannually at an interest rate per annum to be supplied by
the Lessee) of the payments of Basic Rent. In addition, in the event of a
refinancing or refunding referred to in clause (C) of the preceding sentence,
the Special Purchase Price Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date
shall be recalculated in a manner consistent with the procedures specified in
the second sentence of Section 20(c). In performing any such recalculations,
the Owner Participant shall utilize the same methods and assumptions originally
used to calculate the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values,
Termination Values and Special Purchase Price Percentage with respect to the
Term (or, in the case of any recalculation hereunder subsequent to the Section
20 Refinancing, the same methods and assumptions originally used by the
original Owner Participant in the calculation of the alternate schedules
referred to in the definition of the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic
Return and the Special Purchase Price Percentage and held in escrow by Sidley &
Austin pursuant to Section 18(d)) (in each case as such assumptions may be
changed as a result of the event described in clause (A), (B), (C) or (D) of
the second preceding sentence necessitating such recalculation or due to the
prior occurrence of any such event or the prior occurrence of the Section 20
Refinancing); provided that, Basic Rent, as so recomputed, shall comply with
the requirements of Sections 4.02(5) and 4.07(1) of Revenue Procedure 75-28,
1975-1 C.B. 752, and shall not present a greater risk that Section 467(b)(2) of
the Code would apply than the risk that Section 467(b)(2) applied prior to such
recomputation, it being agreed that the requirements of clause (i) of Section
5.01 of Rev. Proc. 75-21, 1975-1 C.B. 715, shall be applied on a prospective
basis.

(b) Confirmation and Verification. Upon completion of any
recalculation described above in Section 18(a), a duly authorized officer of
the Owner Participant shall provide a certificate to the Lessee either (x)
stating that the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values and Termination
Values with respect to the Term and, in the case of the second sentence of

85
<PAGE> 90
Section 18(a), the Special Purchase Price Percentage as are then applicable do
not require change, or (y) setting forth such adjustments to the payments of
Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values or Termination Values with respect to the
Term and, in the case of the second sentence of Section 18(a), the Special
Purchase Price Percentage as have been calculated by the Owner Participant in
accordance with Section 18(a) above and Section 3(e) of the Lease. Such
certificate shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for any such
adjustments. If the Lessee shall so request, the recalculation of any such
adjustments described in this Section 18 shall be verified by a nationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants jointly selected by the
Lessee and the Owner Participant (provided that such firm of independent public
accountants shall not be regularly retained by either the Lessee or the Owner
Participant). A representative of such firm shall be shown, on a confidential
basis, the original assumptions used by the Owner Participant and held in
escrow by Sidley & Austin pursuant to Section 18(d) and the methods used by the
Owner Participant in the original calculation of, and any recalculation of,
Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values and Termination Values and, in the case of
the second sentence of Section 18(a), the Special Purchase Price Percentage
(or, in the case of any recalculation hereunder subsequent to the Section 20
Refinancing, the same methods and assumptions originally used by the original
Owner Participant in the calculation of the alternate schedules referred to in
the definition of the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return and the
Special Purchase Price Percentage held in escrow by Sidley & Austin pursuant to
Section 18(d)). The reasonable costs of such verification shall be borne by
the Lessee, unless as a result of such verification process the payments of
Basic Rent are adjusted and such adjustment causes (i) the present value of the
payments of Basic Rent, discounted semi-annually at the Assumed Debt Rate, to
decline by five basis points or more from the present value of the payments of
Basic Rent, discounted semi-annually at the Assumed Debt Rate, certified by the
Owner Participant pursuant to this Section 18(b) or (ii) any Stipulated Loss
Value or Termination Value percentage or, in the case of the second sentence of
Section 18(a), the Special Purchase Price Percentage, to be significantly below
that certified by the Owner Participant pursuant to this Section 18(b), in
which case the Owner Participant shall be responsible for the reasonable costs
of such verification. In connection with any ad-justment pursuant to this
Section 18 or Section 20, the Owner Participant, the Lessee, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee shall enter into an appropriately revised Rent
Schedule.

(c) Payment of Debt Service. No adjustment may be made to
the payments of Basic Rent or to Stipulated

86
<PAGE> 91
Loss Values or Termination Values with respect to the Term, unless (i) each
installment of Basic Rent (or, in the case of the Base Lease Commencement Date,
the Excess Payment Amount), as so adjusted, under any circumstances and in any
event, will be in an amount at least sufficient for the Owner Trustee to pay in
full as of the due date of such installment any payment of principal or
interest on the Certificates required to be paid on the due date of such
installment of Basic Rent (or on the Base Lease Commencement Date, as the case
may be) and (ii) Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value, as so adjusted,
under any circumstances and in any event, will be an amount which, together
with any other amounts required to be paid by the Lessee under the Lease in
connection with an Event of Loss or a termination of the Lease, as the case may
be, will be at least sufficient to pay in full, as of the date of payment
thereof, the aggregate unpaid principal of and all unpaid interest on the
Certificates accrued to the date on which Stipulated Loss Value or Termination
Value, as the case may be, is paid in accordance with the terms of the Lease.

(d) Escrow. The Owner Participant agrees to place in escrow
with Sidley & Austin, and to cause Sidley & Austin to retain, (i) the
assumptions and methods utilized by the Owner Participant in the calculation of
the schedules of Basic Rent, Termination Value and Stipulated Loss Value
referred to the definition of the Owner Participant's Net Economic Return, and
in the calculation of the Special Purchase Price Percentage as of the Delivery
Date, (ii) the assumptions and methods utilized by the Owner Participant in the
calculation of the alternate schedules of Basic Rent, Termination Value and
Stipulated Loss Value referred to in the definition of the Owner Participant's
Revised Net Economic Return, together with such alternate schedules, and the
Special Purchase Price Percentage applicable to a lease financing accomplished
pursuant to such alternate schedules (calculated to preserve the Special
Purchase Price Yield to the applicable Special Purchase Option Date in
accordance with the methodology described in the second sentence to Section
20(c)), copies of which alternate schedules and such Special Purchase Price
Percentage have been provided to the Lessee, and (iii) any adjustments made to
any of the assumptions referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence to
take into account the effect of any change of the type specified in Section
3(e) of the Lease which theretofore has resulted in an adjustment of the
percentages of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value, Termination Value or Special

87
<PAGE> 92
Purchase Price Percentage. In connection with the foregoing, the Owner
Participant will provide Sidley & Austin with such supporting documents and
materials, and access to such computer programs and/or software, as would be
complete and sufficient, without more, to enable the verification, as
contemplated by Section 18(b), of any calculations made by the Owner
Participant under this Section 18 or Section 20.

SECTION 19. Concerning the Owner Trustee. Wilmington Trust 
Company is entering into this Agreement solely in its capacity as Owner 
Trustee under the Trust Agreement and not in its individual capacity (except 
as expressly stated herein) and in no case shall Wilmington Trust Company (or 
any entity acting as successor Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement) be 
personally liable for or on account of any of the statements, representations, 
warranties, covenants or obligations stated to be those of the Owner Trustee 
hereunder, provided, however, that Wilmington Trust Company (or any such 
successor Owner Trustee) shall be personally liable hereunder for its own 
gross negligence or willful misconduct or for its breach of its covenants,
representations and warranties contained herein, to the extent covenanted or
made in its individual capacity.

SECTION 20. Section 20 Refinancing. (a) In addition to the
provisions set forth in Section 17, whether or not a refunding or refinancing
pursuant to such Section 17 shall have previously occurred, and with regard to
the role of Credit (as defined in the Tax Indemnity Agreement) in the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements, at any time the Lessee
shall have the right to request the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee to
effect an optional redemption of all of the Outstanding Certificates as part of
a refunding or refinancing operation with refinancing indebtedness with respect
to which the refinancing indebtedness has a final maturity date of at least six
months after the final maturity date of the Outstanding Certificates and has a
weighted average life to maturity at least 90 days longer than the remaining
weighted average life to maturity of the outstanding Certificates (such
refinancing hereinafter referred to as the "Section 20 Refinancing"). Promptly
on receipt of such request (which request shall specifically designate such
refinancing as the Section 20 Refinancing), the Owner Participant will, in good
faith, use all reasonable efforts to conclude an agreement with the Lessee as

88
<PAGE> 93
to the terms of such Section 20 Refinancing and upon such agreement:

(i) the Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee, and any other appropriate parties will enter into a
financing or loan agreement (which may involve an underwriting
agreement in connection with a public offering; provided, however,
that in the case of a refunding or refinancing involving a public
offering of debt securities, the Lessee shall have the right to
purchase such debt securities and apply such debt securities as a
credit against its obligations to pay Rent) providing for (x) the
issuance and sale by the Owner Trustee or such other party as may be
appropriate to such institution or institutions on the date specified
in such agreement (for the purposes of this Section 20, the "Section
20 Refunding Date") of United States Dollar-denominated debt
securities in an aggregate principal amount at least equal to the
principal amount of the Outstanding Certificates on the Section 20
Refunding Date and, subject to clause (w) of Section 20(a)(ii), all
interest accrued thereon to the Section 20 Refunding Date and (y) the
application of the proceeds of the sale of such debt securities to the
redemption of all such Certificates on the Section 20 Refunding Date;

(ii) the Lessee and the Owner Trustee will amend the
Lease such that (w) if the Section 20 Refunding Date is not a Lease
Period Date, the Lessee shall on the Section 20 Refunding Date prepay
that portion of the next succeeding installment of Basic Rent as shall
equal the aggregate interest accrued on the Outstanding Certificates
to the Section 20 Refunding Date in the event that such interest is
not financed through the issuance of debt securities on the Section 20
Refunding Date,provided that if the Section 20 Refunding Date occurs
on or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date, the Owner Participant
may, pursuant to Section 16(a), prepay the Excess Payment Amount or
such portion thereof on the Section 20 Refunding Date as the Lessee
and the Owner Participant shall agree is advisable in order to
optimize the revised rental schedules to be calculated pursuant to
Section 20(c), x) Basic Rent payable in respect of the period from and
after the Section 20 Refunding Date shall be recalculated pursuant to
Section 20(c) to preserve the Owner

89
<PAGE> 94
Participant's Revised Net Economic Return, (y) amounts payable in
respect of Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value from and after
the Section 20 Refunding Date shall be appropriately recalculated
pursuant to Section 20(c) to preserve the Owner Participant's Revised
Net Economic Return and z) the Special Purchase Price Percentage and
the Special Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated pursuant to
Section 20(c);

(iii) the Owner Trustee will enter into an agreement to provide
for the securing thereunder of the debt securities issued by the Owner
Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 20 in like manner as
the Certificates issuable under the Trust Indenture and/or will enter
into such amendments and supplements to the Trust Indenture as may be
necessary to effect such refunding or refinancing; and

(iv) unless otherwise agreed by the Owner Participant, the Lessee
shall pay as Supplemental Rent on an After-Tax Basis all reasonable
fees, costs, and expenses of such refunding or refinancing;

provided, however, that if within 15 days after receipt of a request from the
Lessee to effect the Section 20 Refinancing, which request specifies the
proposed structural terms of such refinancing and the amount of refinancing
indebtedness, the Owner Participant provides the Lessee with a written notice
to the effect that there will be a risk of adverse tax consequences to the
Owner Participant resulting from the Section 20 Refinancing and, if then
requested by the Lessee in writing, within 15 days after receipt of such
request, the Owner Participant provides the Lessee with a written opinion of
independent tax counsel selected by the Owner Participant and reasonably
acceptable to the Lessee to the effect that there will be a risk of such
adverse tax consequences to the Owner Participant resulting from the Section 20
Refinancing (other than the consequence that the refinanced loan constitutes
"qualified nonrecourse indebtedness" within the meaning of Temporary
Regulations Section 1.861-10T(b) for the purpose of the computation of the FSC
Benefits (as defined in the Tax Indemnity Agreement)), then the Owner Trustee
and the Owner Participant shall be required to effect the Section 20
Refinancing only if the Lessee shall have agreed to indemnify the Owner
Participant against such identified adverse tax consequences in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant; pro-

90
<PAGE> 95
vided, however, the parties agree that in the absence of a change in applicable
laws, regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures or judicial precedents
enacted, adopted or decided after the Delivery Date, the Section 20 Refinancing
will not be deemed for this purpose to result in a risk of the Owner
Participant not being considered the owner of the Aircraft, Airframe, any
Engine or any Part for Federal or other income tax purposes.
Each of the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, each LOAN
PARTICIPANT and the Indenture Trustee agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
facilitate the Section 20 Refinancing, including, without limitation, by making
such modifications to, or entering into such amendments and supplements to, the
Operative Documents as may be appropriate or necessary to effect the Section 20
Refinancing.

(b) The Section 20 Refinancing shall not constitute a
refunding or refinancing for the purposes of Section 17. Any debt instruments
issued in connection with the Section 20 Refinancing shall not be subject to
optional redemption by the Owner Trustee without the consent of the Lessee
(except as provided in Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture).

(c) In connection with the Section 20 Refinancing, the Owner
Participant shall recalculate the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss
Values and Termination Values with respect to the Term and, if the Section 20
Refunding Date occurs on or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date, the
Excess Payment Amount payable pursuant to Section 16(a) hereof (such
recalculation of the Excess Payment Amount to take into account any prepayment
by the Owner Participant on such Section 20 Refunding Date of all or part of
the Excess Payment Amount under clause (w) of Section 20(a)(ii)), (i) to
achieve the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return, and (ii) to
minimize, to the greatest extent possible consistent with the foregoing clause
(i), the present value (discounted semiannually at an interest rate per annum
to be supplied by the Lessee) of the payments of Basic Rent. In addition, in
such event, the Special Purchase Price Percentage shall be recalculated in
order to preserve the Special Purchase Price Yield to the Special Purchase
Option Date of January 2, 2013; provided that the Special Purchase Price
Percentage for the Special Purchase Option Date, as so adjusted, shall not be
less than 51.8%. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner Participant, the
Owner Trustee and the Lessee agree that, at the Lessee's option, the Lessee

91
<PAGE> 96
may request that the Special Purchase Option Date be changed (and that the
Special Purchase Price Percentage be recalculated as of such changed date) to
whichever of the four Lease Period Dates preceding the Special Purchase Option
Date or the two Lease Period Dates following the Special Purchase Option Date
(each, an "Alternate Special Purchase Option Date") would result in the lowest
possible sum of (1) the present value (discounted semiannually at an interest
rate per annum to be supplied by the Lessee) of the payments of Basic Rent for
the period from the Section 20 Refunding Date to and including the applicable
Alternate Special Purchase Option Date (but excluding any Basic Rent designated
as payable in advance on such Alternate Special Purchase Option Date) and (2)
the present value (discounted semiannually at an interest rate per annum to be
supplied by the Lessee) of the Special Purchase Price as of such Alternate
Special Purchase Option Date, and that, if necessary, the Lease shall be
amended to reflect the change in the Special Purchase Option Date from January
2, 2013 to whichever of the Alternate Special Purchase Option Dates as would
give rise to the lowest such sum; provided that upon any such request by the
Lessee to change the Special Purchase Option Date to an Alternate Special
Purchase Option Date, the Owner Participant shall, at its cost and expense,
obtain an estimate of the fair market value (taking into account a reasonable
estimate for inflation and deflation) of the Aircraft, as of any Alternate
Special Purchase Option Dates specified by the Lessee, from AVMARK, Inc. or, if
AVMARK, Inc. shall not then be an independent aircraft appraiser, from an
independent aircraft appraiser selected by mutual agreement of the Owner
Participant and the Lessee or, if they shall be unable to agree, from an
appraiser selected pursuant to an Independent Appraisal (except that all costs
and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Owner Participant) and, if
the estimated fair market value of the Aircraft determined by such appraiser
(expressed as a percentage of Lessor's Cost) is more than the Special Purchase
Price Percentage calculated for the Alternate Special Purchase Option Date as
provided above in this sentence to which the Lessee has requested the Special
Purchase Option Date be changed, the Special Purchase Option Date shall remain
unchanged and the Special Purchase Price Percentage shall be the percentage
determined in accordance with the preceding sentence, unless the Lessee elects
that the Special Purchase Price Percentage as of such Alternate Special
Purchase Option Date shall be equal to such estimated fair market value
(computed as a percentage of Lessor's Cost), in

92
<PAGE> 97
which case the Lease shall be amended to reflect such Alternate Special
Purchase Option Date. In performing any such recalculations in respect of
Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value, the Owner Participant
shall utilize the same methods and assumptions originally used to calculate the
alternate schedules of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values and Termination
Values referred to in the definition of the Owner Participant's Revised Net
Economic Return and in performing any such recalculations in respect of the
Special Purchase Price Percentage, the Owner Participant shall, subject to the
proviso to the preceding sentence, utilize the same methods and assumptions
originally used to calculate the Special Purchase Price Percentage held in
escrow by Sidley & Austin pursuant to Section 18(d) (other than, in each case,
those assumptions changed as a result of the Section 20 Refinancing; it being
agreed that such recalculation shall reflect solely any changes of assumptions
or facts resulting directly from such Section 20 Refinancing or due to the
prior occurrence of any event taken into account in a recalculation pursuant to
Section 18), provided that, Basic Rent, as so recomputed, shall comply with the
requirements of Sections 4.02(5) and 4.07(1) of Revenue Procedure 75-28, 1975-1
C.B. 752, and shall not present a greater risk that Section 467(b)(2) of the
Code would apply than the risk that Section 467(b)(2) applied prior to such
recomputation, it being agreed that the requirements of clause (i) of Section
5.01 of Rev. Proc. 75-21, 1975-1 C.B. 715, shall be applied on a prospective
basis.

Upon completion of any recalculation described above in this
Section 20(c), a duly authorized officer of the Owner Participant shall provide
a certificate to the Lessee either (x) stating that the payments of Basic Rent,
Stipulated Loss Values and Termination Values with respect to the Term, and the
Special Purchase Price Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date, as are
then set forth in the Lease do not require change, or (y) setting forth such
adjustments to the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values or
Termination Values with respect to the Term and the Special Purchase Price
Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date, as have been calculated by the
Owner Participant in accordance with the above provisions. Such certificate
shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for any such adjustments. If the
Lessee shall so request, the recalculation of any such adjustments described in
this Section 20 shall be verified by procedures substantially identical to the
verification procedures set forth in Section 18(b). No adjustment may be made
to the pay-

93
<PAGE> 98
ments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values or Termination Values with respect
to the Term pursuant to this Section 20 except in accordance with the
provisions of Section 18(c).

SECTION 21. Miscellaneous. (a) Nothing contained in this
Agreement, or in the Lease, the Trust Indenture, the Trust Agreement or the Tax
Indemnity Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee by the Lessee of payments
due pursuant to the Certificates or of the residual value or useful life of the
Aircraft or any portion thereof.

(b) Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited and
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. This Agreement may be
executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall
together constitute but one and the same instrument. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended, supplemented, waived or
modified orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party
against which the enforcement of the termination, amendment, supplement, waiver
or modification is sought. The section and paragraph headings in this
Agreement and the index preceding this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not modify, define, expand or limit any of the terms
or provisions hereof and all references herein to numbered sections, unless
otherwise indicated, are to sections of this Agreement.

(c) The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and
shall inure to the benefit of, the Lessee and, subject to the terms of Section
13(E) hereof, its successors and permitted assigns, the Indenture Trustee and
its successors as Indenture Trustee under the Trust Indenture, the Owner
Trustee and its successors as Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement, the
Owner Participant and, subject to the provisions of Section 16(c) hereof, its
successors and permitted assigns, and the ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT and,
subject to the provisions of Section 9(p) hereof, the other LOAN PARTICIPANTS.
Each LOAN PARTICIPANT other than the ORIGINAL LOAN PARTICIPANT, by

94
<PAGE> 99
its acceptance of any Certificate, shall be deemed to have irrevocably and
unconditionally agreed to perform the obligations of a LOAN PARTICIPANT
hereunder and under the Trust Indenture.

(d) With respect to any opinion required to be delivered
under any Operative Document by counsel to any party hereto, each party hereto
hereby irrevocably instructs its applicable counsel to deliver such opinion to
and for the benefit of the parties that are the addressees of such opinion.

(e) (i) So long as no Indenture Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, without the consent of the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee will not modify, amend, supplement or waive any provision of
the Lease.

(ii) If an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Indenture Trustee shall have the right, without the consent of
the Owner Trustee, to modify, amend, supplement or waive any provision of the
Lease, or give any consent, waiver or authorization thereunder, unless such
Indenture Event of Default shall have resulted from a Lease Event of Default,
in which event the Indenture Trustee shall not, except as permitted by the
terms of Section 21(e)(iii), without the consent of the Owner Trustee, agree to
any such modification, amendment, supplement or waiver or give any such
consent, waiver or authorization (a "Proposed Adverse Lease Amendment"), if the
effect thereof is to reduce the amount or delay the time of payment of Basic
Rent, Stipulated Loss Value or Termination Value payable under the Lease,
extend the Basic Term or any Renewal Term under the Lease, change the terms or
conditions of any refinancing, reoptimization or purchase option under the
Lease or any insurance required to be maintained pursuant to the Lease, change
any requirement in Section 7(a) or (b) of the Lease, or otherwise materially
and adversely affect the interest of the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant.

(iii) If the Indenture Trustee shall propose to enter into any
Proposed Adverse Lease Amendment, it shall give prior written notice of the
substantive terms of such proposal and, if available, a copy of the Proposed
Adverse Lease Amendment which it proposes be entered into to the Owner Trustee
and the Owner Participant, and no such Proposed Adverse Lease Amendment shall
be entered into or effected for a period of 20 Business Days following such

95
<PAGE> 100
notice and delivery without the consent of the Owner Trustee. If the Owner
Trustee shall, at the end of such 20 Business-Day period, neither have
consented to the Proposed Adverse Lease Amendment nor have exercised its option
to purchase the Loan Certificates provided in Section 2.13 of the Indenture,
then, at any time within 20 Business Days after such notice and delivery during
which such Indenture Event of Default is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may
enter into or effect such Proposed Adverse Lease Amendment without the consent
of the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant.

(iv) Promptly after the execution and delivery thereof, either
the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, will provide or
cause to be provided to each Holder, the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant
and the other such party executed or true and correct copies of any
modification, amendment, supplement, waiver, consent or authorization executed
and delivered pursuant to this Section 21(e).

(v) At any time during the 20 Business-Day period commencing
with the giving of notice and delivery of a Proposed Adverse Lease Amendment
pursuant to Section 21(e)(iii), the Owner Trustee shall have the right to
repurchase the Loan Certificates pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Indenture as
if such period were the period referred to in clause (x) of such Section 2.13.

THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND SHALL IN ALL
RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND
PERFORMANCE.

<PAGE> 10

right to request the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee to effect
an optional redemption of all of the Equipment Notes issued under the
Trust Indenture or an optional redemption of all of the Equipment
Notes of the same maturity and bearing the same interest rate issued
under the Trust Indenture pursuant to Section 6.01(b)(2) or (3) of the
Trust Indenture (in each case, such term to include the Equipment
Notes originally issued under the Trust Indenture and any refunding
indebtedness pursuant to this Section 17) , as part of a refunding or
refinancing operation. Promptly on receipt of such request, the Owner
Participant will negotiate promptly in good faith to conclude an
agreement with the Lessee as to the terms of such refunding or
refinancing operation and upon such agreement:

(i) the Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Loan
Trustee, the Owner Trustee, and any other appropriate parties
will enter into a financing or loan agreement (which may
involve an underwriting agreement in connection with a public
offering; provided, however, that in the case of a refunding
or refinancing involving a public offering of debt securities,
the Lessee shall have the right to purchase such debt
securities and apply such debt securities as a credit against
its obligations to pay Rent) providing for (x) the issuance
and sale by the Owner Trustee or such other party as may be
appropriate to such institution or institutions on the date
specified in such agreement (for the purposes of this Section
17, the "Refinancing Date") of United States
dollar-denominated debt securities in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the sum of the principal amount of the
Equipment Notes to be redeemed, on the Refinancing Date, and,
subject to clause (w) of Section 17(a)(ii), all interest
accrued thereon to the Refinancing Date and (y) the
application of the proceeds of the sale of such debt
securities to the redemption of all such Equipment Notes on
the Refinancing Date;

(ii) the Lessee and the Owner Trustee will amend the
Lease such that (w) if the Refinancing Date is not a Lease
Period Date, the Lessee shall on the Refinancing Date prepay
that portion of the next succeeding installment of Basic Rent
as shall equal the aggregate interest accrued on the Equipment
Notes then being redeemed on the

10

Series AB

<PAGE> 11

Refinancing Date in the event that such interest is not financed
through the issuance of debt securities on the Refinancing Date, (x)
Basic Rent payable in respect of the period from and after the
Refinancing Date shall be recalculated to preserve the Owner
Participant's Revised Net Economic Return, (y) amounts payable in
respect of Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value from and after
the Refinancing Date shall be appropriately recalculated to preserve
the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return, and (z) the
Special Purchase Price Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date
shall be recalculated as provided in Section 18;

(iii) the Owner Trustee will enter into an agreement to
provide for the securing thereunder of the debt securities
issued by the Owner Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this
Section 17 in like manner as the Equipment Notes issuable
under the Trust Indenture and/or will enter into such
amendments and supplements to the Trust Indenture as may be
necessary to effect such refunding or refinancing, provided
that no such amendment or supplement will materially increase
the liabilities of or impair the rights of the Owner
Participant under the Operative Documents without the consent
of the Owner Participant; and

(iv) unless otherwise agreed by the Owner Participant,
the Lessee shall pay as Supplemental Rent on an After- Tax
Basis all reasonable fees, costs, and expenses of such
refunding or refinancing;

provided, however, that (v) the Lessee shall not request that less
than all of the Equipment Notes issued under the Trust Indenture be
redeemed as part of a refunding operation hereunder unless it
simultaneously requests that all the outstanding equipment notes held
in the same Pass Through Trust issued under the Other Indentures be
simultaneously redeemed, (w) there shall be no more than two such
refundings or refinancings (not including the Section 20 Refinancing),
(x) if within 15 days after receipt of a request from the Lessee to
effect a refunding or refinancing pursuant to this Section 17, which
request specifies the proposed structural terms and the amount
thereof, the Owner Participant provides the Lessee with a written
notice

11

Series AB

<PAGE> 12

to the effect that there will be a risk of adverse tax consequences to
the Owner Participant resulting from the refunding or refinancing and,
if then requested by the Lessee in writing, within 15 days after
receipt of such request, the Owner Participant provides the Lessee
with a written opinion of independent tax counsel selected by the
Owner Participant and reasonably acceptable to the Lessee to the
effect that there will be a risk of such adverse tax consequences to
the Owner Participant resulting from the refunding or refinancing
(other than the consequence that the refinanced loan constitutes
"qualified nonrecourse indebtedness" within the meaning of Temporary
Regulations Section 1.861-10T(b) for the purpose of the computation of
the FSC Benefits (as defined in the Tax Indemnity Agreement)), then
the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant shall be required to
effect such refunding or refinancing only if the Lessee shall have
agreed to indemnify the Owner Participant against such identified
adverse tax consequences in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Owner Participant; provided, however, the parties agree that in the
absence of a change in applicable laws, regulations, revenue rulings,
revenue procedures or judicial precedents enacted, adopted or decided
after the Delivery Date, a refinancing or refunding will not be deemed
for this purpose to result in a risk of the Owner Participant not
being considered the owner of the Aircraft, Airframe, any Engine or
any Part for Federal or other income tax purposes, (y) no such
refinancing or refunding shall require an increase in the amount of
the Owner Participant's investment in the beneficial ownership of the
Aircraft or shall cause the ratio of the newly issued debt to the
Owner Participant's then outstanding investment in the Aircraft to be
more than 4 to 1 and (z) except with respect to matters relating to
taxes, no such refunding or refinancing will materially increase the
liabilities of or impair the rights of the Owner Participant."

"(b) The Equipment Notes, and any other debt instruments
issued in connection with any refunding or refinancing operation
permitted by this Section 17, shall not be subject to optional
redemption by the Owner Trustee without the consent of the Lessee,
except as provided in the Trust Indenture."

12. Amendment of Section 18 of the Participation Agreement.
(a) Paragraph (a) of Section 18 is amended in its entirety to read as follows:

12

Series AB

<PAGE> 13

"(a) Calculation of Adjustments. In the event that (A) the
Transaction Costs are less or more than 1.49620759% of Lessor's Cost,
or (B) prior to the acceptance of the Aircraft on the Delivery Date:
(1) there shall have occurred a Change in Tax Law and (2) after having
been advised in writing by the Owner Participant of such Change in Tax
Law and the proposed adjustment to the payments of Basic Rent
resulting therefrom, Lessee shall have waived its right under Section
11 of the Participation Agreement to decline to proceed with the
transaction, or (C) a refinancing or refunding as contemplated by
Section 17 hereof occurs, or (D) the Delivery Date is other than July
2, 1991, or (E) if the Certificates are not refunded or refinanced on
or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date, the Excess Payment
Amount (as defined in the Original Participation Agreement) (after
adjustment for any Excess Payment Differential Amount) (as defined in
the Original Participation Agreement) is other than $1,947,948.23,
then, in each case, the Owner Participant shall recalculate the
payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values, Termination Values and
the Excess Payment Amount with respect to the Term (i) to preserve the
Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return and (ii) to minimize,
to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the foregoing clause
(i), the present value (discounted semiannually at an interest rate
per annum to be supplied by the Lessee) of the payments of Basic Rent.
In addition, in the event of a refinancing or refunding referred to in
clause (C) of the preceding sentence, the Special Purchase Price
Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated
in a manner consistent with the procedures specified in Section 20(c)
of the Original Participation Agreement. In performing any such
recalculations, the Owner Participant shall utilize the same methods
and assumptions used by the Owner Participant in the calculation of
the schedules included in the Amended and Restated Rent Schedule dated
as of May 26, 1994, as such assumptions may be changed as a result of
the event described in clause (A), (B), (C), (D) or (E) of the second
preceding sentence necessitating such recalculation or due to the
prior occurrence of any such event; provided that, Basic Rent, as so
recomputed, shall comply with the requirements of Section 4.02(5) and
4.07(1) of Revenue Procedure 75-28, 1975-1 C.B. 752, and shall not
present a greater risk that Section 467(b)(2) of the Code would apply
than the risk that Section 467(b)(2) applied prior to such

13

Series AB

<PAGE> 14

recomputation, it being agreed that the requirements of clause (i) of
Section 5.01 of Rev. Proc. 75-21, 1975-1 C.B. 715, shall be applied on
a prospective basis.

13. Deletion of Section 20 of the Participation Agreement.
Section 20 is hereby deleted and the words "[Intentionally Omitted]"
substituted therefor.

14. Amendment of Section 21 of the Participation Agreement.

(a) Section 21(c) is amended by inserting the following
sentence at the end thereof. "No purchaser or holder of any Equipment Note
(including any Loan Participant) shall be deemed to be a successor or assign of
any of the Original Loan Participants."

(b) Section 21(e) of the Participation Agreement is amended
by deleting it in its entirety.

(c) Section 21 is hereby renumbered Section 22.

Through Trust Documents. (a) In the event that the Loan Trustee
gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Section 9.06(b) of the
Trust Indenture, the Lessee may direct the Owner Trustee to appoint,
and the Owner Trustee shall promptly appoint, a successor Loan
Trustee.

(b) In the event that either the Owner Trustee or the Lessee
obtains knowledge of the existence of any of the grounds for removal
of the Loan Trustee set forth in Section 9.06 of the Trust Indenture,
the Owner Trustee or the Lessee, as the case may be, shall promptly
give notice (the "Removal Notice") to the other by telephone,
confirmed in writing. Within five Business Days after the giving of
the Removal Notice, the Lessee may direct the Owner Trustee to remove,
and the Owner Trustee shall remove, the Loan Trustee and appoint a
successor Loan Trustee, provided that, if within ten Business Days
after the giving of the Removal Notice the Loan Trustee shall not have
been removed, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed without further act to
have delegated to the Lessee the right, on behalf of the Owner
Trustee, to remove the Loan

14

Series AB

<PAGE> 15

Trustee and appoint a successor, and, in the event of the removal of
the Loan Trustee in accordance with such delegation, the Lessee agrees
to appoint promptly a successor Loan Trustee.

(c) The Lessee shall not enter into any modification or
amendment of any Pass Through Trust Document in any manner affecting
the Pass Through Trusts created pursuant to the Pass Through Trust
Supplements, without the consent of the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

SECTION 1. Sale and Purchase; Participation in Lessor's Cost
for Aircraft; Terms of Certificates. (a) Sale and Purchase. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Lessee agrees to sell to the Owner
Trustee, and the Owner Trustee agrees to purchase from the Lessee, the Aircraft

or more Certificates issued to the Original Loan Participant by the Owner

participation required to be made as above provided in the payment of Lessor's
Cost is hereinafter called the Owner Participant's "Commitment" for the
Aircraft and the amount of the Loan Participant's participation required to be
made as above provided in the payment of Lessor's Cost is hereinafter called
the Original Loan Participant's "Commitment" for the Aircraft.

(c) Prepayment of Certificates; Determination of Debt Rate.
Each of the Loan Participants and the Owner Participant hereby agrees that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Participation
Agreement, the Lease, the Trust Indenture, the Certificates, or the Trust
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Lessee, the Owner Trustee
shall not take any action with respect to the Certificates concerning the
optional prepayment of such Certificates (except as provided in Section 2.13 of
the Trust Indenture), or the selection of the Debt Rate to be borne at any time
or from time to time by such Certificates, or the Interest Periods to be
applica-

4
AF-2
<PAGE> 9
ble to the calculation of interest on the Certificates. The Owner Trustee
hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Lessee to act as its exclusive
agent (and agrees that it will not act other than through the Lessee, as such
agent) for the purpose of selecting the durations of the Interest Periods to be
applicable from time to time to calculations of interest on the Certificates
and designating the Debt Rate from time to time to be borne on the
Certificates. Each of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Participant and each
Loan Participant hereby consents to such appointment and authorization. In
taking any actions as agent of the Owner Trustee as aforesaid, the Lessee shall
be authorized to deal directly with the Indenture Trustee and the Loan
Participants, and the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, each Loan
Participant and the Indenture Trustee each agrees to cooperate with the Lessee
and the Original Loan Participant and otherwise to do all things and take all
actions reasonably necessary to effect the actions taken by the Lessee as the
agent of the Owner Trustee under this Section 1(c). Except to the extent
otherwise provided in Section 2.01 of the Trust Indenture, the Debt Rate
applicable to the Loan Certificates for each Interest Period shall be
determined by election of the Lessee (as agent for the Owner Trustee) by
delivering telephonic notice to the Original Loan Participant (whether or not
it at the time holds any Loan Certificates), followed in each case by telexed,
telecopied or other written confirmation (with a copy to the Indenture Trustee
and the Owner Trustee), not less than three Euro Business Days prior to the

Short Period Rate Loan utilizing a Short Period Rate determined as provided in

the definition of Short Period Rate, specifying the duration of such Interest
Period and whether the Debt Rate for such Interest Period shall be determined
by reference to the LIBOR Rate or the Short Period Rate. The Indenture Trustee
shall provide to each Loan Participant other than the Original Loan Participant
a copy of any notice provided by the Lessee pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence promptly after receipt thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Lessee may only select a Short Period Rate (i) during any
period, and from time to time during such

5
AF-2
<PAGE> 10
period, in which the Lessee is in contemplation of a proposed prepayment of the
Loan Certificates pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14 of the Trust Indenture
(whether or not a notice of prepayment has been given pursuant to Section 2.12
or 2.14 of the Trust Indenture) or (ii) at any time when the selection of a
LIBOR Rate would result in the succeeding Interest Period commencing on a day
other than the tenth day of a calendar month. The Original Loan Participant
(whether or not it at the time holds any Loan Certificates) shall provide to
each of the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, each other Loan Participant,
the Indenture Trustee and the Lessee an officer's certificate setting forth the
applicable interest rate and the interest expected to accrue on the

payable on the Loan Certificates on such Lease Period Date.

provisions) and the regulations promulgated under the Code (including
temporary regulations), Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedures or
Revenue Rulings, or other administrative interpretations, applicable
judicial precedents or Executive Orders of the President of the United
States, as in effect on the date hereof, the effect of which might
preclude the Owner Participant from obtaining any of the income tax
benefits and consequences assumed to be available to the Owner
Participant as set forth in Section 1 of the Tax Indemnity Agreement.

(Y) No action or proceeding shall have been instituted nor
shall governmental action be threatened before any court or
governmental agency, nor shall any order, judgment or decree have been
issued or proposed to be issued by any court or governmental agency at
the time of the Delivery Date to set aside, restrain, enjoin or
prevent the completion and consummation of this Participation
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Promptly upon the registration of the Aircraft and the
recording of the Manufacturer's FAA Bill of Sale, the FAA Bill of Sale, the
Lease (with the Lease Supplement covering the Aircraft, the Trust Indenture and
the Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement covering the Aircraft attached)
and the Trust Indenture (with such Lease Supplement and such Trust Agreement
and Trust Indenture Supplement attached) pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act,
the Lessee will cause Crowe & Dunlevy, P.C., special counsel in Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma, to deliver to the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee and the Lessee an opinion as to the due registration of the Aircraft,
and the due recording of such instruments and the lack of filing of any
intervening documents with respect to the Aircraft.

SECTION 5. Postponement of Delivery Date. (a) In the event
that (i) the Original Loan Participant shall for any reason fail or refuse to
make the full amount of its Commitment for the Aircraft available to the Owner
Trustee in accordance with the terms of Section 2 hereof, or (ii) the Owner
Participant shall for any reason fail or refuse to make the full amount of its
Commitment

17
AF-2
<PAGE> 22
for the Aircraft available to the Owner Trustee in accordance with the terms of
Section 2 hereof, the Owner Trustee will forthwith give each party hereto telex
or telegraphic notice of such default and the Delivery Date for the Aircraft
will be postponed up to the fifth succeeding Business Day as the Lessee may
direct (and the term "Delivery Date" as used in this Agreement shall mean such
postponed "Delivery Date"); provided that such postponed Delivery Date shall
not be a date later than September 30, 1991. During such period, the Lessee
shall have the right to find another leasing or financial institution to be
substituted for the defaulting Original Loan Participant or Owner Participant,
as the case may be; provided that in either event the institution so
substituted shall sign and deliver an agreement, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Lessee, by which it will assume the balance of the
Commitment of the defaulting Original Loan Participant or Owner Participant, as
the case may be. Upon the execution and delivery of such agreement, the
institution so substituted shall become the Original Loan Participant or the
Owner Participant, as the case may be, and shall be deemed substituted for the
defaulting Participant, for all purposes of this Agreement, the Trust
Agreement, the Trust Indenture, and the Lease and to have assumed all
obligations of the defaulting Participant thereunder which accrue after the
date of execution and delivery. No action by the Lessee under this Section
5(a) shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or release of any right which the
Lessee may have against the defaulting Participant. In the event that the
Lessee cannot find another institution to be substituted for the defaulting
Participant within such five Business Day period, then, in such event (i) the
Owner Trustee shall not accept delivery of the Aircraft and (ii) this
Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Trust Indenture, the Lease and the Purchase
Agreement Assignment shall terminate and be of no further force or effect
except as expressly provided herein or therein.

(b) A scheduled Delivery Date for the Aircraft may be
postponed from time to time for any reason (but no later than September 30,
1991), other than pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, if the Lessee gives the
Owner Participant, the Original Loan Participant, the Indenture Trustee and the
Owner Trustee telex, telegraphic, facsimile or telephonic (confirmed in
writing) notice of such postponement and notice of the date to which such
Delivery Date has been postponed, such notice of postponement to be

18
AF-2
<PAGE> 23
received by each party no later than 2:00 P.M., New York City time, on the
originally scheduled Delivery Date.

(c) In the event of any postponement of the Delivery Date
pursuant to Section 5(b) hereof, or if on an originally scheduled Delivery Date
not postponed as above provided the Aircraft is not delivered to the Lessor by
3:00 P.M. or, if delivered, is not accepted by the Owner Trustee for any
reason, the Owner Trustee will return by 4:00 P.M. on such date, any funds
which it shall have received from any Participant as its Commitment for the
Aircraft, absent joint instruction from the Lessee and such Participant to
retain funds until the specified date of postponement established under Section
5(b).

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, no
Participant shall be under any obligation to make its Commitment available
beyond 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on September 30, 1991.

SECTION 6. Extent of Interest of Loan Participants. A Loan
Participant shall have no further interest in, or other right with respect to,
the Indenture Estate when and if the principal of and interest on all
Certificates held by such Loan Participant and all other sums payable to such
Loan Participant hereunder, under the Trust Indenture and under such
Certificates shall have been paid in full. By acceptance of a Certificate,
each Loan Participant agrees that it will look solely to the income and
proceeds from the Indenture Estate to the extent available for distribution to
such Loan Participant as provided in Section 2.05 of the Trust Indenture and
that neither the Owner Participant nor the Owner Trustee shall be personally
liable to such Loan Participant for any amounts payable under the Certificates,
the Trust Indenture or hereunder, except as expressly provided in the Operative
Documents.

Lessee and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole;

Indenture (with such Lease Supplement and such Trust Agreement and
Indenture Supplement attached), no further action, including any

(xii) the Lessee has not voluntarily subjected the Aircraft to any

hereby shall be consummated, the Lessee agrees to indemnify, protect, defend
and hold harmless on an After-Tax Basis each Indemnitee against Claims in any

AF-2
<PAGE> 30

9, 10, 15 or 20 of the Lease;

(vii) Any Claim to the extent caused by a failure on the part of
the Owner Trustee to distribute in accordance with the Trust Agreement
any amounts received and distributable by it thereunder;

(viii) Any Claim (other than to the extent any such Claim is
brought against the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee and the
Related Indemnitee Group of such Indemnitee) to the extent caused by a
failure on the part of the Indenture Trustee to distribute in
accordance with the Trust Indenture any amounts received and

giving or withholding by such Indemnitee of any future amendments,

Participation Agreement and the other Operative Documents, other than

Documents in order to give effect thereto;

(x) Any Claim to the extent caused by an Indenture Default that
does not also constitute an Event of Default under the Lease;

other than the Lessee to pay a

26
AF-2
<PAGE> 31
cost, fee or expense payable by such Person in accordance with Section
9(a), 9(b), 9(c), 9(e), 9(f), 9(g), 9(j), 16(b), 16(c), or 18(b)

(xiii) Any Claim that is an ordinary and usual operating or
overhead expense other than to the extent caused by (a) the occurrence
of an Event of Default or an Event of Loss or b) circumstances beyond
the scope of routine portfolio administration (such routine portfolio
administration to be deemed to include tax preparation and other
normally occurring administrative tasks but shall not include any
administrative obligations of the Lessee under the Operative Documents
performed by any Indemnitee);

(xiv) Any Claim to the extent that such Claim relates to amounts
payable by the Owner Trustee to the Indenture Trustee in respect of
the Break Amount, if any, payable with respect to the Certificates as

Event of Default; and

(xv) Any Claim made by a direct or indirect corporate parent of
an Indemnitee, to the extent that such Claim is based on losses
suffered by or any decline in the net worth of such Indemnitee (but
only to the extent that such losses or such decline in net worth is
caused by events for which such Indemnitee is not indemnifiable by the
Lessee under the Operative Documents).

A limitation on the Claims of one Indemnitee under this Section 7(b)(4) shall
not provide a basis for limiting any Claim of any other Indemnitee.

(5) Insured Claims. In the case of any Claim indemnified by
the Lessee hereunder which is covered by a policy of insurance maintained by
the Lessee pursuant to Section 11 of the Lease, each Indemnitee agrees to
cooperate with the insurers in the exercise of their rights to investigate,
defend or compromise such Claim as may be required to retain the benefits of
such insurance with respect to such Claim.

27
AF-2
<PAGE> 32

(6) Claims Procedure. An Indemnitee shall promptly notify
the Lessee of any Claim as to which indemnification is sought. Subject to the
rights of insurers under policies of insurance maintained pursuant to Section
11 of the Lease, so long as no Event of Default under Section 14(f), 14(g),
14(h) or 14(i) of the Lease shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee
(at its sole cost and expense) shall have the right to investigate, and the
right in its sole discretion to defend or compromise, any Claim for which
indemnification is sought under this Section 7(b), and the Indemnitee shall
cooperate with all reasonable requests of the Lessee in connection therewith;
provided, however, that so long as an Event of Default under Section 14(a) of
the Lease has occurred and is continuing, such Indemnitee shall have the right,
along with the concomitant right of the Lessee, to investigate, defend or
compromise any such Claim. Where the Lessee or the insurers under a policy of
insurance maintained by the Lessee undertake the defense of an Indemnitee with
respect to a Claim, no additional legal fees or expenses of such Indemnitee in
connection with the defense of such Claim shall be indemnified hereunder unless
such fees or expenses were incurred at the request of the Lessee or such
insurers; provided, however, that if (i) in the written opinion of counsel to
such Indemnitee an actual or potential material conflict of interest exists
where it is advisable for such Indemnitee to be represented by separate counsel
or (ii) such Indemnitee has been indicted or otherwise charged in a criminal
complaint and such Indemnitee informs the Lessee that such Indemnitee desires
to be represented by separate counsel, the reasonable fees and expenses of any
such separate counsel shall be borne by the Lessee. Subject to the
requirements of any policy of insurance, an Indemnitee may participate at its
own expense in any judicial proceeding controlled by the Lessee pursuant to the
preceding provisions; provided that such party's participation does not, in the
opinion of the independent counsel appointed by the Lessee or its insurers to
conduct such proceedings, interfere with such control; and such participation
shall not constitute a waiver of the indemnification provided in this Section
7(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Lessee
shall not under any circumstances be liable for the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for all Indemnitees except in the case specified in the
proviso to the third sentence of this paragraph (6).

28
AF-2
<PAGE> 33
(7) Subrogation. To the extent that a Claim indemnified by
the Lessee under this Section 7(b) is in fact paid in full by the Lessee and/or
an insurer under a policy of insurance maintained by the Lessee pursuant to
Section 11 of the Lease, the Lessee and/or such insurer, as the case may be,
shall be subrogated to the rights and remedies of the Indemnitee on whose
behalf such Claim was paid (other than rights of such Indemnitee under
insurance policies maintained at its own expense) with respect to the
transaction or event giving rise to such Claim, except that the Lessee shall
not be subrogated to any rights or remedies that the Owner Trustee may have
against the Owner Participant under Section 7.01 of the Trust Agreement or that
the Indenture Trustee may have against the Owner Trustee under Section 7.01 of
the Trust Indenture. Should an Indemnitee receive any refund, in whole or in
part, with respect to any Claim paid by the Lessee hereunder, it shall promptly
pay the amount refunded (but not an amount in excess of the amount the Lessee
or any of its insurers has paid in respect of such Claim) over to the Lessee.
Moreover, if, by reason of any Claim that the Lessee has paid or indemnified
against pursuant to this Section 7(b), an Indemnitee realizes an actual
reduction in any Taxes that was not previously taken into account in computing
a payment by the Lessee pursuant to this Section 7(b), then such Indemnitee
shall promptly pay to the Lessee an amount equal to the actual net reduction in
Taxes realized by such Indemnitee attributable thereto plus the actual
reduction in Taxes realized by such Indemnitee as a result of any payment to
the Lessee pursuant to this sentence. Each Indemnitee shall in good faith use
reasonable diligence in filing its tax returns and in dealing with taxing
authorities to seek and claim any tax benefits that would result in such net
reductions in Taxes.

(8) No Guaranty. Nothing set forth in this Section 7(b)
shall constitute a guarantee by the Lessee that the Aircraft shall have any
particular useful life or residual value or a guarantee to the Indenture
Trustee or the Loan Participants that the Certificates will be paid. Each of
the Loan Participants agrees that the provisions of Section 2.18 of the Trust
Indenture constitute its sole remedy for the reimbursement of Increased Costs
described therein and that nothing in this Section 7(b) shall constitute an
indemnity for any Increased Cost or any cost or loss in the nature of an
Increased Cost.

29
AF-2
<PAGE> 34
(c) General Tax Indemnity. (1) Indemnity. Except as
provided in Section 7(c)(2) hereof, the Lessee shall pay or indemnify and hold

fees) and all taxes, whether now existing or hereafter adopted (including,
without limitation, income, gross receipts, sales, use, value-added, property
(tangible and intangible), excise and stamp taxes), levies, imposts, duties,

(including amounts so payable by any such Tax Indemnitee solely as withholding
agent), the Lessee, any sublessee, sub-sublessee or other user of the Aircraft,
any Engine, or any Part, or any Affiliate of any such user, or imposed against
the Aircraft, any Engine or any Part, by any Federal, state or local government
or other taxing authority in the United States or by any foreign government or
by any territory or possession of the United States or by any international
authority or by any political subdivision or taxing authority of any of the
foregoing (hereinafter, a "Taxing Authority") in connection with or relating to
(a) the construction, mortgaging, financing, refinancing, purchase,
acquisition, acceptance, rejection, delivery, nondelivery, transport, location,
ownership, control, insurance, registration, reregistration, deregistration,
assembly, possession, repossession, operation, use, condition, maintenance,

storage, redelivery, manufacture, leasing, subleasing, modification,
rebuilding, importation, transfer of title, transfer of registration,
exportation or other application or disposition of, the Aircraft, any Engine or
any Part or any interest in any thereof, (b) payments of Rent or the receipts,
income or earnings arising therefrom or received with respect to the Aircraft,
any Engine or any Part or any interest in any thereof or payable pursuant to
the Lease, (c) any amount paid or payable pursuant to any Operative Document,

of the Certificates or any interest in any or all thereof, or the offering,
registration, reregistration, issuance, acquisition, assumption, modification,

suance, refinancing or refunding of any or all thereof, and any other documents
contemplated hereby or thereby and amendments and supplements hereto and
thereto, (f) the payment of the principal of, or interest or premium on, or
other amounts payable with respect to, any or all of the Certificates, whether
as originally issued or pursuant to any refinancing, refunding, assumption,

replacement of the loan evidenced by any or all of the Certificates, (g) any

Section 9(d) hereof, (h) the property, or the income, earnings, receipts or
other proceeds received with respect to the property, held by the Indenture
Trustee under the Trust Indenture or (i) otherwise with respect to or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents.

(2) Exclusions. The provisions of Section 7(c)(1) hereof
shall not apply to:

at any time a replacement Owner Trustee or Indenture Trustee), their

34
AF-2
<PAGE> 39
request or a change that is consented to by the Lessee in writing,

Estate to another jurisdiction;

(xi) Taxes imposed on a Tax Indemnitee (other than the Indenture

related Tax Indemnitee to comply with (x) certification, information,
documentation, reporting or other similar requirements concerning the
nationality, residence, identity or connection with the jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes, if such Tax Indemnitee's or any related Tax
Indemnitee's compliance is required by statute or by regulation of the
jurisdiction imposing such Taxes as a precondition to relief or
exemption from such Taxes and the Tax Indemnitee or such related Tax
Indemnitee was eligible for such relief or exemption or (y) any other
certification, information, documentation, reporting or other similar
requirements under the Tax laws or regulations of the jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes that would establish entitlement to otherwise
applicable relief or exemption from such Taxes, provided that the
exclusion set forth in this subparagraph (xi) shall not apply if such
failure to comply was due to a failure of the Lessee (A) timely to
notify such Tax Indemnitee of such requirement or (B) to provide
reasonable assistance in complying with such requirement or, in the
case of the Owner Participant, if such failure was the result of the
Owner Trustee's negligence or the Owner Trustee's actions or failure
to act in accordance with instructions of the Owner Participant or, in
the case of any Loan Participant, if such failure was the result of
the Indenture Trustee's negligence or the Indenture Trustee's actions
or failure to act in accordance with instructions of such Loan
Participant;

(xii) Taxes in the nature of any intangible or similar tax upon or
with respect to the value of the interest of the Owner Participant in

AF-2
<PAGE> 40

Participant is subject to tax without regard to the ownership or lease
of the Aircraft;

(xiii) Taxes that would not have been imposed but for an amendment
to any Operative Documents not consented to by the Lessee in writing
(other than any amendment that occurs after an Event of Default has
occurred and while it is continuing);

(xiv) Taxes imposed on the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee or
the Trust Estate by the United States or by any state or local
government or taxing authority in the United States (including any
territory or possession thereof) by reason of the trust described in
the Trust Agreement being taxed in the same manner as a corporation;

(xv) Taxes (other than Taxes in the nature of property, sales,
use or rental Taxes) imposed on any Loan Participant that are on,
based on or measured by gross or net income or gross or net receipts
of such Loan Participant or any related Tax Indemnitee (including any
minimum Taxes and any Taxes on or measured by any items of tax
preference) or that are franchise Taxes, Taxes on doing business or
Taxes on, based on or measured by capital or net worth of such Loan
Participant or any related Tax Indemnitee by (x) the Federal
government of the United States or (y) any state or local government
or taxing authority in the United States or any foreign government or
any territory or possession of the United States or any international
authority or any political subdivision or taxing authority of any of
the foregoing except to the extent that such Taxes would have been due
had the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents been the
sole connection between the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and such
Loan Participant,provided that there shall not be excluded under
clause (x) or (y) of this subparagraph (xv) Taxes to the extent
imposed by reason of such Loan Participant being treated as having a
taxable exchange as a result of an assumption by the Lessee of the
rights and obligations of the Owner Trustee under the Indenture and
the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.16 of the Indenture (it being
understood that nothing in this paragraph (xv) shall impair the right
of any

36
AF-2
<PAGE> 41
Loan Participant to an indemnity pursuant to Section 2.04 of the
Indenture); and

(xvi) Taxes imposed on any Loan Participant in the nature of any
intangible or similar tax upon or with respect to the value of the
interest of such Loan Participant in any Certificate or the loan
evidenced thereby, except to the extent that such Taxes would have
been due had the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents
been the sole connection between the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes
and such Loan Participant.

(3) Tax Benefit Payback. If, by reason of the payment or
accrual of any Taxes indemnified hereunder, a Tax Indemnitee realizes an actual
reduction in any Taxes, which reduction in Taxes was not taken into account in
calculating any indemnity payments made by the Lessee hereunder, then such Tax
Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Lessee an amount equal to such actual
reduction in Taxes, if any, plus the actual reduction in Taxes realized by such
Tax Indemnitee or any related Tax Indemnitee as the result of any payment made
by such Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this sentence. Each Tax Indemnitee shall in
good faith use diligence in filing its tax returns and in dealing with Taxing
Authorities to seek and claim any tax benefit that would result in any such
reduction in Taxes or any refund of any Taxes payable or indemnifiable by the
Lessee hereunder, provided that no Loan Participant shall have any obligation
to claim any credit or any deduction in priority to any other claims, reliefs,
credits or deductions available to it. Any Taxes that are imposed on any Tax
Indemnitee as a result of the disallowance or reduction of any reduction in
Taxes referred to in the second preceding sentence as to which (and to the
extent) such Tax Indemnitee has made any payment to the Lessee required hereby
shall be treated as a Tax for which the Lessee is obligated to indemnify such
Tax Indemnitee pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7(c) without regard
to the exclusions set forth in Section 7(c)(2). For the purposes of this
Section 7(c)(3), items of foreign Tax of any Tax Indemnitee (other than any
Loan Participant) shall be deemed to be utilized by such Tax Indemnitee as
credits or deductions in any taxable year in accordance with the following:

37
AF-2
<PAGE> 42
(i) First, all available foreign Taxes other than those arising
out of leveraged lease transactions; and

(ii) Second, foreign Taxes arising from leveraged lease
transactions for which such Tax Indemnitee was not indemnified or held
harmless by anyone; and

(iii) Third, all available foreign Taxes for which such Tax
Indemnitee was indemnified or held harmless by the Lessee and all
other available foreign Taxes indemnified under any other leveraged
lease transactions (other than those arising from any transaction in
which there is an express agreement that such Taxes shall be utilized
last), on apari passu basis; and

(iv) Fourth, any remaining foreign Taxes arising from any
transaction in which there is an express agreement that such Taxes
shall be utilized after such Taxes described above.

(4) Contests. If a written claim shall be made against any
Tax Indemnitee for any Tax for which the Lessee is obligated pursuant to this
Section 7(c), such Tax Indemnitee shall notify the Lessee in writing promptly
of such claim, provided that the Lessee shall not be relieved of its
obligations hereunder by reason of a failure by the Tax Indemnitee to give such
notice unless such failure materially interferes with or prevents the Lessee
from exercising its contest rights hereunder. If the Lessee shall so request
in writing within 30 days after receipt of such notice, such Tax Indemnitee
shall in good faith at the Lessee's expense contest the imposition of such Tax
(including taking an appeal of any adverse judicial decision) by (a) resisting
payment of such Tax, (b) paying such Tax under protest or (c) paying such Tax
and seeking a refund or other repayment thereof, provided that, at such Tax
Indemnitee's option, such contest shall be conducted by the Lessee in the name
of such Tax Indemnitee or, if permitted by law, in the name of the Lessee, and
that in no event shall such Tax Indemnitee be required to contest, or the
Lessee permitted to contest in the name of such Tax Indemnitee or the Lessee,
the imposition of any Tax for which the Lessee is obligated pursuant to this
Section 7(c) unless (v) the Lessee shall have delivered a written opinion of
its internal counsel or outside counsel to the effect that there is a
reasonable basis (consistent

38
AF-2
<PAGE> 43
with Formal Opinion 85-352 of the American Bar Association) for contesting such
claim, (w) if an Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing, the
Lessee shall have provided security for its obligations hereunder reasonably
satisfactory to the Tax Indemnitee, (x) the Lessee shall have agreed to pay
such Tax Indemnitee on demand all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
that such Tax Indemnitee may incur in connection with contesting such claim
(including, without limitation, all reasonable legal and accounting fees and
disbursements), (y) the action to be taken will not result in any material
danger of sale, forfeiture or loss of the Aircraft, Airframe, any Engine or any
material Part or any interest in any thereof and (z) if such contest shall be
conducted in a manner requiring the payment of the claim, the Lessee shall pay
such claim or shall advance to the Tax Indemnitee on an interest- free basis
and with no additional net after-tax cost to the Tax Indemnitee sufficient
funds to pay the claim. Except as otherwise provided herein, the contest shall
be conducted in the manner determined by the Lessee unless it involves issues
with respect to which the Lessee would not be required to indemnify such Tax
Indemnitee hereunder which can not be severed by reasonable efforts of such Tax
Indemnitee from all issues with respect to which the Lessee would be liable
hereunder. If the contest involves issues with respect to which the Lessee
would not be required to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee hereunder that can not
be severed by reasonable efforts of such Tax Indemnitee from all issues with
respect to which the Lessee would be liable hereunder, such Tax Indemnitee may
in its sole discretion select the forum for such contest and determine the
manner in which such contest shall be conducted, provided that such Tax
Indemnitee shall afford the Lessee and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
discuss with such Tax Indemnitee the Lessee's interests with respect to such
contest. No contest of any issue with respect to which the Lessee would be
required to indemnify hereunder shall be settled without the prior written
consent of the Lessee unless the Tax Indemnitee waives (by written notice to
the Lessee) the payment by the Lessee of any amount that might otherwise be
payable by the Lessee under this Section 7(c) in respect of such issue and any
related issue the contest of which is effectively foreclosed by the settlement
of such issue, including any payment arising from such issue in subsequent
years or which arises by reason of the fact that such issue is of a continuing
nature, and promptly pays to the Lessee any amount previously paid or advanced

39
AF-2
<PAGE> 44
by the Lessee with respect to such issue or the contest of such issue, provided
that if there has been an adverse judicial decision with respect to such issue
or related issue the Tax Indemnitee, in determining whether it will terminate
the contest of such issue, shall afford the Lessee and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to discuss with such Tax Indemnitee the Lessee's interests with
respect to such contest. If any Tax Indemnitee shall obtain a refund of all or
any part of any Tax paid by the Lessee or with funds provided by the Lessee,
such Tax Indemnitee shall pay the Lessee, net of any payments theretofore due
to such Tax Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 7(c) but unpaid and any other
payments theretofore due to such Tax Indemnitee under any of the Operative
Documents but unpaid, an amount equal to the amount of such refund, including
interest received attributable thereto, reduced by any Taxes incurred by such
Tax Indemnitee or a related Tax Indemnitee by reason of the receipt or accrual
of such refund and interest, and increased by any tax benefit realized by such
Tax Indemnitee or a related Tax Indemnitee as a result of any payment by such
Tax Indemnitee made pursuant to this sentence.

(5) Reports. If any report, return or statement is required
to be filed with respect to any Tax that is a property tax (or a tax in the
nature of a property tax) subject to indemnification under this Section 7(c),
the Lessee shall timely file the same (except for any such report, return or
statement which the Tax Indemnitee has notified the Lessee that the Tax
Indemnitee intends to file, provided that such Tax Indemnitee shall have
furnished the Lessee, at the Lessee's request and expense, with such
information, not within the control of the Lessee, as is in such Tax
Indemnitee's control and is reasonably available to such Tax Indemnitee and
reasonably necessary to file such returns. The Lessee shall either file such
report, return or statement so as to show the ownership of the Aircraft in the
Owner Trustee and send a copy of such report, return or statement to the Tax
Indemnitee, and the Owner Trustee if the Tax Indemnitee is not the Owner
Trustee, or, where the Lessee is not permitted to so file, shall notify the Tax
Indemnitee of such requirement and prepare and deliver such report, return or
statement to the Tax Indemnitee in a manner satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee
within a reasonable time prior to the time such report, return or statement is
to be filed. The Lessee shall also furnish promptly upon written request such
data in its possession or otherwise

40
AF-2
<PAGE> 45
reasonably available to it as any Tax Indemnitee may reasonably request to
enable such Tax Indemnitee to comply with the requirements of any Taxing
Authority. The Lessee shall hold each Tax Indemnitee harmless from and against
the penalties, additions to tax and fines arising from any insufficiency or
inaccuracy in any such report, return or statement or fairly attributable to
the inaccuracy of any data supplied to any Tax Indemnitee by the Lessee,
without regard to whether such penalties, additions to tax and fines are
otherwise indemnifiable under this Section 7(c). If any report, return or
statement is required to be filed with respect to any Tax (other than a
property tax or a tax in the nature of a property tax) subject to
indemnification under this Section 7(c), the Lessee will promptly notify the
appropriate Tax Indemnitee upon the Lessee's obtaining actual knowledge of such
requirement. If the Lessee receives written notice from a Taxing Au-thority of
a Tax that is imposed upon a Tax Indemnitee but not indemnified against by the
Lessee hereunder, the Lessee will forward a copy of such notice to such Tax
Indemnitee.

(6) Payment. The Lessee shall pay any Tax for which it is
liable pursuant to this Section 7(c), directly to the appropriate taxing
authority or upon demand of a Tax Indemnitee to such Tax Indemnitee, within 30
Business Days of a written demand, but in no event prior to the date such Tax
is due (including all extensions), or, in the case of Taxes which are being
contested, the time such contest is finally resolved. Any such demand shall
specify in reasonable detail the calculation to the payment and the facts upon
which the right to payment is based. Each Tax Indemnitee shall promptly
forward to the Lessee any notice, bill or advice received by it concerning any
Tax which the Lessee may be required to indemnify against hereunder. Upon the
written request of an appropriate Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee shall furnish such
Tax Indemnitee the original or a certified copy of a receipt (if any is
available to the Lessee) for the Lessee's payment of any Tax that is subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7(c), or such other evidence of
payment of such Tax as is acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee (and available to
the Lessee).

(7) Application of Payments During Existence of Event of
Default. Any amount payable to the Lessee pursuant to the terms of this
Section 7(c) shall not be paid to the Lessee if at the time such payment would
otherwise

41
AF-2
<PAGE> 46
be made an Event of Default or event that with lapse of time would constitute
an Event of Default under Section 14(a), 14(h) or 14(i) of the Lease shall have
occurred and be continuing but shall be held by the Tax Indemnitee as security
for the obligations of the Lessee under the Operative Documents and, if the
Lessor declares the Lease to be in default pursuant to Section 15 thereof (or
the Lease is deemed to be declared in default), applied against the Lessee's
obligations under the Operative Documents as and when due, provided that no
such amount shall be held as security for more than 180 days unless the Lessor
or the Indenture Trustee shall be precluded by law or court order from
exercising remedies under Section 15 of the Lease. At such time as there shall
not be continuing any such Event of Default or other event or such 180-day
period shall have elapsed, such amount shall be paid to the Lessee to the
extent not previously applied in accordance with the preceding sentence.

(8) Forms, Etc. Each Tax Indemnitee agrees to furnish from
time to time to the Lessee or to such other person as the Lessee may designate,
at the Lessee's request in writing and expense, such duly executed and properly
completed forms as may be necessary or appropriate in order to claim any
reduction of or exemption from any withholding or other Tax imposed by any
Taxing Author-ity which the Lessee may be required to indemnify against
hereunder, if (x) such reduction or exemption is available to such Tax
Indemnitee and (y) the Lessee has provided such Tax Indemnitee with any
information necessary to complete such form not otherwise reasonably available
to such Tax Indemnitee.

(9) Non-Parties. If a Tax Indemnitee is not a party to this
Agreement, the Lessee may require the Tax Indemnitee to agree in writing, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Lessee, to the terms of this Section 7(c)
prior to making any payment to such Tax Indemnitee under this Section 7(c).

(10) Verification. At the Lessee's request, the amount of any
indemnity payment by the Lessee pursuant to this Section 7 or any payment by a
Tax Indemnitee to the Lessee pursuant to this Section 7 shall be verified and
certified by either the independent public accounting firm that audits the
financial statements of such Tax Indemnitee (provided that such firm shall have
its headquarters

42
AF-2
<PAGE> 47
in the United States) or another independent public accounting firm selected by
such Tax Indemnitee and reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee, provided that,
in the case of any Loan Participant, the amount of any payment by such Loan
Participant to the Lessee pursuant to this Section 7 shall be verified and
certified by the independent public accounting firm that audits the financial
statements of such Loan Participant. The fee of such independent public
accounting firm shall be paid by the Lessee unless such verification shall
disclose an error in such Tax Indemnitee's favor exceeding 10% of the amount of
such payment determined by the Tax Indemnitee, in which case such fee shall be
paid by such Tax Indemnitee. The Lessee will have no right to examine the tax
returns of the Tax Indemnitee in connection with the verification procedure
described in this Section 7(c)(10); each Tax Indemnitee agrees to cooperate
with the independent public accounting firm performing the verification and to
supply such firm with all information reasonably necessary to permit it to
accomplish such verification, provided that the information provided to such
firm by such Tax Indemnitee shall be for its confidential use.

(11) Definition. For purposes of this Section 7(c), "Tax
Indemnitee" shall mean the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, in its
individual capacity and as trustee, the Trust Estate, each Loan Participant,
the Indenture Trustee, in its individual capacity and as trustee, and the
Indenture Estate, and any reference to a Tax Indemnitee, the Owner Participant,
the Owner Trustee, the Trust Estate, any Loan Participant, the Indenture
Trustee or the Indenture Estate shall include its respective successors,
permitted assigns, officers, directors, agents, servants and Affiliates and
shall also include any member of the Affiliated Group of which such Tax
Indemnitee, the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Estate, such
Loan Participant, the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture Estate, as the case
may be, is a member.

(12) Subrogation. Upon payment of any Tax by the Lessee
pursuant to this Section 7(c) to or on behalf of a Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee,
without any further action, shall be subrogated (unless a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have entered a final judgment ordering the return of such
payment to the Lessee) to any claims that

43
AF-2
<PAGE> 48
such Tax Indemnitee may have relating thereto other than claims in respect of
insurance policies maintained by such Tax Indemnitee at its own expense. Such
Tax Indemnitee shall give such further reasonable assurances or agreements and
cooperate with the Lessee to permit the Lessee to pursue such claims; provided
that the Lessee shall reimburse such Tax Indemnitee for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs associated with such assurances, agreements or cooperation.

(d) Survival. The representations, warranties, indemnities
and agreements of the Lessee provided for in this Section 7 and the Lessee's
obligations under any and all thereof, and the obligations of any Indemnitee or
Tax Indemnitee under this Section 7, shall survive the Owner Participant's
making of its Commitment, the delivery of the Aircraft and the expiration or
other termination of the Operative Documents.

(e) Payments; Interest. Any payments made pursuant to this
Section 7 directly to an Indemnitee or a Tax Indemnitee or to the Lessee, as
the case may be, shall be made in immediately available funds at such bank or
to such account as is specified by the payee in written directions to the payor
or, if no such directions shall have been given, by check of the payor payable
to the order of the payee and mailed to the payee by certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid to its address referred to in Section 15(c)
to this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest at the
Overdue Rate shall be paid, on demand, on any amount or indemnity not paid when
due pursuant to this Section 7 until the same shall be paid. Such interest
shall be paid in the same manner as the unpaid amount in respect of which such
interest is due.

(f) Effect of Other Indemnities. The Lessee's obligations
under the indemnities provided for in this Agreement shall be those of a
primary obligor whether or not the Person indemnified shall also be indemnified
with respect to the same matter under the terms of this Agreement, the Lease,
the Trust Indenture, the Trust Agreement or any other document or instrument,
and the Person seeking indemnification from the Lessee pursuant to any
provisions of this Agreement may proceed directly against the Lessee without
first seeking to enforce any other right of indemnification.

(g) Exercise of Right. The Owner Trustee agrees with the
Lessee that it will exercise its rights

44
AF-2
<PAGE> 49
under Section 2.04(j) of the Trust Indenture solely at the Lessee's request and
direction.

SECTION 8. Representations and Warranties. (a) The Owner
Participant represents and warrants that neither it nor any Person authorized
by it to act on its behalf has directly or indirectly offered any Certificates
or any interest in and to the Trust Estate, the Trust Agreement, or any similar
security for sale, or solicited any offer to acquire any of the same other than
in a manner required or permitted by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and by the rules and regulations thereunder. The Owner Participant represents
and warrants that its interest in and to the Trust Estate and the Trust
Agreement is being acquired for its own account and it is being purchased for
investment and not with a view to any resale or distribution thereof; provided,
however, that such representation shall in no way limit the Owner Participant's
right to transfer such interest pursuant to, and in accordance with all the
terms and conditions of, Section 16(c) hereof.

AF-2
<PAGE> 57
cluding, without limitation, the fees and expenses of one (but only

Section 4, printing and document production or reproduction expenses
and all fees, taxes and other charges payable in connection with the
recording or filing of the instruments and financing statements
described in this Agreement.

Each of the Owner Trustee, the Lessee, the Original Loan
Participant and the Indenture Trustee shall promptly submit to the Owner
Participant copies of the invoices in respect of the foregoing transaction
costs as they are received, and in all events not later than December 31, 1991.
The Owner Participant prior to the payment thereof will send copies of any
invoices received by it with respect to any of the foregoing fees, expenses and
disbursements constituting transaction costs to the Lessee for the Lessee's
review and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

In the event that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the agreements referred to herein are not consummated, the Lessee
shall bear and pay all costs, expenses and fees referred to above; provided
that (x) if the transaction fails to be consummated as a result of failure of
the Owner Participant to act in good faith in consummating the transactions, or
to fulfill its funding obligations or otherwise to comply with the terms hereof
or thereof, the Owner Participant shall bear and pay its own fees, costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of its special
counsel), and (y) if the transaction fails to be consummated as a result of
failure of the Original Loan Participant to act in good faith in consummating

(b) The Owner Participant covenants that if (i) it ceases to
be a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning of Section 101(16) of
the Federal Aviation Act and (ii) either (A) the Aircraft shall or would
thereupon become ineligible for registration in the name of the Owner Trustee
under the Federal Aviation Act

53
AF-2
<PAGE> 58
as in effect at such time, or under the law of the current jurisdiction of
registry of the Aircraft, as the case may be, and the regulations then
applicable thereunder, or (B) the Aircraft is registered in a jurisdiction
other than the United States in circumstances in which clause (A) does not
apply and the Lessee at any time proposes to register the Aircraft within four
months in any jurisdiction to which clause (A) would apply upon such
reregistration, then the Owner Participant at its own expense shall promptly
(and, in any event, within a period of 30 days) either transfer, pursuant to
Article VIII of the Trust Agreement and Section 16(c) hereof, such of its
right, title and interest in and to the Trust Agreement, the Trust Estate, and
this Agreement, or take such other action, as may be necessary to prevent any
deregistration of the Aircraft or to make possible its registration in the
United States. Each party hereto agrees to take such steps as the Owner
Participant shall reasonably request in order to assist the Owner Participant
in complying with its obligations under this Section 9(b). The Owner
Participant hereby agrees to indemnify the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee
against any and all losses, liabilities and expenses incurred by the Lessee or
the Indenture Trustee to the extent that any such losses, liabilities or
expenses are caused by the Aircraft's so becoming ineligible or ceasing to
remain eligible for such registration.

(c) The Owner Trustee in its individual capacity covenants
that if at any time it shall cease to be a "citizen of the United States"
within the meaning of Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act, it will
resign immediately as Owner Trustee (if and so long as such citizenship is
necessary under the Federal Aviation Act, or the law of the current
jurisdiction of the registry of the Aircraft, as the case may be, as in effect
at such time or, if it is not necessary, if and so long as the Owner Trustee's
citizenship (in its individual capacity) would have any adverse effect on the
Lessee). The Owner Trustee in its individual capacity hereby unconditionally
agrees with and for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement that the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity will not directly or indirectly create,
incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lessor's Liens on or against any part of
the Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate or Aircraft arising out of any act or
omission of or claim against the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, and
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity agrees that it will at

54
AF-2
<PAGE> 59
its own cost and expense promptly take such action as may be necessary to duly
discharge and satisfy in full (i) all Lessor's Liens attributable to the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity and (ii) any other liens or encumbrances
attributable to the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity on any part of the
Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate which result from claims against the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity not related to the ownership of the
Aircraft, the administration of the Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate or the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents.

(d) Each of the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee
agrees with the Lessee that it shall not take any action, or cause any action
to be taken, which would amend, modify or supplement any provision of the Trust
Agreement in a manner adversely affecting the Lessee without the prior written
consent of the Lessee and (so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been
discharged) the Indenture Trustee, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Owner Trustee confirms for the benefit of the Lessee that it
will comply with the provisions of Article IV of the Trust Agreement. The
Owner Participant agrees not to terminate or revoke the trust created by the
Trust Agreement without the prior written consent of the Lessee and (so long as
the Trust Indenture shall not have been discharged) the Indenture Trustee,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Owner Participant
further agrees not to remove the institution acting as Owner Trustee, and not
to replace the institution acting as Owner Trustee in the event that such
institution resigns as Owner Trustee, unless the Owner Participant shall have
consulted in good faith with the Lessee prior to such removal or replacement as
to the identity, location and fee schedules of the proposed successor trustee,
provided that (i) the Owner Participant shall retain the right, notwithstanding
any such consultation, to act in its sole discretion (provided that the Owner
Participant shall not choose a replacement Owner Trustee which, in the good
faith opinion of the Lessee, may result in additional liability to the Lessee
pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof, except in the case of a mandatory or voluntary
resignation of the Owner Trustee where the Lessee has not proposed an
alternative Owner Trustee which is reasonably satisfactory to the Owner
Participant) and (ii) no such consultation shall be required if an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing. So long as no Event of Default
shall occur and be continuing, the

55
AF-2
<PAGE> 60
Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant agree that no co-trustee or separate
trustee shall be appointed pursuant to Section 9.02 of the Trust Agreement
without the Lessee's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. The Owner Participant agrees that if, at any time, so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Lessee certifies that the
Lessee has, or in the good faith opinion of the Lessee will, become obligated
to pay an amount pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof and the amount that has or
will become payable would be reduced or eliminated if the situs of the Trust
Estate were changed and if, as a consequence thereof, the Lessee should
request that the situs of the trust be moved to another state in the United
States from the state in which it is then located, the Owner Participant shall
direct such change in situs of the Trust Estate as may be specified in writing
by the Lessee and the Owner Participant will take whatever action as may be
reasonably necessary to accomplish such change; provided that the Lessee shall
provide such additional indemnification for Taxes imposed by the jurisdiction
to which the Trust Estate is to be moved as the Owner Participant may
reasonably request. The Indenture Trustee shall execute such documents and
take such action as may be necessary to effect such change in the situs of the
Trust Estate; provided that the Lien created by the Indenture with respect to
the Aircraft shall continue to be perfected.

(e) So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Owner Trustee shall promptly pay to the Lessee any amounts
received by it (i) from any Loan Participant pursuant to Section 2.04 of the
Trust Indenture or (ii) in respect of Break Funding Gain under Section 2.17 of
the Trust Indenture (other than any Break Funding Gain payable with respect to
the Certificates as a result of (A) any prepayment of the Certificates or
purchase of the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture as
a result of an Indenture Default that does not also constitute an Event of
Default or (B) an Indenture Default that does not also constitute an Event of
Default, it being agreed that any such Break Funding Gain shall be for the
account of the Owner Participant); provided that if any such amount has been so
held by the Owner Trustee as security for more than 90 days after an Event of
Default shall have occurred and during which period (x) the Owner Trustee shall
not have been limited by operation of law or otherwise from exercising remedies
under the Lease or (y) the Owner Trustee shall not have

56
AF-2
<PAGE> 61
commenced to exercise any remedy available to it under Section 15 of the Lease,
then the Owner Trustee shall promptly pay such amount to the Lessee.

(f) The Owner Participant agrees that, in the event of the
termination of the Lease pursuant to Section 9 thereof, the Owner Participant
will pay any fees and commissions of any broker or finder appointed by the
Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant, or any fees and commissions payable to
the Lessee pursuant to such Section 9, in connection with the sale of the
Aircraft. In addition, the Owner Participant agrees to pay or cause to be paid
to the Owner Trustee such amounts as may be necessary to enable the Owner
Trustee to pay any amounts to the Lessee pursuant to Section 9 or 15 of the
Lease as a rebate of any Basic Rent theretofore paid under the Lease.

(g) Each Loan Participant hereby unconditionally agrees to
perform its respective obligations under the Trust Indenture (including,
without limitation, those contained in Sections 2.04, 2.17 and 2.18 of the
Trust Indenture) as though such obligations were fully set forth herein.

(h) The Owner Trustee, in its capacity as Owner Trustee, will
not incur any indebtedness for money borrowed, or enter into any business or
other activity, except as contemplated hereby and by the other Operative
Documents.

(i) The Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity
hereby unconditionally agrees with and for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement that the Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity will not
directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Liens on or
against any part of the Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate or Aircraft arising
out of any act or omission of or claim against the Indenture Trustee in its
individual capacity, and the Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity
agrees that it will at its own cost and expense promptly take such action as
may be necessary duly to discharge and satisfy in full (i) all such Liens
attributable to the Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity and (ii) any
other liens or encumbrances attributable to the Indenture Trustee in its
individual capacity on any part of the Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate
which result from claims against the Indenture

57
AF-2
<PAGE> 62
Trustee in its individual capacity not related to the administration of the
Indenture Estate.

(j) The Owner Trustee agrees that any profit, income,
interest, dividend or gain realized upon the maturity, sale or other
disposition of any Permitted Investment made by the Indenture Trustee pursuant
to Section 3.07(b) of the Trust Indenture, and paid to the Lessee on behalf of
the Owner Trustee by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with the terms of such
Section 3.07(b), shall be entirely for the account of, and the sole property
of, the Lessee who, for such purposes, shall not be deemed to be acting as
agent of the Owner Trustee, and the Lessee shall have no obligation to pay over
such income, interest, dividend or gain to the Owner Trustee.

(k) Each of the Indenture Trustee and each Loan Participant,
by its acceptance of a Certificate, hereby irrevocably agree, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, that, in any case in which any Person (other than the
Lessee alone) is the debtor or one of the debtors under the Bankruptcy Code,
each of the Indenture Trustee and each Loan Participant shall be deemed to have
made a timely election pursuant to Section 1111(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Bankruptcy
Code (or any substantively comparable provision which is the successor thereto)
as to the Indenture Estate (which is acknowledged and agreed not to include
Excepted Property).

(l) Each Loan Participant hereby unconditionally agrees with
and for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement that it will not directly
or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Loan Participant
Liens attributable to it on or against any part of the Trust Estate, the
Indenture Estate or the Aircraft, and each Loan Participant agrees that it
will, at its own cost and expense, promptly take such action as may be
necessary duly to discharge and satisfy in full any such Lien attributable to
it; and each Loan Participant hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the Lessee,
the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Participant, and any subsequent holders of
Certificates or any subsequent Owner Participant from and against any loss,
cost, expense or damages (excluding consequential damages) which may be
suffered by any of them as a result of its failure to discharge and satisfy any
such Lien attributable to it.

58
AF-2
<PAGE> 63
(m) Each of the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee
hereby agrees, for the benefit of the Lessee, to cooperate with the Lessee in
effecting any foreign registration of the Aircraft pursuant to Section 7(a)(i)
of the Lease; provided that prior to any such change in the country of registry
of the Aircraft (other than a change in the country of registry that results in
the registration of the Aircraft under the laws of the United States of
America), the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee shall have received from
counsel to the Lessee reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant an
opinion to the effect that (i) the terms of any relevant sublease and the Lease
are legal, valid, binding and enforceable in such country to substantially the
same extent as such documents are at that time enforceable in the United
States, (ii) there is no statutory, regulatory or case law in such country
imposing tort liability on the owner of an aircraft not in possession thereof
under the laws of such country other than tort liability no more extensive or
onerous than that which might have been imposed on such owner under the laws of
the United States or any state thereof (it being understood that, in the event
such opinion cannot be given in a form satisfactory to the Owner Participant,
such opinion shall be waived if insurance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner
Participant is provided by the Lessee to cover the risk of such liability),
(iii) such re-registration will not result in the imposition by such country of
any Taxes on the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant for which the Lessee is
not required to indemnify the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee, as the
case may be (provided that in lieu of the opinion referred to in this clause
(iii) the Lessee may indemnify the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee, as
the case may be, for any Taxes imposed by such country in connection with or
relating to the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents which
would not have been imposed but for such re-registration); (iv) there exist no
possessory rights in favor of the Lessee or any sublessee under the laws of
such country which would, upon bankruptcy of or other default by the Lessee or
any sublessee, prevent the return of the Aircraft to the Owner Trustee in
accordance with and when permitted by the terms of Sections 14 and 15(a) of the
Lease upon the exercise by the Owner Trustee of its remedies under Section
15(a) of the Lease; (v) it is not necessary for the Owner Participant or the
Owner Trustee to qualify to do business in such jurisdiction solely as a result
of the proposed re-registration; (vi) the laws of such country require fair

59
AF-2
<PAGE> 64
compensation by the government of such country for the loss of use of the
Aircraft in the event of the requisition by such government of the Aircraft
(unless the Lessee shall have provided contemporaneously with such
re-registration insurance reasonably satisfactory to the Lessor and the Owner
Participant covering the risk of requisition of use of the Aircraft by the
government of such country so long as the Aircraft is registered under the laws
of such country); and (vii) the Lessee shall have paid or made provision for
the payment of all expenses of the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee in
connection with such change in registration; and provided, further, that (x)
the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant shall have received prior to or
contemporaneously with such re-registration (1) a certificate of insurance
signed by an independent insurance broker to the effect that the Aircraft is

SECTION 16. Certain Covenants of the Owner Participant. (a)
The Owner Participant hereby agrees to notify the Lessee or cause the Lessee to
be notified by telephone, telecopier or telegram not later than 1:00 p.m. New
York City time, on the third Business Day prior to the Base Lease Commencement
Date stating whether or not the Owner Participant intends to pay an amount
equal to $1,947,948.23 (the "Excess Payment Amount", subject to adjustment
pursuant to the following paragraph) in full by 1:00 p.m., New York City time,
on the Base Lease Commencement Date. The Owner Participant shall also have the
right to reimburse the Lessee at any time for all or any portion of the
Reimbursement Amount for which the Lessee has not received an offset pursuant
to Section 3(f) of the Lease.

Although the amount of the Excess Payment Amount has been
computed on the assumption that each Certificate will bear interest at the
Assumed Debt Rate for such Certificate throughout the Interim Period, the Owner
Participant and the Lessee recognize that the actual rate

78
AF-2
<PAGE> 83
of interest on each Certificate may be a rate from time to time which may be
greater or less than the Assumed Debt Rate for such Certificate and that the
related basis upon which interest on the Certificates will be computed will be
as provided in the Trust Indenture. Accordingly, the Excess Payment Amount
shall be increased or decreased (but not below zero), as the case may be, by an
amount (the "Excess Payment Differential Amount") equal to, as of the Base
Lease Commencement Date, the difference between (i) the aggregate amount of
interest actually due and payable on the Base Lease Commencement Date on the
Certificates for the period from and including the Delivery Date to but
excluding the Base Lease Commencement Date, determined as provided in the Trust
Indenture, and (ii) the aggregate amount of interest on the Loan Certificates
that would have been due and payable on the Base Lease Commencement Date if the
outstanding principal amount of such Loan Certificates had borne interest at
the Assumed Debt Rate for the period from and including the Delivery Date to
but excluding the Base Lease Commencement Date. If, as of the Base Lease
Commencement Date, the amount determined in accordance with clause (i) of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be greater than the amount determined in
accordance with clause (ii) of such sentence, the Excess Payment Amount shall
be increased by the Excess Payment Differential Amount. If, as of the Base
Lease Commencement Date, the amount determined in accordance with such clause
(ii) shall be greater than the amount determined in accordance with such clause
(i), the Excess Payment Amount shall be decreased by the Excess Payment
Differential Amount. The interest actually accruing with respect to the
Certificates shall be as specified by the notification to be delivered by the
Original Loan Participant (whether or not it at the time holds any Loan
Certificates) to each of the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, each other
Loan Participant, the Indenture Trustee and the Lessee as provided in Section
1(c).

(b) The Owner Participant hereby unconditionally agrees with
and for the benefit of the other parties to this Agreement that the Owner
Participant will not directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to
exist any Lessor's Liens on or against any part of the Trust Estate or the
Aircraft arising out of any act or omission of or claim against the Owner
Participant, and the Owner Participant agrees that it will, at its own cost and
expense, take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge and satisfy in
full any such Lessor's Lien (by

79
AF-2
<PAGE> 84
bonding or otherwise, so long as Lessee's operation and use of the Aircraft is
not impaired and the lien of the Indenture is not impaired). The Owner
Participant hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the Lessee, the Indenture
Trustee and each Loan Participant against any loss, cost or expense (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) which may be suffered or incurred by any of
them as the result of the failure of the Owner Participant to discharge and
satisfy any such Lessor's Lien. In addition, the Owner Participant agrees to
indemnify, protect, save and keep harmless each Loan Participant from and
against any reduction in the amount payable out of the Indenture Estate to such
Loan Participant in respect of the Certificates held by such Loan Participant
or any other loss, cost or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred by such Loan Participant, as a result of the imposition or
enforcement of, or the Owner Participant's failure to satisfy, any Lessor's
Lien or claim against the Indenture Estate by any taxing authority because of
the nonpayment by the Owner Participant of any Taxes imposed on or measured by
the net income or revenues of the Owner Participant that are not required to be
indemnified against by the Lessee.

(c) The Owner Participant shall not directly or indirectly
assign, convey or otherwise transfer any of its right, title or interest in and
to all or any part of this Agreement, the Tax Indemnity Agreement, the Trust
Agreement, the Trust Estate, the Indenture Estate, the Purchase Agreement
Assignment, the Purchase Agreement or any of the other Operative Documents
except that the Owner Participant may assign, convey or otherwise transfer all
(but not less than all) thereof if:

(i) (A) the Person to whom such transfer is made (the
"Transferee") is a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning
of Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act (without the
utilization of a voting trust agreement, voting powers agreement or
similar arrangement by the Transferee or any Affiliate thereof unless
the Owner Participant obtains the consent of the Lessee, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), and has the requisite power,
authority and legal right to enter into and carry out the transactions
contemplated hereby; B) such conveyance does not violate any
provisions of the Federal Aviation Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (and no registration pursuant to such Act or

80
AF-2
<PAGE> 85
the rules and regulations thereunder shall be required in connection
with such conveyance), or any other applicable law, or create a
relationship which would be in violation thereof, or result in a
"prohibited transaction" under ERISA or the Code; (C) the Transferee
enters into an agreement or agreements, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee, the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee (the "Assumption Agreement") for the benefit of the
Lessee, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, whereby the
Transferee confirms that it shall be deemed a party to this
Participation Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Tax Indemnity
Agreement and each other Operative Document to which the Owner
Participant is a party, and the party named as the "Owner Participant"
in the Trust Agreement, the Lease and the Trust Indenture and agrees
to be bound by all of the terms of, and to undertake all of the
obligations of the Owner Participant contained in, this Agreement, the
Trust Agreement, the Tax Indemnity Agreement and each other Operative
Document to which the Owner Participant is a party or by which the
Owner Participant is bound, and in which the Transferee shall make
representations and warranties comparable to those of the Owner
Participant contained herein and, in the event such Transferee is a
partnership, such additional documents and/or amendments to the
Operative Documents (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Lessee, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee) as the
Lessee, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may reasonably
request; D) after giving effect to such assignment, conveyance or
transfer, there would be no more than one Owner Participant with
respect to the Aircraft; E) the Owner Participant shall deliver to the
Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee (unless the lien of the Trust
Indenture is discharged) and the Lessee an opinion of counsel (which
shall be the general counsel of the Transferee or other counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee), that
the Assumption Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Transferee and is enforceable against such Transferee
in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally or by general
principles of equity; (F) the Owner Participant shall

81
AF-2
<PAGE> 86
deliver to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee (unless the lien
of the Trust Indenture is discharged) and the Lessee one or more
certificates of a duly authorized officer of the transferor and if
necessary transferee Owner Participant concerning, when taken
together, all of the matters contained in clauses (A) and (D) of this
paragraph (i) and (except in connection with any such assignment,
transfer or conveyance to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of American Telephone and Telegraph Company) an opinion delivered by
counsel of the type referred to in clause (E) to the effect that such
transfer complies with the provisions of clauses (A) (except as to
citizenship), (B) and (D) of this paragraph (i); and (G) the
transferor and/or transferee Owner Participant assumes by an
instrument in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee
and the Indenture Trustee the risk of any adverse tax consequences to
any Tax Indemnitee resulting from such conveyance; and

(ii) either A) the Transferee is a bank or lending institution
with a combined capital and surplus of at least $75,000,000, or is a
corporation or domestic partnership with net worth of at least
$75,000,000, exclusive of goodwill, all of the foregoing determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (hereinafter
referred to as a "Qualifying Institution"), or B) if the Transferee is
not itself a Qualifying Institution, a parent corporation of the
Transferee which qualifies as a Qualifying Institution shall have
executed and delivered to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee
(unless the lien of the Trust Indenture is discharged) and the Lessee
an absolute and unconditional guaranty, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee, with respect to
the obligations of the Transferee as the Owner Participant assumed by
the Transferee under the Assumption Agreement referred to above, and
the Transferee shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee (unless the lien
of the Trust Indenture is discharged), the Owner Trustee and the
Lessee an opinion of counsel (which shall be the general counsel of
the Qualifying Institution providing such guaranty or other counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee and the Indenture Trustee) that
such guaranty is enforceable against the guarantor in accordance with
its terms.

82
AF-2
<PAGE> 87
In the event that the Owner Participant is at any time the
subsidiary of another Person, any transfer by direct sale, consolidation,
merger or otherwise of 50% or more of the capital stock of the Owner
Participant (including, for this purpose, any such transfer of the capital
stock of any one of its direct or indirect parent companies or other parent
entities, other than its ultimate parent entity) (any such transfer being
referred to as a "Change in Control") shall be deemed to be a conveyance by
such Owner Participant of its interests in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement subject to this Section 16(c), and accordingly no such Change in
Control shall take place without the Lessee's consent unless it satisfies the
terms and conditions set forth in this Section 16(c), including without
limitation those set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, if (x) the obligations of such Owner Participant were
guaranteed at the time such Owner Participant became the Owner Participant
hereunder by a parent entity that was at such time a Qualifying Institution
(the "Parent Guarantor"), and (y) following a Change in Control, the Transferee
remains both a member of the controlled or consolidated group of companies of
which the Parent Guarantor is a part and a subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor,
such Transferee shall comply with the conditions set forth in paragraph (i)
above, but shall not be required to satisfy the conditions set forth in
paragraph (ii) above; provided that such guaranty of the Parent Guarantor is
amended to remain in full force and effect in respect of the Transferee and the
Transferee delivers to the Indenture Trustee (unless the lien of the Trust
Indenture is discharged), the Owner Trustee and the Lessee an opinion of
counsel (which shall be the general counsel of the Parent Guarantor or other
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee) in form and substance
satisfactory to the Lessee and the Owner Trustee as to the continued legality,
validity and enforceability of such guaranty.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Lease is in
effect, there shall not be more than five transfers (not including any transfer
within two years after the Delivery Date to any Affiliate of American Telephone
and Telegraph Company) by the Owner Participant (including its successors and
permitted assigns) pursuant to this Section 16(c) without the prior written
consent of the Lessee, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

83
AF-2
<PAGE> 88
Any fees, charges and expenses incurred by the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee or the Lessee in connection with any transfer pursuant to this Section
16(c), including, without limitation the out-of-pocket expenses of the Lessee
and reasonable legal fees and expenses, will be paid by the transferring Owner
Participant and in no case will the Lessee be responsible for any such fees,
charges or expenses. Without the consent of the Lessee, no transfer shall be
permitted pursuant to this Section 16(c) to a Transferee that is (i) an airline
or other commercial operator of aircraft that is a competitor of the Lessee or
any of its Affiliates or (ii) a corporation or other entity that is an
Affiliate of any such airline or other commercial operator of aircraft.

Upon any such conveyance by the Owner Participant to a
Transferee permitted by this Section 16(c), the Transferee shall be deemed the
"Owner Participant" for all purposes hereof (unless the context is
inappropriate) and shall be deemed to have made all the investments in
beneficial ownership of the Aircraft previously made by the Owner Participant
in respect of the right, title and interest so conveyed; and each reference in
this Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Lease, the Tax Indemnity Agreement,
the Trust Indenture and the other Operative Documents to the Owner Participant
making the transfer shall thereafter be deemed a reference to the Transferee as
the Owner Participant (unless the context is inappropriate). Upon any such
conveyance by the Owner Participant to a Transferee permitted by the foregoing
provisions of this Section 16(c), the transferor Owner Participant shall be
relieved of all of its liabilities and obligations hereunder and under the
Trust Agreement to the extent of the interest so transferred, provided that in
no event will any such conveyance release the transferor Owner Participant from
any liability to the extent caused by any breach existing at the time of such
conveyance by the Owner Participant of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations contained herein or in the Trust Agreement. If the
Owner Participant proposes to transfer its interests pursuant to this Section
16(c), it shall give 20 days' (or, in the case of a transfer where the
Transferee is an Affiliate of the Owner Participant making the transfer, 10
days') prior written notice thereof to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee
and the Lessee, specifying the name and address of the transferee and
specifying the facts necessary to determine

84
AF-2
<PAGE> 89
whether the conditions of this paragraph (c) have been or shall be satisfied.

SECTION 17. Optional Redemption of Certificates. (d) So
long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lessee
shall have the right to request the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee to
effect an optional redemption of all of the Certificates (the "Outstanding
Certificates") (such term to include the Certificates originally issued under
the Trust Indenture and any refunding indebtedness issued pursuant to this
Section 17 or Section 20) pursuant to the Trust Indenture as part of a
refunding or refinancing operation. Promptly on receipt of such request, the
Owner Participant will negotiate promptly in good faith to conclude an
agreement with the Lessee as to the terms of such refunding or refinancing
operation and upon such agreement:

(i) the Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee, and any other appropriate parties will enter into a
financing or loan agreement (which may involve an underwriting
agreement in connection with a public offering; provided, however,
that in the case of a refunding or refinancing involving a public
offering of debt securities, the Lessee shall have the right to
purchase such debt securities and apply such debt securities as a
credit against its obligations to pay Rent) providing for (x) the
issuance and sale by the Owner Trustee or such other party as may be
appropriate to such institution or institutions on the date specified
in such agreement (for the purposes of this Section 17, the "Refunding
Date") of United States Dollar-denominated debt securities in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the sum of the principal amount of
the Outstanding Certificates on the Refunding Date and, subject to
clause (w) of Section 17(a)(ii), all interest accrued thereon to the
Refunding Date and (y) the application of the proceeds of the sale of
such debt securities to the redemption of all such Certificates on the
Refunding Date;

(ii) the Lessee and the Owner Trustee will amend the Lease such
that (w) if the Refunding Date is not a Lease Period Date, the Lessee
shall on the Refunding Date prepay that portion of the next succeeding
installment of Basic Rent as shall equal the aggre-

85
AF-2
<PAGE> 90
gate interest accrued on the Outstanding Certificates to the Refunding
Date in the event that such interest is not financed through the
issuance of debt securities on the Refunding Date (provided that if
the Refunding Date occurs on or prior to the Base Lease Commencement
Date, the Owner Participant may, pursuant to Section 16(a) on the
Refunding Date prepay the Excess Payment Amount), (x) Basic Rent
payable in respect of the period from and after the Refunding Date
shall be recalculated to preserve the Owner Participant's Net Economic
Return (or, in the case of any recalculation hereunder subsequent to
any Section 20 Refinancing, the Owner Participant's Revised Net
Economic Return), y) amounts payable in respect of Stipulated Loss
Value and Termination Value from and after the Refunding Date shall be
appropriately recalculated to preserve the Owner Participant's Net
Economic Return (or, in the case of any recalculation hereunder
subsequent to the Section 20 Refinancing, the Owner Participant's
Revised Net Economic Return) and (z) the Special Purchase Price and
the Special Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated as provided in
Section 18;

(iii) the Owner Trustee will enter into an agreement to provide
for the securing thereunder of the debt securities issued by the Owner
Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 17 in like manner as
the Certificates issuable under the Trust Indenture and/or will enter
into such amendments and supplements to the Trust Indenture as may be
necessary to effect such refunding or refinancing,provided that no
such amendment or supplement will materially increase the liabilities
of or impair the rights of the Owner Participant under the Operative
Documents without the consent of the Owner Participant; and

(iv) unless otherwise agreed by the Owner Par-ticipant, the Lessee
shall pay as Supplemental Rent on an After-Tax Basis all reasonable
fees, costs, and expenses of such refunding or refinancing;

provided, however, that (w) there shall be no more than two such refundings or
refinancings (not including the Section 20 Refinancing, (x) if within 15 days
after receipt of a request from the Lessee to effect a refunding or refinancing
pursuant to this Section 17, which request specifies the proposed structural
terms and the amount

86
AF-2
<PAGE> 91
thereof, the Owner Participant provides the Lessee with a written notice to the
effect that there will be a risk of adverse tax consequences to the Owner
Participant resulting from the refunding or refinancing and, if then requested
by the Lessee in writing, within 15 days after receipt of such request, the
Owner Participant provides the Lessee with a written opinion of independent tax
counsel selected by the Owner Participant and reasonably acceptable to the
Lessee to the effect that there will be a risk of such adverse tax consequences
to the Owner Participant resulting from the refunding or refinancing (other
than the consequence that the refinanced loan constitutes "qualified
nonrecourse indebtedness" within the meaning of Temporary Regulations Section
1.861-10T(b) for the purpose of the computation of the FSC Benefits (as defined
in the Tax Indemnity Agreement)), then the Owner Trustee and the Owner
Participant shall be required to effect such refunding or refinancing only if
the Lessee shall have agreed to indemnify the Owner Participant against such
identified adverse tax consequences in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Owner Participant; provided, however, the parties agree that in the absence of
a change in applicable laws, regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures
or judicial precedents enacted, adopted or decided after the Delivery Date, a
refinancing or refunding will not be deemed for this purpose to result in a
risk of the Owner Participant not being considered the owner of the Aircraft,
Airframe, any Engine or any Part for Federal or other income tax purposes, (y)
no such refinancing or refunding shall require an increase in the amount of the
Owner Participant's investment in the beneficial ownership of the Aircraft or
shall cause the ratio of the newly issued debt to the Owner Participant's then
outstanding investment in the Aircraft to be more than 4 to 1 and (z) except
with respect to matters relating to taxes, no such refunding or refinancing
will materially increase the liabilities of or impair the rights of the Owner
Participant.

(b) The Certificates, and any other debt instruments issued
in connection with any refunding or refinancing operation permitted by this
Section 17, shall not be subject to optional redemption by the Owner Trustee
without the consent of the Lessee (except as provided in Section 2.13 of the
Trust Indenture).

SECTION 18. Calculation of Adjustments to Basic Rent,
Stipulated Loss Value, Termination Value, etc.; Confirmation and Verification.
(e) Calculation of Adjustments. In the event that (A) the expenses paid by
the Owner Participant pursuant to Section 9(a) hereof (except for any expenses
paid or payable to any financial advisor to the Owner Participant) and such
other expenses as the Lessee shall expressly agree in writing shall be deemed
to be "Transaction Costs" (collectively, the "Transaction Costs") are less or
more than 1.0% of Lessor's Cost, or (B) prior to the acceptance of the Aircraft
on the Delivery Date: (1) there shall have occurred a Change in Tax Law and
(2) after having been advised in writing by the Owner Participant of such
Change in Tax Law and the proposed adjustment to the payments of Basic Rent
resulting therefrom, Lessee shall have waived its right under Section 11 of the
Participation Agreement to decline to proceed with the transaction, or (C) a
refinancing or refunding as contemplated by Section 17 hereof occurs (it being
understood that if the Refunding Date occurs on or prior to the Base Lease
Commencement Date, any recalculations pursuant to this clause (C) shall take
into account any prepayment by the Owner Participant on such Refunding Date of
the Excess Payment Amount pursuant to Section 16(a) hereof under clause (w) of
Section 17(a)(ii) hereof or under clause (w) of Section 20(a)(ii) hereof), or
(D) the Delivery Date is other than July 10, 1991, or (E) if the Certificates
are not refunded or refinanced on or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date,
the Excess Payment Amount (after adjustment for any Excess Payment Differential
Amount) is other than $1,947,948.23, then, in each case, the Owner Participant
shall recalculate the payments of Basic Rent and Stipulated Loss Values,
Termination Values and the Excess Payment Amount with respect to the Term (i)
to preserve the Owner Participant's Net Economic Return (or, in the case of any
recalculation hereunder subsequent to the Section 20 Refinancing, the Owner
Participant's Revised Net Economic Return) and (ii) to minimize to the greatest
extent possible, consistent with the foregoing clause (i), the present value
(discounted semiannually at an interest rate per annum to be supplied by the
Lessee) of the payments of Basic Rent. In addition, in the event of a
refinancing or refunding referred to in clause (C) of the preceding sentence,
the Special Purchase Price Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date
shall be recalculated in a manner consistent with the procedures specified in
the second sentence of Section 20(c). In performing any such recalculations,
the

88
AF-2
<PAGE> 93
Owner Participant shall utilize the same methods and assumptions originally
used to calculate the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values,
Termination Values and Special Purchase Price Percentage with respect to the
Term (or, in the case of any recalculation hereunder subsequent to the Section
20 Refinancing, the same methods and assumptions originally used by the
original Owner Participant in the calculation of the alternate schedules
referred to in the definition of the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic
Return and the Special Purchase Price Percentage and held in escrow by Sidley &
Austin pursuant to Section 18(d)) (in each case as such assumptions may be
changed as a result of the event described in clause (A), (B), (C) or (D) of
the second preceding sentence necessitating such recalculation or due to the
prior occurrence of any such event or the prior occurrence of the Section 20
Refinancing); provided that, Basic Rent, as so recomputed, shall comply with
the requirements of Sections 4.02(5) and 4.07(1) of Revenue Procedure 75-28,
1975-1 C.B. 752, and shall not present a greater risk that Section 467(b)(2) of
the Code would apply than the risk that Section 467(b)(2) applied prior to such
recomputation, it being agreed that the requirements of clause (i) of Section
5.01 of Rev. Proc. 75-21, 1975-1 C.B. 715, shall be applied on a prospective
basis.

(b) Confirmation and Verification. Upon completion of any
recalculation described above in Section 18(a), a duly authorized officer of
the Owner Participant shall provide a certificate to the Lessee either (x)
stating that the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values and Termination
Values with respect to the Term and, in the case of the second sentence of
Section 18(a), the Special Purchase Price Percentage as are then applicable do
not require change, or (y) setting forth such adjustments to the payments of
Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values or Termination Values with respect to the
Term and, in the case of the second sentence of Section 18(a), the Special
Purchase Price Percentage as have been calculated by the Owner Participant in
accordance with Section 18(a) above and Section 3(e) of the Lease. Such
certificate shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for any such
adjustments. If the Lessee shall so request, the recalculation of any such
adjustments described in this Section 18 shall be verified by a nationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants jointly selected by the
Lessee and the Owner Participant (provided that such firm of independent public

89
AF-2
<PAGE> 94
accountants shall not be regularly retained by either the Lessee or the Owner
Participant). A representative of such firm shall be shown, on a confidential
basis, the original assumptions used by the Owner Participant and held in
escrow by Sidley & Austin pursuant to Section 18(d) and the methods used by the
Owner Participant in the original calculation of, and any recalculation of,
Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values and Termination Values and, in the case of
the second sentence of Section 18(a), the Special Purchase Price Percentage
(or, in the case of any recalculation hereunder subsequent to the Section 20
Refinancing, the same methods and assumptions originally used by the original
Owner Participant in the calculation of the alternate schedules referred to in
the definition of the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return and the
Special Purchase Price Percentage held in escrow by Sidley & Austin pursuant to
Section 18(d)). The reasonable costs of such verification shall be borne by
the Lessee, unless as a result of such verification process the payments of
Basic Rent are adjusted and such adjustment causes (i) the present value of the
payments of Basic Rent, discounted semi-annually at the Assumed Debt Rate, to
decline by five basis points or more from the present value of the payments of
Basic Rent, discounted semi-annually at the Assumed Debt Rate, certified by the
Owner Participant pursuant to this Section 18(b) or (ii) any Stipulated Loss
Value or Termination Value percentage or, in the case of the second sentence of
Section 18(a), the Special Purchase Price Percentage, to be significantly below
that certified by the Owner Participant pursuant to this Section 18(b), in
which case the Owner Participant shall be responsible for the reasonable costs
of such verification. In connection with any ad-justment pursuant to this
Section 18 or Section 20, the Owner Participant, the Lessee, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee shall enter into an appropriately revised Rent
Schedule.

(c) Payment of Debt Service. No adjustment may be made to
the payments of Basic Rent or to Stipulated Loss Values or Termination Values
with respect to the Term, unless (i) each installment of Basic Rent (or, in the
case of the Base Lease Commencement Date, the Excess Payment Amount), as so
adjusted, under any circumstances and in any event, will be in an amount at
least sufficient for the Owner Trustee to pay in full as of the due date of
such installment any payment of principal or interest on the Certificates
required to be paid on the due date of

90
AF-2
<PAGE> 95
such installment of Basic Rent (or on the Base Lease Commencement Date, as the
case may be) and (ii) Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value, as so
adjusted, under any circumstances and in any event, will be an amount which,
together with any other amounts required to be paid by the Lessee under the
Lease in connection with an Event of Loss or a termination of the Lease, as the
case may be, will be at least sufficient to pay in full, as of the date of
payment thereof, the aggregate unpaid principal of and all unpaid interest on
the Certificates accrued to the date on which Stipulated Loss Value or
Termination Value, as the case may be, is paid in accordance with the terms of
the Lease.

(d) Escrow. The Owner Participant agrees to place in escrow
with Sidley & Austin, and to cause Sidley & Austin to retain, (i) the
assumptions and methods utilized by the Owner Participant in the calculation of
the schedules of Basic Rent, Termination Value and Stipulated Loss Value
referred to the definition of the Owner Participant's Net Economic Return, and
in the calculation of the Special Purchase Price Percentage as of the Delivery
Date, (ii) the assumptions and methods utilized by the Owner Participant in the
calculation of the alternate schedules of Basic Rent, Termination Value and
Stipulated Loss Value referred to in the definition of the Owner Participant's
Revised Net Economic Return, together with such alternate schedules, and the
Special Purchase Price Percentage applicable to a lease financing accomplished
pursuant to such alternate schedules (calculated to preserve the Special
Purchase Price Yield to the applicable Special Purchase Option Date in
accordance with the methodology described in the second sentence to Section
20(c)), copies of which alternate schedules and such Special Purchase Price
Percentage have been provided to the Lessee, and (iii) any adjustments made to
any of the assumptions referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence to
take into account the effect of any change of the type specified in Section
3(e) of the Lease which theretofore has resulted in an adjustment of the
percentages of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value, Termination Value or Special
Purchase Price Percentage. In connection with the foregoing, the Owner
Participant will provide Sidley & Austin with such supporting documents and
materials, and access to such computer programs and/or software, as would be
complete and sufficient, without more, to enable the verification, as
contemplated by Section 18(b),

91
AF-2
<PAGE> 96
of any calculations made by the Owner Participant under this Section 18 or
Section 20.

SECTION 19. Concerning the Owner Trustee. Wilmington Trust
Company is entering into this Agreement solely in its capacity as Owner Trustee
under the Trust Agreement and not in its individual capacity (except as
expressly stated herein) and in no case shall Wilmington Trust Company (or any
entity acting as successor Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement) be
personally liable for or on account of any of the statements, representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations stated to be those of the Owner Trustee
hereunder, provided, however, that Wilmington Trust Company (or any such
successor Owner Trustee) shall be personally liable hereunder for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct or for its breach of its covenants,
representations and warranties contained herein, to the extent covenanted or
made in its individual capacity.

SECTION 20. Section 20 Refinancing. (a) In addition to the
provisions set forth in Section 17, whether or not a refunding or refinancing
pursuant to such Section 17 shall have previously occurred, and with regard to
the role of Credit (as defined in the Tax Indemnity Agreement) in the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements, at any time the Lessee
shall have the right to request the Owner Participant and the Owner Trustee to
effect an optional redemption of all of the Outstanding Certificates as part of
a refunding or refinancing operation with refinancing indebtedness with respect
to which the refinancing indebtedness has a final maturity date of at least six
months after the final maturity date of the Outstanding Certificates and has a
weighted average life to maturity at least 90 days longer than the remaining
weighted average life to maturity of the outstanding Certificates (such
refinancing hereinafter referred to as the "Section 20 Refinancing"). Promptly
on receipt of such request (which request shall specifically designate such
refinancing as the Section 20 Refinancing), the Owner Participant will, in good
faith, use all reasonable efforts to conclude an agreement with the Lessee as
to the terms of such Section 20 Refinancing and upon such agreement:

(i) the Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee, and any other appropriate parties will enter into a
financing or

92
AF-2
<PAGE> 97
loan agreement (which may involve an underwriting agreement in
connection with a public offering;provided, however, that in the case
of a refunding or refinancing involving a public offering of debt
securities, the Lessee shall have the right to purchase such debt
securities and apply such debt securities as a credit against its
obligations to pay Rent) providing for (x) the issuance and sale by
the Owner Trustee or such other party as may be appropriate to such
institution or institutions on the date specified in such agreement
(for the purposes of this Section 20, the "Section 20 Refunding Date")
of United States Dollar-denominated debt securities in an aggregate
principal amount at least equal to the principal amount of the
Outstanding Certificates on the Section 20 Refunding Date and, subject
to clause (w) of Section 20(a)(ii), all interest accrued thereon to
the Section 20 Refunding Date and y) the application of the proceeds
of the sale of such debt securities to the redemption of all such
Certificates on the Section 20 Refunding Date;

(ii) the Lessee and the Owner Trustee will amend the Lease such
that (w) if the Section 20 Refunding Date is not a Lease Period Date,
the Lessee shall on the Section 20 Refunding Date prepay that portion
of the next succeeding installment of Basic Rent as shall equal the
aggregate interest accrued on the Outstanding Certificates to the
Section 20 Refunding Date in the event that such interest is not
financed through the issuance of debt securities on the Section 20
Refunding Date, provided that if the Section 20 Refunding Date occurs
on or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date, the Owner Participant
may, pursuant to Section 16(a), prepay the Excess Payment Amount or
such portion thereof on the Section 20 Refunding Date as the Lessee
and the Owner Participant shall agree is advisable in order to
optimize the revised rental schedules to be calculated pursuant to
Section 20(c), (x) Basic Rent payable in respect of the period from
and after the Section 20 Refunding Date shall be recalculated pursuant
to Section 20(c) to preserve the Owner Participant's Revised Net
Economic Return, y) amounts payable in respect of Stipulated Loss
Value and Termination Value from and after the Section 20 Refunding
Date shall be appropriately recalculated pursuant to Section 20(c) to
preserve the Owner Participant's

93
AF-2
<PAGE> 98
Revised Net Economic Return and z) the Special Purchase Price
Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated
pursuant to Section 20(c);

(iii) the Owner Trustee will enter into an agreement to provide
for the securing thereunder of the debt securities issued by the Owner
Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 20 in like manner as
the Certificates issuable under the Trust Indenture and/or will enter
into such amendments and supplements to the Trust Indenture as may be
necessary to effect such refunding or refinancing; and

(iv) unless otherwise agreed by the Owner Participant, the Lessee
shall pay as Supplemental Rent on an After-Tax Basis all reasonable
fees, costs, and expenses of such refunding or refinancing;

provided, however, that if within 15 days after receipt of a request from the
Lessee to effect the Section 20 Refinancing, which request specifies the
proposed structural terms of such refinancing and the amount of refinancing
indebtedness, the Owner Participant provides the Lessee with a written notice
to the effect that there will be a risk of adverse tax consequences to the
Owner Participant resulting from the Section 20 Refinancing and, if then
requested by the Lessee in writing, within 15 days after receipt of such
request, the Owner Participant provides the Lessee with a written opinion of
independent tax counsel selected by the Owner Participant and reasonably
acceptable to the Lessee to the effect that there will be a risk of such
adverse tax consequences to the Owner Participant resulting from the Section 20
Refinancing (other than the consequence that the refinanced loan constitutes
"qualified nonrecourse indebtedness" within the meaning of Temporary
Regulations Section 1.861-10T(b) for the purpose of the computation of the FSC
Benefits (as defined in the Tax Indemnity Agreement)), then the Owner Trustee
and the Owner Participant shall be required to effect the Section 20
Refinancing only if the Lessee shall have agreed to indemnify the Owner
Participant against such identified adverse tax consequences in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant; provided, however, the
parties agree that in the absence of a change in applicable laws, regulations,
revenue rulings, revenue procedures or judicial precedents enacted, adopted or
decided after the Delivery Date, the Section 20 Re-

94
AF-2
<PAGE> 99
financing will not be deemed for this purpose to result in a risk of the Owner
Participant not being considered the owner of the Aircraft, Airframe, any
Engine or any Part for Federal or other income tax purposes.

Each of the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, each Loan
Participant and the Indenture Trustee agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
facilitate the Section 20 Refinancing, including, without limitation, by making
such modifications to, or entering into such amendments and supplements to, the
Operative Documents as may be appropriate or necessary to effect the Section 20
Refinancing.

(b) The Section 20 Refinancing shall not constitute a
refunding or refinancing for the purposes of Section 17. Any debt instruments
issued in connection with the Section 20 Refinancing shall not be subject to
optional redemption by the Owner Trustee without the consent of the Lessee
(except as provided in Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture).

(c) In connection with the Section 20 Refinancing, the Owner
Participant shall recalculate the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss
Values and Termination Values with respect to the Term and, if the Section 20
Refunding Date occurs on or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date, the
Excess Payment Amount payable pursuant to Section 16(a) hereof (such
recalculation of the Excess Payment Amount to take into account any prepayment
by the Owner Participant on such Section 20 Refunding Date of all or part of
the Excess Payment Amount under clause (w) of Section 20(a)(ii)), (i) to
achieve the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return, and (ii) to
minimize, to the greatest extent possible consistent with the foregoing clause
(i), the present value (discounted semiannually at an interest rate per annum
to be supplied by the Lessee) of the payments of Basic Rent. In addition, in
such event, the Special Purchase Price Percentage shall be recalculated in
order to preserve the Special Purchase Price Yield to the Special Purchase
Option Date of January 10, 2013; provided that the Special Purchase Price
Percentage for the Special Purchase Option Date, as so adjusted, shall not be
less than 51.8%. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner Participant, the
Owner Trustee and the Lessee agree that, at the Lessee's option, the Lessee may
request that the Special Purchase Option Date be changed (and that the Special
Purchase Price Percentage be recalculated as of such changed date) to whichever
of

95
AF-2
<PAGE> 100
the four Lease Period Dates preceding the Special Purchase Option Date or the
two Lease Period Dates following the Special Purchase Option Date (each, an
"Alternate Special Purchase Option Date") would result in the lowest possible
sum of (1) the present value (discounted semiannually at an interest rate per
annum to be supplied by the Lessee) of the payments of Basic Rent for the
period from the Section 20 Refunding Date to and including the applicable
Alternate Special Purchase Option Date (but excluding any Basic Rent designated
as payable in advance on such Alternate Special Purchase Option Date) and (2)
the present value (discounted semiannually at an interest rate per annum to be
supplied by the Lessee) of the Special Purchase Price as of such Alternate
Special Purchase Option Date, and that, if necessary, the Lease shall be
amended to reflect the change in the Special Purchase Option Date from January
10, 2013 to whichever of the Alternate Special Purchase Option Dates as would
give rise to the lowest such sum; provided that upon any such request by the
Lessee to change the Special Purchase Option Date to an Alternate Special
Purchase Option Date, the Owner Participant shall, at its cost and expense,
obtain an estimate of the fair market value (taking into account a reasonable
estimate for inflation and deflation) of the Aircraft, as of any Alternate
Special Purchase Option Dates specified by the Lessee, from AVMARK, Inc. or, if
AVMARK, Inc. shall not then be an independent aircraft appraiser, from an
independent aircraft appraiser selected by mutual agreement of the Owner
Participant and the Lessee or, if they shall be unable to agree, from an
appraiser selected pursuant to an Independent Appraisal (except that all costs
and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Owner Participant) and, if
the estimated fair market value of the Aircraft determined by such appraiser
(expressed as a percentage of Lessor's Cost) is more than the Special Purchase
Price Percentage calculated for the Alternate Special Purchase Option Date as
provided above in this sentence to which the Lessee has requested the Special
Purchase Option Date be changed, the Special Purchase Option Date shall remain
unchanged and the Special Purchase Price Percentage shall be the percentage
determined in accordance with the preceding sentence, unless the Lessee elects
that the Special Purchase Price Percentage as of such Alternate Special
Purchase Option Date shall be equal to such estimated fair market value
(computed as a percentage of Lessor's Cost), in which case the Lease shall be
amended to reflect such Alternate Special Purchase Option Date. In performing
any

96
AF-2
<PAGE> 101
such recalculations in respect of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value and
Termination Value, the Owner Participant shall utilize the same methods and
assumptions originally used to calculate the alternate schedules of Basic Rent,
Stipulated Loss Values and Termination Values referred to in the definition of
the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return and in performing any such
recalculations in respect of the Special Purchase Price Percentage, the Owner
Participant shall, subject to the proviso to the preceding sentence, utilize
the same methods and assumptions originally used to calculate the Special
Purchase Price Percentage held in escrow by Sidley & Austin pursuant to Section
18(d) (other than, in each case, those assumptions changed as a result of the
Section 20 Refinancing; it being agreed that such recalculation shall reflect
solely any changes of assumptions or facts resulting directly from such Section
20 Refinancing or due to the prior occurrence of any event taken into account
in a recalculation pursuant to Section 18), provided that, Basic Rent, as so
recomputed, shall comply with the requirements of Sections 4.02(5) and 4.07(1)
of Revenue Procedure 75-28, 1975-1 C.B. 752, and shall not present a greater
risk that Section 467(b)(2) of the Code would apply than the risk that Section
467(b)(2) applied prior to such recomputation, it being agreed that the
requirements of clause (i) of Section 5.01 of Rev. Proc. 75-21, 1975-1 C.B.
715, shall be applied on a prospective basis.

Upon completion of any recalculation described above in this
Section 20(c), a duly authorized officer of the Owner Participant shall provide
a certificate to the Lessee either (x) stating that the payments of Basic Rent,
Stipulated Loss Values and Termination Values with respect to the Term, and the
Special Purchase Price Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date, as are
then set forth in the Lease do not require change, or (y) setting forth such
adjustments to the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values or
Termination Values with respect to the Term and the Special Purchase Price
Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date, as have been calculated by the
Owner Participant in accordance with the above provisions. Such certificate
shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for any such adjustments. If the
Lessee shall so request, the recalculation of any such adjustments described in
this Section 20 shall be verified by procedures substantially identical to the
verification procedures set forth in Section 18(b). No adjustment may be made
to the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values or Termination

97
AF-2
<PAGE> 102
Values with respect to the Term pursuant to this Section 20 except in
accordance with the provisions of Section 18(c).

SECTION 21. Miscellaneous. (f) Nothing contained in this
Agreement, or in the Lease, the Trust Indenture, the Trust Agreement or the Tax
Indemnity Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee by the Lessee of payments
due pursuant to the Certificates or of the residual value or useful life of the
Aircraft or any portion thereof.

(b) Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited and
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. This Agreement may be
executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall
together constitute but one and the same instrument. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended, supplemented, waived or
modified orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party
against which the enforcement of the termination, amendment, supplement, waiver
or modification is sought. The section and paragraph headings in this
Agreement and the index preceding this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not modify, define, expand or limit any of the terms
or provisions hereof and all references herein to numbered sections, unless
otherwise indicated, are to sections of this Agreement.

(c) The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and
shall inure to the benefit of, the Lessee and, subject to the terms of Section
13(E) hereof, its successors and permitted assigns, the Indenture Trustee and
its successors as Indenture Trustee under the Trust Indenture, the Owner
Trustee and its successors as Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement, the
Owner Participant and, subject to the provisions of Section 16(c) hereof, its
successors and permitted assigns, and the Original Loan Participant and,
subject to the provisions of Section 9(p) hereof, the other Loan Participants.
Each Loan Participant other than the Original Loan Participant, by

98
AF-2
<PAGE> 103
its acceptance of any Certificate, shall be deemed to have irrevocably and
unconditionally agreed to perform the obligations of a Loan Participant
hereunder and under the Trust Indenture.

(d) With respect to any opinion required to be delivered
under any Operative Document by counsel to any party hereto, each party hereto
hereby irrevocably instructs its applicable counsel to deliver such opinion to
and for the benefit of the parties that are the addressees of such opinion.

THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND SHALL IN ALL
RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND
PERFORMANCE.

"(a) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, the Lessee shall have the right to request the Owner
Participant and the Owner Trustee to effect an optional redemption of
all of the Equipment Notes issued under the Trust Indenture or an
optional redemption of all of the Equipment Notes of the same maturity
and bearing the same interest rate issued under the Trust Indenture
pursuant to Section 6.01(b)(2) or (3) of the Trust Indenture (in each
case, such term to include the Equipment Notes originally issued under
the Trust Indenture and any refunding indebtedness pursuant to this
Section 17) , as part of a refunding or refinancing operation.
Promptly on receipt of such request, the Owner Participant will
negotiate promptly in good faith to conclude an agreement with the
Lessee as to the terms of such refunding or refinancing operation and
upon such agreement:

(i) the Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Loan
Trustee, the Owner Trustee, and any other appropriate parties
will enter into a financing or loan agreement (which may
involve an underwriting agreement in connection with a public
offering; provided, however, that in the case of a refunding
or refinancing involving a public offering of debt securities,
the Lessee shall have the right to purchase such debt
securities and apply such debt securities as a credit against
its obligations to pay Rent) providing for (x) the issuance
and sale by the Owner Trustee or such other party as may be
appropriate to such institution or institutions on the date
specified in such agreement (for the purposes of this Section
17, the "Refinancing Date") of United States
dollar-denominated debt securities in an aggregate principal

accrued thereon to the Refinancing Date and (y) the
application of the proceeds of the sale of such debt
securities to the redemption of all such Equipment Notes on
the Refinancing Date;

(ii) the Lessee and the Owner Trustee will amend the
Lease such that (w) if the Refinancing Date is not a Lease
Period Date, the Lessee shall on the Refinancing Date prepay
that portion of the next succeeding installment of Basic Rent
as shall

10

Series AC
<PAGE> 11

equal the aggregate interest accrued on the Equipment Notes 
then being redeemed on the Refinancing Date in the event that 
such interest is not financed through the issuance of debt 
securities on the Refinancing Date, (x) Basic Rent payable 
in respect of the period from and after the Refinancing Date 
shall be recalculated to preserve the Owner Participant's 
Revised Net Economic Return, (y) amounts payable in respect of
Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value from and after the
Refinancing Date shall be appropriately recalculated to 
preserve the Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return, 
and (z) the Special Purchase Price Percentage and the Special 
Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated as provided in 
Section 18; 

(iii) the Owner Trustee will enter into an agreement to
provide for the securing thereunder of the debt securities
issued by the Owner Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this
Section 17 in like manner as the Equipment Notes issuable
under the Trust Indenture and/or will enter into such
amendments and supplements to the Trust Indenture as may be
necessary to effect such refunding or refinancing, provided
that no such amendment or supplement will materially increase
the liabilities of or impair the rights of the Owner
Participant under the Operative Documents without the consent
of the Owner Participant; and

(iv) unless otherwise agreed by the Owner Participant,
the Lessee shall pay as Supplemental Rent on an After- Tax
Basis all reasonable fees, costs, and expenses of such
refunding or refinancing;

provided, however, that (v) the Lessee shall not request that less
than all of the Equipment Notes issued under the Trust Indenture be
redeemed as part of a refunding operation hereunder unless it
simultaneously requests that all the outstanding equipment notes held
in the same Pass Through Trust issued under the Other Indentures be
simultaneously redeemed, (w) there shall be no more than two such
refundings or refinancings (not including the Section 20 Refinancing),
(x) if within 15 days after receipt of a request from the Lessee to
effect a refunding or refinancing pursuant to

11

Series AC
<PAGE> 12

this Section 17, which request specifies the proposed structural terms
and the amount thereof, the Owner Participant provides the Lessee with
a written notice to the effect that there will be a risk of adverse
tax consequences to the Owner Participant resulting from the refunding
or refinancing and, if then requested by the Lessee in writing, within
15 days after receipt of such request, the Owner Participant provides
the Lessee with a written opinion of independent tax counsel selected
by the Owner Participant and reasonably acceptable to the Lessee to
the effect that there will be a risk of such adverse tax consequences
to the Owner Participant resulting from the refunding or refinancing
(other than the consequence that the refinanced loan constitutes
"qualified nonrecourse indebtedness" within the meaning of Temporary
Regulations Section 1.861-10T(b) for the purpose of the computation of
the FSC Benefits (as defined in the Tax Indemnity Agreement)), then
the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant shall be required to
effect such refunding or refinancing only if the Lessee shall have
agreed to indemnify the Owner Participant against such identified
adverse tax consequences in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Owner Participant; provided, however, the parties agree that in the
absence of a change in applicable laws, regulations, revenue rulings,
revenue procedures or judicial precedents enacted, adopted or decided
after the Delivery Date, a refinancing or refunding will not be deemed
for this purpose to result in a risk of the Owner Participant not
being considered the owner of the Aircraft, Airframe, any Engine or
any Part for Federal or other income tax purposes, (y) no such
refinancing or refunding shall require an increase in the amount of
the Owner Participant's investment in the beneficial ownership of the
Aircraft or shall cause the ratio of the newly issued debt to the
Owner Participant's then outstanding investment in the Aircraft to be
more than 4 to 1 and (z) except with respect to matters relating to
taxes, no such refunding or refinancing will materially increase the
liabilities of or impair the rights of the Owner Participant."

"(b) The Equipment Notes, and any other debt instruments
issued in connection with any refunding or refinancing operation
permitted by this Section 17, shall not be subject to optional
redemption by the Owner Trustee without the consent of the Lessee,
except as provided in the Trust Indenture."

12. Amendment of Section 18 of the Participation Agreement.
(a) Paragraph (a) of Section 18 is amended in its entirety to read as follows:

"(a) Calculation of Adjustments. In the event that (A) the
Transaction Costs are less or more than 1.50426713% of Lessor's Cost,
or (B) prior to the acceptance of the Aircraft on the Delivery Date:
(1) there shall have occurred a Change in Tax Law and (2) after having
been advised in writing by the Owner Participant of such Change in Tax
Law and the proposed adjustment to the payments of Basic Rent
resulting therefrom, Lessee shall have waived its right under Section
11 of the Participation Agreement to decline to proceed with the
transaction, or (C) a refinancing or refunding as contemplated by
Section 17 hereof occurs, or (D) the Delivery Date is other than July
10, 1991, or (E) if the Certificates are not refunded or refinanced on
or prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date, the Excess Payment
Amount ( as defined in the Original Participation Agreement (after
adjustment for any Excess Payment Differential Amount) (as defined in
the Original Participation Agreement) is other than $1,947,948.23,
then, in each case, the Owner Participant shall recalculate the
payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values, Termination Values and
the Excess Payment Amount with respect to the Term (i) to preserve the
Owner Participant's Revised Net Economic Return and (ii) to minimize,
to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the foregoing clause
(i), the present value (discounted semiannually at an interest rate
per annum to be supplied by the Lessee) of the payments of Basic Rent.
In addition, in the event of a refinancing or refunding referred to in
clause (C) of the preceding sentence, the Special Purchase Price
Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated
in a manner consistent with the procedures specified in Section 20(c)
of the Original Participation Agreement. In performing any such
recalculations, the Owner Participant shall utilize the same methods
and assumptions used by the Owner Participant in the calculation of
the schedules included in the Amended and Restated Rent Schedule dated
as of May 26, 1994, as such assumptions may be changed as a result of
the event described in clause (A), (B), (C), (D) or (E) of the second
preceding sentence necessitating such recalculation or due to the
prior occurrence of any such event; provided that, Basic Rent, as so

13

Series AC
<PAGE> 14

recomputed, shall comply with the requirements of Section 4.02(5) and
4.07(1) of Revenue Procedure 75-28, 1975-1 C.B. 752, and shall not
present a greater risk that Section 467(b)(2) of the Code would apply
than the risk that Section 467(b)(2) applied prior to such
recomputation, it being agreed that the requirements of clause (i) of
Section 5.01 of Rev. Proc. 75- 21, 1975-1 C.B. 715, shall be applied
on a prospective basis.

13. Deletion of Section 20 of the Participation Agreement.
Section 20 is hereby deleted and the words "[Intentionally Omitted]"
substituted therefor.

14. Amendment of Section 21 of the Participation Agreement.

(a) Section 21(c) is amended by inserting the following
sentence at the end thereof. "No purchaser or holder of any Equipment Note
(including any Loan Participant) shall be deemed to be a successor or assign of
any of the Original Loan Participants."

(b) Section 21 is hereby renumbered Section 22.

15. New Section 21 of the Participation Agreement. The
following new Section 21 is added:

Through Trust Documents. (a) In the event that the Loan Trustee
gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Section 9.06(b) of the
Trust Indenture, the Lessee may direct the Owner Trustee to appoint,
and the Owner Trustee shall promptly appoint, a successor Loan
Trustee.

(b) In the event that either the Owner Trustee or the Lessee
obtains knowledge of the existence of any of the grounds for removal
of the Loan Trustee set forth in Section 9.06 of the Trust Indenture,
the Owner Trustee or the Lessee, as the case may be, shall promptly
give notice (the "Removal Notice") to the other by telephone,
confirmed in writing. Within five Business Days after the giving of
the Removal Notice, the Lessee may direct the Owner Trustee to remove,
and the Owner Trustee shall remove, the Loan Trustee and appoint a
successor Loan Trustee, provided that, if within ten Business Days
after the giving of the Removal Notice the Loan Trustee shall not have
been

14

Series AC
<PAGE> 15

removed, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed without further act to have
delegated to the Lessee the right, on behalf of the Owner Trustee, to
remove the Loan Trustee and appoint a successor, and, in the event of
the removal of the Loan Trustee in accordance with such delegation,
the Lessee agrees to appoint promptly a successor Loan Trustee.

(c) The Lessee shall not enter into any modification or
amendment of any Pass Through Trust Document in any manner affecting
the Pass Through Trusts created pursuant to the Pass Through Trust
Supplements, without the consent of the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

16. Amendment of Schedule I to the Participation Agreement.

Refunding Agreement (AA 1994 PTC Series AC).

satisfy any obligations expressly undertaken by it in its individual capacity
pursuant to the terms of the Operative Documents to which it is a party. The

such action as may be necessary duly to discharge and satisfy in full (i) all
Lessor's Liens attributable to the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity,

capacity) created as a result of its breach of any of its obligations under

which arise from acts of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, except
the Lien created under the Trust Indenture, the rights of Lessee under the
Lease and the rights of the Owner Participant hereunder, and (iii) any other
Liens attributable to the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity on any part
of the Trust Estate which result from claims against the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity unrelated to the ownership of the Aircraft, the

believed by it to be genuine and reasonably believed by it to be signed by the
proper party or parties. Unless other evidence in respect thereof is
specifically prescribed herein, any request, direction, order or demand of the
Owner Participant or Lessee or the Indenture Trustee mentioned herein or in any
of the other Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party shall be
sufficiently evidenced by written instruments signed by a person purporting to
be an officer of the Owner Participant or Lessee or the Indenture Trustee, as
the case may be. The Owner Trustee may accept a copy of a resolution of the
Board of Directors of Lessee or the

17
<PAGE> 22
Owner Participant or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, certified by
the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of Lessee or the Owner Participant or
the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, as duly adopted and in full force
and effect, as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted
by said Board and that the same is in full force and effect. As to any fact or
matter the manner of ascertainment of which is not specifically described
herein, the Owner Trustee may for all purposes hereof rely on a certificate
signed by an officer of Lessee or the Owner Participant or the Indenture
Trustee, as the case may be, as to such fact or matter, and such certificate
shall constitute full protection to the Owner Trustee for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith in reliance thereon.

Section 6.06. Not Acting in Individual Capacity. In acting
hereunder, the Owner Trustee acts solely as trustee and not in its individual
capacity except as otherwise expressly provided herein; and, except as may be
otherwise expressly provided in this Trust Agreement, the Lease, the
Participation Agreement or the Trust Indenture, all persons having any claim
against the Owner Trustee by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall look only to the Trust Estate for payment or satisfaction thereof.

Section 6.07. Fees; Compensation. Except as provided in
Section 5.03, 6.08 or 7.01, the Owner Trustee agrees that it shall have no
right against the Owner Participant or (subject to the provisions of Section
4.01 hereof and the lien created by the Trust Indenture) the Trust Estate for
any fee as compensation for its services hereunder.

Section 6.08. Tax Returns. The Owner Trustee shall be
responsible for the keeping of all appropriate books and records relating to
the receipt and disbursement by it of all monies under this Trust Agreement or
any agreement contemplated hereby to which it is a party. The Owner
Participant shall be responsible for causing to be prepared and filed, at its
expense, all income tax returns required to be filed by the Owner Participant
and for causing to be prepared all income tax returns required to be filed with
respect to the trust created hereby and shall execute and file such returns.
The Owner Trustee, upon request and upon adequate assurance of reimbursement by
the Owner Participant for its costs and expenses as-

18
<PAGE> 23
sociated therewith, will furnish the Owner Participant with all such
information as may be reasonably required from the Owner Trustee in connection
with the preparation of such income tax returns. Upon request of the Owner
Participant, the Owner Trustee will sign and file the trust's tax returns
prepared by the Owner Participant.

INDEMNIFICATION OF THE OWNER TRUSTEE
BY THE OWNER PARTICIPANT

Section 7.01. The Owner Participant to Indemnify the Owner
Trustee. The Owner Participant hereby agrees, whether or not any of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, to assume liability for,
and does hereby indemnify, protect, save and keep harmless the Owner Trustee in
its individual capacity, and its successors, assigns, legal representatives,
agents and servants, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, taxes (excluding any taxes payable by the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity on or measured by any compensation received
by the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity for its services hereunder),
claims, actions, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements (including, without
limitation, reasonable legal fees) and expenses of any kind and nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity (whether or not also indemnified against by
Lessee under the Lease or under the Participation Agreement or also indemnified
against by the Manufacturer or any other Person) in any way relating to or
arising out of this Trust Agreement or any of the other Operative Documents or
the enforcement of any of the terms of any thereof, or in any way relating to
or arising out of the manufacture, purchase, acceptance, nonacceptance,
rejection, ownership, delivery, lease, possession, use, operation, condition,
sale, return or other disposition of the Aircraft or any Engine (including,
without limitation, latent and other defects, whether or not discoverable, and
any claim for patent, trademark or copyright infringement), or in any way
relating to or arising out of the administration of the Trust Estate or the
action or inaction of the Owner Trustee hereunder, except (a) in the case of
willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Owner Trustee either
as trustee or in its individual capacity in

19
<PAGE> 24
the performance or nonperformance of its duties hereunder or (b) those
resulting from the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity (or from the failure of the Owner Trustee in
its individual capacity to perform any covenant) in Section 6.03, or in any of
the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party, or (c) those
arising or resulting from any of the matters described in the last sentence of
Section 6.01, or (d) those resulting from its failure to perform the terms of
the last sentence of Section 5.04 hereof or from the failure to use ordinary
care in the receipt and disbursement of funds or (e) those arising under any
circumstances or upon any terms where Lessee would not have been required to
indemnify the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity pursuant to Sections
7(b) or 7(c) of the Participation Agreement (disregarding, for this purpose,
those exclusions contained in Sections 7(b)(4) and 7(c)(2) of the Participation
Agreement (including, without limitation, the exclusions contained in Sections
7(b)(4)(i) and 7(c)(2)(F) thereof relating to acts or events occurring after
the termination of the Term of the Lease or after return of the Aircraft, or
after the placement of the Aircraft in storage, or after the discharge of
Lessee's obligations under the Lease and prior to the termination of the Trust
Estate) arising or resulting from any action or inaction of the Owner Trustee
in accordance with written instructions of a Majority in Interest of Owner
Participants). The indemnities contained in this Section 7.01 extend to the
Owner Trustee only in its individual capacity and shall not be construed as
indemnities of the Indenture Estate or the Trust Estate. The indemnities
contained in this Section 7.01 shall survive the termination of this Trust
Agreement. In addition, if necessary, the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to
indemnification from the Trust Estate, subject however to the provisions of
Section 4.01 hereof and the lien created under the Trust Indenture, for any
liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, tax, claim, action, suit, cost,
expense or disbursement indemnified against pursuant to this Section 7.01 to
the extent not reimbursed by Lessee, the Owner Participant or others, but
without releasing any of them from their respective agreements of
reimbursement; and to secure the same the Owner Trustee shall have a lien on
the Trust Estate, subject however to the provisions of Section 4.01 hereof and
the lien created under the Trust Indenture, which lien of the Owner Trustee
shall be prior to any interest therein of the Owner Participant. To the extent
that the

20
<PAGE> 25
Owner Participant makes an indemnification or other payment to the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity under this Article VII or under Section 5.03
hereof or under Section 6.07 in circumstances where the Lessee was obligated to
make payment to the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 7(b)(3) of the
Participation Agreement, or the Owner Trustee retains any moneys pursuant to
clause first of Section 4.01(b) hereof in respect of a matter for which the
Lessee was obligated as aforesaid, the Owner Participant shall be subrogated to
any rights of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity to the extent of
such indemnification or other payment or retention, as the case may be, in
respect of the matter as to which such indemnification or other payment or
retention, as the case may be, was made, except that the Owner Participant
shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any rights of the Owner Trustee in
its individual capacity if such claim arises as a result of an event or
occurrence with respect to which the Owner Participant would not have been
entitled to indemnification under Section 7(b)(3) of the Participation
Agreement by reason of an exclusion from indemnity under Section 7(b)(4)(iii)
or 7(b)(4)(iv). The Owner Trustee in its individual capacity shall not make
any claim for indemnification or other payment from the Owner Participant
pursuant to this Section 7.01 or otherwise with respect to which Lessee has an
obligation to indemnify or make payment to the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity under Section 7(b) of the Participation Agreement, unless and until
the Owner Trustee in this individual capacity shall have first made demand upon
Lessee (but only if and to the extent permitted by applicable law) for such
indemnification.

effect as if set forth in full, mutatis mutandis, in this Section 8.01) be
applicable to any assignment, conveyance or other transfer by the Owner
Participant of its right, title or interest in and to this Trust Agreement or
any of the other Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party or
any proceeds therefrom.

SUCCESSOR OWNER TRUSTEES; CO-TRUSTEES

Section 9.01. Resignation of the Owner Trustee; Appointment
of Successor. (a) Resignation or Removal. The Owner Trustee or any successor
Owner Trustee may resign at any time without cause by giving at least 60 days'
prior written notice to the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee and
Lessee, such resignation to be effective upon the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Owner Trustee under Section 9.01(b). In addition, a Majority in
Interest of Owner Participants may at any time remove the Owner Trustee without
cause by a notice in writing delivered to the Owner Trustee, the other Owner
Participant, if any, the Indenture Trustee and Lessee, such removal to be
effective upon the acceptance of appointment by the successor Owner Trustee
under Section 9.01(b). In the case of the resignation or removal of the Owner
Trustee, a Majority in Interest of Owner Participants may appoint a successor
Owner Trustee by an instrument in writing. If a successor Owner Trustee shall
not have been appointed within 30 days after such notice of resignation or
removal, the Owner Trustee, Lessee or the Indenture Trustee may apply to any
court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor Owner Trustee to act
until such time, if any, as a successor shall have been appointed as above
provided. Any successor Owner Trustee so appointed by such court shall
immediately and without further act be superseded by any successor Owner
Trustee appointed as above provided within one year from the date of the
appointment by such court.

(b) Execution and Delivery of Documents, etc. Any successor
Owner Trustee, however appointed, shall execute and deliver to the predecessor
Owner Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon such
successor Owner Trustee, without further act, shall become vested with all the
estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and trusts of the predecessor Owner
Trustee in the trusts hereunder with like effect as if originally named the
Owner Trustee herein; but nevertheless, upon the written request of such
successor Owner Trustee, such predecessor Owner Trustee shall execute and
deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Owner Trustee, upon the
trusts herein expressed, all the estates, properties, rights, powers and trusts
of such predecessor Owner

22
<PAGE> 27
Trustee, and such predecessor Owner Trustee shall duly assign, transfer,
deliver and pay over to such successor Owner Trustee all monies or other
property then held by such predecessor Owner Trustee upon the trusts herein
expressed. Upon the appointment of any successor Owner Trustee hereunder, the
predecessor Owner Trustee will complete, execute and deliver to the successor
Trustee such documents as are necessary to cause registration of the Aircraft
included in the Trust Estate to be transferred upon the records of the Federal
Aviation Administration, or other governmental authority having jurisdiction,
into the name of the successor Owner Trustee.

(c) Qualification. Any successor Owner Trustee, however
appointed, shall be a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning of
Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act and shall also be a bank or trust
company organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state
thereof having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000, if
there be such an institution willing, able and legally qualified to perform the
duties of the Owner Trustee hereunder upon reasonable and customary terms.

(d) Merger, etc. Any corporation into which the Owner
Trustee (in its individual capacity) may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Owner Trustee (in its individual
capacity) shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the
corporate trust business of the Owner Trustee (in its individual capacity) may
be transferred, shall, subject to the terms of Section 9.01(c), be the
institution acting as the Owner Trustee hereunder without further act.

Section 9.02. Co-Trustees and Separate Trustees. If at any
time or times it shall be necessary or prudent in order to conform to any
applicable law of any jurisdiction in which all or any part of the Trust Estate
is located, or the Owner Trustee shall be advised by counsel that it is so
necessary or prudent in the interest of the Owner Participant or the Owner
Trustee, or the Owner Trustee shall have been directed to do so by a Majority
in Interest of Owner Participants, the Owner Trustee and each Owner Participant
shall execute and deliver an agreement supplemental hereto and all other
instruments and agreements necessary or proper to con-

23
<PAGE> 28
stitute another bank or trust company or one or more persons (any and all of
which shall be a "citizen of the United States" as defined in Section 101(16)
of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended) approved by the Owner Trustee,
Lessee and the Owner Participant, either to act as co-trustee or co-trustees,
jointly with the Owner Trustee, or to act as separate trustee or trustees
hereunder (any such co-trustee or separate trustee being herein sometimes
referred to as an "additional trustee"). In the event (i) the Owner
Participant shall not have joined in the execution of such agreements
supplemental hereto within ten days after the receipt of a written request from
the Owner Trustee so to do, or (ii) a Lease Event of Default or an Indenture
Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Owner Trustee may act under
the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.02 without the concurrence of the
Owner Participant; and the Owner Participant hereby appoints the Owner Trustee
its agent and attorney-in-fact to act for it under the foregoing provisions of
this Section 9.02 in either of such contingencies.

Every additional trustee hereunder shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be appointed and act, and the Owner Trustee and its
successors shall act, subject to the following provisions and conditions:

(a) all powers, duties, obligations and rights conferred upon
the Owner Trustee in respect of the custody, control and management of
monies, the Aircraft or documents authorized to be delivered hereunder
or under the Participation Agreement shall be exercised solely by the
trust company designated as the Owner Trustee in the first paragraph
of this Trust Agreement, or its successors as the Owner Trustee
hereunder;

(b) all other rights, powers, duties and obligations
conferred or imposed upon the Owner Trustee and any limitations
thereon shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed
by the trust company designated as the Owner Trustee in the first
paragraph of this Trust Agreement or its successor as the Owner
Trustee, and such additional trustee or trustees jointly, except to
the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any
particular act or acts are to be performed (including the holding of
title to the Trust Estate), the Owner Trustee shall

24
<PAGE> 29
be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which
event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised
and performed by such additional trustee or trustees;

(c) no power given to, or which it is provided hereby may be
exercised by, any such additional trustee or trustees shall be
exercised hereunder by such additional trustee or trustees, except
jointly with, or with the consent in writing of, the trust company
designated as the Owner Trustee in this Trust Agreement or its
successor as the Owner Trustee, anything herein contained to the
contrary notwithstanding;

(d) no trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason
of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder;

(e) a Majority in Interest of Owner Participants, at any
time, by an instrument in writing may remove any such additional
trustee. In the event that the Owner Participants shall not have
joined in the execution of any such instrument within ten days after
the receipt of a written request from the Owner Trustee so to do, the
Owner Trustee shall have the power to remove any such additional
trustee without the concurrence of the Owner Participants; and the
Owner Participants hereby appoint the Owner Trustee their agent and
attorney-in-fact to act for them in such connection in such
contingency; and

(f) no appointing of, or action by, any additional trustee
will relieve the Owner Trustee of any of its obligations under, or
otherwise affect any of the terms of the Trust Indenture or affect the
interests of the Indenture Trustee or the holders of the Certificates
in the Trust Estate.

and as may be specified in such request, or execute and deliver such written
waiver or modification of or consent under the terms of any such Operative
Document as Lessee and the Indenture Trustee may agree to and as may be
specified in such request; provided, however, that, without the prior written
consent of each Owner Participant: (i) no such supplement, amendment or

individual right on the part of any Owner Participant with respect to any
agreement or obligation. Lessee may consent to any change order with respect

supplement referred to in Section 10.01(a)(i) shall be delivered by the Owner

other Operative Document to which the Owner Trustee is a party, the Owner
Trustee may in its discretion decline to execute such document.

Section 10.03. Absence of Requirements as to Form. It shall
not be necessary for any written request furnished pursuant to Section 10.01 to
specify the particular form of the proposed documents to be executed pursuant

execution by the Owner Trustee of any document entered into pursuant to Section

written request pursuant to Section 10.01 shall be required to enable the Owner
Trustee to enter into any Lease Supplement with Lessee pursuant to Section 3.01
or Section 3.04 or to enter into any Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement
with the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.04.

with the terms of the Lease or such other Operative Document; and third, the
balance, if any, shall be paid to the Owner Participant.

Indenture shall have been discharged pursuant to Sections 10.01 thereof, any
payment of the type referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 4.01 received
by the Owner Trustee with respect to such Aircraft shall, if required by the
terms of the Lease, be distributed to Lessee. Any such payment which would be
required to be made to Lessee pursuant to the terms of the Lease or the
Participation Agreement, but is not made due to the occurrence and continuation
of a Lease Event of Default, shall be held and invested by the Owner Trustee
pursuant to Section 25 of the Lease as further security for the obligations of
Lessee under the Lease, and at such time as there shall not be continuing any
Lease Event of Default, such payment shall be made to Lessee.

(d) Excepted Property. Any Excepted Property received
by the Owner Trustee shall be paid by the Owner Trustee to the person to whom
such Excepted Property is payable under the provisions of the Participation
Agreement, the Tax Indemnity Agreement or the Lease.

(e) Insurance Proceeds. Any proceeds of any insurance
for loss or damage to the Aircraft in excess of the Stipulated Loss Value for
the Aircraft shall be paid to Lessee. Any proceeds of any insurance for loss
or damage to the Aircraft not constituting an Event of Loss with respect to the
Airframe, the Aircraft or any Engine received by the Owner Trustee shall be
applied as provided in Section 11(b) of the Lease.

Section 4.02. Method of Payments. The Owner Trustee
shall make distributions or cause distributions to be made to (i) the Owner
Participant pursuant to this Article IV by transferring by wire transfer in
immediately available funds the amount to be distributed to such account or
accounts of the Owner Participant as it may designate from time to time by
written notice to the Owner Trustee (and the Owner Trustee shall use reasonable
efforts to cause such funds to be transferred by wire transfer on the same day
as received, but in any case not later than the next succeeding Business Day),
and (ii) the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Article IV by paying the

<PAGE> 14
amount to be distributed to the Indenture Trustee in the manner specified in
the Trust Indenture; provided, however, that the Owner Trustee shall invest
overnight, for the benefit of the Owner Participant, in investments that would
be permitted by Section 25 of the Lease (but only to the extent such
investments are available and, if such investments are not available, then in
such other investments available to the Owner Trustee which, after consultation
with the Owner Participant, the Owner Participant shall direct) all funds not
transferred by wire transfer on the same day as they were received.
Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject always to the provisions of and lien
created by the Trust Indenture, the Owner Trustee will, if so requested by the
Owner Participant by written notice, pay any and all amounts payable by the
Owner Trustee hereunder to the Owner Participant either (i) by crediting, or
causing the Indenture Trustee to credit, such amount or amounts to an account
or accounts maintained by the Owner Participant with the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity or with the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, in
immediately available funds, or (ii) by mailing, or causing the Indenture
Trustee to mail, an official bank check or checks in such amount or amounts
payable to the Owner Participant at such address as the Owner Participant shall
have designated in writing to the Owner Trustee.

DUTIES OF THE OWNER TRUSTEE

Section 5.01. Notice of Event of Default. If the Owner
Trustee shall have knowledge of a Lease Event of Default or an Indenture Event
of Default (or an event that, with the passage of time or the giving of notice
or both, would constitute a Lease Event of Default or an Indenture Event of
Default), the Owner Trustee shall give to the Owner Participant and Lessee
prompt telephonic or telex notice thereof followed by prompt confirmation
thereof by certified mail, postage prepaid. Subject to the terms of Section
5.03, the Owner Trustee shall take such action or shall refrain from taking
such action, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Operative Documents,
with respect to such Lease Event of Default or Indenture Event of Default or
event as the Owner Trustee shall be directed in writing by the Owner
Participant. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement and the Lease,

10
AF-1
<PAGE> 15
the Owner Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of a Lease Event of
Default or an Indenture Event of Default or an event that, with the passage of
time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a Lease Event of Default
or an Indenture Event of Default unless notified in writing thereof in the
manner and at the address set forth in Section 11.05 or unless an officer in
the Corporate Trust Administration of the Owner Trustee has actual knowledge
thereof.

Section 5.02. Action Upon Instructions. Subject in all
respects to the terms of Sections 5.01 and 5.03 and to the terms of the other
Operative Documents, upon the written instructions at any time and from time to
time of the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee will take such of the
following actions as may be specified in such instructions: (i) give such
notice or direction or exercise such right, remedy or power hereunder or under
any of the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party, or in
respect of all or any part of the Trust Estate, as shall be specified in such
instructions; (ii) take such action to preserve or protect the Trust Estate
(including the discharge of any liens or encumbrances) as may be specified in
such instructions; (iii) approve as satisfactory to it all matters required by
the terms of the Lease and the other Operative Documents to be satisfactory to
the Owner Trustee, it being understood that without written instructions of the
Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee shall not approve any such matter as
satisfactory to it; and (iv) subject to the rights of Lessee under the
Operative Documents, after the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease,
convey all of the Owner Trustee's right, title and interest in and to the
Aircraft for such amount, on such terms and to such purchaser or purchasers as
shall be designated in such instructions, or lease the Aircraft on a net lease
basis on such terms as shall be set forth in such instructions or deliver the
Aircraft to the Owner Participant in accordance with such instructions. In the
event that the Owner Trustee is unsure of the application of any provision of
this Trust Agreement or any other agreement relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Owner Trustee may request and rely upon instructions
of the Owner Participant.

11

<PAGE> 16
Section 5.03. Indemnification. The Owner Trustee shall
not be required to take or refrain from taking any action under Section 5.01 or
5.02 (other than the giving of notices required of the Owner Trustee therein)
unless the Owner Trustee shall have been indemnified by the Owner Participant,
in manner and form satisfactory to the Owner Trustee, against any liability,
cost or expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements) which may
be incurred in connection therewith; and, if the Owner Participant shall have
directed the Owner Trustee to take or refrain from taking any such action, the
Owner Participant agrees to furnish such indemnity as shall be required and, in
addition (to the extent not otherwise paid pursuant to the Participation
Agreement or the Lease), to pay the reasonable fees and charges of the Owner
Trustee for the services performed or to be performed by it pursuant to such
direction. The Owner Trustee shall not be required to take any action under
Section 5.01 or 5.02 if the Owner Trustee shall reasonably determine, or shall
have been advised by counsel, that such action is contrary to the terms of any
of the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party, or is
otherwise contrary to law.

Section 5.04. No Duties Except as Specified in Trust
Agreement or Instructions. The Owner Trustee shall not have any duty or
obligation to manage, control, use, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with the
Aircraft or any other part of the Trust Estate, or otherwise to take or refrain
from taking any action under, or in connection with any of the Operative
Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party, except as expressly required
by the terms of any of the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a
party, or (to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Trust
Indenture) as expressly provided by the terms hereof or in written instructions
from the Owner Participant received pursuant to the terms of Section 5.01 or
5.02, and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Trust
Agreement against the Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee nevertheless agrees
that it will, in its individual capacity and at its own cost and expense (but
without any right of indemnity in respect of any such cost or expense under
Section 7.01) promptly take such action as may be necessary duly to discharge
and satisfy in full (i) all Lessor's Liens attributable to the Owner Trustee in
its individual capacity, (ii) any Liens (other than Lessor's Liens attributable
to it in its individual capacity) created as a result of its breach of

12
AF-1
<PAGE> 17
any of its obligations under this Trust Agreement (subject to the limitations
on the liability of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity set forth in
Section 6.01) on any part of the Trust Estate, or on any properties of the
Owner Trustee assigned, pledged or mortgaged as part of the Trust Estate, which
arise from acts of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, except the
lien created under the Trust Indenture, the rights of Lessee under the Lease
and the rights of the Owner Participant hereunder, and (iii) any other liens or
encumbrances attributable to the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity on
any part of the Trust Estate which result from claims against the Owner Trustee
in its individual capacity unrelated to the ownership of the Aircraft, the
administration of the Trust Estate or the transactions contemplated by the
Operative Documents.

Section 5.05. No Action Except Under Specified Documents
or Instructions. The Owner Trustee shall have no power or authority to, and
the Owner Trustee agrees that it will not, manage, control, use, sell, dispose
of or otherwise deal with the Aircraft or any other part of the Trust Estate
except (i) as expressly required by the terms of any of the Operative Documents
to which the Owner Trustee is a party, (ii) as expressly provided by the terms
hereof, or (iii) as expressly provided in written instructions from the Owner
Participant pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.02, but subject always to the
provisions of, and the lien created by, the Trust Indenture.

THE OWNER TRUSTEE

Owner Trustee in its individual capacity accepts the trusts hereby created and
agrees to perform the same but only upon the terms hereof applicable to it.
The Owner Trustee in its individual capacity also agrees to receive and

willful misconduct or gross negligence, (ii) its performance of the terms of
the last sentence of Section 5.04, (iii) its failure to use ordinary care in
receiving or disbursing funds, (iv) liabilities that may

13
AF-1

its individual capacity to perform any covenant made in its individual
capacity) in Section 6.03, or in any of the Operative Documents to which the
Owner Trustee is a party, and (v) taxes, fees or other charges on, based on or
measured by any fees, commissions or other compensation received by the Owner
Trustee as compensation for its services rendered as the Owner Trustee;
provided, however, that the failure to act or perform in the absence of
instructions after the Owner Trustee has requested instructions from the Owner
Participant pursuant to the last sentence of Section 5.02 shall not constitute
willful misconduct or gross negligence for purposes of clause (i) of this
Section 6.01.

Section 6.02. Absence of Certain Duties. Except in
accordance with written instructions furnished pursuant to Section 5.01, 5.02
and except as provided in, and without limiting the generality of, Section 5.04
and the last sentence of Section 9.01(b), the Owner Trustee shall have no duty
(i) to see to any registration of the Aircraft or any recording or filing of
the Lease, this Trust Agreement, the Trust Indenture or of any supplement to
any thereof or to see to the maintenance of any such registration, rerecording
or refiling, except that the Owner Trustee shall notify the Federal Aviation
Administration of changes in its mailing address pursuant to 14 C.F.R. Section
47.45 and the Owner Trustee shall (x) take such other action as may be required
of the Owner Trustee to maintain the registration of the Aircraft in the name
of the Owner Trustee under the Federal Aviation Act or, to the extent the
Aircraft is registered in a country other than the United States pursuant to
Section 7 of the Lease, other applicable law and (y) to the extent that
information for that purpose is supplied by Lessee pursuant to any of the
Operative Documents, complete and timely submit any and all reports relating to
the Aircraft which may from time to time be required by the Federal Aviation
Administration or any government or governmental authority having jurisdiction,
(ii) to see to any insurance on the Aircraft or to effect or maintain any such
insurance, whether or not Lessee shall be in default with respect thereto,
other than to forward to the Owner Participant copies of all reports and other
information which the Owner Trustee receives from Lessee pursuant to Section 11
of the Lease, (iii) to see to the payment or

14
AF-1
<PAGE> 19
discharge of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge or any lien or
encumbrance of any kind owing with respect to, assessed or levied against any
part of the Trust Estate except as provided by Section 9(c) of the
Participation Agreement and Section 4.01 of the Trust Indenture, (iv) to
confirm or verify any financial statements of Lessee or (v) to inspect the
Aircraft or Lessee's books and records with respect to the Aircraft.

Section 6.03. No Representations or Warranties as to
Certain Matters. THE OWNER TRUSTEE IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY OR AS THE OWNER
TRUSTEE DOES NOT MAKE AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE (a) ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE TITLE, AIRWORTHINESS,
VALUE, CONDITION, WORKMANSHIP, DESIGN, OPERATION, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR USE FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE AIRCRAFT OR ANY ENGINE THEREOF, AS TO
THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS (WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE), AS TO THE
ABSENCE OF ANY INFRINGEMENT OF ANY PATENT, TRADEMARK OR COPYRIGHT, AS TO THE
ABSENCE OF OBLIGATIONS BASED ON STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT, OR ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE AIRCRAFT OR ANY ENGINE
WHATSOEVER, except that the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity warrants
that on the Delivery Date the Owner Trustee has received whatever title to the
Aircraft was conveyed to it by Lessee and shall be in compliance with the last
sentence of Section 5.04 hereof and that the Aircraft shall during the Term be
free of Lessor's Liens attributable to it in its individual capacity, or (b)
any representation or warranty as to the validity, legality or enforceability
of this Trust Agreement or any other Operative Document to which the Owner
Trustee is a party, or any other document or instrument, or as to the
correctness of any statement contained in any thereof except to the extent that
any such statement is expressly made herein or therein as a representation by
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity and except that the Owner Trustee
in its individual capacity hereby represents and warrants that this Trust
Agreement has been, and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
of this Trust Agreement by the Owner Participant) the Operative Documents to
which the Owner Trustee is a party have been (or at the time of execution and
delivery of any such instrument by the Owner Trustee hereunder or pursuant to
the terms of the Participation Agreement that such an instrument will be) duly
executed and delivered by one of its officers who is or will be, as the case
may be, duly authorized to execute

15
AF-1
<PAGE> 20
and deliver such instruments on behalf of the Owner Trustee and that this Trust
Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the institution
acting as the Owner Trustee and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of such institution enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except as such terms may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally and by general principles of equity.

Section 6.04. No Segregation of Monies Required;
Investment Thereof. Monies received by the Owner Trustee hereunder need not be
segregated in any manner except to the extent required by law, and may be
deposited under such general conditions as may be prescribed by law, and shall
be invested as provided in Section 4.02 hereof or Section 25 of the Lease.

Section 6.05. Reliance Upon Certificates, Counsel and
Agents. The Owner Trustee shall incur no liability to anyone in acting in
reliance upon any signature, instrument, notice, resolution, request, consent,
order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other document or paper reasonably
believed by it to be genuine and reasonably believed by it to be signed by the
proper party or parties. Unless other evidence in respect thereof is
specifically prescribed herein, any request, direction, order or demand of the
Owner Participant, Lessee or the Indenture Trustee mentioned herein or in any
of the other Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party shall be
sufficiently evidenced by written instruments signed by a person purporting to
be an officer of the Owner Participant, Lessee or the Indenture Trustee, as the
case may be. The Owner Trustee may accept a copy of a resolution of the Board
of Directors of Lessee or the Owner Participant, as the case may be, certified
by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of Lessee, the Owner Participant or
the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, as duly adopted and in full force
and effect, as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted
by said Board and that the same is in full force and effect. As to any fact or
matter the manner of ascertainment of which is not specifically described
herein, the Owner Trustee may for all purposes hereof rely on a certificate
signed by an officer of Lessee or the Owner Participant or the Indenture
Trustee, as the case may be, as to such fact or matter, and such certificate
shall constitute full protection to the Owner Trustee for any

16
AF-1
<PAGE> 21
action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in reliance thereon.

Section 6.06. Not Acting in Individual Capacity. In
acting hereunder, the Owner Trustee acts solely as trustee and not in its
individual capacity except as otherwise expressly provided herein; and, except
as may be otherwise expressly provided in this Trust Agreement, the Lease, the
Participation Agreement or the Trust Indenture, all persons having any claim
against the Owner Trustee by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall look only to the Trust Estate for payment or satisfaction thereof.

Section 6.07. Fees; Compensation. Except as provided in
Section 4.01(b), 5.03, 6.08 or 7.01, the Owner Trustee agrees that it shall
have no right against the Owner Participant or (subject to the provisions of
the Trust Indenture) the Trust Estate for any fee as compensation for its
services hereunder.

Section 6.08. Tax Returns. The Owner Trustee shall be
responsible for the keeping of all appropriate books and records relating to
the receipt and disbursement by it of all monies under this Trust Agreement or
any agreement contemplated hereby. The Owner Participant shall be responsible
for causing to be prepared and filed, at its expense, all income tax returns
required to be filed by the Owner Participant. The Owner Trustee shall be
responsible for causing to be prepared, at the request of the Owner
Participant, all income tax returns required to be filed with respect to the
trust created hereby and shall execute and file such returns. The Owner
Participant, upon request, will furnish the Owner Trustee with all such
information as may be reasonably required from the Owner Participant in
connection with the preparation of such income tax returns.

INDEMNIFICATION OF THE OWNER TRUSTEE
BY THE OWNER PARTICIPANT

Owner Trustee. The Owner Participant hereby agrees, whether or not any of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, to assume liability

17
AF-1
<PAGE> 22
for, and does hereby indemnify, protect, save and keep harmless the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity, and its successors, assigns, legal
representatives, agents and servants, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, taxes (excluding any taxes payable by
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity on or measured by any compensation
received by the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity for its services
hereunder), claims, actions or suits or reasonable costs, expenses or
disbursements (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and
expenses) of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity (whether or
not also indemnified against by Lessee under the Lease or under the
Participation Agreement or also indemnified against by the Manufacturer or any
other Person) in any way relating to or arising out of this Trust Agreement or
any of the Operative Documents or the enforcement of any of the terms of any
thereof, or in any way relating to or arising out of the manufacture, purchase,
acceptance, rejection, ownership, delivery, lease, possession, use, operation,
condition, sale, return or other disposition of the Aircraft or any Engine
(including, without limitation, latent and other defects, whether or not
discoverable, and any claim for patent, trademark or copyright infringement),
or in any way relating to or arising out of the administration of the Trust
Estate or the action or inaction of the Owner Trustee hereunder, except (a) in
the case of willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Owner
Trustee either as trustee or in its individual capacity in the performance or
nonperformance of its duties hereunder or (b) those resulting from the
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity (or from the failure of the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity to perform any covenant) in Section 6.03, or in any of the Operative
Documents, or (c) those arising or resulting from any of the matters described
in the last sentence of Section 6.01, or (d) those resulting from its failure
to perform the terms of the last sentence of Section 5.04 hereof or from the
failure to use ordinary care in the receipt and disbursement of funds. The
indemnities contained in this Section 7.01 extend to the Owner Trustee only in
its individual capacity and shall not be construed as indemnities of the
Indenture Estate or the Trust Estate (except to the extent, if any, that the
Owner Trustee has been reimbursed by Lessee pursuant to the Lease for amounts
covered by the indemnities contained in

18
AF-1
<PAGE> 23
this Section 7.01). The indemnities contained in this Section 7.01 shall
survive the termination of this Trust Agreement. In addition, if necessary,
the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification from the Trust Estate,
subject however to the provisions of Section 4.01 hereof and the lien created
under the Trust Indenture, for any liability, obligation, loss, damage,
penalty, tax, claim, action, suit, cost, expense or disbursement indemnified
against pursuant to this Section 7.01 to the extent not reimbursed by Lessee,
the Owner Participant or others, but without releasing any of them from their
respective agreements of reimbursement; and to secure the same the Owner
Trustee shall have a lien on the Trust Estate, subject however to the
provisions of Section 4.01 hereof and the lien created under the Trust
Indenture, which lien of the Owner Trustee shall be prior to any interest
therein of the Owner Participant.

ARTICLE VIII

Section 8.01. Transfer of Interest. All provisions of
Section 16(c) of the Participation Agreement shall (with the same force and
effect as if set forth in full, mutatis mutandis, in this Section 8.01) be
applicable to any assignment, conveyance or other transfer by the Owner
Participant of its right, title or interest in and to this Trust Agreement or
any of the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party or any
proceeds therefrom.

ARTICLE IX

SUCCESSOR OWNER TRUSTEES; CO-TRUSTEES

Section 9.01. Resignation of the Owner Trustee;
Appointment of Successor. (a) Resignation or Removal. The Owner Trustee or
any successor Owner Trustee may resign at any time without cause by giving at
least 60 days' prior written notice to the Owner Participant, the Indenture
Trustee and Lessee, such resignation to be effective upon the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Owner Trustee under Section 9.01(b). In addition,
subject to Section 9(d) of the Participation Agreement, the Owner Participant
may at any time remove the Owner

19
AF-1
<PAGE> 24
Trustee without cause by a notice in writing delivered to the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee and Lessee, such removal to be effective upon the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Owner Trustee under Section 9.01(b).
In the case of the resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee, subject to
Section 9(d) of the Participation Agreement, the Owner Participant may appoint
a successor Owner Trustee by an instrument in writing signed by the Owner
Participant. If a successor Owner Trustee shall not have been appointed within
30 days after such notice of resignation or removal, the Owner Trustee, Lessee
or the Indenture Trustee may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint a successor Owner Trustee to act until such time, if any, as a
successor shall have been appointed as above provided. Any successor Owner
Trustee so appointed by such court shall immediately and without further act be
superseded by any successor Owner Trustee appointed as above provided within
one year from the date of the appointment by such court.

(b) Execution and Delivery of Documents, etc. Any
successor Owner Trustee, however appointed, shall execute and deliver to the
predecessor Owner Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and
thereupon such successor Owner Trustee, without further act, shall become
vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and trusts of
the predecessor Owner Trustee in the trusts hereunder with like effect as if
originally named the Owner Trustee herein; but nevertheless, upon the written
request of such successor Owner Trustee, such predecessor Owner Trustee shall
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Owner Trustee,
upon the trusts herein expressed, all the estates, properties, rights, powers
and trusts of such predecessor Owner Trustee, and such predecessor Owner
Trustee shall duly assign, transfer, deliver and pay over to such successor
Owner Trustee all monies or other property then held by such predecessor Owner
Trustee upon the trusts herein expressed. Upon the appointment of any
successor Owner Trustee hereunder, the predecessor Owner Trustee will complete,
execute and deliver to the successor Trustee such documents as are necessary to
cause registration of the Aircraft included in the Trust Estate to be
transferred upon the records of the Federal Aviation Administration, or other
governmental authority having jurisdiction, into the name of the successor
Owner Trustee.

20
AF-1
<PAGE> 25
(c) Qualification. Any successor Owner Trustee, however
appointed, shall be a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning of
Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act, and shall also be a bank or trust
company organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 (or having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $25,000,000 and the obligations of
which are guaranteed by a corporation or a bank or trust company having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000), if there be such an
institution willing, able and legally qualified to perform the duties of the
Owner Trustee hereunder upon reasonable and customary terms.

(d) Merger, etc. Any corporation into which the Owner
Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Owner Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all
the corporate trust business of the Owner Trustee may be transferred, shall,
subject to the terms of Section 9.01(c), be the Owner Trustee hereunder without
further act.

Section 9.02. Co-Trustees and Separate Trustees. If at
any time or times it shall be necessary or prudent in order to conform to any
applicable law of any jurisdiction in which all or any part of the Trust Estate
is located, or the Owner Trustee shall be advised by counsel that it is so
necessary or prudent in the interest of the Owner Participant or the Owner
Trustee, or the Owner Trustee shall have been directed to do so by the Owner
Participant, the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant shall, subject to
Section 9(d) of the Participation Agreement, execute and deliver an agreement
supplemental hereto and all other instruments and agreements necessary or
proper to constitute another bank or trust company or one or more persons (any
and all of which shall be a "citizen of the United States" as defined in
Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act) approved by the Owner Trustee,
Lessee and the Owner Participant, either to act as co-trustee or co-trustees,
jointly with the Owner Trustee, or to act as separate trustee or trustees
hereunder (any such co-trustee or separate trustee being herein sometimes
referred to as an "additional trustee"). In the event (i) the Owner
Participant shall not have joined in the execution of such agreements
supplemental hereto within

21
AF-1
<PAGE> 26
ten days after the receipt of a written request from the Owner Trustee so to
do, or (ii) a Lease Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Owner
Trustee may act under the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.02 without the
concurrence of the Owner Participant; and the Owner Participant hereby appoints
the Owner Trustee its agent and attorney-in-fact to act for it under the
foregoing provisions of this Section 9.02 in either of such contingencies.

Every additional trustee hereunder shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be appointed and act, and the Owner Trustee and its
successors shall act, subject to the following provisions and conditions:

(A) all powers, duties, obligations and rights conferred
upon the Owner Trustee in respect of the custody, control and
management of monies, the Aircraft or documents authorized to be
delivered hereunder shall be exercised solely by the corporation
designated as the Owner Trustee in the first paragraph of this
Trust Agreement, or its successors as the Owner Trustee
hereunder;

(B) all other rights, powers, duties and obligations
conferred or imposed upon the Owner Trustee shall be conferred or
imposed upon and exercised or performed by the corporation
designated as the Owner Trustee in the first paragraph of this
Trust Agreement or its successor as the Owner Trustee, and such
additional trustee or trustees jointly, except to the extent that
under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or
acts are to be performed (including the holding of title to the
Trust Estate), the Owner Trustee shall be incompetent or
unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such
rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and
performed by such additional trustee or trustees;

(C) no power given to, or which it is provided hereby
may be exercised by, any such additional trustee or trustees
shall be exercised hereunder by such additional trustee or
trustees, except jointly with, or with the consent in writing of,
the corporation designated as the Owner Trustee in this Trust
Agreement or its successor as the Owner Trustee,

22
AF-1
<PAGE> 27
anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding;

(D) no trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by
reason of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder;

(E) subject to Section 9(d) of the Participation
Agreement, the Owner Participant, at any time, by an instrument
in writing may remove any such additional trustee. In the event
that the Owner Participant shall not have joined in the execution
of any such instrument within ten days after the receipt of a
written request from the Owner Trustee so to do, the Owner
Trustee shall have the power to remove any such additional
trustee without the concurrence of the Owner Participant; and the
Owner Participant hereby appoints the Owner Trustee its agent and
attorney-in-fact to act for it in such connection in such
contingency; and

(F) no appointing of, or action by, any additional
trustee will relieve the Owner Trustee of any of its obligations

AF-2
<PAGE> 15
the Owner Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of a Lease Event of
Default or an Indenture Event of Default or an event that, with the passage of
time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a Lease Event of Default

unless the Owner Trustee shall have been indemnified by the Owner Participant,
in manner and form satisfactory to the Owner Trustee, against any liability,
cost or expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements) which may
be incurred in connection therewith; and, if the Owner Participant shall have
directed the Owner Trustee to take or refrain from taking any such action, the
Owner Participant agrees to furnish such indemnity as shall be required and, in
addition (to the extent not otherwise paid pursuant to the Participation
Agreement or the Lease), to pay the reasonable fees and charges of the Owner
Trustee for the services performed or to be performed by it pursuant to such
direction. The Owner Trustee shall not be required to take any action under
Section 5.01 or 5.02 if the Owner Trustee shall reasonably determine, or shall
have been advised by counsel, that such action is contrary to the terms of any
of the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party, or is
otherwise contrary to law.

by the terms of any of the Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a
party, or (to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Trust
Indenture) as expressly provided by the terms hereof or in written instructions
from the Owner Participant received pursuant to the terms of Section 5.01 or
5.02, and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Trust
Agreement against the Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee nevertheless agrees
that it will, in its individual capacity and at its own cost and expense (but
without any right of indemnity in respect of any such cost or expense under
Section 7.01) promptly take such action as may be necessary duly to discharge
and satisfy in full (i) all Lessor's Liens attributable to the Owner Trustee in
its individual capacity, (ii) any Liens (other than Lessor's Liens attributable
to it in its individual capacity) created as a result of its breach of

12
AF-2
<PAGE> 17
any of its obligations under this Trust Agreement (subject to the limitations
on the liability of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity set forth in
Section 6.01) on any part of the Trust Estate, or on any properties of the
Owner Trustee assigned, pledged or mortgaged as part of the Trust Estate, which
arise from acts of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, except the
lien created under the Trust Indenture, the rights of Lessee under the Lease
and the rights of the Owner Participant hereunder, and (iii) any other liens or
encumbrances attributable to the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity on
any part of the Trust Estate which result from claims against the Owner Trustee
in its individual capacity unrelated to the ownership of the Aircraft, the
administration of the Trust Estate or the transactions contemplated by the
Operative Documents.

Section 5.05. No Action Except Under Specified Documents
or Instructions. The Owner Trustee shall have no power or authority to, and
the Owner Trustee agrees that it will not, manage, control, use, sell, dispose

Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the institution
acting as the Owner Trustee and constitutes the legal, valid and binding

reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally and by general principles of equity.

reliance upon any signature, instrument, notice, resolution, request, consent,
order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other document or paper reasonably

proper party or parties. Unless other evidence in respect thereof is

of the other Operative Documents to which the Owner Trustee is a party shall be
sufficiently evidenced by written instruments signed by a person purporting to
be an officer of the Owner Participant, Lessee or the Indenture Trustee, as the

of Directors of Lessee or the Owner Participant, as the case may be, certified

matter the manner of ascertainment of which is not specifically described
herein, the Owner Trustee may for all purposes hereof rely on a certificate
signed by an officer of Lessee or the Owner Participant or the Indenture
Trustee, as the case may be, as to such fact or matter, and such certificate
shall constitute full protection to the Owner Trustee for any

16

individual capacity except as otherwise expressly provided herein; and, except
as may be otherwise expressly provided in this Trust Agreement, the Lease, the
Participation Agreement or the Trust Indenture, all persons having any claim
against the Owner Trustee by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall look only to the Trust Estate for payment or satisfaction thereof.

Section 4.01(b), 5.03, 6.08 or 7.01, the Owner Trustee agrees that it shall
have no right against the Owner Participant or (subject to the provisions of
the Trust Indenture) the Trust Estate for any fee as compensation for its
services hereunder.

Section 6.08. Tax Returns. The Owner Trustee shall be
responsible for the keeping of all appropriate books and records relating to
the receipt and disbursement by it of all monies under this Trust Agreement or

required to be filed by the Owner Participant. The Owner Trustee shall be
responsible for causing to be prepared, at the request of the Owner
Participant, all income tax returns required to be filed with respect to the

Trustee in its individual capacity, and its successors, assigns, legal
representatives, agents and servants, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, taxes (excluding any taxes payable by

received by the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity for its services
hereunder), claims, actions or suits or reasonable costs, expenses or

by or asserted against the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity (whether or
not also indemnified against by Lessee under the Lease or under the
Participation Agreement or also indemnified against by the Manufacturer or any
other Person) in any way relating to or arising out of this Trust Agreement or
any of the Operative Documents or the enforcement of any of the terms of any
thereof, or in any way relating to or arising out of the manufacture, purchase,
acceptance, rejection, ownership, delivery, lease, possession, use, operation,
condition, sale, return or other disposition of the Aircraft or any Engine
(including, without limitation, latent and other defects, whether or not
discoverable, and any claim for patent, trademark or copyright infringement),
or in any way relating to or arising out of the administration of the Trust
Estate or the action or inaction of the Owner Trustee hereunder, except (a) in
the case of willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Owner
Trustee either as trustee or in its individual capacity in the performance or
nonperformance of its duties hereunder or (b) those resulting from the

Owner Trustee has been reimbursed by Lessee pursuant to the Lease for amounts
covered by the indemnities contained in

18
AF-2
<PAGE> 23
this Section 7.01). The indemnities contained in this Section 7.01 shall
survive the termination of this Trust Agreement. In addition, if necessary,
the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification from the Trust Estate,
subject however to the provisions of Section 4.01 hereof and the lien created
under the Trust Indenture, for any liability, obligation, loss, damage,
penalty, tax, claim, action, suit, cost, expense or disbursement indemnified
against pursuant to this Section 7.01 to the extent not reimbursed by Lessee,
the Owner Participant or others, but without releasing any of them from their
respective agreements of reimbursement; and to secure the same the Owner
Trustee shall have a lien on the Trust Estate, subject however to the
provisions of Section 4.01 hereof and the lien created under the Trust
Indenture, which lien of the Owner Trustee shall be prior to any interest
therein of the Owner Participant.

19

<PAGE> 24
Trustee without cause by a notice in writing delivered to the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee and Lessee, such removal to be effective upon the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Owner Trustee under Section 9.01(b).
In the case of the resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee, subject to
Section 9(d) of the Participation Agreement, the Owner Participant may appoint
a successor Owner Trustee by an instrument in writing signed by the Owner
Participant. If a successor Owner Trustee shall not have been appointed within
30 days after such notice of resignation or removal, the Owner Trustee, Lessee
or the Indenture Trustee may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint a successor Owner Trustee to act until such time, if any, as a
successor shall have been appointed as above provided. Any successor Owner
Trustee so appointed by such court shall immediately and without further act be
superseded by any successor Owner Trustee appointed as above provided within
one year from the date of the appointment by such court.

(b) Execution and Delivery of Documents, etc. Any
successor Owner Trustee, however appointed, shall execute and deliver to the
predecessor Owner Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and
thereupon such successor Owner Trustee, without further act, shall become
vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and trusts of
the predecessor Owner Trustee in the trusts hereunder with like effect as if
originally named the Owner Trustee herein; but nevertheless, upon the written
request of such successor Owner Trustee, such predecessor Owner Trustee shall
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Owner Trustee,
upon the trusts herein expressed, all the estates, properties, rights, powers
and trusts of such predecessor Owner Trustee, and such predecessor Owner
Trustee shall duly assign, transfer, deliver and pay over to such successor
Owner Trustee all monies or other property then held by such predecessor Owner
Trustee upon the trusts herein expressed. Upon the appointment of any
successor Owner Trustee hereunder, the predecessor Owner Trustee will complete,
execute and deliver to the successor Trustee such documents as are necessary to
cause registration of the Aircraft included in the Trust Estate to be
transferred upon the records of the Federal Aviation Administration, or other
governmental authority having jurisdiction, into the name of the successor
Owner Trustee.

20
AF-2
<PAGE> 25
(c) Qualification. Any successor Owner Trustee, however
appointed, shall be a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning of

company organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 (or having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $25,000,000 and the obligations of

combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000), if there be such an
institution willing, able and legally qualified to perform the duties of the
Owner Trustee hereunder upon reasonable and customary terms.

(d) Merger, etc. Any corporation into which the Owner
Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Owner Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all
the corporate trust business of the Owner Trustee may be transferred, shall,
subject to the terms of Section 9.01(c), be the Owner Trustee hereunder without
further act.

Section 9.02. Co-Trustees and Separate Trustees. If at
any time or times it shall be necessary or prudent in order to conform to any
applicable law of any jurisdiction in which all or any part of the Trust Estate
is located, or the Owner Trustee shall be advised by counsel that it is so
necessary or prudent in the interest of the Owner Participant or the Owner
Trustee, or the Owner Trustee shall have been directed to do so by the Owner
Participant, the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant shall, subject to
Section 9(d) of the Participation Agreement, execute and deliver an agreement
supplemental hereto and all other instruments and agreements necessary or
proper to constitute another bank or trust company or one or more persons (any
and all of which shall be a "citizen of the United States" as defined in
Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act) approved by the Owner Trustee,
Lessee and the Owner Participant, either to act as co-trustee or co-trustees,
jointly with the Owner Trustee, or to act as separate trustee or trustees
hereunder (any such co-trustee or separate trustee being herein sometimes
referred to as an "additional trustee"). In the event (i) the Owner
Participant shall not have joined in the execution of such agreements
supplemental hereto within

21

do, or (ii) a Lease Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Owner
Trustee may act under the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.02 without the
concurrence of the Owner Participant; and the Owner Participant hereby appoints
the Owner Trustee its agent and attorney-in-fact to act for it under the
foregoing provisions of this Section 9.02 in either of such contingencies.

permitted by law, be appointed and act, and the Owner Trustee and its
successors shall act, subject to the following provisions and conditions:

(A) all powers, duties, obligations and rights conferred
upon the Owner Trustee in respect of the custody, control and
management of monies, the Aircraft or documents authorized to be
delivered hereunder shall be exercised solely by the corporation
designated as the Owner Trustee in the first paragraph of this
Trust Agreement, or its successors as the Owner Trustee
hereunder;

(B) all other rights, powers, duties and obligations
conferred or imposed upon the Owner Trustee shall be conferred or
imposed upon and exercised or performed by the corporation
designated as the Owner Trustee in the first paragraph of this
Trust Agreement or its successor as the Owner Trustee, and such
additional trustee or trustees jointly, except to the extent that
under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or
acts are to be performed (including the holding of title to the
Trust Estate), the Owner Trustee shall be incompetent or
unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such
rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and
performed by such additional trustee or trustees;

(C) no power given to, or which it is provided hereby may
be exercised by, any such additional trustee or trustees shall be
exercised hereunder by such additional trustee or trustees,
except jointly with, or with the consent in writing of, the
corporation designated as the Owner Trustee in this Trust
Agreement or its successor as the Owner Trustee,

22
AF-2
<PAGE> 27
anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding;

(D) no trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by
reason of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder;

Agreement, the Owner Participant, at any time, by an instrument
in writing may remove any such additional trustee. In the event
that the Owner Participant shall not have joined in the execution
of any such instrument within ten days after the receipt of a
written request from the Owner Trustee so to do, the Owner
Trustee shall have the power to remove any such additional
trustee without the concurrence of the Owner Participant; and the
Owner Participant hereby appoints the Owner Trustee its agent and
attorney-in-fact to act for it in such connection in such
contingency; and

(F) no appointing of, or action by, any additional trustee
will relieve the Owner Trustee of any of its obligations under,
or otherwise affect any of the terms of the Trust Indenture or
affect the interests of the Indenture Trustee or the holders of
the Certificates in the Trust Estate.

the Term or any Renewal Term then in effect, provided that if at the end of the
Extension Period the Aircraft cannot be returned subject to the same terms and
conditions as required at the end of the Term, such inability on such date
shall constitute an Event of Loss, (y) by a Government (other than the
government of the United States) which shall not have resulted in a loss of
possession of the Aircraft for a period extending beyond the end of the Term or
any Renewal Term then in effect or (z) by the

4

of such government, which shall not have resulted in a loss of possession of
the Aircraft for a period in excess of 180 consecutive days, or, if earlier,
for a period extending beyond the end of the Term or any Renewal Term then in
effect); (iv) as a result of any rule, regulation, order or other action by the

of registry having jurisdiction, the use of such property in the normal course
of air transportation of persons shall have been prohibited for a period of six
consecutive months (or, if earlier, for a period extending beyond the end of
the Term or any Renewal Term then in effect), unless Lessee, prior to the
expiration of such six-month period, shall have undertaken and shall be
diligently carrying forward all steps which are necessary or desirable to

shall have been prohibited for a period of twelve consecutive months (or, if
earlier, for a period extending beyond the end of the Term or any Renewal Term
then in effect); or (v) the operation or location of the Aircraft, while under
requisition for use by the Government or government of the country of registry
of the Aircraft, in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance policy in
effect with respect to the Aircraft required by the terms of Section 11, if
Lessee shall be unable to obtain indemnity in lieu thereof from such Government
or government; provided that if, prior to the earliest of the Loss Payment
Date, the date on which notice of payment of the Certificates is given pursuant
to Section 2.14 of the Trust Indenture, and the twenty-third anniversary of the
Base Lease Commencement Date, such property shall be returned to Lessee either
in the condition required by the terms hereof, or capable of being brought into
such condition, and if Lessee diligently proceeds to bring such property into
such condition, then such event shall, at the option of Lessee, not constitute
an Event of Loss, unless Lessee shall have failed to bring such property into
such condition by the 270th day following such return, whereupon such failure
to bring such property into such condition by such date shall constitute an
Event of Loss. An Event of Loss with respect to the Aircraft shall be deemed
to have occurred if an Event of Loss occurs with respect to the Airframe.

Portion (as defined in the next sentence) at the Base Rate for the period from

sentence, the term "Equity Portion" shall mean an amount equal to the excess of
the amount calculated pursuant to clause (i) of such preceding sentence over
the aggregate unpaid principal of, and the aggregate unpaid accrued interest
on, the outstanding Certificates as of such Termination Value Determination
Date (assuming that all scheduled payments of principal and interest have been
paid when due). The Termination Value Percentages set forth in Exhibit C to
the Rent Schedule have been computed on the assumption that each Certificate
will bear interest throughout the term at the Assumed Debt Rate for such
Certificate. To the extent that the aggregate amount of interest payable on
the Certificates from and including the Lease Period Date next preceding a
Termination Value Determination Date to but excluding such Termination Value
Determination Date is greater or less than the amount included in calculating
the Termination Value Percentage set forth in Exhibit C to the Rent Schedule

Lessor hereby agrees (subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Section 4 of the Participation Agreement) to accept delivery of the
Aircraft from Lessee under the Participation Agreement and simultaneously
therewith to lease to Lessee hereunder, and Lessee hereby agrees (subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 11 of the
Participation Agreement) to lease from Lessor hereunder, the Aircraft, as
evidenced by the execution by Lessor and Lessee of a Lease Supplement covering
the Aircraft. Lessor shall authorize one or more employees or agents of
Lessee, designated by Lessee, as the authorized representative or
representatives of Lessor to accept delivery of the Aircraft. Lessee hereby
agrees that such acceptance of delivery by such authorized representative or
representa- tives on behalf of Lessor shall, without further act, irrevocably
constitute acceptance by Lessee of the Aircraft for all purposes of this Lease.
Lessee hereby agrees to deliver the Aircraft within the United States to
Lessor, and Lessor hereby authorizes one or more employees or agents of Lessee,
designated by Lessee, as the authorized representative or representatives of
Lessor to ultimately deliver the Aircraft outside the United States within 1

to the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Base Lease Commencement Date.

(b) Basic Rent. Lessee hereby agrees to pay Lessor
Basic Rent for the Aircraft throughout the Term in consecutive semi-annual

Rent in respect of the Aircraft shall be an amount equal to the amount
determined by multiplying Lessor's Cost by the percentage set forth in Exhibit
A to the Rent Schedule for the applicable Lease Period Date, as adjusted
pursuant to the next paragraph.

Although the Basic Rent percentages set forth in
Exhibit A to the Rent Schedule have been computed on the assumption that each
Certificate will bear interest at the Assumed Debt Rate for such Certificate
throughout the Term, Lessor and Lessee recognize that the actual rate of
interest on each Certificate may be a rate from time to time which may be
greater or less than the Assumed Debt Rate for such Certificate and that the
related basis upon which interest on the Certificates will be computed will be
as provided in the Trust Indenture. Accordingly, each installment of Basic
Rent shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the Rent
Differential Amount (as defined herein). For purposes hereof, "Rent
Differential Amount" shall mean, as of any Lease Period Date on which Basic
Rent is payable with respect to the Term, the amount, if any, by which (i) the
aggregate amount of interest actually due and payable on such Lease Period Date
on the Certificates exceeds or is less than (ii) the aggregate amount of
interest on the Certificates that would have been due and payable on such Lease
Period Date if each Certificate had borne interest at the Assumed Debt Rate for
such Certificate for the period from and including the Lease Period Date next
preceding such Lease Period Date to but excluding such Lease Period Date. If,
as of any Lease Period Date on which Basic Rent is payable, the amount
determined in accordance with clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be greater or less than the amount determined in accordance with clause
(ii) of such sentence, the amount of Basic Rent payable on such Lease Period
Date shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the Rent
Differential Amount. Basic Rent payable hereunder shall also be increased by
an amount equal to the accrued interest, if any, referred to in the second
sentence of the second

20
<PAGE> 26
paragraph of the form of Certificate contained in Section 2.01 of the
Indenture.

Anything contained herein or in the Participation
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, each installment of Basic Rent (both
before and after any adjustment pursuant to Section 3(e), or any deduction
pursuant to Section 3(f)), together with any Advance or Deferred Equity Advance
made pursuant to Section 3(f) and any payment made by the Owner Participant
under Section 16(a) of the Participation Agreement, shall be, under any
circumstances and in any event, in an amount at least sufficient for Lessor to
pay in full as of the due date of such installment any payment of principal of
and interest on the Certificates required to be paid by Lessor pursuant to the
Trust Indenture on the due date of such installment of Basic Rent.

Basic Rent accrues or is earned with respect to each
Lease Period in accordance with Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule.

(c) Supplemental Rent. Lessee also agrees to pay
to Lessor, or to whomsoever shall be entitled thereto, any and all Supplemental
Rent promptly as the same shall become due and owing (and in any event, within
the relevant period as provided herein), and in the event of any failure on the
part of Lessee to pay any Supplemental Rent when due, Lessor shall have all
rights, powers and remedies provided for herein or by law or in equity or
otherwise in the case of nonpayment of Basic Rent. In addition, Lessee will
pay as Supplemental Rent (i) on demand, an amount equal to interest at the
Overdue Rate on any part of any installment of Basic Rent not paid when due for
any period for which the same shall be overdue and on any payment of
Supplemental Rent not paid when due for the period until the same shall be
paid, (ii) subject to the final sentence of this paragraph (c), if any Break
Amount is payable with respect to the Certificates pursuant to the Trust
Indenture, as and when the same is payable by Lessor under the Trust Indenture,
an amount equal to such Break Amount payable with respect to the Certificates
and (iii) as and when the same are payable by Lessor, any amounts payable by
the Lessor under Section 2.04 or 2.18 of the Trust Indenture, and all Supple-
mental Rent to be paid pursuant to this Section 3(c) shall be payable in the
type of funds and in the manner set forth in Section 3(d). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in any Operative Document or any other
document or instrument relating thereto, Lessee shall have no responsibility or

21
<PAGE> 27
liability for any amounts payable to any Holder of a Certificate in respect of
the Break Amount, if any, payable with respect to the Certificates of such
Holder as a result of (i) a purchase of the Certificates pursuant to Section
2.13 of the Trust Indenture, (ii) an Indenture Default that does not also
constitute an Event of Default or (iii) if an Indenture Default that is not an
Event of Default shall have occurred, any deemed withdrawal of an election to
purchase the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture
resulting from the curing of such Indenture Default.

(d) Payment to Lessor. All Rent shall be paid by
Lessee to Lessor at its office at 35 North Sixth Street, Reading, Pennsylvania
19601, Attn: Corporate Trust Administration (AA 1992 MF-1), in funds
consisting of lawful currency of the United States which shall be immediately
available at such office of Lessor not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the date of payment, provided that so long as the Trust Indenture
shall not have been discharged pursuant to the terms thereof, Lessor hereby
directs, and Lessee agrees, that all Rent (excluding Excepted Property) payable
to Lessor and assigned to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Trust Indenture
shall be paid directly to the Indenture Trustee at the times and in funds of
the type specified in this Section 3(d) at the offices of the Indenture Trustee
at 79 South Main Street, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, Attn: Corporate Trust
Department (AA 1992 MF-1) or at such other location in the United States as the
Indenture Trustee may otherwise direct. Payments in respect of Excepted
Property shall be paid in the lawful currency of the United States in
immediately available funds to the Person to whom payable at the payment
address of such Person as specified in Schedule I to the Participation
Agreement.

(e) Adjustments to Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss
Value and Termination Value. In the event that (i) Transaction Costs are other
than 1.0% of Lessor's Cost, or (ii) prior to the acceptance of the Aircraft on
the Delivery Date: (A) there shall have occurred a Tax Change and (B) after
having been advised in writing by the Owner Participant of such Tax Change and
the proposed adjustment to the payments of Basic Rent resulting therefrom,
Lessee shall have waived its right under Section 11 of the Participation
Agreement to decline to proceed with the transaction, or (iii) a refinancing or
refunding as contemplated by Section 17 or Section 20 of the Participation
Agreement

22
<PAGE> 28
occurs, or (iv) the Delivery Date is other than May 28, 1992, or (v) if the
Certificates are not refunded or refinanced on or prior to the Base Lease
Commencement Date, the Interim Payment Amount (after adjustment for any Interim
Payment Differential Amount) is other than $1,345,440.50, or (vi) any amount is
paid by Lessee to the Owner Participant pursuant to the Tax Indemnity
Agreement, or (vii) if the Certificates are not refunded or refinanced on or
prior to the Base Lease Commencement Date, any Deferred Equity Amount is other
than $3,275,000.00, then all payments of Basic Rent, Interim Payment Amount,
Deferred Equity Amount, Stipulated Loss Values, Termination Values and Special
Purchase Price Percentage (or, in the case of an event described in clause (vi)
above, payments of Stipulated Loss Values, Termination Values and Special
Purchase Price Percentage only) will, subject always to the penultimate
paragraph of Section 3(b), be adjusted (upwards or downwards, as the case may
be) in accordance with the provisions of Section 18 or Section 20, as
applicable, of the Participation Agreement. In addition, in the event of a
refunding or refinancing as contemplated by Section 17 or Section 20 of the
Participation Agreement, the Special Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated
in accordance with the provisions of Section 18 or Section 20, as applicable,
of the Participation Agreement.

(f) Certain Advances; Reimbursement Thereof. (i)
If and to the extent that the Indenture Trustee shall not have received by 1:00
p.m., New York City time, on or before the Base Lease Commencement Date the
amount payable by the Owner Participant pursuant to Section 16(a)(i) of the
Participation Agreement, Lessee shall advance to the Indenture Trustee on
behalf of the Owner Participant on the Base Lease Commencement Date an amount
equal to the Interim Payment Amount not so paid by the Owner Participant (the
amount of such advance being herein called the "Advance"). In the event Lessee
makes any Advance pursuant to this Section 3(f)(i) and is not reimbursed
therefor by the Owner Participant as provided in Section 16(a)(i) of the
Participation Agreement, Lessee shall be entitled to offset and deduct (without
duplication) against each succeeding payment (other than as limited by the
proviso to this sentence) due from Lessee to Persons other than the Loan
Participants, the Indenture Trustee and Lessor in its individual capacity
(including, without limitation, Basic Rent, payments due under Sections 5, 9,
10, 15 and 20 hereof, payments due under the Tax Indemnity Agreement and
payments due to Persons other than the Loan Participant, the Indenture

23
<PAGE> 29
Trustee and Lessor in its individual capacity under Section 7 of the
Participation Agreement) the amounts (including interest) due and owing by the
Owner Participant to Lessee from time to time under Section 16(a) of the
Participation Agreement until Lessee has been fully reimbursed for such amounts
(including interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% and the Base
Rate); provided that, in no event shall any such offset or aggregate combined
effect of separate offsets reduce the amount of any installment of Basic Rent
to an amount that is insufficient to pay in full the payments then required to
be made on account of the principal of and interest on the Certificates then
outstanding. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 3(f)(i) to the
contrary, Lessee's obligation to make the Advance shall terminate at such time
as its obligation to pay Basic Rent terminates under this Lease.

(ii) If and to the extent that the Indenture
Trustee shall not have received by 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on or before
the Base Lease Commencement Date the amount payable by the Owner Participant
pursuant to Section 16(a)(ii) of the Participation Agreement, Lessee shall
advance to the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Owner Participant on the Base
Lease Commencement Date an amount equal to the Deferred Equity Amount not so
paid by the Owner Participant (the amount of such advance being herein called
the "Deferred Equity Advance"). In the event Lessee makes any Deferred Equity
Advance pursuant to this Section 3(f)(ii) and is not reimbursed therefor by the
Owner Participant as provided in Section 16(a)(ii) of the Participation
Agreement, Lessee shall be entitled to offset and deduct (without duplication)
against each succeeding payment (other than as limited by the proviso to this
sentence) due from Lessee to Persons other than the Loan Participant, the
Indenture Trustee and Lessor in its individual capacity (including, without
limitation, Basic Rent, payments due under Sections 5, 9, 10, 15 and 20 hereof,
payments due under the Tax Indemnity Agreement and payments due to Persons
other than the Loan Participant, the Indenture Trustee and Lessor in its
individual capacity under Section 7 of the Participation Agreement) the amounts
(including interest) due and owing by the Owner Participant to Lessee from time
to time under Section 16(a)(ii) of the Participation Agreement until Lessee has
been fully reimbursed for such amounts (including interest at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of 2% and the Base Rate); provided that, in no event shall any
such offset or

24
<PAGE> 30
aggregate combined effect of separate offsets reduce the amount of any
installment of Basic Rent to an amount that is insufficient to pay in full the
payments then required to be made on account of the principal of and interest
on the Certificates then outstanding. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Section 3(f)(ii) to the contrary, Lessee's obligation to make the Deferred
Equity Advance shall terminate at such time as its obligation to pay Basic Rent
terminates under this Lease.

Section 4. Lessor's Representations, Warranties and
Covenants; Quiet Enjoyment. (a) Lessor's Representa- tions, Warranties and
Covenants. NEITHER LESSOR IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY OR AS OWNER TRUSTEE NOR
THE OWNER PARTICIPANT NOR ANY LOAN PARTICIPANT NOR THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE MAKES
OR SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE, AND EACH WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMED ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE TITLE,
AIRWORTHINESS, VALUE, CONDITION, WORKMANSHIP, DESIGN, OPERATION,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR USE FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE AIRCRAFT OR
ANY ENGINE OR ANY PART THEREOF, AS TO THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE, AS TO THE ABSENCE OF ANY INFRINGEMENT OF ANY
PATENT, TRADEMARK OR COPYRIGHT, AS TO THE ABSENCE OF OBLIGATIONS BASED ON
STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE AIRCRAFT OR ANY PART THEREOF, except
that Lessor in its individual capacity represents and warrants that on the
Delivery Date Lessor shall have received whatever rights, title and interests
in, to and under the Aircraft was conveyed to it by Lessee, and Lessor
represents, warrants and covenants in its individual capacity that the Aircraft
shall be free of Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the proviso to
the definition thereof) attributable to it in its individual capacity. Lessor
also represents and warrants in its individual capacity that it is, in its
individual capacity, a "citizen of the United States" as defined in Section
101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act.

(b) Quiet Enjoyment. Lessor covenants that, so
long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, it will not
take any action contrary to Lessee's rights under this Lease, or otherwise
interfere with or interrupt the quiet enjoyment of the use, operation and
possession of the Aircraft, the Airframe or any Engine by Lessee or any
sublessee, assignee or transferee under any sublease, assignment or transfer
then in effect and

25
<PAGE> 31
permitted by the terms of this Lease. Lessee agrees that it shall perform the
agreements, covenants and indemnities of Lessee set forth in the Participation
Agreement, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference with the same
force and effect as set forth herein in full.

Section 5. Return of Aircraft. (a) Return of 
Airframe and Engines. Upon the termination of this Lease at the end of the
Term, a Renewal Term or pursuant to or as specified in Section 5(e) or 9,
unless Lessee shall have exercised its option to purchase the Aircraft pursuant
to Section 9(e), 20(b) or 20(c), and, except as otherwise provided in Section
9(b), 9(e), 10(a), 10(d), 20(b) or 20(c), Lessee will return the Aircraft by
delivering the same, at its own expense (except as otherwise provided in this
Section 5(a) and Section 5(d)), (x) to any location designated by the Owner
Participant and reasonably satisfactory to Lessee, provided that if such
location is not on Lessee's route system, the Owner Participant shall be
responsible for Lessee's costs and expenses of fuel and crew and other flight
related costs in connection with such off-route delivery to the extent such
costs and expenses exceed the costs and expenses that would have been incurred
by Lessee in delivering the Aircraft to the location specified in this clause
(x), or (y) if Lessor has requested storage pursuant to Section 5(d), to the
location determined in accordance with Section 5(d), fully equipped with two
Engines (which may be Replacement Engines), or other General Electric
CF6-80C2B6 engines (or other General Electric engines of an improved model
suitable for installation and use on the Airframe and compatible for use on the
Airframe with the other Engine or engine being returned hereunder) owned by
Lessee, duly installed there- on. At the time of such return, (A) such
Airframe and Engines or engines (i) shall be, if the Aircraft is then
registered under the laws of the United States as provided in the final
sentence of this paragraph, duly certificated as an airworthy aircraft by the
Federal Aviation Administration or, if the Aircraft is not then registered
under the laws of the United States as so provided, shall be duly certificated
as an airworthy aircraft by the central civil aviation authority of the
jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is then registered, and, subject to such
sentence, in any case contemplated by the proviso to such sentence, shall be
eligible for cer- tification as an airworthy aircraft by the Federal Aviation
Administration, (ii) shall be free and clear of all Liens (other than Lessor's
Liens), (iii) shall be in as good an operating condition as when delivered to
Lessee

26
<PAGE> 32
hereunder, ordinary wear and tear excepted, or, in the case of any such engines
owned by Lessee, shall have a value and utility at least equal to, and shall be
in as good an operating condition as required by the terms hereof with respect
to, Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but not then installed on the
Airframe, (iv) shall have all Lessee's and any sublessee's exterior markings
removed or painted over with the areas thereof refinished to match adjacent
areas and (v) in the event that Lessee does not use a progressive maintenance
program with respect to the Airframe or a condition-monitored maintenance
program with respect to such Engines or engines, and Lessee adopts a block
overhaul program with respect to the Airframe or a hard time engine shop visit
or hard time module shop visit program with respect to such Engines or engines,
or both, the Airframe shall have remaining until the next scheduled block
overhaul at least 25% of the allowable hours between block overhauls permitted
under the block overhaul program then used by Lessee and the aggregate number
of hours of operation on all such Engines or engines remaining until the next
hard time engine shop visit or hard time module shop visit shall be at least
3,000 hours and (B) such Aircraft shall, except as otherwise provided herein,
be in a configuration suitable for commercial passenger service and shall be in
compliance with all mandatory environmental, noise, air pollution and other
standards prescribed by the Federal government of the United States and any
other jurisdiction whose standards are then applicable to the Aircraft,
provided that compliance with such foreign standards shall not be required to
the extent that it is not possible for Lessee to comply with such standards
because of a conflict with the applicable standards of the Federal Government
of the United States. In the event that Lessee has adopted a block overhaul
program with respect to the Airframe and does not meet the conditions set forth
in subclause (v) of clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence with
respect thereto, Lessee shall pay Lessor a dollar amount computed by
multiplying (i) 110% of Lessee's direct cost (during the preceding twelve
months) of such block overhaul by (ii) a fraction of which (x) the numerator
shall be the excess of 25% of the hours of operation between such block
overhauls over the actual number of hours of operation remaining on the
Airframe to the next block overhaul and (y) the denominator shall be the
aggregate number of hours allowable between block overhauls in accordance with
such block overhaul program. In the event that Lessee has adopted a hard time
engine shop visit or hard time module shop visit program with respect to such

27
<PAGE> 33
Engines or engines and Lessee does not meet the above conditions with respect
to such Engines or engines, Lessee shall pay Lessor a dollar amount computed by
multiplying (i) the product of (x) 110% of Lessee's direct cost (during the
preceding twelve months) of such hard time engine shop visit or hard time
module shop visit and (y) the number of Engines or engines returned by (ii) a
fraction of which (A) the numerator shall be the difference between 3,000 hours
in the aggregate for the Engines or engines on the Aircraft and the actual
aggregate number of hours of operation remaining to the next hard time engine
shop visit or hard time module shop visit for the Engines or engines on the
Aircraft and (B) the denominator shall be the aggregate number of hours
allowable between hard time engine shop visits or hard time module shop visits
for such Engines or engines. At the time of such return, Lessee will (unless
Lessor or the Owner Participant shall have requested Lessee at least 90 days
prior to such time of return, to retain the existing registration of the
Aircraft) cause the Aircraft if it is not then so registered, to be registered
under the laws of the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration in
the name of Lessor or its designee; provided that Lessee shall be relieved of
its obligation to cause such registration (but not its obligation to return the
Aircraft in such condition as would have made it eligible for certification as
an airworthy aircraft had the Aircraft in fact been registrable at the time)
under this sentence if (x) such registration is prohibited by reason of the
failure of Lessor, the Owner Participant or Lessor's designee to be eligible on
such date to own an aircraft registered with the Federal Aviation
Administration or (y) Lessee shall have provided to Lessor and the Owner
Participant an opinion of counsel experienced in matters pertaining to such
registration (which counsel may be special Oklahoma City counsel or other
counsel reasonably acceptable to Lessor) that in the opinion of such counsel,
such registration is prohibited by applicable law other than for the reason set
forth in clause (x) and that such prohibition does not result from an act of
failure to act on the part of Lessee or any sublessee of the Aircraft.

Any maintenance program used by Lessee for airframes
operated by Lessee (including the Airframe) substantially similar to the
maintenance program currently described in Lessee's FAA Part 121 Maintenance
Program shall be considered a progressive maintenance program (and not a block
overhaul program) and any engine maintenance program used by Lessee for engines
operated by Lessee (including the

28
<PAGE> 34
Engines) substantially similar to the program currently described in such FAA
Part 121 Maintenance Program shall be considered a condition monitored
maintenance program.

During the six months ending on the last day of the
regularly scheduled Term (unless Lessee shall have elected to purchase the
Aircraft or renew this Lease in accordance with the terms of this Lease), with
reasonable notice, Lessee will cooperate, and will in any sublease in effect at
such time require the sublessee to cooperate, at the Owner Participant's sole
cost, expense and risk, in all reasonable respects with the efforts of Lessor
to sell or lease the Aircraft, including without limitation, permitting
purchasers or lessees that have committed to purchase the Aircraft subject to
inspection and other customary closing conditions, to inspect the Aircraft, any
records relating to the Aircraft then required to be retained by the Federal
Aviation Administration or by the comparable government agency of the country
in which the Aircraft is then registered and/or under the laws of which the
Aircraft is then maintained and trend monitoring records such as flight
monitoring and engine control systems data, all in accordance with Section 12
hereof, provided that any such cooperation shall not interfere with the normal
operation or maintenance of the Aircraft by, or the business of, Lessee or any
sublessee.

(b) Return of Engines. In the event that any
engine not owned by Lessor shall be delivered with the Airframe as set forth in
paragraph (a) of this Section 5, Lessee, concurrently with such delivery, will,
at its own expense, furnish Lessor with a warranty (as to title) bill of sale
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor (which warranty shall
except Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the
definition thereof)) with respect to each such engine and with a written
opinion of Lessee's counsel (which may be Lessee's General Counsel) to the
effect that such bill of sale constitutes an effective instrument for the
conveyance of title to such engine to Lessor, and thereupon Lessor will
transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except as to the absence of
Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the definition
thereof)), all Lessor's right, title and interest in and to an Engine
constituting part of the Aircraft but not installed on the Airframe at the time
of the return of the Airframe.

29
<PAGE> 35
(c) Fuels; Manuals. Upon the return of the Airframe
pursuant to this Section 5, (i) Lessee shall have no obligation with respect to
the amount of fuel or oil contained in the Airframe and all fuel or oil
remaining on board the Airframe shall be the property of Lessor without charge
and (ii) Lessee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Lessor all logs,
manuals and data, and inspection, modification and overhaul records required to
be maintained with respect thereto under applicable rules and regulations of
the Federal Aviation Administration and, if the Aircraft has been registered
under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States, of the
applicable foreign governmental authority. All such logs, records, manuals and
data shall be in English.

(d) Storage upon Return. Upon written request of
Lessor received at least 30 days prior to the end of the Term, Lessee will
provide Lessor with storage facilities (x) free of charge except as provided
below for the Aircraft for a period not exceeding 30 days and (y) at the Owner
Participant's sole cost and expense for an additional period not to exceed 60
days after the initial 30 day period, at such location on Lessee's route system
as shall be designated within 15 days of such request by Lessee; provided that
the Owner Participant may request that the Aircraft be stored at any other
location on Lessee's route system used by Lessee for such purpose, in which
case Lessee may, in its sole discretion, provide such facilities for such
period; provided further that the risk of loss of the Aircraft and Lessee's
out-of-pocket costs in connection with providing such facilities (it being
understood that such out-of-pocket costs shall not be deemed to include the
cost of making the storage facilities available) and the cost of insurance
shall, in all cases, be for the account of the Owner Participant. In the event
the Owner Participant, after a storage location is determined as provided in
the first sentence of this Section 5(d), shall request Lessee to deliver the
Aircraft to a second location, Lessee will, at the Owner Participant's expense,
fly the Aircraft within such 30-day period to a reasonable location selected by
the Owner Participant, for storage at the risk and expense of the Owner
Participant, upon receipt of evidence of insurance coverage (reasonably
satisfactory to Lessee), provided that (i) Lessee shall not be required to
store the Air- craft at any location used by Lessee for storage of surplus
aircraft available for sale except as provided in the first sentence of this
Section 5(d) and (ii) the delivery by Lessee of the Aircraft to the first
location determined as provided in

30
<PAGE> 36
such sentence in the condition required by Section 5(a) shall constitute
delivery of the Aircraft as required by said Section 5(a). Lessor or the Owner
Participant, at its expense, may place such other insurance in such
circumstances on the Aircraft as it may deem appropriate.

(e) Delayed Return. (i) In the event that the use
of the Aircraft, Airframe or any Engine in the normal course of the business of
air transportation is prohibited on the last day of the Term or the date the
Aircraft is required to be redelivered pursuant to Section 9, Lessee shall not
be required to return such Aircraft to Lessor but may retain custody and
control of the Aircraft for a period not in excess of 30 days beyond the last
day of the Term or such date in order to attempt in a diligent manner to remedy
any condition prohibiting such use or (ii) in connection with any sublease of
the Aircraft by Lessee permitted under the terms of this Lease, Lessee may at
its option, upon written notice to Lessor given not less than 60 days prior to
the last day of the Term or such date, extend this Lease for a period not in
excess of 30 days beyond the last day of the Term in order to enable Lessee to
bring the Aircraft to the condition required under this Section 5 on its return
to Lessor; provided that in either case, Lessee shall pay to Lessor at monthly
intervals the daily equivalent of the average annual Basic Rent payable during
the Term (excluding the Interim Period) pursuant to the terms hereof for each
day of such period and, in addition, Lessee shall pay to Lessor, in the case of
clause (ii), damages incurred by Lessor as a result of the delayed return.

(f) Export Certificate of Airworthiness. Upon the
written request of Lessor received a sufficient time prior to the end of the
Term (and, in any event, not less than 60 days prior to the end of the Term),
Lessee will, unless it shall have exercised its option to purchase the Aircraft
under Section 9(e), 20(b) or 20(c), subject to the availability of maintenance
and other appropriate personnel and facilities, use its best efforts to obtain
or assist Lessor in obtaining an export certificate of airworthiness for the
Aircraft from the Federal Aviation Administration or, if the Aircraft is then
registered in any country other than the United States and the Lessor or the
Owner Participant shall have requested that Lessee retain the existing
registration of the Aircraft at the expiration of the Term in accordance with
Section 5(a), the corresponding authority in the country of registry of the
Aircraft; provided that (i) the Owner Participant shall reimburse

31
<PAGE> 37
Lessee for Lessee's costs in connection therewith, (ii) Lessee shall not be
under any obligation to maintain, service, repair, overhaul or test the
Aircraft, or otherwise to perform any work or services in respect of the
Aircraft, in connection therewith that is inconsistent with the maintenance
program then applicable to the Aircraft, (iii) Lessee shall not be under any
obligation to cause the Aircraft to satisfy the airworthiness or other relevant
requirements of any country other than the United States or such country of
registry in connection with the proposed export of the Aircraft, (iv) Lessee
shall not be required for such purpose to interfere with the use, operation or
maintenance of the Aircraft or the normal conduct of Lessee's business, and (v)
Lessee shall not be required to undertake or incur any additional liabilities
in connection therewith.

Section 6. Liens. Lessee will not directly or
indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on or with respect
to the Airframe or any Engine, title thereto or any interest therein or in this
Lease except (i) the respective rights of Lessor and Lessee as herein provided,
the Lien created under the Trust Indenture, the rights of Lessor under the
Purchase Agreement Assignment and the rights of the Owner Participant, the
Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Loan Participants under the Trust
Agreement, the Trust Indenture, and the Participation Agreement, (ii) the
rights of others under agreements or arrangements to the extent expressly
permitted by the terms of Sections 7(b) and 8(b), (iii) Lessor's Liens
(disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the definition thereof), Loan
Participant Liens and Trustee's Liens, (iv) Liens for Taxes either not yet due
or being contested in good faith (and for the payment of which adequate
reserves have been provided) by ap- propriate proceedings so long as such
proceedings do not involve any significant danger of the sale, forfeiture or
loss of the Airframe or any Engine or any interest therein, (v) materialmen's,
mechanics', workmen's, repairmen's, employees' or other like Liens arising in
the ordinary course of business for amounts the payment of which is either not
yet delinquent or is being contested in good faith (and for the payment of
which adequate reserves have been provided) by appropriate proceedings so long
as such proceedings do not involve any significant danger of the sale,
forfeiture or loss of the Airframe or any Engine or interest therein, (vi)
Liens arising out of judgments or awards against Lessee or any sublessee with
respect to which an appeal or proceeding for

32
<PAGE> 38
review is being prosecuted in good faith, so long as any such judgment or award
does not involve any significant risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the
Airframe or any Engine or any interest therein (unless Lessee or any sublessee
shall have provided a bond or other security in an amount and under terms
reasonably satisfactory to Lessor), and (vii) salvage or similar rights of
insurers under insurance policies maintained pursuant to Section 11. Lessee
will promptly, at its own expense, take such action as may be necessary duly to
discharge (by bonding or otherwise) any such Lien not excepted above if the
same shall arise at any time.

Section 7. Registration, Maintenance and Operation;
Possession; Insignia. (a) Registration, Maintenance and Operation. Lessee, at
its own cost and expense, shall:

(i) forthwith upon the delivery thereof to Lessor
on the Delivery Date, cause the Aircraft to be duly registered, and
at all times thereafter to remain duly registered, under the laws of
the United States, in the name of Lessor, as owner, except (x) as
otherwise required by the Federal Aviation Act, or (y) to the extent
that such regis- tration cannot be effected because of Lessor's or
the Owner Participant's failure to comply with the citizenship or
other eligibility requirements for registration of aircraft under
such Act; provided that Lessor shall execute and deliver all such
documents as Lessee shall reasonably request for the purpose of
effecting and continuing such registration. Not- withstanding the
preceding sentence, but subject to the conditions and requirements
of Sections 9(m) and 9(n) of the Participation Agreement, Lessee, at
no expense or liability to Lessor, the Owner Participant, any Loan
Participant or the Indenture Trustee, may cause the Aircraft to be
duly registered under the laws of any jurisdiction in the name of
Lessor or of any nominee of Lessor, or, if required by applicable
law, in the name of Lessee or any other Person, and Lessor will
cooperate with Lessee in effecting such foreign registration;

(ii) maintain, service, repair, overhaul and test
the Aircraft in accordance with a maintenance program (as approved
by the Federal Aviation Administration) for Boeing 767-323ER
aircraft and General Electric CF6-80C2B6 engines (or, at Lessee's
option, in accordance with the aircraft maintenance standards for
such

33
<PAGE> 39
aircraft and engines approved by the central civil aviation
authority of any of Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, France,
Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction
with aircraft maintenance standards that are, at the time that such
standards become applicable to the Aircraft, substantially similar
to those of the United States or substantially similar to those of
any of the foregoing countries on the Delivery Date) and in the same
manner and with the same care used by Lessee with respect to
comparable aircraft and engines owned or operated by Lessee and
utilized in similar circumstances so as to keep the Aircraft in as
good an operating condition as when delivered to Lessee hereunder,
ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in such condition as may be
necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of the Aircraft
to be maintained in good standing at all times (other than during
temporary periods of storage in accordance with applicable
regulations or during periods of grounding by applicable
governmental authorities) under the Federal Aviation Act or, if the
Aircraft is registered under the laws of any other jurisdiction, the
laws of such jurisdiction;

(iii) maintain all records, logs and other
materials in English and such other languages as are, from time to
time, required by the appropriate authorities in the jurisdiction
where the Aircraft is registered and maintained to be maintained in
respect of the Aircraft; and

(iv) promptly furnish to Lessor such information
as may be required to enable Lessor to file any reports, returns or
statements required to be filed by Lessor with any governmental
authority because of Lessor's or the Owner Participant's interest in
the Aircraft.

Lessee agrees that the Aircraft will not be
maintained, used or operated in violation of any law or any rule, regulation or
order of any government or governmental authority having jurisdiction (domestic
or foreign), or in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or
registration relating to the Aircraft issued by any such government or
authority; provided that Lessee shall not be in default under this sentence if
it is not possible for it to comply with the laws of a jurisdiction other than
the United States (or the jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is

34
<PAGE> 40
then registered) because of a conflict with the applicable laws of the United
States (or such jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is then registered). In the
event that any such law, rule, regulation or order requires alteration of the
Aircraft, Lessee will conform thereto or obtain conformance therewith at no
expense to Lessor and will maintain the Aircraft in proper operating condition
under such laws, rules, regulations and orders; provided, however, that Lessee
may, in good faith, contest the validity or ap- plication of any such law,
rule, regulation or order in any reasonable manner which does not materially
adversely affect Lessor or involve a significant risk of the imposition of
criminal liability on Lessor or the Owner Participant; and provided, further,
that no such contest shall continue beyond the end of the Term or any Renewal
Term. Lessee also agrees not to operate or locate the Aircraft, or suffer the
Aircraft to be operated or located, (i) in any area excluded from coverage by
any insurance required by the terms of Section 11, except in the case of a
requisition for use by any Government where Lessee obtains indemnity in lieu of
such insurance from such Government against the risks and in the amounts
required by Section 11 covering such area, or (ii) in any war zone or
recognized or, in Lessee's reasonable judgment, threatened area of hostilities
unless covered by war risk insurance of the type required to be maintained in
Section 11, or unless the Aircraft is operated or used under contract with any
Government, under which contract such Government assumes liability for any
damage, loss, destruction or failure to return possession of the Aircraft at
the end of the term of such contract and for injury to persons and damage to
property of others.

(b) Possession. Lessee will not, without the prior
written consent of Lessor, sublease or otherwise in any manner deliver,
transfer or relinquish possession of the Airframe or any Engine or install any
Engine, or permit any Engine to be installed, on any airframe other than the
Airframe; provided that, so long as no Event of Default (or, in the case of a
sublease described in clause (viii) or (ix) below, a Payment or Bankruptcy
Default) shall have occurred and be continuing, and so long as the action to be
taken shall not deprive the Indenture Trustee of the perfected Lien of the
Trust Indenture on the Airframe or (subject to subclause (B) of the "provided
further" clause to subsection (i) of this Section 7(b)) any Engine, and in any
event, so long as Lessee shall comply with the provisions of Section 11, Lessee
may, without the prior consent of Lessor:

35
<PAGE> 41
(i) subject the Airframe to normal interchange
agreements or any Engine to normal interchange or pooling agreements
or arrangements in each case customary in the airline industry and
entered into by Lessee in the ordinary course of its business with
any other United States air carrier as to which there is in force a
certificate issued pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal Aviation
Act or any successor provision that gives like authority, and as to
which there is in full force and effect an air carrier operating
certificate issued pursuant to Part 121 of the regulations under
such Act, or with any "foreign air carrier" (as such term is defined
in such Act) as to which there is in force a permit issued pursuant
to Section 402 of said Act and which is principally based in and a
domiciliary of either (A) a country listed in Exhibit B or B-1
hereto or (B) a country as to which Lessee has delivered an opinion
to the effect specified in clause (y) of paragraph (ix) of this
Section 7(b) with respect to such interchange agreement (mutatis
mutandis) with such foreign air carrier (any such United States
certificated air carrier and any such foreign air carrier being
hereinafter called a "Permitted Air Carrier"); provided that no
transfer of the registration of such Airframe shall be effected in
connection therewith; and provided further that (A) no such
agreement or arrangement contemplates, permits or requires or
results in the transfer of title to the Airframe and (B) if Lessor's
title to any such Engine shall be divested under any such agreement
or arrangement, such divestiture shall be deemed to be an Event of
Loss with respect to such Engine and Lessee shall comply with
Section 10(b) in respect thereof;

(ii) deliver possession of the Airframe or any
Engine to the manufacturer thereof for testing or other similar
purposes or to any organization for service, repair, maintenance or
overhaul work on the Airframe or such Engine or any part thereof or
for alterations or modifications in or additions to the Airframe or
such Engine to the extent required or permitted by the terms of
Section 7(a) or 8(c);

(iii) transfer possession of the Airframe or any
Engine to the United States or any instrumentality or agency thereof
pursuant to a sublease, contract or other instrument a copy of which
shall be furnished to Lessor and the Indenture Trustee; provided
that the

36
<PAGE> 42
term of such sublease (including, without limitation, any option of
the sublessee to renew or extend) or the term of possession under
such contract or other instrument shall not continue beyond the end
of the Term or any Renewal Term then in effect;

(iv) transfer possession of the Airframe or any
Engine to the United States or any instrumentality or agency thereof
in accordance with applicable laws, rulings, regulations or orders
(including, without limitation, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program
authorized under 10 U.S.C. Sec. 9511 et seq., or any substantially
similar program);

(v) install an Engine on an airframe owned by
Lessee free and clear of all Liens, except (A) those of the type
permitted under clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of
Section 6 and those which apply only to the engines (other than
Engines), appliances, parts, instruments, appurtenances,
accessories, furnishings and other equipment (other than Parts)
installed on such airframe (but not to the airframe as an entirety)
and (B) the rights of other Permitted Air Carriers under normal
interchange agreements which are customary in the airline industry
and do not contemplate, permit, require or result in the transfer of
title to the airframe or engines installed thereon;

(vi) install an Engine on an airframe leased to
Lessee or owned by Lessee subject to a conditional sale or other
security agreement; provided that (A) such airframe is free and
clear of all Liens except the rights of the parties to the lease or
conditional sale or other security agreement covering such airframe
and except Liens of the type permitted by clauses (A) and (B) of
subparagraph (v) of this paragraph of Section 7(b) and (B) Lessee
shall have obtained from the lessor or secured party of such
airframe a written agreement (which may be the lease or conditional
sale or other security agreement covering such airframe), in form
and substance satisfactory to Lessor (it being understood that an
agreement from such lessor or secured party substantially in the
form of the final sentence of the penultimate paragraph of this
Section 7(b) shall be deemed to be satisfactory to Lessor), whereby
such lessor or secured party expressly agrees that neither it nor
its successors or assigns will acquire or claim any right, title or
interest in

37
<PAGE> 43
any Engine by reason of such Engine being installed on such airframe
at any time while such Engine is subject to this Lease or to the
lien of the Trust Indenture;

(vii) install an Engine on an airframe owned by
Lessee, leased to Lessee or owned by Lessee subject to a conditional
sale or other security agreement under circumstances where neither
subparagraph (v) nor subparagraph (vi) of this Section 7(b) is
applicable; provided that such installation shall be deemed an Event
of Loss with respect to such Engine and Lessee shall comply with
Section 10(b) in respect thereof if such installation shall
adversely affect Lessor's interest in, or, so long as the lien of
the Trust Indenture has not been discharged, the Indenture Trustee's
interest in, such Engine, Lessor not intending hereby to waive any
right or interest it may have to or in such Engine under applicable
law until compliance by Lessee with such Section 10(b);

(viii) sublease any Engine or the Airframe and
Engines or engines then installed on the Airframe to any United
States air carrier as to which there is in force a certificate
issued pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act or
successor provision that gives like authority; provided that the
term of such sublease (including, without limitation, any option of
the sublessee to renew or extend) shall not continue beyond the end
of the Term or any Renewal Term then in effect, unless Lessee shall
have irrevocably agreed to purchase the Aircraft or renew this Lease
in accordance with the terms hereof at the end of the Term or such
Renewal Term, as the case may be, to a date beyond the end of the
term of such sublease (assuming that all options to renew or extend
such sublease will be exercised); and

(ix) sublease any Engine or the Airframe and
Engines or engines then installed on the Airframe to (A) any foreign
air carrier that is principally based in and a domiciliary of a
country that is listed in Exhibit B hereto, or (B) any foreign air
carrier that is principally based in and a domiciliary of a country
listed in Exhibit B-1 hereto, or (C) any foreign air carrier not
described in clause (A) or (B) above, provided that (x) if the Owner
Participant shall have delivered an opinion of counsel to the Owner
Participant licensed in any country listed in Exhibit B-1,

38
<PAGE> 44
such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to Lessee, to the effect
that an opinion as to the matters set forth in clause (y) below
cannot be rendered with respect to such country and the reasons
therefor, then such country shall be deemed deleted from Exhibit B-1
and (y) prior to any sublease to a foreign air carrier under clause
(C) above, Lessor shall have received an opinion of counsel to
Lessee licensed in the country in which the sublessee is domiciled
and principally based, such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to
the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee, to the effect that
(1) there exist no possessory rights in favor of the sublessee under
the laws of such sublessee's country which would, upon bankruptcy or
insolvency of or other default by Lessee and assuming that at such
time such sublessee is not insol- vent or bankrupt, prevent the
return of such Engine or the Airframe and such Engine or engine to
Lessor in accordance with and when permitted by the terms hereof
upon the exercise by Lessor of its remedies hereunder, (2) the
remedies provided in the sublease are enforceable in the country in
which such foreign air carrier is a domiciliary and prin- cipally
based, to substantially the same extent as such remedies would be
enforceable in the United States, and the sublease is subject and
subordinate to the Lease, (3) it is not necessary for Lessor or the
Owner Participant to qualify to do business in such country solely
as a result of the proposed sublease and (4) the proposed sublease
will not give rise to tort liability of the owner of an aircraft not
in possession thereof under the laws of such country other than tort
liability no more extensive or onerous than that which might have
been imposed on such owner under the laws of the United States in
the absence of such sublease (it being understood that, in the event
the opinion set forth in this subclause (4) cannot be given in a
form satisfactory to Lessor, the Owner Participant and Indenture
Trustee, such opinion shall be waived if insurance reasonably
satisfactory to Lessor, the Owner Participant and Indenture Trustee
is provided by Lessee to cover the risk of such liability), and (z)
in the case of any sublease to a foreign air carrier (other than a
foreign air carrier principally based in and a domiciliary of
Taiwan) the United States is maintaining normal diplo- matic
relations with the country in which such foreign air carrier is
principally based and domiciled at the time such sublease is entered
into; and provided, further, that the term of any sublease

39
<PAGE> 45
described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above (including, without
limitation, any option of the sublessee to renew or extend) shall
not continue beyond the end of the Term or any Renewal Term then in
effect, unless Lessee shall irrevocably have agreed to purchase the
Aircraft or renew this Lease in accordance with the terms hereof at
the end of the Term or such Renewal Term, as the case may be, to a
date beyond the end of the term of such sublease (assuming that all
options to renew or extend such sublease will be exercised);

provided that the rights of any sublessee or other transferee who receives
possession by reason of a transfer permitted by this Section 7(b) (other than
the transfer of an Engine which is deemed an Event of Loss) shall be subject
and subordinate to, and any sublease permitted by this Section 7(b) shall be
made expressly subject and subordinate to, all the terms of this Lease and of
the Trust Indenture, including, without limitation, Section 7(a) hereof and
Lessor's rights to repossession pursuant to Section 15(a) hereof and to avoid
such sublease upon such repossession and the Indenture Trustee's rights to
possession pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Trust Indenture, and Lessee shall in
all events remain primarily liable hereunder for the performance and observance
of all of the terms and conditions of this Lease to the same extent as if such
sublease or transfer had not occurred, and any such sublease shall include
appropriate provisions for the maintenance and insurance of the Aircraft. No
interchange agreement, pooling agreement, sublease or other relinquishment of
possession of the Airframe or any Engine shall in any way discharge or diminish
any of Lessee's obligations to Lessor hereunder. No sub-sublease of the
Airframe or Engines shall be permitted except in connection with a transaction
that involves such a sub-sublease commencing at the inception of the sublease
and in which each sub-sublessee and sub-sublease satisfies the conditions
contained in this Section 7(b) with respect to sublessees and subleases,
respectively. Lessee shall not sublease the Airframe or any Engine to an air
carrier that at the inception of the sublease is subject to bankruptcy or other
insolvency proceedings unless the sublease shall have been approved by the
United States Bankruptcy Court and payments thereunder shall have been accorded
priority treatment in such

40
<PAGE> 46
bankruptcy or other insolvency or, in the case of a sublease to a foreign air
carrier, the sublease shall have been approved by the corresponding foreign
authority and payments thereunder shall have been accorded priority treatment
in such bankruptcy or other insolvency and the Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee shall have received an opinion in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee of
Lessee's counsel to the effect that such approval provides Lessee with
assurances and priority treatment substantially equivalent to those that would
be provided by the corresponding United States Bankruptcy Court. Lessee shall,
promptly (and in any event within 15 days) upon entering into a sublease of the
Airframe or Engines, notify Lessor, the Owner Participant and the Indenture
Trustee of the identity of the sublessee and the term of such sublease and
shall provide a copy of such sublease agreement to Lessor, the Owner
Participant and the Indenture Trustee upon request therefrom (with economic and
financial provisions and information deleted therefrom if Lessee shall so
choose), provided, that such parties shall keep confidential the identity of
the sublessee and the existence and terms of such sublease, except that such
parties may disclose such information (A) to committed (subject to receipt of
such information and other customary closing conditions) transferees of
Lessor's, the Owner Participant's or Indenture Trustee's interest who agree to
hold such information confidential, (B) to Lessor's, the Owner Participant's or
Indenture Trustee's counsel, independent insurance advisors or other agents who
agree to hold such information confidential and (C) as may be required by any
statute, court or administrative order or decree or governmental ruling or
regulation. Lessor hereby agrees, for the benefit of the lessor or secured
party of any airframe leased to Lessee or owned by Lessee subject to a
conditional sale or other security agreement, that Lessor will not acquire or
claim, as against such lessor or secured party, any right, title or interest in
any engine or engines owned by the lessor under such lease or subject to a
security interest in favor of the secured party under such conditional sale or
other security agreement as the result of such engine or engines being
installed on the Airframe at any time while such engine or engines are subject
to such lease or conditional sale or other security agreement.

Lessor acknowledges that any "wet lease" or other
similar arrangement under which Lessee maintains operational control of the
Aircraft shall not constitute a delivery, transfer or relinquishment of
possession for purposes of this Section 7(b).

(c) Insignia. Lessee agrees to affix on or prior
to the Delivery Date and thereafter to maintain in the

41
<PAGE> 47
cockpit of the Airframe adjacent to the airworthiness certificate therein and
(if not prevented by applicable law or regulations or by any governmental
authority) on each Engine a nameplate bearing the inscription "LEASED FROM
MERIDIAN TRUST COMPANY, AS OWNER TRUSTEE, LESSOR", and, so long as the Airframe
or such Engine shall constitute a part of the Indenture Estate, the inscription
"MORTGAGED TO FIRST SECURITY BANK OF UTAH, N.A., AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE" (such
nameplate to be replaced, if necessary, with a nameplate reflecting the name of
any successor Lessor or successor Indenture Trustee). Except as above
provided, Lessee will not allow the name of any Person to be placed on the
Airframe or on any Engine as a designation that might be interpreted as a claim
of ownership; provided that nothing herein contained shall prohibit Lessee (or
any sublessee) from placing its customary colors and insignia on the Airframe
or any Engine.

Section 8. Replacement and Pooling of Parts;
Alterations, Modifications and Additions. (a) Replacement of Parts. Lessee,
at its own cost and expense, will promptly replace all Parts which may from
time to time be incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any
Engine and which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen,
destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or rendered permanently
unfit for use for any reason whatsoever, except as otherwise provided in
Section 8(c). In addition, Lessee may, at its own cost and expense, remove in
the ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or testing, any
Parts, whether or not worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated,
damaged beyond repair or rendered permanently unfit for use; provided that
Lessee, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c), will, at its own cost and
expense, replace such Parts as promptly as possible. All replacement Parts
shall be free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted Liens), and shall be
in as good operating condition as, and shall have a value and utility at least
equal to, the Parts replaced, assuming such replaced Parts were in the
condition and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof. Title to
all Parts at any time removed from the Airframe or any Engine shall remain
vested in Lessor no matter where located, until such time as such Parts shall
be replaced by Parts which have been incorporated or installed in or attached
to the Airframe or any Engine, which meet the requirements for replacement
Parts specified above and title to which has vested in Lessor as provided in
this Section 8(a) or Section 8(b). Immediately upon any replacement Part
becoming

42
<PAGE> 48
incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine as above
provided, without further act, (i) title to such replacement Part shall
thereupon vest in Lessor, free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted
Liens) and (ii) such replacement Part shall become subject to this Lease and be
deemed part of the Airframe or such Engine for all purposes to the same extent
as the Parts originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the
Airframe or such Engine. Upon title to such replacement Part so vesting in
Lessor, title to the replaced Part shall thereupon vest in Lessee, free and
clear of all rights of Lessor or any Affiliate of Owner Participant, and such
replaced Part shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder.

(b) Pooling of Parts. Any Part removed from the
Airframe or an Engine as provided in Section 8(a) may be subjected by Lessee to
a normal pooling arrangement customary in the airline industry entered into in
the ordinary course of Lessee's business with Permitted Air Carriers; provided
that the Part replacing such removed Part shall be incorporated or installed in
or attached to the Airframe or such Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) as
promptly as practicable after the removal of such removed Part. In addition,
any replacement Part when incorporated or installed in or attached to the
Airframe or an Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) may be owned by a
Permitted Air Carrier subject to such a normal pooling arrangement; provided
that Lessee shall, at its expense, as promptly thereafter as practicable,
either (i) cause title to such replacement Part to vest in Lessor in accordance
with Section 8(a) by acquiring title thereto for the benefit of, and
transferring such title to, Lessor free and clear of all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens) or (ii) replace such replacement Part by incorporating or
installing in or attaching to the Airframe or such Engine a further replacement
Part owned by Lessee free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens)
and by causing title to such further replacement Part to vest in Lessor in
accordance with Section 8(a). Upon title to such replacement Part vesting in
Lessor, such replacement Part shall become subject to this Lease and be deemed
part of the Airframe or such Engine for all purposes to the same extent as the
Part originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or
such Engine, and title to the replaced Part shall vest in Lessee, free and
clear of all rights of Lessor or any Affiliate of Owner Participant, and such
replaced Part shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder.

43
<PAGE> 49
(c) Alterations, Modifications and Additions.
Lessee, at its own expense, will make such alterations and modifications in and
additions to the Airframe and the Engines as may be required from time to time
to meet the standards of the Federal Aviation Administration or other
governmental authority having jurisdiction in any country in or over which the
Aircraft is flown; provided, however, that Lessee may, in good faith, contest
the validity or application of any such standard in any reasonable manner which
does not materially adversely affect Lessor or the Owner Participant or involve
a significant risk of the imposition of criminal liability on the Lessor or the
Owner Participant; and provided, further, that no such contest by Lessee shall
continue beyond the end of the Term or any Renewal Term. In addition, Lessee,
at its own expense, may from time to time make or cause to be made such
alterations and modifications in and additions to the Airframe or any Engine as
Lessee may deem desirable in the proper conduct of its business, including,
without limitation, removal of Parts; provided that no such alteration,
modification, addition or removal shall diminish the value or utility of the
Airframe or such Engine, or impair the condition or airworthiness thereof,
below the value, utility, condition and airworthiness thereof immediately prior
to such alteration, modification, addition or re- moval assuming the Airframe
or such Engine was then of the value and utility and in the condition and
airworthiness required to be maintained by the terms of this Lease, except that
the value (but not the utility, condition or airworthiness) of the Aircraft may
be reduced by the value of Parts which Lessee deems obsolete or no longer
suitable or appropriate for use in the Airframe or any Engine which shall have
been removed, if the aggregate original value of all such obsolete or
unsuitable Parts removed from the Air- craft and not replaced during the Term
shall not exceed $400,000. Title to all Parts incorporated or installed in or
attached or added to the Airframe or any Engine as the result of such
alteration, modification or addition shall, without further act, vest in
Lessor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, Lessee may, at any time during the Term,
remove any Part; provided that (i) such Part is in addition to, and not in
replacement of or substitution for, any Part originally incorporated or
installed in or attached to the Airframe or such Engine at the time of delivery
thereof hereunder or any Part in replacement of, or substitution for, any such
Part, (ii) such Part is not required to be incorporated or installed in or
attached or added to such Airframe or Engine

44
<PAGE> 50
pursuant to Section 7 or the first sentence of this Section 8(c) other than the
proviso thereto, and (iii) such Part can be removed from the Airframe or such
Engine without diminishing or impairing the value, utility, condition or
airworthiness required to be maintained by the terms of this Lease which the
Airframe or such Engine would have had at such time had such removal not
occurred. Upon the removal by Lessee of any Part as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence or the removal of any obsolete or unsuitable
Part permitted by this Section 8(c), title thereto shall, without further act,
vest in Lessee and such Part shall no longer be deemed part of the Airframe or
the Engine from which it was removed. Any such Part not removed by Lessee
prior to the return of the Airframe or any Engine to Lessor hereunder shall
remain vested in Lessor.

Section 9. Voluntary Termination. (a) Right of
Termination. So long as no Event of Default (or Payment or Bankruptcy Default)
shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee shall have the right, subject to
the conditions set forth in this Section 9, at its option to terminate this
Lease (i) at any time on or after the seventh anniversary of the Base Lease
Commencement Date, if in Lessee's good faith determination (evidenced by a
certificate of a Responsible Officer of Lessee to such effect) the Aircraft is
surplus to Lessee's requirements or economically obsolete to Lessee, and (ii)
on a Special Termination Date, in each case by delivering to Lessor and the
Owner Participant a written notice of termination specifying a proposed date of
termination (the "Termination Date") which shall be a Business Day occurring
not earlier than 180 days after the date of such notice, and, if the
Termination Date is a Special Termination Date, whether or not Lessee is
thereby electing to purchase the Aircraft on such Special Termination Date as
provided in Section 9(e). The termination of this Lease shall be effective,
subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 9, on (A) if Lessee has not
elected to purchase the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has
elected to sell the Aircraft, as provided below, the date of sale of the
Aircraft, if any, referred to in Section 9(b), (B) if Lessee has not elected to
purchase the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected to
retain the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(d), the date of termination
referred to in Section 9(d), or (C) if Lessee has elected to purchase the
Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e), the date of purchase referred to in
Section 9(e). Where Lessee has not elected to purchase the Aircraft as
provided for in Section 9(e), Lessor or the

45
<PAGE> 51
Owner Participant shall give Lessee irrevocable notice of its election to sell
or retain the Aircraft no later than 30 days prior to the Termination Date. In
the event Lessor or the Owner Participant shall fail to give notice pursuant to
the immediately preceding sen- tence, notice of its election to sell the
Aircraft shall be deemed to have been given as of such thirtieth day prior to
the Termination Date. Unless Lessor or the Owner Participant shall have given
to Lessee a timely notice of its election to retain the Aircraft as provided in
Section 9(d), Lessee may withdraw the termination notice referred to above at
any time on or prior to the date that is 15 days prior to the Termination Date,
whereupon this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. In the event
Lessee withdraws, on or before the 15th day prior to the Termination Date, a
notice of termination given pursuant to this Section 9(a) or such notice is
deemed withdrawn pursuant to the final sentence of Section 9(b) or if this
Lease is not terminated on a proposed Termination Date pursuant to this Section
9 as a result of a breach by Lessee of its obligations hereunder, Lessee will
reimburse Lessor and the Owner Participant for any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including any reasonable brokers' fees) incurred by them in
connection with the proposed sale, except Lessee shall not be obligated to
reimburse Lessor or the Owner Participant for any out-of-pocket expenses to the
extent Lessor or the Owner Participant, as the case may be, shall have failed
to comply with its obligations under this Section 9. Lessee shall not be
entitled to exercise its right of termination provided for in this Section 9(a)
more than four times during the Term (not including for purposes of this
sentence any exercise by Lessee of such right of termination immediately
following a failure of this Lease to be terminated solely by reason of Lessor's
or the Owner Participant's failure to comply with its obligations under this
Section 9).

(b) Sale of Aircraft. If Lessee has not elected to
purchase the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected or is
deemed to have elected to sell the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(a), Lessee
will have the option of acting as non-exclusive agent for Lessor to obtain bids
for the cash purchase on or prior to the Termination Date of the Aircraft.
Lessor agrees to pay Lessee a commercially reasonable brokerage fee based on
the then current industry practice in the event that Lessee locates the Person
who purchases the Aircraft pursuant to this Section 9(b); provided that the
foregoing shall not derogate from Lessee's obligations set forth in clause (1)
of the

46
<PAGE> 52
sixth sentence of this paragraph. If Lessee acts as such agent, Lessee shall,
promptly upon receipt of any cash bid for the Aircraft notify Lessor and the
Owner Participant in writing of the amount and terms of each such bid and the
name and the address of the Person submitting each such bid. Lessor and the
Owner Participant may also, at their expense (which expense, including without
limitation any broker's or finder's fees or commissions, shall, subject to the
penultimate sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 9, be for the Owner
Participant's own account), independently obtain cash bids for such purchase
and, in the event Lessor or the Owner Participant receives any such bid, Lessor
or the Owner Participant, as the case may be, shall promptly notify Lessee in
writing of the amount and terms of such bid and the name and address of the
Person submitting such bid; provided that the foregoing shall not derogate from
Lessee's obligations set forth in clause (1) of the sixth sentence of this
paragraph. On the Termination Date (or such other date of sale as may be
agreed to by Lessor and Lessee, which shall thereafter be deemed the
Termination Date), (x) Lessee shall, subject to receipt by Lessor of all
amounts owing to Lessor pursuant to the next sentence (other than amounts
payable by Lessee), deliver the Aircraft at a location selected by Lessee to
the Person who, prior to such date, shall have submitted the highest cash bid
net of any broker's or finder's fees (or such other purchaser acceptable to
Lessor and Lessee), in the same manner as if delivery were made to Lessor at
the end of the Term pursuant to Section 5, and shall duly transfer to Lessor
title to any engines installed on the Airframe but not owned by Lessor, all in
accordance with the terms of Section 5, and (y) Lessor shall simultaneously
therewith sell, without recourse or warranty (except as to the absence of
Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the definition
thereof)), for cash all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the
Aircraft to such highest net cash bidder (or other purchaser). The total
selling price realized at such sale shall be retained by Lessor and, in
addition, on the Termination Date, Lessee shall pay to Lessor or, in the case
of Supplemental Rent, to the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of the type
specified in Section 3(d), an amount equal to the sum of (1) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Termination Value for the Aircraft as of the Termination Date,
over (B) the proceeds of the sale of the Aircraft after deducting (i) any
reasonable brokerage or finders' fee payable by Lessor or the Owner
Participant, (ii) any other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Lessor and the Owner Participant, and (iii) any sale or

47
<PAGE> 53
transfer taxes payable by Lessor or the Owner Participant in connection with
such sale, and (2) all Supplemental Rent, other than Termination Value, due and
owing on the Termination Date, and (3) if the Termination Date is a Lease
Period Date, the Basic Rent installment due and payable on that date pursuant
to Section 3(b) (it being understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be
required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment designated
in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in ad- vance). If on or
prior to the scheduled Termination Date no sale of the Aircraft shall have
occurred and if Lessor shall not have elected to retain the Aircraft in
accordance with Section 9(d) or Lessee shall not have elected to purchase the
Aircraft in accordance with Section 9(e), Lessee's notice given pursuant to
Section 9(a) shall be deemed to be withdrawn as of such scheduled Termination
Date and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. Without the
written consent of the Owner Participant, neither the Lessee nor any of its
Affiliates may bid on the Aircraft in connection with a termination of this
Lease pursuant to Sec- tion 9(a)(i).

(c) Certain Obligations upon Sale of Aircraft.
Upon the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to and in accor- dance with the
provisions of Section 9(b), Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or
warranty (except as to the absence of Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this
purpose the proviso to the definition thereof)), all of Lessor's right, title
and interest in and to any Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but which
are not then installed on the Aircraft. Lessor shall be under no duty to
solicit bids, to inquire into the efforts of Lessee to obtain bids or otherwise
take any action in connection with the sale of the Aircraft under Section 9(b),
other than to transfer to the purchaser of the Aircraft (or to such purchaser
and to Lessee, as the case may be), without recourse or warranty (except as to
the absence of Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the
definition thereof)), all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the
Aircraft against receipt of the payments provided for herein, and to pay the
amounts, if any, required to be paid by Lessor under Section 9(b) or this
Section 9(c), and to request the Indenture Trustee upon the sale of the
Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(b) to execute and deliver to such purchaser (or
to such purchaser and to Lessee, as the case may be) an appropriate instrument
releasing the Aircraft from the lien of the Trust Indenture and releasing the
Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment

48
<PAGE> 54
from the assignment and pledge under the Trust Indenture. Lessor agrees to
notify promptly Lessee of the appointment by Lessor of any broker or finder
(other than Lessee) in connection with the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to
Section 9(b) and to pay the fees or commissions of any such broker or finder
employed by Lessor in connection with the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to
Section 9(b); provided that nothing in this Section 9(c) shall derogate from
Lessee's obligations set forth in clause (1) of the sixth sentence of Section
9(b).

(d) Retention of Aircraft by Lessor. If Lessee has
not elected to purchase the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has
elected to retain the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(a), on the Termination
Date specified in Lessee's termination notice, Lessor shall pay, or cause to be
paid, to the Indenture Trustee in funds of the type specified in Section 3(d),
an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the
Certificates and all accrued interest thereon, plus all other sums due and
payable to the Indenture Trustee on such Termination Date under the Trust
Indenture, the Participation Agreement or such Certificates. Subject to
receipt by the Indenture Trustee of such funds, on the Termination Date, (i)
Lessee (x) shall deliver the Aircraft to Lessor in the same manner as if
delivery were made to Lessor at the end of the Term pursuant to Section 5, and
shall duly transfer to Lessor title to any engines installed on the Airframe
but not owned by Lessor, all in accordance with the terms of Section 5, and (y)
shall pay to Lessor or to the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of the type
specified in Section 3(d), all Supplemental Rent, other than Termination Value,
due and owing on the Termination Date, and, if the Termination Date is a Lease
Period Date, the Basic Rent installment due and payable on that date pursuant
to Section 3(b) (it being understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be
required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment designated
in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in advance), and (ii)
Lessor (x) shall transfer or cause to be transferred to Lessee, without
recourse or warranty (except as to the absence of Lessor's Liens (disregarding
for this purpose the proviso to the definition thereof)), all of Lessor's
right, title and interest in and to any Engines constituting part of the
Aircraft but which are not then installed on the Aircraft, and (y) shall
request the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate
instrument releasing the Aircraft from the lien of the Trust Indenture and
releasing the Purchase

49
<PAGE> 55
Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge
under the Trust Indenture. If Lessor shall fail to perform any of its
obligations pursuant to this Section 9(d) under circumstances in which Lessee
shall have fully performed its obligations hereunder with respect to such
termination and as a result thereof this Lease shall not be terminated on a
proposed Termination Date, Lessor shall thereafter no longer be entitled to
exercise its election to retain the Aircraft upon any subsequent termination
pursuant to this Section 9 and Lessee may at its option at any time thereafter
submit a new termination notice pursuant to Section 9(a).

(e) Purchase of Aircraft by Lessee. In the event
that Lessee shall be entitled to and shall have elected pursuant to the written
notice referred to in the first sentence of Section 9(a) to terminate this
Lease and purchase the Aircraft on a Special Termination Date, on such Special
Termination Date, Lessee shall purchase the Aircraft at a price (the "Special
Termination Price") equal to the greatest of (i) the Termination Value for the
Aircraft, computed as of the Special Termination Date, (ii) the then fair
market sales value of the Aircraft, as determined by mutual agreement of Lessor
and Lessee or, if they shall be unable to agree, by an Independent Appraisal
and (iii) the sum of the present values, as of such Special Termination Date,
of (x) Basic Rent (including any Rent Differential Amount required to reflect
the actual interest rate then in effect on the Certificates) payable with
respect to the period from such Special Termination Date to and including the
twenty-fourth anniversary of the Base Lease Commencement Date and (y) the
estimated fair market sales value of the Aircraft on the twenty-fourth
anniversary of the Base Lease Commencement Date, as determined on such Special
Termination Date by the Independent Appraisal (such present value calculation
to utilize a discount rate equal to 13.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually).
In such event, on such Special Termination Date, (x) Lessee (i) shall pay to
Lessor or to the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of the type specified in
Section 3(d), all unpaid Supplemental Rent, other than Termination Value, due
and owing on such Special Termination Date and all Basic Rent due and payable
on or prior to the Special Termination Date and remaining unpaid (it being
understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be required to pay the portion, if
any, of the Basic Rent installment due and payable on the Special Termination
Date designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in
advance) and (ii) at its option shall either

50
<PAGE> 56
(A) pay to Lessor, in funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), the Special
Termination Price, or (B) assume all of the rights and obligations of the Owner
Trustee under the Trust Indenture in respect of the Certificates (including,
without limitation, any scheduled payment of principal of or accrued interest
on the Certificates due and payable on the Special Termination Date but only to
the extent that the Basic Rent installment payable by Lessee pursuant to clause
(i) above or previously paid pursuant to this Lease does not cover such
scheduled payment of principal of or accrued interest on the Certificates but
excluding any obligations or liabilities of the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity incurred on or prior to the Special Termination Date, which
obligations and liabilities shall remain the sole responsibility of the Owner
Trustee) in accordance with Section 2.16 of the Trust Indenture and
simultaneously shall pay to Lessor, in funds of the type specified in Section
3(d), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Special Termination Price
over an amount equal to the sum of the principal of and any accrued and unpaid
interest on the out- standing Certificates on such Special Termination Date,
after taking into account any payments of principal or interest made in respect
of the outstanding Certificates on such Special Termination Date, and (y)
Lessor will sell to Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except as to the
absence of Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the
definition thereof)), all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the
Aircraft and all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to any Engines
constituting part of the Aircraft but which are not then installed on the
Aircraft and, if Lessee shall not have assumed the rights and obligations of
the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture in respect of the Certificates as
provided for above, Lessor will request the Indenture Trustee to execute and
deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument releasing the Airframe and Engines
with respect to which title is transferred from the lien of the Trust Indenture
and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from
the assignment and pledge thereunder.

(f) Termination of Lease, Etc. Upon the sale or
retention or purchase of the Aircraft, as the case may be, in compliance with
the provisions of this Section 9, (i) the obligation of Lessee to pay Basic
Rent under Section 3(b) on any Lease Period Date occurring subsequent to the
applicable Termination Value Determination Date, and (ii) the obligation of
Lessee to pay Supplemental Rent (other than

51
<PAGE> 57
payments of Supplemental Rent to be made by Lessee (x) surviving pursuant to
Section 7(d) of the Participation Agreement or Section 18 of the Tax Indemnity
Agreement or (y) in respect of liabilities and obligations of Lessee which have
accrued under any Operative Document but have not been paid or which are in
dispute as of the date of such sale or retention) shall cease as of the
Termination Date and, in each case, the Term shall end effective as of the
Termination Date.

(g) Termination as to Engines. So long as no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee shall have the right
at its option at any time, on at least 60 days' prior written notice, to
terminate this Lease with respect to any Engine. In such event, and prior to
the date of such termination, Lessee shall replace such Engine hereunder by
complying with the terms of Section 10(b) to the same extent as if an Event of
Loss had occurred with respect to such Engine. No termination of this Lease
with respect to any Engine as contemplated by this Section 9(g) shall result in
any reduction of Basic Rent.

Section 10. Loss, Destruction, Requisition, Etc. 
(a) Event of Loss with Respect to the Airframe. Upon the occurrence of an
Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines
installed on the Airframe, Lessee shall forthwith (and, in any event, within 15
days after such occurrence) give Lessor and the Owner Participant written
notice of such Event of Loss, specifying the date of such occurrence, and of
its election to perform one of the following options (it being agreed that if
Lessee shall not have given notice of such election within such 15 days after
such occurrence, Lessee shall be deemed to have elected to perform the option
set forth in the following clause (ii)):

(i) as promptly as practicable, and in any event
on or before the Business Day next preceding the 181st day next
following the date of occurrence of such Event of Loss, in
replacement for the Airframe, Lessee shall convey or cause to be
conveyed to Lessor title to a Replacement Airframe (together with
the same number of Replacement Engines as the Engines, if any,
installed on the Airframe at the time such Event of Loss occurred)
to be leased to Lessee hereunder, such Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines to be free and clear of all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens), to have a value and utility at least equal to, and
to be in as good operating condition as, the Airframe and

52
<PAGE> 58
Engines, if any, so replaced (assuming such Airframe and Engines
were in the condition and repair required by the terms of this
Lease); provided, that if the Owner Participant shall provide
Lessee, within 30 days after receipt of written notice from Lessee
of its election to perform the option set forth in this clause (i),
an opinion of independent tax counsel selected by the Owner
Participant and reasonably acceptable to Lessee to the effect that
it is more likely than not that such conveyance will result in
adverse Federal income tax consequences to the Owner Participant
(which opinion shall also state whether there is a Realistic
Possibility of Success (as defined in the Tax Indemnity Agreement)
for the position that such conveyance will not result in adverse
Federal income tax consequences to the Owner Participant), then
Lessee shall be able to elect the option set forth in this clause
(i) only if (A) in the event such opinion is to the effect that
there is no such Realistic Possibility of Success, Lessee and the
Owner Participant negotiate a mutually satisfactory compensation
payment or (B) in the event such opinion is to the effect that there
is such a Realistic Possibility of Success, Lessee shall indemnify
the Owner Participant in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Owner Participant against such adverse consequences; and provided,
further, that if Lessee shall have elected to replace the Airframe
and such Engines, but shall not have performed its obligation to
effect such replacement under this clause (i) during the period of
time provided herein, then Lessee shall pay on the fifth day next
following the end of such period to Lessor, or, in the case of
Supplemental Rent, to the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of the
type specified in Section 3(d) hereof, the amounts specified in
clause (ii) below; or

(ii) on or before the Business Day next preceding
the 181st day next following the date of occurrence of such Event of
Loss or on the date specified in the second proviso to clause (i)
above, if such proviso is applicable (the "Loss Payment Date"),
Lessee shall pay to Lessor or, in the case of Supplemental Rent, to
the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of the type specified in
Section 3(d), (A) the Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft,
determined as of the Casualty Loss Determination Date, plus (B) all
Supplemental Rent (other than Stipulated Loss Value) due and owing
on such Loss Payment Date, including Break Amount, if any,

53
<PAGE> 59
plus (C) if the Loss Payment Date with respect to the Stipulated
Loss Value is a Lease Period Date, the Basic Rent installment due
and payable on that date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it being
understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be required to pay the
portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment designated in
Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in advance), plus
(D) all Basic Rent due and payable prior to the Loss Payment Date
and unpaid.

In the event of payment in full of the Stipulated
Loss Value for the Aircraft and all amounts payable pursuant to this Section
10, (1) the obligation of Lessee to pay any Basic Rent under Section 3(b) on
any Lease Period Date occurring subsequent to the Loss Payment Date shall
terminate, (2) the obligation of Lessee to pay Supplemental Rent (other than
payments of Supplemental Rent to be made by Lessee (x) surviving pursuant to
Section 18 of the Tax Indemnity Agreement or Section 7(d) of the Participation
Agreement or (y) in respect of liabilities and obligations of Lessee which have
accrued but not been paid or which are in dispute as of the date of such
payment) shall terminate, (3) the Term for the Aircraft shall end, (4) Lessor
will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except as to the absence
of Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the definition
thereof)), all Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the Airframe and
Engines (if any) with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, as well as
all Lessor's right, title and interest in and to any Engines constituting part
of the Aircraft but not installed on the Airframe when such Event of Loss
occurred, and (5) Lessor will assign to or as directed by Lessee all claims of
Lessor against third Persons relating to such Airframe and Engines arising from
such Event of Loss. Upon such transfer, Lessor shall request the Indenture
Trustee to execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument releasing
the Airframe and Engines with respect to which title is transferred from the
Lien of the Trust Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the
Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge thereof
thereunder.

At the time of or prior to, and as a condition to,
any replacement of the Airframe and such Engines, if any, Lessee, at its own
expense, will (A) furnish Lessor with a warranty (as to title) bill of sale in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor (which warranty shall
except Permitted Liens) with respect to the Replacement

54
<PAGE> 60
Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, a Federal Aviation Administration
form 8050-2 bill of sale and a purchase agreement assignment substantially
similar to that delivered on the Delivery Date containing manufacturer's
warranties substantially similar to those assigned to Lessor on the Delivery
Date, (B) cause a Lease Supplement substantially in the form of Exhibit A
hereto, sub- jecting such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any,
to this Lease, and duly executed by Lessee, to be delivered to Lessor for
execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the
Federal Aviation Act or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of such
jurisdiction other than the United States in which such Replacement Airframe
and Replacement Engines, if any, are to be registered in accordance with
Section 7(a), as the case may be, (C) so long as the Trust Indenture shall not
have been satisfied and discharged, cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture
Supplement substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the Trust Indenture for
such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, to be delivered to
Lessor and to the Indenture Trustee for execution and, upon such execution, to
be filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act or, if necessary,
pursuant to the applicable laws of such jurisdiction other than the United
States in which such Replacement Aircraft and Replacement Engines, if any, are
to be registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the case may be, (D) cause
a financing statement or statements (including a precautionary financing
statement or statements) with respect to the Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, or other requisite documents or instruments to be
filed in such place or places as necessary in order to perfect the security
interest therein created by or pursuant to the Trust Indenture (so long as the
Trust Indenture shall not have been satisfied and discharged), or to protect
the interest of Lessor in and to the Replacement Airframe and the Replacement
Engine or Replacement Engines, if any, or, if necessary, pursuant to the
applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which such Replacement Aircraft and
Replacement Engines, if any, are to be registered in accordance with Section
7(a), as the case may be, (E) furnish Lessor with an opinion of Lessee's
counsel (which may be Lessee's General Counsel), to the effect that (i) the
bill of sale referred to in clause (A) above constitutes an effective
instrument for the conveyance of title to the Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, to Lessor and (ii) upon such conveyance such
substituted property will be leased hereunder and subjected to the Lien of the
Indenture, (F) furnish Lessor

55
<PAGE> 61
with a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of Lessee certifying that,
upon consummation of such replacement, no Event of Default will exist
hereunder, (G) furnish Lessor with a certificate of an independent aircraft
engineer or appraiser certifying that the Replacement Airframe and Replacement
Engines, if any, have a value and utility at least equal to, and are in as good
operating condition as, the Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced assuming
such Airframe and Engines were in the condition and repair required by the
terms hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss and that
the Replacement Aircraft is a Boeing 767-323ER aircraft or a comparable or
improved model of such aircraft which shall have been manufactured no earlier
than 18 months prior to the Delivery Date, (H) furnish Lessor with such
evidence of compliance with the insurance provisions of Section 11 with respect
to such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines as Lessor may reasonably
request and (I) furnish Lessor and the Indenture Trustee with a reasoned
opinion of Lessee's counsel (which may be Lessee's General Counsel) addressed
to each, to the effect that the Owner Trustee, as Lessor under the Lease, and
the Indenture Trustee, as assignee of the Owner Trustee's rights under the
Lease pursuant to the Indenture, will be entitled to the benefits of Title 11
U.S.C. Section 1110 with respect to the Replacement Airframe, provided that (i)
such opinion need not be delivered to the extent that, by reason of a change in
law or in judicial or other governmental interpretation thereof, the benefits
of such Section 1110 were not available to the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee with respect to the Aircraft immediately prior to such substitution and
(ii) such opinion may contain quali- fications and assumptions of the tenor
contained in the opinion of Debevoise & Plimpton delivered pursuant to Section
4(J) of the Participation Agreement on the Delivery Date and such other
qualifications and assumptions as shall at the time be customary in opinions
rendered in comparable circumstances. In the case of each Replacement Airframe
and each Replacement Engine, if any, conveyed to Lessor under this Section 10,
and each Replacement Engine conveyed to Lessor under this Section 10, promptly
upon the registration of the Replacement Aircraft and the recordation of the
Lease Supplement and the Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement covering such
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, or such Replacement
Engine pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act (or pursuant to the applicable laws
of the jurisdiction in which such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines,
if any, or such Replacement Engine, are

56
<PAGE> 62
to be registered in accordance with Section 7(a)), Lessee will cause to be
delivered to Lessor and the Indenture Trustee an opinion of counsel to Lessee
as to the due registration of such Replacement Aircraft and the due recordation
of such Lease Supplement and such Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement and
the validity and perfection of the interest of the Lessor in the Replacement
Airframe and the Replacement Engine or the Replacement Engines, if any, and the
security interest in the Replacement Aircraft, Replacement Engines or
Replacement Engine, as the case may be, granted to the Indenture Trustee under
the Trust Indenture.

For all purposes hereof, upon passage of title
thereto to Lessor the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any,
shall be deemed part of the property leased hereunder, the Replacement Airframe
shall be deemed an "Airframe" as defined herein, and each such Replacement
Engine shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein. No such replacement of
the Airframe or any Engines under the circumstances contemplated by the terms
of this Section 10(a) shall result in any reduction of Basic Rent. Upon such
passage of title, Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty
(except as to Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the
definition thereof)), all Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the
replaced Airframe and Engines (if any) installed thereon at the time such Event
of Loss occurred, and upon such transfer, Lessor will request in writing that
the Indenture Trustee execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument
releasing such replaced Airframe and Engines (if any) installed thereon at the
time such Event of Loss occurred from the lien of the Indenture and releasing
the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the
assignment and pledge under the Indenture.

(b) Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Upon
the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under
circumstances in which there has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to
the Airframe, Lessee shall give Lessor prompt written notice thereof and shall,
within 90 days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, convey or cause to
be conveyed to Lessor, as replacement for the Engine with respect to which such
Event of Loss occurred, title to a Replacement Engine free and clear of all
Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and having a value and utility at least
equal to, and being in as good operating condition as, the Engine with respect
to which such Event of Loss

57
<PAGE> 63
occurred, assuming such Engine was of the value and utility and in the
condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior to the
occurrence of such Event of Loss. Prior to or at the time of, and as a
condition to, any such conveyance, Lessee, at its own expense, will (i) furnish
Lessor with a warranty (as to title) bill of sale (which warranty shall except
Permitted Liens) in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor with
respect to such Replacement Engine, (ii) cause a Lease Supplement substantially
in the form of Exhibit A hereto, subjecting such Replacement Engine to this
Lease, and duly executed by Lessee, to be delivered to Lessor for execution
and, upon such execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal
Aviation Act, or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of such
jurisdiction other than the United States in which the Aircraft is registered,
(iii) so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been satisfied and
discharged, cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement substantially in
the form of Exhibit A to the Trust Indenture for such Replacement Engine to be
delivered to Lessor and to the Indenture Trustee for execution and, upon such
execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act or,
if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of such jurisdiction other than
the United States in which the Aircraft is or is to be registered in accordance
with Section 7(a), as the case may be, (iv) furnish Lessor with an opinion of
Lessee's counsel (which may be Lessee's General Counsel) to the effect that (i)
the bill of sale referred to in clause (i) above constitutes an effective
instrument for the conveyance of title to such Replacement Engine to Lessor and
(ii) upon such conveyance such substituted property will be leased hereunder
and subjected to the Lien of the Indenture, (v) furnish Lessor with a
certificate of an independent aircraft appraiser certifying that such
Replacement Engine has a value and utility at least equal to, and is in as good
operating condition as, the Engine so replaced assuming such Engine was in the
condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior to the
occurrence of such Event of Loss, (vi) cause a financing statement or
statements (including a precautionary financing statement or statements) with
respect to the Replacement Engine, or other requisite documents or instruments
to be filed in such place or places as necessary in order to perfect the
security interest in the Replacement Engine created by or pursuant to the Trust
Indenture (if then in effect) or to protect the rights and interests of Lessor
in and to the Replacement Engine, and (vii) furnish Lessor and the Indenture
Trustee

58
<PAGE> 64
with such evidence of compliance with the insurance provisions of Section 11
with respect to such Replacement Engine as Lessor may reasonably request. Upon
full compliance by Lessee with the terms of this paragraph (b), Lessor will
transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens
(disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the definition thereof)), all of
Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the Engine with respect to which
such Event of Loss occurred, and Lessor will assign to or as directed by Lessee
all claims of Lessor against third Persons relating to such Engine arising from
such Event of Loss, and upon such transfer Lessor shall request in writing that
the Indenture Trustee execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument
releasing such Engine from the lien of the Trust Indenture and releasing the
Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment (in respect solely of
such Engine) from the assignment and pledge under the Trust Indenture. For all
purposes hereof, each such Replacement Engine shall, after such conveyance, be
deemed part of the property leased hereunder and shall be deemed an "Engine" as
defined herein. No Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under the
circumstances contemplated by the terms of this Section 10(b) shall result in
any reduction in Basic Rent.

(c) Application of Payments from Governmental
Authorities for Requisition of Title or Use. Any payments (other than
insurance proceeds the application of which is provided for in Section 11)
received at any time by Lessor or by Lessee from any governmental authority or
other Person with respect to an Event of Loss resulting from the condemnation,
confiscation, theft or seizure of, or requisition of title to or use of, the
Airframe or any Engine (other than a requisition for use by any Government or
by the government of the country of registry of the Aircraft not constituting
an Event of Loss) will be applied as follows:

(i) if such payments are received with respect to
the Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on
the Airframe that has been or is being replaced by Lessee pursuant
to Section 10(a), such payments shall be paid over to, or retained
by, Lessor and upon completion of such replacement be paid over to,
or retained by, Lessee;

(ii) if such payments are received with respect to
the Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines

59

installed on the Airframe that has not been and will not be replaced
pursuant to Section 10(a), such payments shall, after reimbursement
of Lessor for costs and expenses, be applied in reduction of
Lessee's obligation to pay the Stipulated Loss Value required to be
paid by Lessee pursuant to Section 10(a) and amounts payable as
Supplemental Rent in respect of the Break Amount and any interest,
if any, in connection therewith, if not already paid by Lessee, or,
if already paid by Lessee, shall be applied to reimburse Lessee for
its payment of such Stipulated Loss Value and any such Supplemental
Rent, and the balance, if any, of such payments remaining thereafter
shall be paid over to, and retained by, Lessee and Lessor, as their
interests may appear; and

(iii) if such payments are received with respect to
an Engine under circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b), so much
of such payments remaining after reimbursement of Lessor for costs
and expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee; provided
that Lessee shall have fully performed the terms of Section 10(b)
with respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

(d) Requisition for Use by any Government of the
Airframe and the Engines Installed Thereon. In the event of the requisition
for use by any Government or by the government of the country of registry of
the Aircraft (including for this purpose any agency or instrumentality thereof
which bears the full faith and credit of such Government or government)
including, without limitation, pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program
referred to in Section 7(b)(iv), of the Airframe and the Engines or engines
installed on the Airframe during the Term, Lessee shall promptly notify Lessor
of such requisition and all of Lessee's obligations under this Lease with
respect to the Aircraft shall continue to the same extent as if such
requisition had not occurred; provided, that in the event of a requisition for
use by the government of the United States extending beyond the end of the Term
or any Renewal Term then in effect, which requisition Lessee elects not to
treat as an Event of Loss as of such end of the Term or Renewal Term, the Lease
shall be extended for a period (the "Extension Period") not to exceed the
shorter of (i) one year and (ii) 30 days beyond the period of such requisition,
and during such Extension Period Lessee shall pay to Lessor the fair market
rental value (without regard to the

60
<PAGE> 66
requisition) determined during the period of 90 days prior to the end of the
Term or Renewal Term, as determined by agreement between Lessee and Lessor or,
in the absence of such agreement, by an Independent Appraisal. All such
payments received by Lessor or Lessee from such Government or government for
the use of the Airframe and Engines or engines during or, in the case of the
Government of the United States, after the Term, shall be paid over to, or
retained by, Lessee.

(e) Requisition for Use by the Government of an
Engine. In the event of the requisition for use by any Government or the
government of the country of registry of the Aircraft (including for this
purpose any agency or instrumentality thereof which bears the full faith and
credit of such Government or government) of any Engine (but not the Airframe),
Lessee will replace such Engine hereunder by complying with the terms of
Section 10(b) to the same extent as if an Event of Loss had occurred with
respect to such Engine, and any payments received by Lessor or Lessee from such
Government or government with respect to such requisition shall be paid over
to, or retained by, Lessee.

(f) Application of Payments During Existence of
Event of Default. Any amount referred to in this Sec- tion 10 which is payable
to Lessee shall not be paid to Lessee, or if it has been previously paid to
Lessee, shall not be retained by Lessee, if at the time of such payment an
Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, but shall be paid to and held by the Lessor as security for the
obligations of Lessee under this Lease, and at such time as there shall not be
continuing any such Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default, such
amount shall be paid to Lessee, provided, that if any such amount has been so
held by Lessor as security for more than 180 days after an Event of Default or
Payment or Bankruptcy Default shall have occurred and during which period (i)
Lessor shall not have been limited by operation of law or otherwise from
exercising remedies hereunder or (ii) Lessor shall not have commenced to
exercise any remedy available to it under Section 15, then such amount shall be
paid to Lessee.

(g) Replacement Airframes and Replacement Engines.
Section 5.06 of the Trust Indenture is hereby incorporated herein by reference,
with the same force and effect as if such Section 5.06 were contained herein,
and shall continue to be so incorporated herein and remain in

61
<PAGE> 67
force and effect in the event no Certificates are outstanding and/or the Trust
Indenture is terminated.

Section 11. Insurance. (a) Public Liability and
Property Damage Insurance. Subject to the rights of Lessee to establish and
maintain self-insurance with respect to public liability and property damage
liability insurance for aircraft and engines (including the Aircraft and
Engines) in the manner and to the extent specified in the next sentence, Lessee
will carry, or cause to be carried, at no expense to Lessor, the Indenture
Trustee or any Participant public liability (including, without limitation,
contractual liability and passenger legal liability) and property damage
liability insurance (exclusive of manufacturer's product liability insurance)
with respect to the Aircraft (i) in amounts which are not less than the public
liability and property damage insurance applicable to similar aircraft and
engines which comprise Lessee's fleet on which Lessee carries insurance,
provided that such liability insurance shall not be less than the amount
certified to Lessor on the Delivery Date, (ii) of the type usually carried by
corporations engaged in the same or similar business, similarly situated with
Lessee, and owning or operating similar aircraft and engines and covering risks
of the kind customarily insured against by Lessee, and (iii) which is
maintained in effect with insurers of recognized responsibility. Lessee may
self-insure, by way of deductible or premium adjustment provisions in insurance
policies, the risks required to be insured against pursuant to the preceding
sentence, but in no case shall the self-insurance (including the self-insurance
permitted by Section 11(b)) with respect to all of the aircraft and engines in
Lessee's fleet (including, without limitation, the Aircraft) exceed for any
12-month policy year the lesser of (x) 50% of the largest replacement value of
any single aircraft in Lessee's fleet or (y) 1-1/2% of the average aggregate
insurable value (for the preceding year) of all aircraft (including, without
limitation, the Aircraft) on which Lessee carries insurance; provided that, in
the event that there shall have occurred a material adverse change in the
financial condition of Lessee from such condition as is reflected in the
consolidated financial statements of Lessee at December 31, 1982, then, upon
not less than 30 days' written notice from Lessor to Lessee, Lessee will, until
Lessee's financial condition is on an overall basis equivalent to its financial
condition at December 31, 1982, reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder
to such reasonable amount as Lessor may require; provided, further,

62
<PAGE> 68
that a deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce handling that, in the case
of the Aircraft, is not in excess of the amount customarily allowed as a
deductible in the industry, shall be permitted in addition to the
above-mentioned self-insurance. Any policies of insurance carried in
accordance with this Section 11(a) and any policies taken out in substitution
or replacement for any of such policies (A) shall name Lessor, as lessor of the
Aircraft and in its individual capacity, the Indenture Trustee and each
Participant as additional insureds as their respective Interests may appear,
(B) shall provide that in respect of the respective Interests of Lessor, of the
Indenture Trustee and of each Participant in such policies the insurance shall
not be invalidated by any action or inaction of Lessee and shall insure
Lessor's, the Indenture Trustee's and each Participant's Interests as they
appear, regardless of any breach or violation of any warranty, declaration or
condition contained in such policies by Lessee, (C) shall provide that, if such
insurance is cancelled for any reason whatever, or any substantial change is
made in the coverage which affects the coverage certified hereunder to Lessor,
the Indenture Trustee or any Participant, or if such insurance is allowed to
lapse for nonpayment of premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not
be effective as to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant for 30 days
(seven days, or such other period as is customarily obtainable in the industry,
in the case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt by
Lessor, by the Indenture Trustee or by such Participant, respectively, of
written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse, (D)
shall provide that none of Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant
shall have any obligation or liability for premiums, commissions, assessments
or calls in connection with such insurance, (E) shall provide that the insurers
shall waive (i) any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction,
whether by attachment or otherwise, which they may have against Lessor, the
Indenture Trustee or any Participant and (ii) any rights of subrogation against
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant to the extent that Lessee has
waived its rights by its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to
this Lease or the Participation Agreement and that the exercise by such
insurers of rights of subrogation derived from rights retained by Lessee will
not delay payment of any claims that would otherwise be payable but for the
exercise of such rights of subrogation, (F) shall be primary without right of
contribution from any other insurance which may be carried by Lessor, the
Indenture Trustee or any Participant

63
<PAGE> 69
with respect to its Interest as such in the Aircraft and (G) shall expressly
provide that all of the provisions thereof, except the limits of liability,
shall operate in the same manner as if there were a separate policy covering
each insured. "Interests" as used in this Section 11(a) and Section 11(b) with
respect to any Person means the interests of such Person in its individual
capacity, as Lessor, Owner Trustee (including in its individual capacity under
the Participation Agreement), the Indenture Trustee or any Participant, as the
case may be, in the leasing transaction contemplated by this Lease, the
Participation Agreement and the Indenture. Lessee shall arrange for
appropriate certification that the requirements of this Section 11(a) have been
met to be made to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant (and
the Indenture Trustee may furnish such certificates to the Loan Par- ticipants)
as soon as practicable by each insurer or its authorized representative with
respect thereto, provided that all information contained therein shall be held
confidential by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and each Participant and shall
not be fur- nished or disclosed by them to anyone other than their bank
examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and any Person with
whom any Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations relating to the
possible transfer and sale of such Par- ticipant's Certificates or interest in
the Aircraft, as the case may be, if such Person shall have entered into an
agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(a) whereby such Person
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be re- quired
by an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule,
regulation or order of any governmental authority. In the case of a sublease
or contract with any Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, or in
the case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine by any
Government, a valid agreement to indemnify Lessee against any of the risks
which Lessee is required hereunder to insure against by such Government shall
be considered adequate insurance to the extent of the risks and in the amounts
that are the subject of any such agreement to indemnify.

(b) Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Aircraft.
Subject to the rights of Lessee to establish and maintain self-insurance with
respect to loss or damage to aircraft (including the Aircraft) in the manner
and to the extent specified in the next sentence, Lessee shall maintain, or
cause to be maintained, in effect with insurers of recognized responsibility,
at no expense to Lessor, the

64
<PAGE> 70
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Participant, all-risk aircraft hull insurance
covering the Aircraft and all-risk coverage with respect to any Engines or
Parts while removed from the Aircraft (including, without limitation, war risk,
political risk and allied perils insurance if and to the extent the same is
maintained by Lessee or any Permitted Air Carrier subleasing the same with
respect to other aircraft owned or operated by Lessee or such Permitted Air
Carrier, as the case may be, on the same routes) which is of the type and in
substantially the amount usually carried by corporations engaged in the same or
similar business and similarly situated with Lessee; provided that (i) such
insurance (including the permitted self-insurance) shall at all times while the
Aircraft is subject to this Lease be for an amount not less than the Stipulated
Loss Value for the Aircraft from time to time and (ii) such insurance need not
cover an Engine while attached to an airframe not owned, leased or operated by
Lessee. Lessee may self-insure, by way of deductible or premium adjustment
provisions in insurance policies, the risks required to be insured against
pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in no case shall the self-insurance
(including the self-insurance permitted by Section 11(a)) with respect to all
of the aircraft and engines in Lessee's fleet (including, without limitation,
the Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month policy year the lesser of (i) 50% of the
largest replacement value of any single aircraft in Lessee's fleet or (ii)
1-1/2% of the average aggregate insurable value (for the preceding year) of all
aircraft (including, without limitation, the Aircraft) on which Lessee carries
insurance; provided that, in the event that there shall have occurred a
material adverse change in the financial con- dition of Lessee from such
condition as is reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Lessee at
December 31, 1982, then, upon not less than 30 days' written notice from Lessor
to Lessee, Lessee will, until Lessee's financial condition is on an overall
basis equivalent to its financial condition at December 31, 1982, reduce the
self-insurance permitted hereunder to such reasonable amount as Lessor may
require; provided, further, that a deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce
handling that, in the case of the Aircraft, is not in excess of the amount
customarily allowed as a deductible in the industry, shall be permitted in
addition to the above-mentioned self-insurance. Any policies carried in
accordance with this Section 11(b) and any policies taken out in substitution
or replacement for any such policies (A) shall provide that any loss in excess
of $10,000,000, up to the amount of Stipulated Loss Value, for any loss or
damage to the

65
<PAGE> 71
Aircraft (or Engines) shall be paid to the Indenture Trustee as long as the
Trust Indenture shall not have been discharged pursuant to the terms and
conditions thereof, and thereafter to Lessor, and that all other amounts shall
be payable to Lessee unless the insurer shall have received notice that an
Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default exists, in which case all
insurance proceeds up to Stipulated Loss Value and Break Amounts payable by
Lessee as Supplemental Rent, if any, shall be payable to the Indenture Trustee
or Lessor, as the case may be, (B) shall provide that in respect of the
respective interests of Lessor, of the Indenture Trustee and of each
Participant in such policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any
action or inaction of Lessee and shall insure Lessor's, the Indenture Trustee's
and each Participant's Interests, as they appear, regardless of any breach or
violation of any warranty, declaration or condition contained in such policies
by Lessee, (C) shall provide that, if such in- surance is cancelled for any
reason whatever, or any material change is made in the policy which affects the
coverage certified hereunder to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any
Participant, or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of
premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be effective as to
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant for 30 days (seven days, or
such other period as may from time to time be customarily obtainable in the
industry, in the case of any war risk, political risk and allied perils
coverage) after receipt by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or such Participant,
respectively, of written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, change
or lapse, (D) shall provide that none of Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any
Participant shall have any obligation or liability for premiums, commissions,
assessments or calls in connection with such insurance, (E) shall provide that
the insurers shall waive any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other
deduction, whether by attachment or otherwise, which they may have against
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant and shall be primary with- out
right of contribution from any other insurance which may be carried by Lessor,
the Indenture Trustee or any Participant with respect to its interests as such
in the Aircraft and (F) shall provide that the insurers shall waive any rights
of subrogation against Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and any Participant to the
extent that Lessee has waived its rights by its agreements to indemnify any
such party pursuant to this Lease or the Participation Agreement; provided,
that the exercise by insurers of rights of subrogation derived

66
<PAGE> 72
from rights retained by Lessee shall not, in any way, delay payment of a claim
that would otherwise be paid by such insurers but for the existence of rights
of subrogation derived from rights retained by Lessee. Lessee shall arrange
for appropriate certification that the requirements of this Section 11(b) have
been met to be made promptly to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Participant (and the Indenture Trustee may furnish such certification to the
Loan Participants) by each insurer or its authorized representative with
respect thereto, provided that all information contained therein shall be held
confidential by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and each Participant and shall
not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other than their bank
examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and any Person with
whom any Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations relating to the
possible transfer and sale of such Participant's Certificates or interest in
the Aircraft, as the case may be, if such Person shall have entered into an
agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(b) whereby such Person
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be required by
an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule,
regulation or order of any governmental authority. In the case of a sublease
or contract with any Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, or in
the case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine by any
Government, a valid agreement to indemnify Lessee against any of the risks
which Lessee is required hereunder to insure against by such Government in any
amount up to the Stipulated Loss Value of the Aircraft from time to time shall
be considered adequate insurance to the extent of the risks and in the amounts
that are the subject of any such agreement to indemnify.

(c) Application of Insurance Payments. As between
Lessor and Lessee it is agreed that all insurance payments received under
policies required to be maintained by Lessee hereunder, exclusive of any
payments received in excess of the Stipulated Loss Value and Break Amounts
payable by Lessee as Supplemental Rent, if any, for the Aircraft from such
policies, as the result of the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to
the Airframe or an Engine will be applied as follows:

(x) if such payments are received with respect to
the Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines installed on
the Airframe that has been or is being replaced by Lessee as
contemplated by Section 10(a),

67
<PAGE> 73
such payments shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessor, and
upon completion of such replacement be paid over to, or retained by,
Lessee;

(y) if such payments are received with respect to
the Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines installed
thereon that has not been and will not be replaced as contemplated
by Section 10(a), so much of such payments remaining after
reimbursement of Lessor for costs and expenses as shall not exceed
the Stipulated Loss Value required to be paid by Lessee pursuant to
Section 10(a) and Break Amount payable by Lessee as Supplemental
Rent, if any, shall be applied in reduction of Lessee's obligation
to pay such Stipulated Loss Value, if not already paid by Lessee,
or, if already paid by Lessee, shall be applied to reimburse Lessee
for its payment of such Stipulated Loss Value, and the balance, if
any, of such payment remaining thereafter will be paid over to, or
retained by, Lessee; and

(z) if such payments are received with respect to
an Engine under the circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b), so
much of such payments remaining after reimbursement of Lessor for
costs and expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee;
provided that Lessee shall have fully performed the terms of Section
10(b) with respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments are
made.

As between Lessor and Lessee the insurance payment
of any property damage loss received under policies maintained by Lessee in
excess of the Stipulated Loss Value and Break Amounts payable by Lessee as
Supplemental Rent, if any, for the Aircraft shall be paid to Lessee.

As between Lessor and Lessee the insurance payments
of any property damage loss received under policies required to be maintained
hereunder not constituting an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe or an
Engine will be applied in payment (or to reimburse Lessee) for repairs or for
replacement property in accordance with the terms of Sections 7 and 8, and any
balance remaining after compliance with such Sections with respect to such loss
shall be paid to Lessee. Any amount referred to in the preceding sentence or
in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the second preceding paragraph which is payable to
Lessee shall not be paid to Lessee or, if it has been previously paid directly
to

68
<PAGE> 74
Lessee, shall not be retained by Lessee, if at the time of such payment an
Event of Default or Payment or Bankruptcy Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, but shall be paid to and held by the Indenture Trustee, or if the
Trust Indenture shall have been terminated pursuant to the terms thereof,
Lessor, as security for the obligations of Lessee under this Lease, and at such
time as there shall not be continuing any such Event of Default or event, such
amount shall be paid to Lessee, provided that if any such amount has been so
held by Lessor as security for more than 90 days after such event or Event of
Default shall have occurred and during which period Lessor shall not have
exercised any remedy available to it under Section 15, then such amount shall
be paid to Lessee, unless Lessor shall have been prohibited by operation of law
or otherwise from exercising such remedies.

(d) Reports, Etc. On or before the Delivery Date,
and annually upon renewal of Lessee's insurance coverage, Lessee will furnish
to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant (and the Indenture
Trustee may furnish such reports to the Loan Participants) a report signed by a
firm of independent aircraft insurance brokers appointed by Lessee, stating the
opinion of such firm that the insurance then carried and maintained on the
Aircraft complies with the terms hereof; provided that all information
contained in such report shall be held confidential by Lessor, the Indenture
Trustee and each Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to
anyone other than their accountants, agents and legal counsel and any Person
with whom such Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations relating to
the possible transfer and sale of such Participant's Certificates or interest
in the Aircraft, as the case may be, if such Person shall have entered into an
agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(d) whereby such Person
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be required by
an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule,
regulation or order of any governmental authority. Lessee will cause such firm
to advise Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant in writing
promptly of any default in the payment of any premium and of any other act or
omission on the part of Lessee of which such firm has knowledge and which might
invalidate or render unenforceable, in whole or in part, any insurance on the
Aircraft. Lessee will also cause such firm to advise Lessor, the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Participant in writing as promptly as practicable

69
<PAGE> 75
after such firm acquires knowledge that an interruption or reduction of any
insurance carried and maintained on the Aircraft pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 11 will occur.

(e) Insurance for Own Account. Nothing in this
Section 11 shall limit or prohibit the Owner Participant (either directly or in
the name of the Owner Trustee) or Lessee from obtaining insurance for its own
account with respect to the Airframe or any Engine and any proceeds payable
thereunder shall be payable as provided in the insurance policy relating
thereto, provided that no such insurance may be obtained which would limit or
otherwise adversely affect the coverage or amounts payable under insurance
required to be maintained pursuant to this Section 11, it being understood that
all salvage rights to the Airframe or such Engine shall remain with Lessee's
insurers at all times, and provided further, that the Owner Participant may
obtain hull insurance on the Aircraft only to the extent the procurement of
such insurance does not have an adverse effect on Lessee's ability or cost to
obtain such insurance.

Section 12. Inspection. At all reasonable times
during the Term, but upon at least 10 days' prior written notice to Lessee,
Lessor and Indenture Trustee, or their authorized representatives may, subject
to the last sentence of this Section 12, conduct a visual walk-around
inspection of the Aircraft and any Engine (including a visual walk-around
inspection of the Aircraft during any regularly scheduled heavy maintenance
visit for the Aircraft conducted by Lessee during the Term) and may in- spect
the books and records of Lessee relating thereto; provided that (a) such
representative shall be covered by such insurance as shall be customary in
connection with risks of the type incurred in connection with any such
inspection, (b) any such inspection shall be subject to the safety, security
and workplace rules applicable at the location where such inspection is
conducted and any applicable governmental rules or regulations and (c) in the
case of an inspection during a maintenance visit, such inspection shall not in
any respect interfere with the normal conduct of such maintenance visit or
extend the time required for such maintenance visit. All information obtained
in connection with any such inspection shall be held confidential by Lessor,
the Indenture Trustee and each Participant and shall not be furnished or
disclosed by them to anyone other than their bank examiners, auditors,
accountants, agents and

70
<PAGE> 76
legal counsel and any Person with whom any Participant is in good faith
conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale of such
Participant's Certificates or interest in the Aircraft, as the case may be, if
such Person shall have entered into an agreement similar to that contained in
this Section 12 whereby such Person agrees to hold such information
confidential, and except as may be required by an order of any court or
administrative agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or order of any
governmental authority. No inspection pursuant to this Section 12 shall
interfere with the use, operation or maintenance of the Aircraft or the normal
conduct of Lessee's business, and Lessee shall not be required to undertake or
incur any additional liabilities in connection therewith. Upon receipt by
Lessee of a written request from the Owner Participant specifying that the
Owner Participant desires to have an authorized representative observe the next
scheduled basic check to be performed on the Aircraft (or substantially
equivalent successor type of maintenance work) scheduled to be performed on the
Aircraft during the Term, Lessee shall cooperate with the Owner Participant to
enable the Owner Participant's representative to observe the next scheduled
basic check to be performed on the Aircraft during the Term, including
reasonable advance notification to the Owner Participant of the time and place
of such scheduled basic check; provided that the Owner Participant's authorized
representative shall merely observe such scheduled basic check, shall not
interfere with or extend in any manner the normal conduct or duration of the
scheduled basic check, shall not be entitled to direct any of the work
performed in connection with such scheduled basic check and shall in all
respects be bound by the provisions of this Section 12 and Section 4(b). Any
inspection or observation pursuant to this Section 12 shall be at the sole risk
(including, without limitation, any risk of personal injury or death) and
expense of the party (or the party whose representative shall be) making such
inspection or observation.

Section 13. Assignment, Citizenship, Etc. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 7(b) or in the case of any requisition for use by
any Government referred to in Section 7(a), Lessee will not, without the prior
written consent of Lessor, assign any of its rights hereunder, except as
permitted by Section 13 of the Participation Agreement. Except as elsewhere
herein provided or as expressly permitted by the provisions of the
Participation Agreement, the Trust Indenture or the Trust Agreement,

71
<PAGE> 77
Lessor agrees that it will not assign or convey its right, title and interest
in and to this Lease or the Aircraft; provided, however, that, in each case
where so provided or permitted, the transferee shall be domiciled in the United
States, shall be a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning of Section
101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act, and shall assume all of the obligations of
Lessor under this Lease. The terms and provisions of this Lease shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of Lessor and Lessee and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.

Section 14. Events of Default. The following events
shall constitute Events of Default (whether any such event shall be voluntary
or involuntary or come about or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to
or in compliance with any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order,
rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body) and each such
Event of Default shall be deemed to exist and continue so long as, but only as
long as, it shall not have been remedied:

(a) Lessee shall fail to make any payment of
Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value or Termination Value within 15
days after the same shall have become due or shall fail to make any
other payment of Supplemental Rent within 20 days after written
notice of such failure by Lessor; or

(b) Lessee shall fail to carry and maintain
insurance on or with respect to the Aircraft in accordance with the
provisions of Section 11; provided that, in the case of insurance
with respect to which cancellation, change or lapse for nonpayment
of premium shall not be effective as to Lessor, the Indenture
Trustee or the Owner Participant for 30 days (seven days, or such
other period as may from time to time be customarily obtainable in
the industry, in the case of any war risk, political risk and allied
perils coverage) after receipt of notice by Lessor, the Indenture
Trustee or the Owner Participant of such cancellation, change or
lapse, no such failure to carry and maintain insurance shall
constitute an Event of Default hereunder until the earlier of (i)
the date such failure shall have continued unremedied for a period
of 20 days (five days in the case of any war risk, political risk
and allied perils coverage) after receipt by Lessor of the notice of
cancellation, change or lapse referred to in Section 11(a)(C) or
11(b)(C),

72
<PAGE> 78
or (ii) the date such insurance is not in effect as to any of
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant; or

(c) Lessee shall operate the Aircraft at a time
when public liability insurance required by Section 11(a) shall not
be in effect; or

(d) Lessee shall fail to perform or observe any
covenant, condition or agreement to be performed or observed by it
hereunder or under the Participation Agreement (other than as
provided in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 14), and
such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days after
written notice thereof by Lessor; provided that, if such failure is
capable of being remedied, no such failure shall constitute an Event
of Default hereunder for such longer period (not to exceed 360 days)
during which Lessee is diligently proceeding to remedy such failure;
or

(e) any representation or warranty made by Lessee
in this Lease or in the Participation Agreement shall prove to have
been incorrect in any material respect at the time made, and such
incorrectness shall continue to be material and unremedied for a
period of 30 days after written notice thereof by Lessor; or

(f) Lessee shall consent to the appointment of a
receiver, trustee or liquidator of itself or of a substantial part
of its property, or Lessee shall admit in writing its inability to
pay its debts generally as they come due, or shall make a general
assignment for the benefit of creditors; or

(g) Lessee shall file a voluntary petition in
bankruptcy or a voluntary petition or an answer seeking
reorganization in a proceeding under any bankruptcy laws (as now or
hereafter in effect) or an answer admitting the material allegations
of a petition filed against Lessee in any such proceeding, or Lessee
shall by voluntary petition, answer or consent seek relief under the
provisions of any other now existing or future bankruptcy or other
similar law providing for the reorganization or winding-up of
corporations, or providing for an agreement, composition, extension
or adjustment with its creditors; or

73
<PAGE> 79
(h) an order, judgment or decree shall be entered
by any court of competent jurisdiction appointing, without the
consent of Lessee, a receiver, trustee or liquidator of Lessee or of
any substantial part of its property, or sequestering any
substantial part of the property of Lessee, and any such order,
judgment or decree of appointment or sequestration shall remain in
force undismissed, unstayed or unvacated for a period of 90 days
after the date of entry thereof; or

(i) a petition against Lessee in a proceeding
under the Federal bankruptcy laws or other insolvency laws, as now
or hereafter in effect, shall be filed and shall not be withdrawn or
dismissed within 90 days thereafter, or, under the provisions of any
law providing for reorganization or winding-up of corporations which
may apply to Lessee, any court of competent jurisdiction shall
assume jurisdiction, custody or control of Lessee or of any
substantial part of its property, and such jurisdiction, custody or
control shall remain in force unrelinquished, unstayed or
unterminated for a period of 90 days;

provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Lease, any failure of Lessee to perform or observe any covenant, condition, or
agreement herein shall not constitute an Event of Default if such failure is
caused solely by reason of an event referred to in the definition of "Event of
Loss" as long as Lessee is continuing to comply with the applicable terms of
Section 10.

Section 15. Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default and at any time thereafter as long as the same shall be
continuing, Lessor may, at its option, declare this Lease to be in default by a
written notice to Lessee (provided that this Lease shall be deemed to have been
declared in default without the necessity of such written notice upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default described in paragraph (f), (g), (h) or (i)
of Section 14 hereof); and at any time thereafter, so long as Lessee shall not
have remedied all outstanding Events of Default, Lessor may do one or more of
the following with respect to all or any part of the Airframe and any Engines
as Lessor in its sole discretion shall elect, to the extent permitted by, and
subject to compliance with any mandatory requirements of, applicable law then
in effect; provided that during any period the Aircraft is subject to the Civil
Reserve Air Fleet Program in accordance with the provisions of

74
<PAGE> 80
Section 7(b) and in the possession of the United States government or an
instrumentality or agency thereof, Lessor shall not, on account of any Event of
Default, be entitled to do any of the following in such manner as to limit
Lessee's control under this Lease (or any sublessee's control under any
sublease permitted by the terms of this Lease) of any Airframe or any Engines,
unless at least 60 days' (or such lesser period as may then be applicable under
the Military Airlift Command Program of the United States government) prior
written notice of default hereunder shall have been given by Lessor by
registered or certified mail to Lessee (or any sublessee) with a copy addressed
to the Contracting Office Representative for the Military Airlift Command of
the United States Air Force under any contract with Lessee (or any sublessee)
relating to the Aircraft:

(a) cause Lessee, upon the written demand of
Lessor and at Lessee's expense, to return promptly, and Lessee shall
return promptly, all or such part of the Airframe or any Engine as
Lessor may so demand to Lessor or its order in the manner and
condition required by, and otherwise in accordance with all the
provisions of, Section 5, as if the Airframe or such Engine were
being returned at the end of the Term, or Lessor, at its option, may
enter upon the premises where all or any part of the Airframe or any
Engine are located and take immediate possession of and remove the
same (together with any engine which is not an Engine but which is
installed on the Airframe, subject to all of the rights of the
owner, lessor, lienor or secured party of such engine; provided that
the Airframe with an engine (which is not an Engine) installed
thereon may be flown or returned only to a location within the
continental United States, and such engine shall be held for the
account of any such owner, lessor, lienor or secured party or, if
owned by Lessee, may, at the option of Lessor, be exchanged with
Lessee for an Engine in accordance with the provisions of Section
5(b)) by summary proceedings or otherwise, all without liability
accruing to Lessor for or by reason of such entry or taking of
possession or removal, whether for the restoration of damage to
property caused by such taking or otherwise;

(b) sell all or any part of the Airframe and any
Engine at public or private sale, as Lessor may determine, or
otherwise dispose of, hold, use, operate, lease to others or keep
idle all or any part of the

75
<PAGE> 81
Airframe or such Engine as Lessor, in its sole discretion, may
determine, all free and clear of any rights of Lessee except as
hereinafter specifically set forth in this Section 15 and without
any duty to account to Lessee with respect to such action or
inaction or for any proceeds with respect thereto, except to the
extent required by paragraph (d) below if Lessor elects to exercise
its rights under such paragraph (d) in lieu of its rights under
paragraph (c) below;

(c) whether or not Lessor shall have exercised,
or shall thereafter at any time exercise, any of its rights under
paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) above with respect to all or any part
of the Airframe or any Engine, Lessor, by written notice to Lessee
specifying a payment date (which date shall be deemed to be a
"Termination Date" for purposes of computing Termination Value)
which shall be not earlier than 30 days from the date of such
notice, may demand that Lessee pay to Lessor, and Lessee shall pay
Lessor, on the payment date specified in such notice, as liquidated
damages for loss of a bargain and not as a penalty (in lieu of the
Basic Rent due for Lease Periods commencing on or after the Lease
Period Date next preceding the payment date specified in such
notice), if the Termination Date is a Lease Period Date, all Basic
Rent due and payable on or prior to that date pursuant to Section
3(b) and remaining unpaid (it being understood and agreed that
Lessee shall not be required to pay the portion, if any, of the
Basic Rent installment due and payable on such date designated in
Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in advance), plus
whichever of the following amounts Lessor, in its sole discretion,
shall specify in such notice: (i) an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of the Termination Value for the Airframe or such Engine or
part thereof, computed as of the payment date specified in such
notice, over the aggregate fair market rental value (computed as
hereafter provided in this Section 15) of the Airframe or such
Engine or part thereof for the remainder of the Term, after
discounting such aggregate fair market rental value semi-annually
(effective on the Lease Period Dates) to present worth as of the
payment date specified in such notice at the Assumed Debt Rate on
the date of such notice; or (ii) an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of the Termination Value for the Airframe or such

76
<PAGE> 82
Engine or part thereof computed as of the payment date specified in
such notice, over the fair market sales value (com- puted as
hereafter provided in this Section 15) of the Airframe or such
Engine or part thereof as of the payment date specified in such
notice;

(d) in the event Lessor, pursuant to paragraph
(b) above, shall have sold all or any part of the Airframe or any
Engine, Lessor, in lieu of exercising its rights under paragraph (c)
above with respect to the Airframe or such Engine or part thereof,
may, if it shall so elect, demand that Lessee pay to Lessor, and
Lessee shall pay to Lessor, on the date of such sale (which date
shall be deemed a "Termination Date" for purposes of computing
Termination Value), as liquidated damages for loss of a bargain and
not as a penalty (in lieu of the Basic Rent due for Lease Periods
commencing on or after the Lease Period Date next preceding the date
of such sale), if the Termination Date is a Lease Period Date, all
Basic Rent due and payable on or prior to that date pursuant to
Section 3(b) and remaining unpaid (it being understood and agreed
that Lessee shall not be required to pay the portion, if any, of the
Basic Rent installment due and payable on such date designated in
Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in advance), plus
the amount of any deficiency between the net proceeds of such sale
and the Termination Value for the Airframe or such Engine or part
thereof, computed as of the date of such sale; and/or

(e) Lessor may terminate or rescind this Lease,
and/or may exercise any other right or remedy which may be available
to it under applicable law or may proceed by appropriate court
action to enforce the terms or to recover damages for the breach
hereof.

In addition, Lessee shall be liable, except as
otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) above, with- out duplication of
any amounts payable hereunder, for any and all unpaid Rent (including, without
limitation, any Break Amount) due hereunder before, after or during the
exercise of any of the foregoing remedies and for all legal fees and other
costs and expenses incurred by reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default
or the exercise of Lessor's remedies with respect thereto, including all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the retaking or

77
<PAGE> 83
return of the Airframe or any Engine in accordance with the terms of Section 5
or in placing such Airframe or Engine in the condition and airworthiness
required by such Section; provided that, if Lessee returns or surrenders
possession of all or any part of the Airframe or any Engine in accordance with
this Section 15, there shall be deducted from each payment of Basic Rent
becoming due after such return or surrender the net proceeds, if any, received
by Lessor from leasing the Aircraft, the Airframe or any Engine to any Person
other than the Lessee and provided further that, if Lessor does not within 365
days after the date of such return or surrender exercise its rights under
paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) above with respect to such Airframe or Engine or
part thereof, there shall be deducted from each payment of Basic Rent becoming
due after the expiration of such 365-day period an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of (x) the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate fair market
rental value (computed as hereafter provided in this Section 15) of such
Airframe or Engine or part thereof, for the remainder of the Term after the
expiration of such 365-day period (computed as of the date of such expiration),
by the number of Basic Rent installments remaining with respect to the Aircraft
after the expiration of such 365-day period to the end of the Term over (y) any
proceeds deducted from such payment of Basic Rent pursuant to the second
preceding proviso; provided, further, that Lessor and Lessee agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Lease, the Trust
Indenture, the Participation Agreement, the Tax Indemnity Agreement or any
other document or instrument relating hereto or thereto, Lessee shall have no
responsibility or liability for any amounts payable to the Holders of
Certificates in respect of the Break Amount, if any, payable with respect to
the Certificates as a result of (x) a purchase of the Certificates pursuant to
Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture or (y) an Indenture Default that does not
also con- stitute an Event of Default. For purposes of paragraph (c) above and
the preceding sentence, the "aggregate fair market rental value" or the "fair
market sales value" of the Airframe or any Engine or any Part shall be as
specified in an Independent Appraisal. At any sale of the Airframe or any
Engine or Part pursuant to this Section 15, Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or
any Participant may bid for and purchase such property. Except as otherwise
expressly provided above, no remedy referred to in this Section 15 is intended
to be exclusive, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to any other
remedy referred to above or otherwise available to Lessor at law or in equity;
and the exercise or beginning of exercise by

78
<PAGE> 84
Lessor of any one or more of such remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous
or later exercise by Lessor of any or all of such other remedies. No express
or implied waiver by Lessor of any Event of Default shall in any way be, or be
construed to be, a waiver of any future or subsequent Event of Default.

Section 16. Federal Bankruptcy Act. To the extent
consistent with the provisions of Title 11 U.S.C. Section 1110, or any
analogous section of the Federal bankruptcy laws, as amended from time to time,
it is hereby expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other provisions of the
Federal bankruptcy laws, as amended from time to time, any right of Lessor to
take possession of the Aircraft in compliance with the provisions of this Lease
shall not be affected by the provisions of the Federal bankruptcy laws, as
amended from time to time. The Lessee hereby acknowledges that the Lessor and
the Indenture Trustee are entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 of the
Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, with respect to the Aircraft.

Section 17. Further Assurances; Financial
Information. Forthwith upon the execution and delivery of each Lease
Supplement and Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement, Lessee will cause such
Lease Supplement and Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement (and, in the case
of the initial Lease Supplement and Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement,
this Lease, the Trust Indenture and the Trust Agreement) to be duly filed and,
except with respect to the Trust Agreement, recorded in accordance with the
Federal Aviation Act. In addition, each of Lessor and Lessee will promptly and
duly execute and deliver to the other party hereto such further documents and
assurances and take such further action as such other party may from time to
time reasonably request in order effectively to carry out the intent and
purpose of this Lease, including, without limitation, if requested by Lessor,
the execution and delivery of supplements or amendments hereto, in recordable
form, subjecting to this Lease any Replacement Airframe or Replacement Engine
and the recording or filing of counterparts hereof or thereof, in accordance
with the laws of such jurisdictions as Lessor may from time to time deem
advisable. Lessee also agrees to furnish Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the
Owner Participant (i) within 60 days after the end of each of the first three
quarterly fiscal periods in each fiscal year of Lessee, a consolidated balance
sheet of Lessee and its consolidated subsidiaries prepared by it as of the
close of such period, together with

79
<PAGE> 85
the related consolidated statements of income for such period, (ii) within 120
days after the close of each fiscal year of Lessee, a consolidated balance
sheet of Lessee and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the close of such
fiscal year, together with the related consolidated statements of income for
such fiscal year, as certified by independent public accountants, (iii) within
120 days after the close of each fiscal year of Lessee, a certificate of
Lessee, signed by a Responsible Officer of Lessee, to the effect that the
signer has reviewed the relevant terms of the Participation Agreement and this
Lease and has made, or caused to be made under his or her supervision, a review
of the transactions and condition of Lessee during the accounting period
covered by the financial statements referred to in clause (ii) above, and that
such review has not disclosed the existence during such accounting period, nor
does the signer have knowledge of the existence as at the date of such
certificate, of any condition or event which con- stitutes an Event of Default
or an event which, with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both,
would become an Event of Default, or, if any such condition or event existed or
exists, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof and what action
Lessee has taken or is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto and (iv)
from time to time, such other nonconfidential infor- mation as Lessor may
reasonably request.

Section 18. Notices. All notices required under the
terms and provisions of this Lease shall be in English and in writing, and any
such notice may be given by United States mail, courier service, telegram,
telemessage, telecopy, telefax, telex, cable or facsimile (confirmed by
telephone or in writing in the case of notice by telegram, telemessage,
telecopy, telefax, telex, cable or facsimile) or any other customary means of
communication, and any such notice shall be effective when delivered, or if
mailed, three days after deposit in the United States mail with proper postage

Lake City, Utah 84111, Attn: Corporate Trust Department (AA 1992 MF-1), or

Section 19. No Setoff, Counterclaim, Etc. This 
Lease is a net lease and Lessee's obligation to pay all Rent payable hereunder
shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 3(f), be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including,
without limitation, (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
right which Lessee may have against Lessor, any Participant, the Indenture
Trustee or anyone else for any reason whatsoever, (ii) any defect in the title,
airworthiness, condition, design, operation or fitness for use of, or any
damage to or loss or destruction of, the Aircraft, or any interruption or
cessation in or prohibition of the use or possession thereof by Lessee for any
reason whatsoever, (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceedings by or against Lessee or any other Person or (iv) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not unforeseen or
similar to any of the foregoing. If for any reason whatsoever this Lease shall
be terminated in whole or in part by operation of law or otherwise except as
specifically provided herein, Lessee nonetheless agrees to pay to Lessor or to
the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, an amount equal to each Basic Rent
and Supplemental Rent payment at the time such payment would have become due
and payable in accordance with the terms hereof had this Lease not been
terminated in whole or in part. Lessee hereby waives, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, any and all rights which it may now have or which at any
time hereafter may be conferred upon it, by statute or otherwise, to terminate,
cancel, quit or surrender this Lease except in accordance with the express
terms hereof. Each payment of Rent made by Lessee shall be final as to Lessor
and Lessee, and Lessee will not seek to recover all or any part of any such
payment of Rent from Lessor or from the Indenture Trustee for any reason
whatsoever; provided that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to modify
or limit in any way Lessee's rights under Section 3(f).

81
<PAGE> 87
Section 20. Renewal Options; Purchase Options. (a)
Renewal Options. Lessee shall have the right to extend this Lease with respect
to the Aircraft for successive periods of one year each (each such period
commencing at the end of the Term, being hereinafter referred to also as a
"Renewal Term"). Such options to renew shall be exercised upon irrevocable
written notice from Lessee to Lessor given when no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing and not less than 270 days prior to the commencement
of the first day of each Renewal Term and if no Event of Default (or Payment or
Bankruptcy Default) shall have occurred and be continuing on such date, then
this Lease shall be extended for the additional period of such Renewal Term on
the same conditions provided for herein, and upon such extension, the word
"Term" whenever used herein shall be deemed to refer, unless the context
otherwise requires, to such Renewal Term; provided that the rental payable
during such Renewal Term shall be at a rental rate equal to (i) in the case of
each of the first 2 Renewal Term(s), the lesser of (x) the Renewal Term Rate
and (y) the fair market rental value for the Aircraft determined within 90 days
after such notice of renewal by mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if
they shall be unable to agree, by an Independent Appraisal, and (ii) in the
case of any subsequent Renewal Term, the fair market rental value of the
Aircraft determined within 90 days after such notice of renewal by mutual
agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they shall be unable to agree, by an
Independent Appraisal; and provided further, that the provisions of Section 9
shall not be applicable during any Renewal Term. The amounts which are payable
during any such Renewal Term in respect of Termination Value as used in Section
15 and Stipulated Loss Value with respect to the Aircraft shall be determined
on the basis of the fair market sales value of the Aircraft as of the
commencement of such Renewal Term, amortized on a straight-line basis over such
Renewal Term to the fair market sales value of the Aircraft as of the
expiration of such Renewal Term, as such fair market sales value in each case
is determined prior to the commencement of such Renewal Term by mutual
agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they shall be unable to agree, as
determined by an Independent Appraisal.

(b) Special Purchase Option. On November 26, 2008,
or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day
(the "Special Purchase Option Date"), Lessee shall have the right, at its
option, to purchase the Aircraft. Such option to purchase the Aircraft

82
<PAGE> 88
shall be exercised upon irrevocable written notice from Lessee to Lessor given
not less than 120 days prior to the Special Purchase Option Date. In the event
that Lessee shall have so elected to purchase the Aircraft, on the Special
Purchase Option Date, (x) Lessee shall pay the Basic Rent installment due on
the Special Purchase Option Date (it being understood and agreed that Lessee
shall not be required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic Rent
installment designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in
advance), and at its option shall either (A) pay to Lessor (or, in the case of
Supplemental Rent which constitutes Excepted Property, to the Person entitled
thereto), in funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), (1) an amount
determined by multiplying Lessor's Cost by the Special Purchase Price
Percentage (the "Special Purchase Price") (which is equal to the greater of the
estimated fair market sales value of the Aircraft, taking into account the
encumbrance of the Lease and the estimated fair market sales value of the
Aircraft determined without regard to the encumbrance of the Lease, both as of
the Special Purchase Option Date as set forth in the opinion received by the
Owner Participant described in Section 4(U) of the Participation Agreement),
pro- vided, however, and anything in this Section 20(b) to the contrary
notwithstanding, in no event shall the Special Purchase Price be less than the
principal of, and accrued interest on, the Certificates outstanding on the
Special Purchase Option Date, plus (2) all Supplemental Rent due and owing on
the Special Purchase Option Date, or (B) assume all of the rights and
obligations of the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture in respect of the
Certificates (including, without limitation, any scheduled payment of principal
of or accrued interest on the Certificates due and payable on the Special
Purchase Option Date but only to the extent that any Basic Rent installment
payable by Lessee pursuant to clause (x) above or previously paid pursuant to
this Lease does not cover such scheduled payment of principal or accrued
interest on the Certificates and excluding any obligations or liabilities of
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity incurred on or prior to the
Special Purchase Option Date, which obligations and liabilities shall remain
the sole responsibility of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity) in
accordance with Section 2.16 of the Trust Indenture and simultaneously shall
pay to Lessor, in funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of the Special Purchase Price over an amount equal to
the sum of the principal of the outstanding Certificates on such Special
Purchase Option Date, after taking into account any

83
<PAGE> 89
payments of principal or interest made in respect of the outstanding
Certificates on such Special Purchase Option Date (assuming that all other
payments of principal or interest on the Certificates have been paid) and (y)
Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except as to
Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the definition
thereof)), all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the Aircraft
and, if Lessee shall not have assumed the rights and obligations of the Owner
Trustee under the Trust Indenture in respect of the Certificates as provided
for above, Lessor will request the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to
Lessee an appropriate instrument releasing the Airframe and Engines with
respect to which title is transferred from the lien of the Trust Indenture and
releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the
assignment and pledge thereunder.

(c) Purchase Option. Lessee shall have the right,
at its option, at the expiration of the Term or of any Renewal Term, to elect
to purchase the Aircraft at a price equal to the fair market sales value of the
Aircraft, as determined as provided below. Such option to purchase shall be
exercised upon written notice from Lessee to Lessor given not less than 270
days prior to the last day of the Term or any Renewal Term, as the case may be.
If Lessee shall have so elected to purchase the Aircraft, Lessor shall transfer
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens (disregarding for
this purpose the proviso to the definition thereof)) the Aircraft to Lessee,
against payment by Lessee of the applicable purchase price in immediately
available funds. In order to enable Lessee to determine whether it wishes to
exercise such election to purchase, the fair market sales value for the
Aircraft shall, at Lessee's request made in sufficient time to permit such
determination, be determined not less than 300 days prior to the end of the
Term or any Renewal Term by mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they
shall be unable to agree, by an Independent Appraisal.

Section 21. Successor Owner Trustee. Lessee agrees
that, in the case of the appointment of any successor Owner Trustee pursuant to
the terms of the Trust Agreement and Section 9(d) of the Participation
Agreement, such successor Owner Trustee shall succeed to all the rights, powers
and title of Lessor hereunder and shall be deemed to be Lessor of the Aircraft
for all purposes without in any way altering the terms of this Lease or
Lessee's obligations

84
<PAGE> 90
hereunder. Lessee further agrees that in the case of the appointment of any
additional trustee to act as co-trustee or as a separate trustee pursuant to
the terms of the Trust Agreement and Section 9(d) of the Participation
Agreement, such additional trustee shall acquire such rights, power and title
of Lessor hereunder as are specified in the instruments appointing such
additional trustee, without in any way altering the terms of this Lease or
Lessee's obligations hereunder. One such appointment and designation of a
successor or additional Owner Trustee shall not exhaust the right to appoint
and designate further successor or additional Owner Trustees pursuant to the
Trust Agreement and Section 9(d) of the Participation Agreement, but such right
may be exercised repeatedly as long as this Lease shall be in effect.

Section 22. Security for Lessor's Obligation to
Holders of Certificates. In order to secure the indebted- ness evidenced by
the Certificates, Lessor has agreed in the Trust Indenture, among other things,
to assign to the Indenture Trustee this Lease and the Lease Supplements and to
mortgage in favor of the Indenture Trustee all of Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to the Aircraft, subject to the reservations and conditions
therein set forth. To the extent, if any, that this Lease Agreement
constitutes chattel paper (as such term is defined in the Uniform Commercial
Code as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction), no security interest in this
Lease may be created through the transfer or possession of any counterpart
hereof other than the original counterpart, which shall be identified as the
counterpart containing the receipt therefor executed by the Indenture Trustee
on the signature page thereof.

Section 23. Lessor's Right to Perform for Lessee. 
If Lessee fails to make any payment of Rent required to be made by it hereunder
or fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein and
such failure can be cured with the payment of money, Lessor may, on behalf of
Lessee and upon prior notice to Lessee, itself make such payment. The amount
of any such payment and the amount of the reasonable expenses of Lessor
incurred in connection with such payment shall be deemed Supplemental Rent,
payable by Lessee upon demand.

Section 24. Maintenance of Certain Engines.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an aircraft engine
which is not an Engine, but which is

85
<PAGE> 91
installed on the Airframe, shall be maintained in accordance with Section 7(a).

Section 25. Investment of Security Funds;
Miscellaneous. Any moneys required to be paid to or retained by Lessor which
are not required to be paid to Lessee pursuant to Section 10(f) or 11(b) solely
because an Event of Default (or Payment or Bankruptcy Default) hereunder shall
have occurred, or which are required to be paid to Lessee pursuant to Section
10(c) or 11(b) after completion of a replacement to be made pursuant to Section
10(a) shall, until paid to Lessee as provided in Section 10 or 11 or applied as
provided herein or in the Trust Agreement and Trust Indenture, be invested in
Permitted Investments by Lessor (unless the Trust Indenture shall not have been
discharged, in which case, by the Indenture Trustee as provided in Section 3.07
of the Trust Indenture) from time to time as directed in writing by Lessee. So
long as no Payment or Bankruptcy Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, there shall be promptly remitted to Lessee as a

Section 27. Sublessee's Performance and Rights. Any
obligation imposed on Lessee in this Lease shall require only that Lessee
perform or cause to be performed such obligation, even if stated herein as a
direct obligation, and the performance of any such obligation by any sublessee
or transferee under a sublease or transfer agreement then in effect shall
constitute performance by Lessee and to the extent of such performance
discharge such obligation by Lessee. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, any right granted to Lessee in this Lease shall grant Lessee the right
to exercise such right or permit such right to be exercised by any such
sublessee or transferee, it being understood that this sentence is subject to
the proviso immediately following clause (ix) of Section 7(b). The inclusion
of specific references to obligations or rights of any such sublessee or
transferee in certain provisions of this Lease shall not in any way prevent or
diminish the application of the provisions of the two sentences immediately
preceding with respect to obligations or rights in respect of which specific
reference to any such sublessee or transferee has not been made in this Lease.

Section 28. Miscellaneous. Any provision of this
Lease which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. This Lease
may be executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed and delivered, subject to Section 21, shall be an original,
but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same
instrument. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lessee hereby waives
any provision of law which renders any provision hereof prohibited or
unenforceable in any respect. No term or provision of this Lease may be
changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which the enforcement of the change,
waiver, discharge or termination is sought. This Lease shall constitute an
agreement of lease, and nothing herein shall be construed as conveying to
Lessee any right, title or interest in the Aircraft except as a lessee only.
The section and paragraph headings in this Lease and the table of contents are
for convenience of reference only and shall not modify, define, expand or limit
any of the terms or provisions hereof and all references herein to numbered

87
<PAGE> 93
sections, unless otherwise indicated, are to sections of this Lease. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 3(b), whenever the date scheduled for any payment
of Rent to be made hereunder shall not be a Business Day, then such payment
need not be made on such scheduled date but may be made on the next succeeding
Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such scheduled date
and (provided such payment is made on such next succeeding Business Day) no
interest shall accrue on the amount of such payment from and after such
scheduled date to the time of such payment on such next succeeding Business
Day. Lessee agrees that all Rent shall be paid by it from the United States.

THIS LEASE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED IN THE STATE
OF NEW YORK AND SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF
CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE.

Termination Date, whether or not Lessee is thereby
electing to purchase the Aircraft on such Special
Termination Date as provided in Section 9(e). The
termination of this Lease shall be effective, subject
to the conditions set forth in this Section 9, on (A)
if Lessee has not elected to purchase the Aircraft as
provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected to
sell the Aircraft, as provided below, the date of sale
of the Aircraft, if any, referred to in Section 9(b),
(B) if Lessee has not elected to purchase the Aircraft
as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected to
retain the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(d), the
date of termination referred to in Section 9(d), or
(C) if Lessee has elected to purchase the Aircraft as
provided in Section 9(e), the date of purchase
referred to in Section 9(e). Where Lessee has not
elected to purchase the Aircraft as provided for in
Section 9(e), Lessor or the Owner Participant shall
give Lessee irrevocable notice of its election to sell
or retain the Aircraft

10

Series AA

<PAGE> 14

no later than 30 days prior to the Termination
Contract Date. In the event Lessor or the Owner
Participant shall fail to give notice pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, notice of its election
to sell the Aircraft shall be deemed to have been
given as of such thirtieth day prior to the
Termination Contract Date. Unless Lessor or the Owner
Participant shall have given to Lessee a timely notice
of its election to retain the Aircraft as provided in
Section 9(d), Lessee (1) shall withdraw such
termination notice on the Termination Contract Date if
the Person who shall have submitted the highest cash
bid notified by Lessee to Lessor or by Lessor or Owner
Participant to Lessee pursuant to Section 9(b) prior
to the Termination Contract Date (or, with the consent
of Lessor, another person who shall have submitted a
bid for the purchase of the Aircraft, acceptable to
Lessor and Lessee) shall not have entered into a
binding contract of sale on or prior to such
Termination Contract Date reasonably acceptable to the
Owner Participant providing for the sale by Lessor
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's
Liens) for cash of the Airframe and the Engines
installed thereon to such Person (the "Contract
Purchaser") (Lessor hereby agreeing, subject to
Lessor's right to retain the Aircraft, promptly to
execute and deliver any such contract of sale in the
form thereof furnished by Lessee for execution and
delivery and Lessee hereby agreeing to consult with
the Owner Participant regarding the terms of such
contract of sale and to submit the execution form
thereof to the Owner Participant a reasonable period
of time prior to the Termination Contract Date) and
(2) may withdraw the termination notice referred to
above at any time on or prior to the Termination
Contract Date, whereupon this Lease shall continue in
full force and effect. In the event Lessee withdraws,
on or before the Termination Contract Date, a notice
of termination given pursuant to this Section 9(a) or
such notice is deemed withdrawn pursuant to the final
sentence of Section 9(b) or if this Lease is not
terminated on a proposed Termination Date pursuant to
this Section 9 as a result of a breach by Lessee of
its obligations hereunder, Lessee will reimburse
Lessor and the Owner Participant for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including any reasonable
brokers' fees) incurred by them in connection with the
proposed sale, except Lessee shall not be obligated to
reimburse Lessor or the Owner

11

Series AA

<PAGE> 15

Participant for any out-of-pocket expenses to
the extent Lessor or the Owner Participant, as the
case may be, shall have failed to comply with its
obligations under this Section 9. Lessee shall not be
entitled to exercise its right of termination provided
for in this Section 9(a) more than four times during
the Term (not including for purposes of this sentence
any exercise by Lessee of such right of termination
immediately following a failure of this Lease to be
terminated solely by reason of Lessor's or the Owner
Participant's failure to comply with its obligations
under this Section 9).

(b) Sale of Aircraft. If Lessee has not
elected to purchase the Aircraft as provided in
Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected or is deemed to
have elected to sell the Aircraft pursuant to Section
9(a), Lessee will have the option of acting as
non-exclusive agent for Lessor to obtain bids for the
cash purchase of the Aircraft. Lessor agrees to pay
Lessee a commercially reasonable brokerage fee based
on the then current industry practice in the event
that Lessee locates the Person who purchases the
Aircraft pursuant to this Section 9(b); provided that
the foregoing shall not derogate from Lessee's
obligations set forth in clause (1) of the sixth
sentence of this paragraph. If Lessee acts as such
agent, Lessee shall, promptly upon receipt of any cash
bid for the Aircraft (but in no event later than 10
Business Days prior to the Termination Contract Date)
notify Lessor and the Owner Participant in writing of
the amount and terms of each such bid and the name and
the address of the Person submitting each such bid.
Lessor and the Owner Participant may also, at their
expense (which expense, including without limitation
any broker's or finder's fees or commissions, shall,
subject to the penultimate sentence of paragraph (a)
of this Section 9, be for the Owner Participant's own
account), independently obtain cash bids for such
purchase and, in the event Lessor or the Owner
Participant receives any such bid, Lessor or the Owner
Participant, as the case may be, shall promptly notify
Lessee in writing of the amount and terms of such bid
and the name and address of the Person submitting such
bid; provided that the foregoing shall not derogate
from Lessee's obligations set forth in clause (1) of
the sixth sentence of this paragraph. On the
Termination Date, (x) Lessee shall, subject to receipt
by Lessor of all amounts owing to Lessor pur-

12

Series AA

<PAGE> 16

suant to the next sentence (other than amounts 
payable by Lessee), deliver the Aircraft at a location
selected by Lessee to the Contract Purchaser (or such
other purchaser acceptable to Lessor and Lessee), in
the same manner as if delivery were made to Lessor at
the end of the Term pursuant to Section 5, and shall
duly transfer to Lessor title to any engines installed
on the Airframe but not owned by Lessor, all in
accordance with the terms of Section 5, and (y) Lessor
shall simultaneously therewith sell, without recourse
or warranty (except as to the absence of Lessor's
Liens (disregarding for this purpose the proviso to
the definition thereof)), for cash all of Lessor's
right, title and interest in and to the Aircraft to
such Contract Purchaser (or other purchaser). The
total selling price realized at such sale shall be
retained by Lessor, and, in addition, on the
Termination Date, Lessee shall pay to Lessor or, in
the case of Supplemental Rent, to the Persons entitled
thereto, in funds of the type specified in Section
3(d), an amount equal to the sum of (1) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Termination Value for the Aircraft as
of the Termination Date, over (B) the proceeds of the
sale of the Aircraft after deducting (i) any
reasonable brokerage or finders' fee payable by Lessor
or the Owner Participant, (ii) any other reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lessor and the
Owner Participant, and (iii) any sale or transfer
taxes payable by Lessor or the Owner Participant in
connection with such sale, plus (2) that amount of
interest that will accrue on the principal of all
Outstanding Certificates during the period from and
including the Termination Date to but excluding the
Redemption Date specified in Section 6.01 of the Trust
Indenture, plus (3) all Supplemental Rent (including,
without limitation, Premium Amount, if any), other
than Termination Value, due and owing on the
Termination Date, plus (4) if the Termination Date is
a Lease Period Date, the Basic Rent installment due
and payable on that date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it
being understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be
required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic
Rent installment designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent
Schedule as being payable in advance). If on or prior
to the scheduled Termination Date no sale of the
Aircraft shall have occurred and if Lessor shall not
have elected to retain the Aircraft in accordance with
Section 9(d) or Lessee shall not have

13

Series AA

<PAGE> 17

elected to purchase the Aircraft in accordance
with Section 9(e), Lessee's notice given pursuant to
Section 9(a) shall be deemed to be withdrawn as of
such scheduled Termination Date and this Lease shall
continue in full force and effect. Without the
written consent of the Owner Participant, neither
Lessee nor any of its Affiliates may bid on the
Aircraft in connection with a termination of this
Lease pursuant to Section 9(a)(i).

(c) Certain Obligations upon Sale of
Aircraft. Upon the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to
and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(b),
Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or
warranty (except as to the absence of Lessor's Liens
(disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the
definition thereof)), all of Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to any Engines constituting part of
the Aircraft but which are not then installed on the
Aircraft. Lessor shall be under no duty to solicit
bids, to inquire into the efforts of Lessee to obtain
bids or otherwise take any action in connection with
the sale of the Aircraft under Section 9(b), other
than to transfer to the purchaser of the Aircraft (or
to such purchaser and to Lessee, as the case may be),
without recourse or warranty (except as to the absence
of Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the
proviso to the definition thereof)), all of Lessor's
right, title and interest in and to the Aircraft
against receipt of the payments provided for herein,
and to pay the amounts, if any, required to be paid by
Lessor under Section 9(b) or this Section 9(c), and to
request the Loan Trustee upon the sale of the Aircraft
pursuant to Section 9(b) to execute and deliver to
such purchaser (or to such purchaser and to Lessee, as
the case may be) an appropriate instrument releasing
the Aircraft from the lien of the Trust Indenture and
releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase
Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge
under the Trust Indenture. Lessor agrees to notify
promptly Lessee of the appointment by Lessor of any
broker or finder (other than Lessee) in connection
with the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(b)
and to pay the fees or commissions of any such broker
or finder employed by Lessor in connection with the
sale of the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(b);
provided that nothing in this Section 9(c) shall
derogate from

14

Series AA

<PAGE> 18

Lessee's obligations set forth in clause (1) of
the sixth sentence of Section 9(b).

(d) Retention of Aircraft by Lessor. If
Lessee has not elected to purchase the Aircraft as
provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected to
retain the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(a), on the
Termination Date specified in Lessee's termination
notice, Lessor shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Loan Trustee in funds of the type specified in Section
3(d), an amount equal to (1) the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Certificates and all accrued
interest thereon, plus (2) that amount of interest
that will accrue on the principal of all Outstanding
Certificates during the period from and including the
Termination Date to but excluding the Redemption Date
specified in Section 6.01 of the Trust Indenture, plus
(3) all other sums due and payable to the Indenture
Trustee on such Termination Date under the Trust
Indenture, the Participation Agreement or such
Certificates. Subject to receipt by the Loan Trustee
of such funds, on the Termination Date, (i) Lessee (x)
shall deliver the Aircraft to Lessor in the same
manner as if delivery were made to Lessor at the end
of the Term pursuant to Section 5, and shall duly
transfer to Lessor title to any engines installed on
the Airframe but not owned by Lessor, all in
accordance with the terms of Section 5, and (y) shall
pay to Lessor or to the Persons entitled thereto, in
funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), all
Supplemental Rent (including, without limitation,
Premium Amount, if any), other than Termination Value,
due and owing on the Termination Date, and, if the
Termination Date is a Lease Period Date, the Basic
Rent installment due and payable on that date pursuant
to Section 3(b) (it being understood and agreed that
Lessee shall not be required to pay the portion, if
any, of such Basic Rent installment designated in
Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in
advance), and (ii) Lessor (x) shall transfer or cause
to be transferred to Lessee, without recourse or
warranty (except as to the absence of Lessor's Liens
(disregarding for this purpose the proviso to the
definition thereof)), all of Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to any Engines constituting part of
the Aircraft but which are not then installed on the
Aircraft, and (y) shall request the Loan Trustee to
execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate
instrument

releasing the Aircraft from the lien of the
Trust Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement

assignment and pledge under the Trust Indenture. If
Lessor shall fail to perform any of its obligations
pursuant to this Section 9(d) under circumstances in
which Lessee shall have fully performed its
obligations hereunder with respect to such termination
and as a result thereof this Lease shall not be
terminated on a proposed Termination Date, Lessor
shall thereafter no longer be entitled to exercise its
election to retain the Aircraft upon any subsequent
termination pursuant to this Section 9 and Lessee may
at its option at any time thereafter submit a new
termination notice pursuant to Section 9(a).

(e) Purchase of Aircraft by Lessee. In the
event that Lessee shall be entitled to and shall have
elected pursuant to the written notice referred to in
the first sentence of Section 9(a) to terminate this
Lease and purchase the Aircraft on a Special
Termination Date, on such Special Termination Date,
Lessee shall purchase the Aircraft at a price (the
"Special Termination Price") equal to the greatest of
(i) the Termination Value for the Aircraft, computed
as of such Special Termination Date, (ii) the then
fair market sales value of the Aircraft, as determined
by mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they
shall be unable to agree, by an Independent Appraisal
and (iii) the sum of the present values, as of such
Special Termination Date, of (x) Basic Rent payable
with respect to the period from such Special
Termination Date to and including the twenty-fourth
anniversary of the Base Lease Commencement Date and
(y) the estimated fair market sales value of the
Aircraft on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Base
Lease Commencement Date, as determined on such Special
Termination Date by the Independent Appraisal (such
present value calculation to utilize a discount rate
equal to 13.5% per annum, compounded semi-annually).
In such event, on such Special Termination Date, (x)
Lessee (i) shall pay to Lessor or to the Persons
entitled thereto, in funds of the type specified in
Section 3(d), all unpaid Supplemental Rent (including,
without limitation, Premium Amount, if any), other
than Termination Value, due and owing on such Special
Termination Date and all Basic Rent due and payable on
or prior to the Special

understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be
required to pay the portion, if any, of the Basic Rent
installment due and payable on the Special Termination
Date designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as
being payable in advance) and (ii) at its option shall
either (A) pay to Lessor, in funds of the type
specified in Section 3(d), the Special Termination
Price, or (B) assume all of the rights and obligations
of the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture in
respect of the Certificates (including, without
limitation, any scheduled payment of principal of or
accrued interest on the Certificates due and payable
on the Special Termination Date but only to the extent
that the Basic Rent installment payable by Lessee
pursuant to clause (i) above or previously paid
pursuant to this Lease does not cover such scheduled
payment of principal of or accrued interest on the
Certificates but excluding any obligations or
liabilities of the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity incurred on or prior to such Special
Termination Date, which obligations and liabilities
shall remain the sole responsibility of the Owner
Trustee) in accordance with Section 7.03 of the Trust
Indenture and simultaneously shall pay to Lessor, in
funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the Special
Termination Price over an amount equal to the sum of
the principal of and any accrued and unpaid interest
on the outstanding Certificates on such Special
Termination Date, after taking into account any
payments of principal or interest made in respect of
the outstanding Certificates on such Special
Termination Date, and (y) Lessor will sell to Lessee,
without recourse or warranty (except as to the absence
of Lessor's Liens (disregarding for this purpose the
proviso to the definition thereof)), all of Lessor's
right, title and interest in and to the Aircraft and
all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to
any Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but
which are not then installed on the Aircraft and, if
Lessee shall not have assumed the rights and
obligations of the Owner Trustee under the Trust
Indenture in respect of the Certificates as provided
for above, Lessor will request the Loan Trustee to
execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate
instrument releasing the Airframe and Engines with
respect to which title is transferred from the lien of
the Trust Indenture and releasing the

shall cease as of the Termination Date and, in each
case, the Term shall end effective as of the

no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Lessee shall have the right at its option
at any time, on at least 60 days' prior written
notice, to terminate this Lease with respect to any
Engine. In such event, and prior to the date of such
termination, Lessee shall replace such Engine
hereunder by complying with the terms of Section 10(b)
to the same extent as if an Event of Loss had occurred
with respect to such Engine. No termination of this
Lease with respect to any Engine as contemplated by

Lessor's Cost for the Aircraft. The Termination Value Percentages set forth in
Exhibit C to the Rent Schedule have been computed on the assumption that each
Certificate will bear interest throughout the term at the Assumed Debt Rate for
such Certificate. To the extent that the aggregate amount of interest payable

Period.

Section 2. Acceptance and Leasing of Aircraft. Lessor hereby
agrees (subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Section 4 of the Participation Agreement) to accept delivery of, and
simultaneously to lease to Lessee hereunder, and Lessee hereby agrees (subject
to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 11 of the
Participation Agreement) to lease from Lessor hereunder, the Aircraft, as
evidenced by the execution by Lessor and Lessee of a Lease Supplement covering
the Aircraft. Lessor shall authorize one or more employees or agents of
Lessee, designated by Lessee, as the authorized representative or
representatives of Lessor to accept delivery of the Aircraft pursuant to the
Participation Agreement. Lessee hereby agrees that such acceptance of delivery
by such authorized representative or representatives on behalf of Lessor shall,
without further act, irrevocably constitute acceptance by Lessee of the
Aircraft for all purposes of this Lease.

Section 3. Term and Rent. (a) Term. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the Term for the lease of the Aircraft hereunder shall
commence on the Delivery Date and end on the Base Lease Expiration Date.

(b) Basic Rent. Lessee hereby agrees to pay Lessor Basic
Rent for the Aircraft throughout the Term in consecutive semi-annual
installments payable on each Lease Period Date commencing on the Lease Period
Date next following the Base Lease Commencement Date. Each such installment of
Basic Rent in respect of the Aircraft shall be in an amount determined by
multiplying Lessor's Cost by the Basic Rent percentage set forth in Exhibit A
to the Rent Schedule for the applicable Lease Period Date.

Although the Basic Rent percentages set forth in Exhibit A to
the Rent Schedule have been computed on the assumption that each Certificate
will bear interest at the Assumed Debt Rate for such Certificate throughout the

17
AF-1
<PAGE> 22
Term, Lessor and Lessee recognize that the actual rate of interest on each
Certificate may be a rate from time to time which may be greater or less than
the Assumed Debt Rate for such Certificate and that the related basis upon
which interest on the Certificates will be computed will be as provided in the
Trust Indenture. Accordingly, each installment of Basic Rent shall be
increased or decreased, as the case may be, by an amount (the "Rent
Differential Amount") equal to, as of any Lease Period Date on which Basic Rent
is payable, the difference between (i) the aggregate amount of interest
actually due and payable on such Lease Period Date on the Certificates for the
period from and including the Lease Period Date next preceding such Lease
Period Date to but excluding such Lease Period Date, determined as provided in
the Trust Indenture, and (ii) the aggregate amount of interest on the
Certificates that would have been due and payable on such Lease Period Date if
each Certificate had borne interest at the Assumed Debt Rate for such
Certificate for the period from and including the Lease Period Date next
preceding such Lease Period Date to but excluding such Lease Period Date. If,
as of any Lease Period Date on which Basic Rent is payable, the amount
determined in accordance with clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be greater than the amount determined in accordance with clause (ii) of
such sentence, the amount of Basic Rent payable on such Lease Period Date shall
be increased by the Rent Differential Amount. If, as of any Lease Period Date
on which Basic Rent is payable, the amount determined in accordance with such
clause (ii) shall be greater than the amount determined in accordance with such
clause (i), the amount of Basic Rent due on such Lease Period Date shall be
decreased by the Rent Differential Amount. The interest actually accruing with
respect to the Certificates shall be as specified by the notification to be
delivered by the Indenture Trustee to Lessor, Lessee and the Owner Participant
as provided in Section 1(c) of the Participation Agreement.

Anything contained herein or in the Participation Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, each installment of Basic Rent (both before and
after any adjustment pursuant to Section 3(e), or any deduction pursuant to
Section 3(f)), as well as the amount of any Prepaid Rent paid pursuant to
Section 3(f), together with any payment made by the Owner Participant under
Section 16(a) of the Participation Agreement, shall be, under any circumstances
and in any event, in an amount at least equal to,

18
AF-1
<PAGE> 23
as of the due date of such installment, or Base Lease Commencement Date, as the
case may be, the amount of principal of and interest on the Certificates
required to be paid by Lessor pursuant to the Trust Indenture on the due date
of such installment of Basic Rent or on the Base Lease Commencement Date, as
the case may be. Further, and anything contained herein or in the
Participation Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Termination Value and
Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft (both before and after any adjustment
pursuant to Section 3(e), or any deduction pursuant to Section 3(f)) will,
under any circumstances and in any event, be an amount which, together with any
other amounts (excluding Excepted Payments) then required to be paid by Lessee
hereunder in connection therewith, will be at least equal to, as of the date of
payment thereof, the aggregate unpaid principal of the outstanding
Certificates, together with all unpaid interest thereon accrued to the date on
which such amount is paid in accordance with the terms hereof.

Basic Rent accrues or is earned with respect to each Lease
Period in accordance with Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule.

(c) Supplemental Rent. Lessee also agrees to pay to Lessor,
or to whomsoever shall be entitled thereto, any and all Supplemental Rent
promptly as the same shall become due and owing, and in the event of any
failure on the part of Lessee to pay any Supplemental Rent, Lessor shall have
all rights, powers and remedies provided for herein or by law or in equity or
otherwise as in the case of nonpayment of Basic Rent. In addition, Lessee will
pay as Supplemental Rent (i) on demand, an amount equal to interest at the
Overdue Rate on any part of any installment of Basic Rent not paid when due for
any period for which the same shall be overdue and on any payment of
Supplemental Rent not paid when due or demanded, as the case may be, for the
period until the same shall be paid, (ii) in the case of any prepayment of the
Certificates or purchase of the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.13 of the
Trust Indenture, on the date the same is payable by Lessor under the Trust
Indenture, an amount equal to the Break Amount, if any, payable with respect to
the Certificates and (iii) any amounts payable by Lessor under Section 2.04 or
2.18 of the Trust Indenture; provided that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in any Operative Document or any document or instrument
relating thereto, Lessee shall have no responsibility or liability

19
AF-1
<PAGE> 24
for any amounts payable to any Loan Participant in respect of the Break Amount,
if any, payable with respect to the Certificates, as a result of (i) a
prepayment of the Certificates or a purchase of the Certificates pursuant to
Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture as a result of an Indenture Default that
does not also constitute an Event of Default or (ii) an Indenture Default that
does not also constitute an Event of Default. All Supplemental Rent to be paid
pursuant to this Section 3(c) shall be payable in the type of funds and in the
manner set forth in Section 3(d).

(d) Payment to Lessor. All Rent shall be paid by Lessee to
Lessor at its office at Rodney Square North, Wilmington, Delaware 19890,
Attention: Corporate Trust Administration (AA 1991 AF-1), in funds consisting
of lawful currency of the United States of America which shall be immediately
available at such office of Lessor not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the date of payment, provided that so long as the Trust Indenture
shall not have been discharged pursuant to the terms thereof, Lessor hereby
directs, and each of Lessor and Lessee agrees, that all Rent (excluding
Excepted Property) or other sums payable to Lessor hereunder or pursuant hereto
shall be paid directly to the Indenture Trustee at the times and in funds of
the type specified in this Section 3(d) at the offices of the Indenture Trustee
at 33 North Avenue, Suite 700, Atlanta, Georgia 30308, Attention: Corporate
Trust Department (AA 1991 AF-1), or at such other location in the United States
as the Indenture Trustee may otherwise direct. Whenever the date scheduled for
any payment of Rent to be made hereunder shall not be a Business Day, then such
payment need not be made on such scheduled date but may be made on the next
succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such
scheduled date and (provided such payment is made on such next succeeding
Business Day) no interest shall accrue on the amount of such payment from and
after such scheduled date to the time of such payment on such next succeeding
Business Day.

(e) Adjustments to Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value and
Termination Value. In the event that (i) the Transaction Costs (as such term
is defined in Section 18(a) of the Participation Agreement) are less or more
than 1.0% of Lessor's Cost, or (ii) prior to the acceptance of the Aircraft on
the Delivery Date: (A) there shall have occurred a Change in Tax Law and (B)
after hav-

20
AF-1
<PAGE> 25
ing been advised in writing by the Owner Participant of such Change in Tax Law
and the proposed adjustment to the payments of Basic Rent resulting therefrom,
Lessee shall have waived its right under Section 11 of the Participation
Agreement to decline to proceed with the transaction, or (iii) a refunding or
refinancing as contemplated by Section 17 or Section 20 of the Participation
Agreement occurs, or (iv) the Delivery Date is other than July 2, 1991, or (v)
if the Certificates are not refunded or refinanced on or prior to the Base
Lease Commencement Date, the Excess Payment Amount (after adjustment for any
Excess Payment Differential Amount) is other than $1,947,948.23, then, in each
such case, all payments of Basic Rent, Excess Payment Amount and Stipulated
Loss Values and Termination Values with respect to the Term will, subject
always to the penultimate paragraph of Section 3(b), be adjusted (upwards or
downwards, as the case may be) in accordance with the provisions of Section 18
or Section 20, as applicable, of the Participation Agreement to preserve the
Owner Participant's Net Economic Return, or the Owner Participant's Revised Net
Economic Return, as the case may be, and, to the greatest extent possible, to
minimize the net present value of the payments of Basic Rent. In addition, in
the event of a refunding or refinancing as contemplated by Section 17 or
Section 20 of the Participation Agreement, the Special Purchase Price
Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated in
accordance with the provisions of Section 18 or Section 20, as applicable, of
the Participation Agreement.

(f) Prepayments of Certain Rent Payments. To the extent, if
any, that there shall not have been received by the Indenture Trustee at the
office of Indenture Trustee referred to in Section 3(d) hereof, by 1:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on or before the Base Lease Commencement Date from Lessor,
an amount equal to the Excess Payment Amount payable for such date, Lessee
shall advance to Lessor on the Base Lease Commencement Date an amount equal to
the Excess Payment Amount not so paid (such amount being herein called "Prepaid
Rent") provided that Lessee will also pay to the Indenture Trustee, on demand,
as Supplemental Rent, to the extent permitted by applicable law, interest at
the Overdue Rate on any Excess Payment Amount not paid when due for any period
for which the same shall be overdue. Any Rent prepaid pursuant to this Section
3(f) shall be offset against installments of Basic Rent in the order in which
they become due, subject

21
AF-1
<PAGE> 26
to the penultimate sentence of this paragraph. Lessor agrees to reimburse
Lessee in the manner and subject to the conditions provided in the following
sentence for (x) the Prepaid Rent so paid by Lessee determined as of the date
such payment was made, plus (y) the Supplemental Rent so paid by Lessee
pursuant to this Section 3(f) plus (z) accrued interest on the unreimbursed
portion thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Overdue Rate plus three
percent (3%) from the date such amount is paid by Lessee to but not including
the date of each such reimbursement (such amounts to be reimbursed being herein
called the "Reimbursement Amount"). So long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, Lessee may with written notice to the Owner
Participant and Indenture Trustee offset (without duplication) against each
succeeding payment (other than as limited by the proviso to this sentence) due
from Lessee to Lessor in respect of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value,
Termination Value or any other amount due hereunder to Lessor, until Lessee has
been fully reimbursed for the Reimbursement Amount; provided, however, that in
the case of any payment due from Lessee which is distributable under the terms
of the Indenture, Lessee's right of offset shall be limited to amounts
distributable to Lessor or the Owner Participant thereunder. No such offset or
aggregate combined effect of separate offsets shall reduce the amount of any
installments of Basic Rent to an amount insufficient, together with all other
amounts payable simultaneously by Lessee, to pay in full the payments then
required to be made on account of the principal of and interest on the
Certificates then outstanding. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section
3(f) to the contrary, Lessee's obligation to advance an amount equal to the
Excess Payment Amount shall terminate at such time as its obligation to pay
Basic Rent terminates under this Lease.

Section 4. Lessor's Representations, Warranties and
Covenants; Quiet Enjoyment. (a) Lessor's Representations, Warranties and
Covenants. NONE OF LESSOR (IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY OR AS OWNER TRUSTEE),

Engines. Upon the termination of this Lease at the end of the Term, a Renewal

(and each such engine shall be of the same make, model and manufacture as the
other Engine or engine installed on the Airframe), duly installed thereon. At

case of any such engines owned by Lessee, shall have a value and utility at
least equal to, and shall be in as good operating condition as required by the
terms hereof with respect to, Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but not
then installed on the Airframe and (iv) in the event that Lessee does not use a
progressive overhaul program in which no out-of-service phase with respect to
the Airframe exceeds 240 hours or a condition-monitored maintenance program
with respect to such Engines or engines, and Lessee adopts a time-related
overhaul program with respect to the Airframe or a scheduled shop visit or
module change maintenance program with respect to such Engines or engines, or
both, such Airframe shall have at least 1,500 hours of operation remaining to
the next heavy maintenance visit and the aggregate number of hours of operation
on all such Engines or engines remaining until the next scheduled shop visit or
module change shall be at least 3,000 hours and (B) such Aircraft shall, except
as otherwise provided herein, be clean and in a configuration suitable for
commercial passenger service, and shall be in compliance with all mandatory
environmental, noise, air pollution and other standards prescribed by the
Federal government of the United States of America and applicable to the
Aircraft and shall have all of Lessee's and any other Person's exterior
markings removed or painted over with the areas thereof refinished to match
adjacent areas. In the event that Lessee has adopted a time-related overhaul
program with respect to the Airframe and does not meet the above conditions
with respect thereto, Lessee shall pay Lessor a dollar amount computed by
multiplying (i) 110% of Lessee's direct cost (during the preceding twelve
months)

24
AF-1
<PAGE> 29
of such heavy maintenance visit by (ii) a fraction of which (x) the numerator
shall be the difference between 1,500 hours and the actual number of hours of
operation remaining on the Airframe to the next heavy maintenance visit and (y)
the denominator shall be the aggregate number of hours allowable between heavy
maintenance visits. In the event that Lessee has adopted a scheduled shop
visit or module change program with respect to such Engines or engines and
Lessee does not meet the above conditions with respect to such Engines or
engines, Lessee shall pay Lessor a dollar amount computed by multiplying (i)
the product of (x) 110% of Lessee's direct cost (during the preceding twelve
months) of such scheduled shop visit or module change and (y) the number of
Engines or engines returned by (ii) a fraction of which (A) the numerator shall
be the difference between 3,000 hours and the actual aggregate number of hours
of operation remaining to the next scheduled shop visit or module change for
the Engines or engines on the Aircraft and (B) the denominator shall be the
aggregate number of hours allowable between scheduled shop visits or module
changes for such Engines or engines. At the time of such return, Lessee will,
unless requested by Lessor at least 90 days prior to such time of return to
retain the existing registration of the Aircraft, cause the Aircraft, if it is
not then so registered, to be registered under the laws of the United States
with the Federal Aviation Administration in the name of Lessor or its designee;
provided that Lessee shall be relieved of its obligations under this sentence
if (x) such registration is prohibited by reason of the failure of Lessor, the
Owner Participant or Lessor's designee to be eligible on such date to own an
aircraft registered with the Federal Aviation Administration or (y) such
registration is otherwise prohibited by applicable law and such prohibition
does not result from an act or failure to act on the part of Lessee or any
sublessee. In the event the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue any
directive which would require improvements to the Aircraft in order for the
airworthiness certificate of the Aircraft to be maintained in good standing,
and if such directive by its terms is not applicable to the Aircraft prior to
the return thereof pursuant to this Section 5, Lessee shall nevertheless comply
with such directive if, prior to such return, (x) Lessee commences compliance
with such directive with respect to any other Boeing 757-200 aircraft affected
by such directive and in use by Lessee and (y) subsequent to any such
commencement, the Aircraft is subjected to a maintenance check of the type at
which such

25
AF-1
<PAGE> 30
modification is made, in accordance with Lessee's general maintenance program.

(b) Return of Engines. In the event that any engine not
owned by Lessor shall be delivered with the Airframe as set forth in paragraph
(a) of this Section 5, Lessee, concurrently with such delivery, will, at its
own expense, furnish Lessor with a warranty (as to title) bill of sale in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor (which warranty shall except
Lessor's Liens and Permitted Liens of the type described in clause (i) of
Section 6), with respect to each such engine and with a written opinion of
Lessee's counsel (which may be Lessee's General Counsel) to the effect that
such bill of sale constitutes an effective instrument for the conveyance of
title to such engine to Lessor, and thereupon Lessor will transfer to Lessee,
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all Lessor's right,
title and interest in and to an Engine constituting part of the Aircraft but
not installed on the Airframe at the time of the return of the Airframe.

(c) Fuel; Manuals. Upon the return of the Airframe pursuant
to this Section 5, (i) Lessee shall have no obligation with respect to the
amount of fuel or oil contained in the Airframe and all fuel or oil remaining
on board the Airframe shall be the property of Lessor without charge and (ii)
Lessee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Lessor all logs, manuals and
data, and inspection, modification and overhaul records required to be
maintained with respect thereto under applicable rules and regulations of the
Federal Aviation Administration and, if the Aircraft has been registered under
the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States, of the applicable
foreign governmental authority, and the warranty bill of sale relating to the
Aircraft received from the Manufacturer.

(d) Storage upon Return. Upon written request of Lessor
received at least 30 days prior to the end of the Term, Lessee will provide
Lessor with storage facilities free of charge except as provided below for the
Aircraft for a period not exceeding 30 days at such location in the United
States on Lessee's route system used by Lessee for the storage of surplus
aircraft or engines available for sale as shall be designated by Lessee;
provided that Lessor may request that the Aircraft be stored at any other
location in the United States on Lessee's route sys-

26
AF-1
<PAGE> 31
tem used by Lessee for such purpose, in which case Lessee may, in its sole
discretion, provide such facilities for such period. Any storage facilities
provided by Lessee for the Aircraft pursuant to this Section 5(d) shall, in all
cases, be at the cost to Lessor of insurance and Lessee's out-of-pocket costs
in connection with providing such facilities (it being understood that such
out-of- pocket costs shall not be deemed to include the cost of making the
storage facilities available) and at the risk of Lessor. In the event Lessor,
after a storage location is determined as provided in the first sentence of
this Section 5(d), shall request Lessee to deliver the Aircraft to a second
location, Lessee will, at Lessor's expense, fly the Aircraft within such 30-day
period to a reasonable location selected by Lessor in the United States, for
storage at the risk and expense of Lessor, upon receipt of evidence of
insurance coverage (reasonably satisfactory to Lessee) as set forth in Section
11(a), provided that (i) Lessee shall not be required to store the Aircraft at
any location used by Lessee for storage of surplus aircraft available for sale
except as provided in the first sentence of this Section 5(d) and (ii) the
delivery by Lessee of the Aircraft to the first location determined as provided
in such sentence shall constitute delivery of the Aircraft as required by
Section 5(a). Lessor, at its expense, may place such other insurance in such
circumstances on the Aircraft as it may deem appropriate. Lessee shall, at
Lessor's request, maintain insurance (if available) for the Aircraft during
such period of storage and shall be reimbursed by Lessor for the cost thereof.

(e) Delayed Return. (i) In the event that the use of the
Aircraft, Airframe or any Engine in the normal course of the business of air
transportation is prohibited on the last day of the Term or the date the
Aircraft is required to be redelivered pursuant to Section 9, Lessee shall,
upon prompt notice of the reasons therefor to Lessor, not be required to return
such Aircraft to Lessor but may retain custody and control of the Aircraft for
a period not in excess of 180 days beyond the last day of the Term or such date
in order to attempt in a diligent manner to remedy any condition prohibiting
such use or (ii) in connection with any sublease of the Aircraft by Lessee
permitted under the terms of this Lease, Lessee may at its option, upon written
notice to Lessor given not less than 30 days prior to the last day of the Term
or such date, extend this Lease for a period not in excess of 60 days beyond
the last day of the Term in order to enable

27
AF-1
<PAGE> 32
Lessee to bring the Aircraft to the condition required under this Section 5 on
its return to Lessor; provided that in either case, Lessee shall pay to Lessor
at monthly intervals the daily equivalent of 50% of the average annual Basic
Rent payable during the Term (excluding the Interim Period) pursuant to the
terms hereof for each day of such period.

(f) Overhaul. Immediately prior to the return of the
Airframe and Engines or engines at the end of the Term, Lessee, upon written
request of Lessor received at least 30 days prior to the end of the Term, and
subject to the availability of the appropriate facilities, will overhaul or
cause to be overhauled such Airframe and Engines or engines. Such overhaul
shall be done in the same manner and same care as used by Lessee with similar
airframes and engines of its own, and Lessor shall reimburse Lessee for such
overhaul by payment of an amount equal to 110% of Lessee's actual costs in
connection with such overhaul. This provision is not intended and shall not be
construed to diminish or modify Lessee's other obligations under this Section 5.

Section 6. Liens. Lessee will not directly or indirectly
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on or with respect to the
Airframe or any Engine, title thereto or any interest therein or in this Lease
except (i) the respective rights of Lessor and Lessee as herein provided, the
Lien created under the Trust Indenture, the rights of Lessor under the Purchase
Agreement Assignment and the rights of the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee under the Trust Agreement, the Trust Indenture, and
the Participation Agreement, (ii) the rights of others under agreements or
arrangements to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of Sections 7(b)
and 8(b), (iii) Lessor's Liens, Loan Participant Liens and Trustee's Liens,
(iv) Liens for Taxes either not yet due or being contested in good faith (and
for the payment of which adequate reserves have been provided) by appropriate
proceedings so long as such proceedings do not involve any material danger of
the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Airframe or any Engine or interest therein,
(v) materialmen's, mechanics', workmen's, repairmen's, employees' or other like
Liens arising in the ordinary course of Lessee's business for amounts the
payment of which is either not yet delinquent or is being contested in good
faith (and for the payment of which adequate reserves have been provided) by
appropriate

28
AF-1
<PAGE> 33
proceedings so long as such proceedings do not involve any material danger of
the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Airframe or any Engine or interest therein,
(vi) Liens arising out of judgments or awards against Lessee with respect to
which an appeal or proceeding for review is being prosecuted in good faith and
with respect to which there shall have been secured a stay of execution pending
such appeal or proceeding for review so long as such judgment or award does not
and will not involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the
Airframe or any Engine or interest therein and (vii) salvage or similar rights
of insurers under insurance policies maintained pursuant to Section 11. Lessee
will promptly, at its own expense, take such action as may be necessary duly to
discharge (by bonding or otherwise) any such Lien not excepted above if the
same shall arise at any time.

Section 7. Registration, Maintenance and Oper-ation;
Possession; Insignia. (a) Registration, Maintenance and Operation. Lessee,
at its own cost and expense, shall:

(i) forthwith upon the delivery thereof to Lessor on the
Delivery Date cause the Aircraft to be duly registered, and at all
times thereafter to remain duly registered, under the laws of the
United States, in the name of Lessor, as owner, except (x) as
otherwise required by the Federal Aviation Act, or (y) to the extent
that such registration cannot be effected because of Lessor's or the
Owner Participant's failure to comply with the citizenship or other
eligibility requirements for registration of aircraft under such
Act;provided that Lessor shall execute and deliver all such documents
as Lessee shall reasonably request for the purpose of effecting and
continuing such registration. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
but subject always to the terms and conditions set forth in Section
9(m) and 9(n) of the Participation Agreement, Lessee may cause the
Aircraft to be duly registered under the laws of any jurisdiction in
which a sublessee pursuant to Section 7(b)(ix) could be principally
based, in the name of Lessor or of any nominee of Lessor, or, if
required by applicable law, in the name of Lessee or any other Person,
and shall thereafter maintain such registration unless and until
changed as provided herein and therein; and Lessor will cooperate

29
AF-1
<PAGE> 34
with Lessee in effecting such foreign registration;

(ii) maintain, service, repair, overhaul and test the Aircraft in
accordance with a maintenance program (as approved by the Federal
Aviation Administration) for Boeing 757-200 series aircraft (or, at
Lessee's option, x) in the event that the Aircraft is re-registered in
another jurisdiction pursuant to Section 7(a)(i), in accordance with
an aircraft maintenance program approved by the central civil aviation
authority of the jurisdiction of such registration or y) in the event
of any sublease to a foreign air carrier in accordance with Section
7(b)(ix), approved by the central civil aviation authority of one of
the jurisdictions specified in clause (y) of such Section 7(b)(ix))
and in the same manner and with the same care used by Lessee with
respect to comparable aircraft and engines owned or operated by Lessee
and utilized in similar circumstances so as to keep the Aircraft in as
good operating condition as when delivered to Lessee by the
Manufacturer, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in such condition
as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of the
Aircraft to be maintained in good standing at all times (other than
during temporary periods of storage in accordance with applicable
regulations or during periods of grounding by applicable governmental
authorities, except where such periods of grounding are the result of
the failure by Lessee to maintain the Aircraft as otherwise required
herein) under the Federal Aviation Act or, if the Aircraft is
registered under the laws of any other jurisdiction, the laws of such
jurisdiction and in compliance with all applicable manufacturer's
alert service bulletins;

(iii) maintain, in the English language, all records, logs and
other materials required by the appropriate authorities in the
jurisdiction where the Aircraft is registered to be maintained in
respect of the Aircraft; and

30
AF-1
<PAGE> 35
(iv) promptly furnish to Lessor such information as may be
required to enable Lessor to file any reports, returns or statements
required to be filed by Lessor with any governmental authority because
of Lessor's or the Owner Participant's interest in the Aircraft.

Lessee agrees that the Aircraft will not be maintained, used
or operated in violation of any law or any rule, regulation or order of any
government or governmental authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign),
or in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or registration
relating to the Aircraft issued by any such authority; provided that Lessee
shall not be in default under this sentence if it is not possible for it to
comply with the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States (or other
than any jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is then registered) because of a
conflict with the applicable laws of the United States (or such jurisdiction in
which the Aircraft is then registered). In the event that any such law, rule,
regulation or order requires alteration of the Aircraft, Lessee will conform
thereto or obtain conformance therewith at no expense to Lessor and will
maintain the Aircraft in proper operating condition under such laws, rules,
regulations and orders; provided, however, that Lessee may, in good faith,
contest the validity or application of any such law, rule, regulation or order
in any reasonable manner which does not materially adversely affect Lessor, the
Aircraft, the Owner Participant or the lien of the Trust Indenture. Lessee
also agrees not to operate or locate the Aircraft, or suffer the Aircraft to be
operated or located, (i) in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance
required by the terms of Section 11, except in the case of a requisition for
use by any Government where Lessee obtains indemnity pursuant to Section 11 in
lieu of such insurance from such Government against the risks and in the
amounts required by Section 11 covering such area, or (ii) in any war zone or
recognized or, in Lessee's judgment, threatened area of hostilities unless
covered by war risk insurance in accordance with Section 11, but only so long
as the same remains in effect while the Aircraft is so operated or located, or
unless the Aircraft is operated or used under contract with any Government
entered into pursuant to Section 11, under which contract such Government
assumes liability for any damage, loss, destruction or failure to return
possession of the Aircraft at the end

31
AF-1
<PAGE> 36
of the term of such contract or for injury to persons or damage to property of
others.

(b) Possession. Lessee will not, without the prior written
consent of Lessor, sublease or otherwise in any manner deliver, transfer or
relinquish possession of the Airframe or any Engine or install any Engine, or
permit any Engine to be installed, on any airframe other than the Airframe;
provided that, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, and so long as the action to be taken shall not deprive the
Indenture Trustee of the perfected lien of the Trust Indenture on the Airframe
or (subject to subclause (B) of the "provided further" clause to subsection (i)
of this Section 7(b)) any Engine, and in any event, so long as Lessee shall
comply with the provisions of Section 11, Lessee may, without the prior consent
of Lessor:

(i) subject the Airframe to normal interchange agreements or
any Engine to normal interchange or pooling agreements or arrangements
in each case customary in the airline industry and entered into by
Lessee in the ordinary course of its business with any other United
States air carrier as to which there is in force a certificate issued
pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act or any successor
provision that gives like authority or with any "foreign air carrier"
(as such term is defined in such Act) as to which there is in force a
permit issued pursuant to Section 402 of said Act (any such United
States certificated air carrier and any such foreign air carrier being
hereinafter called a "Permitted Air Carrier"); provided that no
transfer of the registration of such Airframe shall be effected in
connection therewith; and provided, further, that (A) no such
agreement or arrangement contemplates or requires the transfer of
title to the Airframe and B) if Lessor's title to any such Engine
shall be divested under any such agreement or arrangement, such
divestiture shall be deemed to be an Event of Loss with respect to
such Engine and Lessee shall comply with Section 10(b) in respect
thereof;

(ii) deliver possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the
manufacturer thereof for testing or other similar purposes or to any
organization for service, repair, maintenance or overhaul work on the
Airframe or such Engine or any part thereof or for

32
AF-1
<PAGE> 37
alterations or modifications in or additions to the Airframe or such
Engine to the extent required or permitted by the terms of Section
7(a) or 8(c);

(iii) transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the
United States of America or any instrumentality or agency thereof
pursuant to a sublease, contract or other instrument, a copy of which
shall be furnished to Lessor;provided that the term of such sublease
(including, without limitation, any option of the sublessee to renew
or extend) or the term of possession under such contract or other
instrument shall not continue beyond the end of the Term or any
Renewal Term then in effect;

(iv) transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the
United States of America or any instrumentality or agency thereof in
accordance with applicable laws, rulings, regulations or orders
(including, without limitation, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program
authorized under 10 U.S.C. Section 9511et seq. or any substantially
similar program);

(v) install an Engine on an airframe owned by Lessee free and
clear of all Liens, except (A) those of the type permitted under
clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of Section 6 and those
which apply only to the engines (other than Engines), appliances,
parts, instruments, appurtenances, accessories, furnishings and other
equipment (other than Parts) installed on such airframe (but not to
the airframe as an entirety) and (B) the rights of other Permitted Air
Carriers under normal interchange agreements which are customary in
the airline industry and do not contemplate, permit or require the
transfer of title to the airframe or engines installed thereon;

(vi) install an Engine on an airframe leased to Lessee or owned
by Lessee subject to a conditional sale or other security agreement;
provided that (A) such airframe is free and clear of all Liens except
the rights of the parties to the lease or conditional sale or other
security agreement covering such airframe and except Liens of the type
permitted by clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (v) of this paragraph
of Section 7(b) and B) Lessee shall have obtained from the lessor or
secured party of such

33
AF-1
<PAGE> 38
airframe a written agreement (which may be the lease or conditional
sale or other security agreement covering such airframe), in form and
substance satisfactory to Lessor (it being understood that an
agreement from such lessor or secured party substantially in the form
of the final sentence of the penultimate paragraph of this Section
7(b) shall be deemed to be satisfactory to Lessor), whereby such
lessor or secured party expressly agrees that neither it nor its
successors or assigns will acquire or claim any right, title or
interest in any Engine by reason of such Engine being installed on
such airframe at any time while such Engine is subject to this Lease
or to the lien of the Trust Indenture;

(vii) install an Engine on an airframe owned by Lessee, leased to
Lessee or owned by Lessee subject to a conditional sale or other
security agreement under circumstances where neither subparagraph (v)
nor subparagraph (vi) of this Section 7(b) is applicable;provided that
such installation shall be deemed an Event of Loss with respect to
such Engine and Lessee shall comply with Section 10(b) in respect
thereof, Lessor not intending hereby to waive any right or interest it
may have to or in such Engine under applicable law until compliance by
Lessee with such Section 10(b); and

(viii) sublease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or engines
then installed on the Airframe to any United States air carrier as to
which there is in force a certificate issued pursuant to Section 401
of the Federal Aviation Act or successor provision that gives like
authority; provided that the term of such sublease (including, without
limitation, any option of the sublessee to renew or extend) shall not
continue beyond the end of the Term or any Renewal Term then in
effect, unless Lessee shall have agreed to purchase the Aircraft or
renew this Lease in accordance with the terms hereof at the end of the
Term or such Renewal Term, as the case may be, to a date beyond the
end of the term of such sublease (assuming that all options to renew
or extend such sublease will be exercised); and

34
AF-1
<PAGE> 39
(ix) sublease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or engines
then installed on the Airframe to A) any foreign air carrier that is
principally based in and a domiciliary of a country (other than Cuba,
El Salvador, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Libya) that is at the inception
of the sublease a party to the Mortgage Convention, or B) any foreign
air carrier that is principally based in and a domiciliary of a
country listed in Exhibit B hereto, or (C) any foreign air carrier not
described in clause (A) or (B) above;provided that (w) in the case
only of a sublease to a foreign air carrier under clause (C) above,
Lessor receives at the time of such sublease an opinion of counsel to
Lessee (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and
the Owner Participant) to the effect that (a) the terms of the
sublease and the Operative Documents are legal, valid, binding and
enforceable in the country in which such foreign air carrier is
principally based, to substantially the same extent as the Operative
Documents are at that time enforceable in the United States, (b) it is
not necessary for Lessor or the Owner Participant to qualify to do
business in such country solely as a result of the proposed sublease,
(c) there is no tort liability of the owner of an aircraft not in
possession thereof under the laws of such country other than tort
liability no more extensive or onerous than that which might have been
imposed on such owner under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof (it being understood that, in the event such opinion cannot be
given in a form satisfactory to Lessor and the Owner Participant, such
opinion shall be waived if insurance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor
and the Owner Participant is provided by Lessee to cover the risk of
such liability), (d) the laws of such country require fair
compensation by the government of such country for the loss of use of
the Aircraft in the event of the requisition by such government of the
Aircraft (unless Lessee shall have agreed to provide insurance
reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and the Owner Participant covering
the risk of requisition of use of the Aircraft by the government of
such jurisdiction so long as the Aircraft is subleased in such
country), and (e) there exist no possessory rights in favor of such
sublessee under the laws of such country which would, upon bankruptcy
of or other default by Lessee or the sublessee, prevent the return of

35
AF-1
<PAGE> 40
such Engine or the Airframe and such Engine or engine to Lessor in
accordance with and when permitted by the terms of Sections 14 and
15(a) hereof upon the exercise by Lessor of its remedies under Section
15(a), x) in the case only of a sublease to a foreign air carrier
under clause (C) above, each of Lessor and the Owner Participant
receives assurances reasonably satisfactory to it that the currency of
such country is freely convertible into U.S. Dollars (unless Lessee
shall have agreed to provide the requisition insurance described in
subclause (d) of clause (w) above), y) in the case of any sublease to
a foreign air carrier, either the sublease, or an arrangement existing
between Lessee, the sublessee and/or one or more third parties that
provide maintenance services, provides that the Aircraft will be
maintained, serviced, repaired, overhauled and tested in accordance
with maintenance standards for Boeing 757-200 series aircraft approved
by, or substantially similar to those approved or required by, the
Federal Aviation Administration or the central civil aviation
authority of any of Brazil, Canada, France, The Federal Republic of
Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland or the
United Kingdom and (z) in the case of any sublease to a foreign air
carrier (other than a foreign air carrier principally based in Taiwan)
the United States of America maintains diplomatic relations with the
country in which such foreign air carrier is principally based at the
time such sublease is entered into; andprovided, further, that the
term of any such sublease (including, without limitation, any option
of the sublessee to renew or extend) shall not continue beyond the end
of the Term or any Renewal Term then in effect, unless Lessee shall
have agreed to purchase the Aircraft or renew this Lease in accordance
with the terms hereof at the end of the Term or such Renewal Term, as
the case may be, to a date beyond the end of the term of such sublease
(assuming that all options to renew or extend such sublease will be
exercised);

provided that the rights of any transferee who receives possession by reason of
a transfer permitted by this Section 7(b) (other than the transfer of an Engine
which is deemed an Event of Loss) shall be subject and subordinate to, and any
sublease permitted by this Section 7(b) shall be made expressly subject and
subordinate to, all the

36
AF-1
<PAGE> 41
terms of this Lease and of the Trust Indenture, including, without limitation,
Lessor's rights to repossession pursuant to Section 15(a) hereof and to avoid
such sublease upon such repossession and the Indenture Trustee's rights to
possession pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Trust Indenture, and Lessee shall in
all events remain primarily liable hereunder for the performance and observance
of all of the terms and conditions of this Lease to the same extent as if such
sublease or transfer had not occurred, and any such sublease shall include
appropriate provisions for the maintenance (subject to clause (y) of the first
proviso to Section 7(b)(ix)) and insurance of the Aircraft. No interchange
agreement, pooling agreement, sublease or other relinquishment of possession of
the Airframe or any Engine permitted by this Section 7(b) shall in any way
discharge or diminish any of Lessee's obligations under the Operative
Documents. With the prior written consent of Lessor, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, Lessee may sub-sublease the Airframe or Engines in
connection with a transaction that involves such a sub-sublease commencing at
the inception of the transaction. Lessee may not otherwise sub-sublease the
Airframe or Engines. Lessee shall not sublease the Airframe or Engines to any
sublessee that is the subject of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
proceeding at the inception of such sublease without the prior written consent
of Lessor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Lessee shall,
promptly upon entering into a sublease of the Airframe or Engines, notify
Lessor, the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee of the identity of the
sublessee and the term of such sublease and shall provide a copy of such
sublease agreement to any of Lessor, the Owner Participant or the Indenture
Trustee upon request therefrom (with economic and financial provisions and
information deleted therefrom if Lessee shall so choose), provided that, except
to the extent required by applicable law, such parties shall keep confidential
the identity of the sublessee and the existence and terms of such sublease.
Lessor hereby agrees, for the benefit of the lessor or secured party of any
airframe leased to Lessee or owned by Lessee subject to a conditional sale or
other security agreement that Lessor will not acquire or claim, as against such
lessor or secured party, any right, title or interest in any engine or engines
owned by the lessor under such lease or subject to a security interest in favor
of the secured party under such conditional sale or other security agreement as
the result of such engine or engines being installed on the Airframe at any
time

37
AF-1
<PAGE> 42
while such engine or engines are subject to such lease or conditional sale or
other security agreement.

Lessor acknowledges that any "wet lease" or other similar
arrangement under which Lessee maintains operational control of the Aircraft
shall not constitute a delivery, transfer or relinquishment of possession for
purposes of this Section 7(b).

(c) Insignia. Lessee agrees to affix as promptly as
practicable after the Delivery Date and thereafter to maintain in the cockpit
of the Airframe adjacent to the airworthiness certificate therein and (if not
prevented by applicable law or regulations or by any governmental authority) on
each Engine a nameplate bearing the inscription "WILMINGTON TRUST COMPANY, AS
OWNER TRUSTEE, LESSOR", and, so long as the Airframe or such Engine shall
constitute a part of the Indenture Estate, the inscription "C&S/SOVRAN TRUST
COMPANY (GEORGIA), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE/MORTGAGEE" (such
nameplate to be replaced, if necessary, with a nameplate reflecting the name of
any successor Lessor or successor Indenture Trustee). Except as above
provided, Lessee will not allow the name of any Person to be placed on the
Airframe or on any Engine as a designation that might be interpreted as a claim
of ownership; provided that nothing herein contained shall prohibit Lessee (or
any sublessee) from placing its customary colors and insignia on the Airframe
or any Engine.

Section 8. Replacement and Pooling of Parts; Alterations,
Modifications and Additions. (a) Replacement of Parts. Lessee, at its own
cost and expense, will promptly replace all Parts which may from time to time
be incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine and
which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized,
confiscated, damaged beyond repair or rendered permanently unfit for use for
any reason whatsoever, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c). In
addition, Lessee may, at its own cost and expense, remove in the ordinary
course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or testing, any Parts, whether
or not worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond
repair or rendered permanently unfit for use; provided that Lessee, except as
otherwise provided in Section 8(c), will, at its own cost and expense, replace
such Parts as promptly as possible. All replacement Parts shall be free and
clear of all Liens (except

38
AF-1
<PAGE> 43
for pooling arrangements to the extent permitted by Section 8(b) and Permitted
Liens), and shall be in as good operating condition as, and shall have a value
and utility at least equal to, the Parts replaced, assuming such replaced Parts
were in the condition and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof.
Title to all Parts at any time removed from the Airframe or any Engine shall
remain vested in Lessor no matter where located, until such time as such Parts
shall be replaced by Parts which have been incorporated or installed in or
attached to the Airframe or any Engine and which meet the requirements for
replacement Parts specified above. Immediately upon any replacement Part
becoming incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine
as above provided, without further act, (i) title to the replaced Part shall
thereupon vest in Lessee, free and clear of all rights of Lessor, and such
replaced Part shall no longer be deemed a Part hereunder, (ii) title to such
replacement Part shall thereupon vest in Lessor, free and clear of all Liens
(except for Permitted Liens) and (iii) such replacement Part shall become
subject to this Lease and be deemed part of the Airframe or such Engine for all
purposes to the same extent as the Parts originally incorporated or installed
in or attached to the Airframe or such Engine.

(b) Pooling of Parts. Any Part removed from the Airframe or
an Engine as provided in Section 8(a) may be subjected by Lessee to a normal
pooling arrangement customary in the airline industry entered into in the
ordinary course of Lessee's business with Permitted Air Carriers; provided that
the Part replacing such removed Part shall be incorporated or installed in or
attached to the Airframe or such Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) as
promptly as practicable after the removal of such removed Part. In addition,
any replacement Part when incorporated or installed in or attached to the
Airframe or an Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) may be owned by a
Permitted Air Carrier subject to such a normal pooling arrangement; provided
that Lessee, at its expense, as promptly thereafter as practicable, either (i)
causes title to such replacement Part to vest in Lessor in accordance with
Section 8(a) by Lessee acquiring title thereto for the benefit of, and
transferring such title to, Lessor, free and clear of all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens) or (ii) replaces such replacement Part by incorporating or
installing in or attaching to the Airframe or such Engine a further replacement
Part owned by Lessee free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted

39
AF-1
<PAGE> 44
Liens) and by causing title to such further replacement Part to vest in Lessor
in accordance with Section 8(a).

(c) Alterations, Modifications and Additions. Lessee, at its
own expense, will make such alterations and modifications in and additions to
the Airframe and the Engines as may be required from time to time to meet the
standards of the Federal Aviation Administration or other governmental
authority having jurisdiction in any country in or over which the Aircraft is
flown; provided, however, that Lessee may, in good faith, contest the validity
or application of any such standard in any reasonable manner which does not
materially adversely affect Lessor, the Aircraft, the Owner Participant or the
lien of the Trust Indenture. In addition, Lessee, at its own expense, may from
time to time make or cause to be made such alterations and modifications in and
additions to the Airframe or any Engine as Lessee may deem desirable in the
proper conduct of its business, including, without limitation, removal of
Parts; provided that no such alteration, modification, addition or removal
shall materially diminish the value or utility of the Airframe or such Engine,
or materially impair the condition or airworthiness thereof, below the value,
utility, condition and airworthiness thereof immediately prior to such
alteration, modification, addition or removal assuming the Airframe or such
Engine was then of the value and utility and in the condition and airworthiness
required to be maintained by the terms of this Lease, except that the value
(but not the utility, condition or airworthiness) of the Aircraft may be
reduced by the value of Parts which Lessee deems obsolete or no longer suitable
or appropriate for use in the Airframe or any Engine which shall have been
removed, if the aggregate value of all such obsolete or unsuitable Parts
removed from the Aircraft and not replaced shall not exceed $500,000. Title to
all Parts incorporated or installed in or attached or added to the Airframe or
any Engine as the result of such alteration, modification or addition shall,
without further act, vest in Lessor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee
may, at any time during the Term, remove any Part; provided that (i) such Part
is in addition to, and not in replacement of or substitution for, any Part
originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or such
Engine at the time of delivery thereof hereunder or any Part in replacement of,
or substitution for, any such Part, (ii) such Part is not required to be
incorporated or installed in or attached or added to such Airframe or

40
AF-1
<PAGE> 45
Engine pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 8(c), and (iii) such Part
can be removed from the Airframe or such Engine without materially diminishing
or impairing the value, utility, condition or airworthiness required to be
maintained by the terms of this Lease which the Airframe or such Engine would
have had at such time had such removal not occurred. Upon the removal by
Lessee of any Part as provided in the immediately preceding sentence or the
removal of any obsolete or unsuitable Part permitted by this Section 8(c),
title thereto shall, without further act, vest in Lessee and such Part shall no
longer be deemed part of the Airframe or the Engine from which it was removed.
Title to any such Part not removed by Lessee prior to the return of the
Airframe or any Engine to Lessor hereunder shall remain vested in Lessor.

Section 9. Voluntary Termination. (a) Right of Termination.
So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee
shall have the right at its option (i) to terminate this Lease at any time on
or after the fifth anniversary of the Delivery Date, if in Lessee's good faith
determination (evidenced by a certificate of a Responsible Officer of Lessee to
such effect) the Aircraft is surplus to Lessee's requirements or economically
obsolete to Lessee, and (ii) at any time on or after the eighth anniversary of
the Delivery Date to terminate this Lease for any reason whatsoever, in each
case by delivering to Lessor a written notice of termination specifying a
proposed date of termination (the "Termination Date") which shall be a Business
Day occurring not earlier than 90 days after the date of such notice, and, if
the Termination Date is a Special Termination Date, whether or not Lessee is
thereby electing to purchase the Aircraft on such Special Termination Date as
provided in Section 9(e). The termination of this Lease shall, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Section 9, be effective on (i) if Lessee has not
elected to purchase the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has
elected to sell the Aircraft, as provided below, the date of sale of the
Aircraft, if any, referred to in Section 9(b), (ii) if Lessee has not elected
to purchase the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected to
retain the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(d), the date of termination
referred to in Section 9(d), or (iii) if Lessee has elected to purchase the
Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e), the date of purchase referred to in
Section 9(e). Where Lessee has not elected to purchase the Aircraft as
provided in Section 9(e),

41
AF-1
<PAGE> 46
Lessor shall give Lessee irrevocable notice of its election to sell or retain
the Aircraft no later than 30 days prior to the Termination Date. In the event
Lessor shall fail to give notice pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, notice of its election to sell the Aircraft shall be deemed to have
been given as of such thirtieth day prior to the Termination Date. Unless
Lessor shall have given to Lessee a timely notice of its election to retain the
Aircraft as provided in Section 9(d), Lessee may withdraw the termination
notice referred to above at any time on or prior to the date three Business
Days prior to the Termination Date, whereupon this Lease shall continue in full
force and effect. In the event Lessee withdraws, on or after the third
Business Day prior to the Termination Date, a notice of termination given
pursuant to this Section 9(a) or such notice is deemed withdrawn pursuant to
the final sentence of Section 9(b), Lessee will reimburse Lessor and the Owner
Participant for any reasonable out-of- pocket expenses incurred by it in
connection with the proposed sale, except Lessee shall not be obligated to
reimburse Lessor and the Owner Participant for any out-of-pocket expenses to
the extent Lessor shall have failed to comply with its obligations under this
Section 9. Lessee shall not be entitled to exercise its right of termination
provided for in this Section 9(a) more than four times during the Term (not
including for purposes of this sentence any exercise by Lessee of such right of
termination immediately following a failure of this Lease to be terminated by
reason of Lessor's failure to comply with its obligations under this Section
9).

(b) Sale of Aircraft. If Lessee has not elected to purchase
the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected or is deemed to
have elected to sell the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(a), Lessee will have
the option of acting as non-exclusive agent for Lessor to obtain bids for the
cash purchase on or prior to the Termination Date of the Aircraft. Lessor
agrees to pay Lessee a commercially reasonable brokerage fee based on the then
current industry practice in the event that Lessee locates the Person who
purchases the Aircraft pursuant to this Section 9(b). If Lessee acts as such
agent, no later than ten Business Days prior to the Termination Date, Lessee
shall certify to Lessor in writing the amount and terms of each cash bid
received by Lessee and the name and the address of the Person submitting each
such bid. Lessor may (but need not), also, at its expense (which expense,
including without limitation

42
AF-1
<PAGE> 47
any broker's or finder's fees, shall be for the Owner Participant's own
account), independently obtain cash bids for such purchase and, in the event
Lessor receives any such bid, Lessor shall promptly, and in any event at least
five Business Days prior to the Termination Date, certify to Lessee in writing
the amount and terms of such bid and the name and address of the Person
submitting such bid. Neither the Owner Participant, Lessee, nor any Affiliate
of either may submit a bid for the Aircraft, directly or indirectly, in
connection with such proposed sale. On the Termination Date (or such other
date of sale as may be agreed to by Lessor and Lessee, which shall thereafter
be deemed the Termination Date), (x) Lessee shall, subject to receipt (i) by
Lessor (or, so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been discharged, the
Indenture Trustee) of the full purchase price thereof and all amounts owing to
Lessor pursuant to the next sentence, and (ii) by the Persons entitled thereto
of all unpaid Supplemental Rent due on or before the Termination Date, deliver
the Aircraft at a location selected by Lessee to the Person who shall have
submitted the highest cash bid net of any broker's or finder's fees (or such
other purchaser acceptable to Lessor and Lessee), in the same manner as if
delivery were made to Lessor at the end of the Term pursuant to Section 5, and
shall duly transfer to Lessor title to any engines installed on the Airframe
but not owned by Lessor, all in accordance with the terms of Section 5, and (y)
Lessor shall simultaneously therewith sell, without recourse or warranty
(except as to Lessor's Liens), for cash all of Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to the Aircraft to such highest net cash bidder (or other
purchaser). The total selling price realized at such sale shall be retained by
Lessor (or, so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been discharged,
distributed by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Trust
Indenture) and, in addition, on the Termination Date, Lessee shall pay to
Lessor or, in the case of Supplemental Rent, to the Persons entitled thereto,
in funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), an amount equal to (I) the sum
of (1) the excess, if any, of (A) the Termination Value for the Aircraft as of
the Termination Date, over (B) the proceeds of the sale of the Aircraft after
deducting the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lessor and the
Owner Participant (including any brokerage fee paid to Lessee or any other
Person), plus (2) all Supplemental Rent (including, without limitation, Break
Amount, if any, on the Certificates) due and owing on the Termination Date,
plus (3) (A) if the Termination Date is

43
AF-1
<PAGE> 48
a Lease Period Date, the Basic Rent installment due and payable on that date
pursuant to Section 3(b) (it being understood and agreed that Lessee shall not
be required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment
designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in advance), or
(B) if the Termination Date is not a Lease Period Date and if Basic Rent is
payable in arrears during the Lease Period commencing on the Lease Period Date
next preceding the Termination Date, an amount equal to the Accrued Arrears
Basic Rent for the period from and including such Lease Period Date to but
excluding the Termination Date, plus (4) all Basic Rent due and payable prior
to the Termination Date and unpaid, less (II) any credit to which Lessee may be
entitled as hereinafter in this Section 9(b) provided. Subject always to the
provisions of the penultimate paragraph of Section 3(b), if the Termination
Date with respect to which Termination Value is determined is not a Lease
Period Date and if any portion of the Basic Rent installment paid in respect of
the Lease Period commencing on the Lease Period Date next preceding the
Termination Date is designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as having
been payable in advance, Lessee shall be entitled to a credit against the
amounts payable by it pursuant to this Section 9(b) in an amount equal to the
lesser of (x) the Unearned Advance Basic Rent as of the Termination Date, and
(y) the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of the sale of the Aircraft after
deducting the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lessor and the
Owner Participant (including any brokerage fee paid to Lessee or any other
Person) exceeds the Termination Value for the Aircraft as of the Termination
Date; provided that, in the event that the amount calculated pursuant to this
sentence to be credited exceeds the amounts payable by Lessee pursuant to this
Section 9(b), the Owner Participant shall be obligated to rebate an amount
equal to such excess to Lessee. If on or prior to the scheduled Termination
Date no sale of the Aircraft shall have occurred and if Lessor shall not have
elected to retain the Aircraft in accordance with Section 9(d) or Lessee shall
not have elected to purchase the Aircraft in accordance with Section 9(e),
Lessee's notice given pursuant to Section 9(a) shall be deemed to be withdrawn
as of such scheduled Termination Date and this Lease shall continue in full
force and effect.

<PAGE> 49
(c) Certain Obligations upon Sale of Aircraft. Upon the sale
of the Aircraft pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section
9(b), Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except as
to Lessor's Liens), all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to any
Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but which are not then installed on
the Aircraft. Lessor shall be under no duty to solicit bids, to inquire into
the efforts of Lessee to obtain bids or otherwise take any action in connection
with the sale of the Aircraft under Section 9(b), other than to transfer to the
purchaser of the Aircraft (or to such purchaser and to Lessee, as the case may
be), without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all of
Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the Aircraft against receipt of
the payments provided for herein, and to pay the amounts, if any, required to
be paid by Lessor under Section 9(b) or this Section 9(c), and to request the
Indenture Trustee upon the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(b) to
execute and deliver to such purchaser (or to such purchaser and to Lessee, as
the case may be) an appropriate instrument releasing the Aircraft from the lien
of the Trust Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase
Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge under the Trust Indenture.
Lessor agrees to notify promptly Lessee of the appointment by Lessor of any
broker or finder (other than Lessee) in connection with the sale of the
Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(b) and, subject to Section 9(b), to pay the fees
or commissions of any such broker or finder employed by Lessor in connection
with the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(b).

(d) Retention of Aircraft by Lessor. If Lessee has not elected
to purchase the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected to
retain the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(a), on the Termination Date specified
in Lessee's termination notice, Lessor shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Indenture Trustee funds of the type and in an amount equal to (1) the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Certificates and all accrued interest
thereon, plus (2) all other sums due and payable on such Termination Date under
the Trust Indenture, the Participation Agreement or such Certificates. Subject
to receipt by the Indenture Trustee of such funds, on the Termination Date, (i)
Lessee (x) shall deliver the Aircraft to Lessor in the same manner as if
delivery were made to Lessor at the end of the Term pursuant

45
AF-1
<PAGE> 50
to Section 5, and shall duly transfer to Lessor title to any engines
installed on the Airframe but not owned by Lessor, all in accordance with the
terms of Section 5, and (y) shall pay to Lessor or to the Persons entitled
thereto, in funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), (A) all Supplemental
Rent (including, without limitation, Break Amount, if any, on the
Certificates), other than Termination Value, and, if the Termination Date is a
Lease Period Date, the Basic Rent installment due and payable on that date
pursuant to Section 3(b) (it being understood and agreed that Lessee shall not
be required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment
designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in advance) or,
if the Termination Date is not a Lease Period Date and if Basic Rent is payable
in arrears during the Lease Period commencing on the Lease Period Date next
preceding the Termination Date, an amount equal to the Accrued Arrears Basic
Rent for the period from and including such Lease Period Date to but excluding
the Termination Date, and all Basic Rent due and payable prior to the
Termination Date and unpaid, less (B) any credit to which Lessee may be
entitled as hereinafter in this Section 9(d) provided, and (ii) Lessor (x)
shall transfer or cause to be transferred to Lessee, without recourse or
warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all of Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to any Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but which are
not then installed on the Aircraft, and (y) Lessor shall request the Indenture
Trustee to execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument releasing
the Aircraft from the lien of the Trust Indenture and releasing the Purchase
Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge
under the Trust Indenture. If the Termination Date is not a Lease Period Date
and if any portion of the Basic Rent installment paid in respect of the Lease
Period commencing on the Lease Period Date next preceding the Termination Date
is designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as having been payable in
advance, Lessee shall, subject always to the provisions of the penultimate
paragraph of Section 3(b), be entitled to a credit against the amounts payable
by it pursuant to this Section 9(d) in an amount equal to the Unearned Advance
Basic Rent as of the Termination Date; provided that in the event that the
Unearned Advance Basic Rent exceeds the amount payable by Lessee pursuant to
this Section 9(d), the Owner Participant will be obligated to rebate an amount
equal to such excess to Lessee. If Lessor shall fail to perform any of its
obligations pursuant to this Section 9(d) and as a

46
AF-1
<PAGE> 51
result thereof this Lease shall not be terminated on a proposed Termination
Date, Lessor shall thereafter no longer be entitled to exercise its election to
retain the Aircraft and Lessee may at its option at any time thereafter submit
a new termination notice pursuant to Section 9(a).

(e) Purchase of Aircraft by Lessee. In the event that
Lessee shall have elected to purchase the Aircraft on a Special Termination
Date pursuant to Section (a), on such Special Termination Date, Lessee shall
purchase the Aircraft at a price (the "Special Termination Price") equal to the
greater of (I) the Termination Value for the Aircraft, computed as of the
Special Termination Date, and (II) the then fair market sales value of the
Aircraft, as determined by mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they
shall be unable to agree, by an Independent Appraisal. On such Special
Termination Date, (x) Lessee (i) shall pay to Lessor or to the Persons entitled
thereto, in funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), all unpaid
Supplemental Rent (including, without limitation, Break Amount, if any, on the
Certificates), other than Termination Value, due and owing on such Special
Termination Date, all Basic Rent due and payable prior to the Special
Termination Date and unpaid and the Basic Rent installment due and payable on
the Special Termination Date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it being understood and
agreed that Lessee shall not be required to pay the portion, if any, of such
Basic Rent installment designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being
payable in advance) and (ii) at its option shall either (A) pay to Lessor, in
funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), the Special Termination Price, or
(B) assume all of the rights and obligations of the Owner Trustee under the
Trust Indenture in respect of the Certificates (including, without limitation,
any scheduled payment of principal of, Break Amount, if any, on, or accrued
interest on, the Certificates due and payable on the Special Termination Date
but only to the extent that the Basic Rent installment payable by Lessee
pursuant to clause (i) above does not cover such scheduled payment of principal
of or accrued interest on the Certificates but excluding any obligations or
liabilities of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity incurred on or
prior to the Special Termination Date, which obligations and liabilities shall
remain the sole responsibility of the Owner Trustee) in accordance with Section
2.16 of the Trust Indenture and simultaneously shall pay to Lessor, in funds

47
AF-1
<PAGE> 52
of the type specified in Section 3(d), an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of the Special Termination Price over an amount equal to the sum of the
principal of, and any accrued and unpaid interest on, the outstanding
Certificates on such Special Termination Date, after taking into account any
payments of principal or interest made in respect of the outstanding
Certificates on such Special Termination Date, and (y) Lessor will sell to
Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all of
Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the Aircraft and all of Lessor's
right, title and interest in and to any Engines constituting part of the
Aircraft but which are not then installed on the Aircraft and, if Lessee shall
not have assumed the rights and obligations of the Owner Trustee under the
Trust Indenture in respect of the Certificates as provided for above, Lessor
will request the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to Lessee an
appropriate instrument releasing the Airframe and Engines with respect to which
title is transferred from the lien of the Trust Indenture and releasing the
Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment
and pledge thereunder.

(f) Termination of Lease, Etc. Upon the sale or retention or
purchase of the Aircraft, as the case may be, in compliance with the provisions
of this Section 9, (i) the obligation of Lessee to pay Basic Rent under Section
3(b) on any Lease Period Date occurring subsequent to the applicable
Termination Value Determination Date, and (ii) the obligation of Lessee to pay
Supplemental Rent (subject to Section 3(f), other than payments of Supplemental
Rent to be made by Lessee (x) surviving pursuant to Section 7(d) of the
Participation Agreement or Section 10 of the Tax Indemnity Agreement, or (y) in
respect of liabilities and obligations of Lessee which have accrued under any
Operative Document but not been paid or which are in dispute as of the date of
such sale or retention) shall cease as of the Termination Date and, in each
case, the Term shall end effective as of the Termination Date.

(g) Termination as to Engines. So long as no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee shall have the right at
its option at any time, on at least 60 days' prior written notice, to terminate
this Lease with respect to any Engine. In such event, and prior to the date of
such termination, Lessee shall replace such Engine hereunder by complying with
the terms

48
AF-1
<PAGE> 53
of Section 10(b) to the same extent as if an Event of Loss had occurred with
respect to such Engine.

Section 10. Loss, Destruction, Requisition, Etc. (a) Event
of Loss with Respect to the Airframe. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss
with respect to the Airframe, Lessee shall forthwith (and, in any event, within
30 days after such occurrence) give Lessor notice of such Event of Loss and of
its election to perform one of the following options (it being agreed that, if
Lessee shall not have given notice of such election within such 30 days after
such occurrence, Lessee shall be deemed to have elected to perform the option
set forth in the following clause (ii)):

(i) as promptly as practicable, and in any event on or before
the Business Day next preceding the 121st day next following the date
of occurrence of such Event of Loss, in replacement for the Airframe,
Lessee shall convey or cause to be conveyed to Lessor title to a
Replacement Airframe (together with the same number of Replacement
Engines as the Engines, if any, installed on the Airframe at the time
such Event of Loss occurred) to be leased to Lessee hereunder, such
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines to be free and clear of
all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), to have a value and utility at
least equal to, and to be in as good operating condition as, the
Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced (assuming such Airframe and
Engines were in the condition and repair required by the terms of this
Lease); provided that, if Lessee shall not perform its obligation to
effect such replacement under this clause (i) during the period of
time provided herein, then Lessee shall pay on the fifteenth day next
following the end of such period to Lessor, or, in the case of
Supplemental Rent, to the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of the
type specified in Section 3(d) hereof, the amounts specified in clause
(ii) below; or

(ii) on or before the earlier of 30 days following the date on
which insurance proceeds are received with respect to such Event of
Loss and the Business Day next preceding the 121st day next following
the date of occurrence of such Event of Loss or on the date specified
in the proviso to clause (i) above, if such proviso is applicable (the
"Loss Payment Date"),

49
AF-1
<PAGE> 54
Lessee shall pay to Lessor or, in the case of Supplemental Rent, to
the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of the type specified in
Section 3(d), A) the Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft,
determined as of the Loss Payment Date, plus (B) all Supplemental Rent
(including, without limitation, the Break Amount, if any, on the
Certificates) due and owing on such Loss Payment Date, plus (C) if the
Casualty Loss Determination Date with respect to the Stipulated Loss
Value is a Lease Period Date, the Basic Rent installment due and
payable on that date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it being understood and
agreed that Lessee shall not be required to pay the portion, if any,
of such Basic Rent installment designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent
Schedule as being payable in advance), plus (D) all Basic Rent due and
payable prior to the Casualty Loss Determination Date and unpaid.

In the event of payment in full of the Stipulated Loss Value
for the Aircraft and all amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10, (1) the
obligation of Lessee to pay any Basic Rent under Section 3(b) on any Lease
Period Date occurring subsequent to the Casualty Loss Determination Date with
respect to which Stipulated Loss Value is determined shall terminate, (2) the
obligation of Lessee to pay Supplemental Rent (subject to Section 3(f), other
than payments of Supplemental Rent to be made by Lessee (x) surviving pursuant
to Section 10 of the Tax Indemnity Agreement or Section 7(d) of the
Participation Agreement, or (y) in respect of liabilities and obligations of
Lessee which have accrued under any of the Operative Documents but not been
paid or which are in dispute as of the date of such payment) shall terminate,
(3) the Term for the Aircraft shall end, (4) Lessor will transfer to Lessee,
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all Lessor's right,
title and interest in and to the Airframe and Engines (if any) with respect to
which such Event of Loss occurred, as well as all Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to any Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but not
installed thereon when such Event of Loss occurred, and (5) Lessor will assign
to or as directed by Lessee all claims of Lessor against third Persons relating
to such Airframe and Engines arising from such Event of Loss. Upon such
transfer, Lessor shall request the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to
Lessee an appropriate instrument releasing the Airframe and Engines with
respect to which title is transferred

50
AF-1
<PAGE> 55
from the lien of the Trust Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and
the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge thereof
thereunder.

At the time of or prior to any replacement of the Airframe and
such Engines, if any, Lessee, at its own expense, will (A) furnish Lessor with
a warranty (as to title) bill of sale in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Lessor (which warranty shall except Permitted Liens) with
respect to the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, together
with an assignment of any and all manufacturer's warranties applicable thereto
(to the extent such warranties may be so assigned by Lessee) in a form
substantially similar to the Form of Purchase Agreement Assignment attached as
Exhibit III to the Participation Agreement, (B) cause a Lease Supplement
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, subjecting such Replacement
Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, to this Lease, and duly executed by
Lessee, to be delivered to Lessor for execution and, upon such execution, to be
filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act or, if necessary,
pursuant to the applicable laws of such jurisdiction other than the United
States of America in which such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines,
if any, are to be registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the case may
be, (C) so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been satisfied and
discharged, cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement substantially in
the form of Exhibit A to the Trust Indenture or other requisite documents or
instruments for such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, to
be delivered to Lessor and to the Indenture Trustee for execution and, upon
such execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation
Act or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of such jurisdiction
other than the United States of America in which such Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, are to be registered in accordance with Section
7(a), as the case may be, (D) so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have
been satisfied and discharged, cause a financing statement or statements with
respect to the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, or other
requisite documents or instruments to be filed in such place or places as
necessary in order to perfect the security interest therein created by or
pursuant to the Trust Indenture, or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable
laws of the jurisdiction in which such Replacement Airframe and Replacement
Engines, if any, are to be registered in accordance with

51
AF-1
<PAGE> 56
Section 7(a), as the case may be, (E) furnish Lessor and the Indenture Trustee
with an opinion of Lessee's counsel addressed to each (which may be Lessee's
General Counsel), to the effect that the bill of sale referred to in clause (A)
above constitutes an effective instrument for the conveyance of title to the
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, to Lessor and to the
further effect that upon such conveyance such substituted property will be
leased hereunder and subjected to the lien of the Trust Indenture, (F) furnish
Lessor with a certificate of an independent aircraft engineer or appraiser
certifying that the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, have
a value and utility at least equal to, and are in as good operating condition
as, the Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced assuming such Airframe and
Engines were in the condition and repair required by the terms hereof
immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss, (G) furnish Lessor
and the Indenture Trustee with (i) such evidence of compliance with the
insurance provisions of Section 11 with respect to such Replacement Airframe
and Replacement Engines as Lessor may reasonably request and (ii) a certificate
from a Responsible Officer of Lessee certifying that at the time of such
replacement there is no continuing Event of Default, and (H) furnish Lessor and
the Indenture Trustee with a reasoned opinion of Lessee's counsel (which may be
Lessee's General Counsel) addressed to each, to the effect that the Owner
Trustee, as Lessor under the Lease, and the Indenture Trustee, as assignee of
the Owner Trustee's rights under the Lease pursuant to the Indenture, should be
entitled to the benefits of Title 11 U.S.C. Section 1110 with respect to the
Replacement Airframe, provided that (i) such opinion need not be delivered to
the extent that, by reason of a change in law or in judicial or other
governmental interpretation thereof, the benefits of such Section 1110 were not
available to the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee with respect to the
Aircraft immediately prior to such substitution and (ii) such opinion may
contain qualifications and assumptions of the tenor contained in the opinion of
Debevoise & Plimpton delivered pursuant to Section 4(J) of the Participation
Agreement on the Delivery Date and such other qualifications and assumptions as
shall at the time be customary in opinions rendered in comparable
circumstances. In the case of each Replacement Airframe and each Replacement
Engine, if any, conveyed to Lessor under this Section 10, and each Replacement
Engine conveyed to Lessor under this Section 10, promptly upon the registration
of the Replacement Aircraft and the

52
AF-1
<PAGE> 57
recordation of the Lease Supplement and the Trust Agreement and Indenture
Supplement or other requisite documents or instruments covering such
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, or such Replacement
Engine pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act (or pursuant to the applicable laws
of the jurisdiction in which such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines,
if any, or such Replacement Engine, are to be registered in accordance with
Section 7(a)), Lessee will cause to be delivered to Lessor and the Indenture
Trustee an opinion of counsel to Lessee as to the due registration of such
Replacement Aircraft, the due recordation of such Lease Supplement and such
Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement or other requisite documents or
instruments and the validity and perfection of the security interest in the
Replacement Aircraft, Replacement Engines or Replacement Engine, as the case
may be, granted to the Indenture Trustee under the Trust Indenture.

For all purposes hereof, upon passage of title thereto to
Lessor the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, shall be
deemed part of the property leased hereunder, the Replacement Airframe shall be
deemed an "Airframe" as defined herein, and each such Replacement Engine shall
be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein. No such replacement of the Airframe
or any Engines under the circumstances contemplated by the terms of this
Section 10(a) shall result in any reduction of Basic Rent. Upon such passage
of title, Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except
as to Lessor's Liens), all Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the
replaced Airframe and Engines (if any) installed thereon at the time such Event
of Loss occurred, and upon such transfer, Lessor will request in writing that
the Indenture Trustee execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument
releasing such replaced Airframe and Engines (if any) installed thereon at the
time such Event of Loss occurred from the lien of the Indenture and releasing
the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the
assignment and pledge under the Indenture.

(b) Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under circumstances in
which there has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe,
Lessee shall give Lessor prompt written notice thereof and shall, within 90
days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss,

53
AF-1
<PAGE> 58
convey or cause to be conveyed to Lessor, as replacement for the Engine with
respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, title to a Replacement Engine
free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and having a value and
utility at least equal to, and being in as good operating condition as, the
Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, assuming such Engine
was of the value and utility and in the condition and repair required by the
terms hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss. Prior
to or at the time of any such conveyance, Lessee, at its own expense, will (i)
furnish Lessor with a warranty (as to title) bill of sale (which warranty shall
except Permitted Liens) with respect to such Replacement Engine, (ii) cause a
Lease Supplement substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, subjecting such
Replacement Engine to this Lease, and duly executed by Lessee, to be delivered
to Lessor for execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for recordation
pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, or, if necessary, pursuant to the
applicable laws of such jurisdiction other than the United States of America in
which the Aircraft is registered, (iii) so long as the Trust Indenture shall
not have been satisfied and discharged, comply with the applicable provisions
thereof and cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement substantially in
the form of Exhibit A to the Trust Indenture or other requisite documents or
instruments for such Replacement Engine to be delivered to Lessor and to the
Indenture Trustee for execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for
recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act or, if necessary, pursuant to
the applicable laws of such jurisdiction other than the United States of
America in which the Aircraft is or is to be registered in accordance with
Section 7(a), as the case may be, (iv) furnish Lessor and the Indenture Trustee
with an opinion of Lessee's counsel addressed to each (which may be Lessee's
General Counsel) to the effect that the bill of sale referred to in clause (i)
above constitutes an effective instrument for the conveyance of title to such
Replacement Engine to Lessor and to the further effect that upon such
conveyance such substituted property will be leased hereunder and subjected to
the lien of the Trust Indenture, (v) furnish Lessor with a certificate of an
aircraft engineer or appraiser (who may be an employee of Lessee) certifying
that such Replacement Engine has a value and utility at least equal to, and is
in as good operating condition as, the Engine so replaced assuming such Engine
was in the condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior
to the occurrence of

54
AF-1
<PAGE> 59
such Event of Loss, (vi) so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been
satisfied and discharged, cause a financing statement or statements with
respect to the Replacement Engine or other requisite documents or instruments
to be filed in such place or places as necessary in order to perfect the
security interest therein created by or pursuant to the Trust Indenture, or, if
necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which the
Aircraft is or is to be registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the case
may be, and (vii) furnish Lessor and the Indenture Trustee with such evidence
of compliance with the insurance provisions of Section 11 with respect to such
Replacement Engine as Lessor may reasonably request. Upon full compliance by
Lessee with the terms of this paragraph (b), Lessor will transfer to Lessee,
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all of Lessor's
right, title and interest in and to the Engine with respect to which such Event
of Loss occurred, and Lessor will assign to or as directed by Lessee all claims
of Lessor against third Persons relating to such Engine arising from such Event
of Loss. In addition, upon such transfer Lessor shall request in writing that
the Indenture Trustee execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument
releasing such Engine from the lien of the Trust Indenture and releasing the
Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment (in respect solely of
such Engine) from the assignment and pledge under the Trust Indenture. For all
purposes hereof, each such Replacement Engine shall, after such conveyance, be
deemed part of the property leased hereunder and shall be deemed an "Engine" as
defined herein. No Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under the
circumstances contemplated by the terms of this Section 10(b) shall result in
any reduction in Basic Rent.

(c) Application of Payments from Governmental Authorities for
Requisition of Title or Use. Any payments (other than insurance proceeds the
application of which is provided for in Section 11) received at any time by
Lessor or by Lessee from any governmental authority or other Person with
respect to an Event of Loss resulting from the condemnation, confiscation,
theft or seizure of, or requisition of title to or use of, the Airframe or any
Engine, other than a requisition for use by any Government or by the government
of the country of registry of the Aircraft not constituting an Event of Loss,
will be applied as follows:

55
AF-1
<PAGE> 60
(i) if such payments are received with respect to the Airframe 
or the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on the Airframe 
that has been or is being replaced by Lessee pursuant to Section 
10(a), such payments shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessor 
and upon completion of such replacement be paid over to, or retained 
by, Lessee;

(ii) if such payments are received with respect to the Airframe
or the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on the Airframe
that has not been and will not be replaced pursuant to Section 10(a),
such payments shall, after reimbursement of Lessor for costs and
expenses, be applied in reduction of Lessee's obligation to pay the
Stipulated Loss Value required to be paid by Lessee pursuant to
Section 10(a), if not already paid by Lessee, or, if already paid by
Lessee, shall be applied to reimburse Lessee for its payment of such
Stipulated Loss Value, and the balance, if any, of such payments
remaining thereafter shall be paid over to, and retained by, Lessee
and Lessor, as their interests may appear; and

(iii) if such payments are received with respect to an Engine
under circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b), so much of such
payments remaining after reimbursement of Lessor for costs and
expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee; provided that
Lessee shall have fully performed the terms of Section 10(b) with
respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

(d) Requisition for Use by the Government of the Airframe and
the Engines Installed Thereon. In the event of the requisition for use by any
Government or by the government of the country of registry of the Aircraft
(including for this purpose any agency or instrumentality thereof), including,
without limitation, pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program referred to
in Section 7(b)(iv), of the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on
the Airframe during the Term, Lessee shall promptly notify Lessor of such
requisition and all of Lessee's obligations under this Lease with respect to
the Aircraft shall continue to the same extent as if such requisition had not
occurred. All payments received by Lessor or Lessee from such Government or
government for the use of the Airframe and Engines or engines during the Term
for the Aircraft shall be paid over to, or retained

56
AF-1
<PAGE> 61
by, Lessee. In the case of any requisition for use by the government of the
United States (or any agency or instrumentality thereof whose obligations bear
the full faith and credit of such government) of the Airframe and Engines or
engines installed on the Airframe that would extend beyond the end of the Term,
Lessee at its option may, by written notice to Lessor given not more than 30
nor less than 10 days before the end of the Term, elect to declare an Event of
Loss with respect to the Airframe and Engines or engines. Such Event of Loss
will be deemed to have occurred on the final day of the Term. If Lessee does
not so elect to declare an Event of Loss and (1) such requisition fully
terminates and (2) the Airframe and Engines or engines are returned to Lessee
before the first anniversary of the end of the Term, Lessee shall be obligated
to return the Airframe and the Engines or engines to Lessor pursuant to, and in
all other respects to comply with the provisions of, Section 5 as soon as
practicable after the Airframe and Engines or engines are returned to Lessee
unless Lessee shall have exercised its option to purchase the Aircraft pursuant
to Sections 9(e), 20(b) or 20(c). In addition, Lessee shall pay to Lessor at
monthly intervals (until the earlier of (i) the return of the Aircraft to
Lessor pursuant to Section 5 and (ii) the first anniversary of the end of the
Term), an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (A) the daily
equivalent of the lesser of (x) 50% of the average annual Basic Rent for the
Aircraft payable during the Term (excluding for this purpose the Interim
Period) and (y) the fair market rental value of the Aircraft for such period,
and (B) the amounts received by Lessor from such government for the use of the
Aircraft for such period. All payments received by Lessor or Lessee from such
government for the use of such Airframe and Engines or engines during the first
year after the end of the Term for the Aircraft shall be paid over to, or
retained by, Lessor unless Lessee shall have exercised its option to purchase
the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(e), 20(b) or 20(c), in which event all such
payments received after such purchase shall be paid over to, or retained by,
Lessee.

(e) Requisition for Use by the Government of an Engine. In
the event of the requisition for use by any Government or by the government of
the country of registry of the Aircraft (including for this purpose any agency
or instrumentality thereof) of any Engine (but not the Airframe), Lessee will
replace such Engine hereunder by complying with the terms of Section 10(b) to
the same extent

57
AF-1
<PAGE> 62
as if an Event of Loss had occurred with respect to such Engine, and any
payments received by Lessor or Lessee from such Government or government with
respect to such requisition shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee.

(f) Application of Payments During Existence of Event of
Default. Any amount referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 10(c),
Section 10(d) or Section 10(e) which is payable to Lessee shall not be paid to
Lessee, or if it has been previously paid directly to Lessee, shall not be
retained by Lessee, if at the time of such payment an Event of Default (or
event that with lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under
Section 14(a), 14(g), 14(h) or 14(i)) shall have occurred and be continuing,
but shall be paid to and held by the Lessor as security for the obligations of
Lessee under this Lease, and at such time as there shall not be continuing any
such Event of Default or event, such amount shall be paid to Lessee, provided
that if any such amount has been so held by Lessor as security for more than 90
days after an Event of Default shall have occurred and during which period (i)
Lessor shall not have been limited by operation of law or otherwise from
exercising remedies hereunder or (ii) Lessor shall not have commenced to
exercise any remedy available to it under Section 15, then such amount shall be
paid to Lessee.

Section 11. Insurance. (a) Public Liability and Property
Damage Insurance. Subject to the rights of Lessee to establish and maintain
self-insurance with respect to public liability and property damage liability
insurance for aircraft and engines (including the Aircraft and Engines) in the
manner and to the extent specified in the next sentence, Lessee will carry, or
cause to be carried, at no expense to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or the
Owner Participant, public liability (including, without limitation, contractual
liability and passenger legal liability) and property damage liability
insurance (exclusive of manufacturer's product liability insurance) with
respect to the Aircraft (i) in amounts which are not less than the public
liability and property damage insurance applicable to similar aircraft and
engines which comprise Lessee's fleet on which Lessee carries insurance,
provided that such liability insurance shall not be less than the amount
certified to Lessor on the Delivery Date, (ii) of the type usually carried by
corporations engaged in the same or similar business, similarly situated with
Lessee, and owning or operating similar aircraft and

58
AF-1
<PAGE> 63
engines and covering risks of the kind customarily insured against by Lessee,
and (iii) which is maintained in effect with insurers of recognized
responsibility. Lessee may self-insure, by way of deductible or premium
adjustment provisions in insurance policies, the risks required to be insured
against pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in no case shall the
self-insurance (including the self-insurance permitted by Section 11(b)) with
respect to all of the aircraft and engines in Lessee's fleet (including,
without limitation, the Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month policy year the
lesser of (x) 50% of the largest replacement value of any single aircraft in
Lessee's fleet or (y) 1-1/2% of the average aggregate insurable value (for the
preceding year) of all aircraft (including, without limitation, the Aircraft)
on which Lessee carries insurance; provided that, in the event that there shall
have occurred a material adverse change in the financial condition of Lessee
from such condition as is reflected in the consolidated financial statements of
Lessee at December 31, 1982, then, upon not less than 30 days' written notice
from Lessor to Lessee, Lessee will, until Lessee's financial condition is on an
overall basis equivalent to its financial condition at December 31, 1982,
reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder to such reasonable amount as
Lessor may require; provided, further, that a deductible per occurrence
utilized to reduce handling that, in the case of the Aircraft, is not in excess
of the amount customarily allowed as a deductible in the industry, shall be
permitted in addition to the above-mentioned self-insurance. Any policies of
insurance carried in accordance with this Section 11(a) and any policies taken
out in substitution or replacement for any of such policies (A) shall name
Lessor, as lessor of the Aircraft and in its individual capacity, the Indenture
Trustee and each Participant as additional insureds as their respective
Interests may appear (and, so long as the Owner Participant is a direct or
indirect subsidiary of American Telephone & Telegraph Company, shall name AT&T
Capital Corporation and American Telephone & Telegraph Company as additional
insureds), (B) shall provide that in respect of the respective interests of
Lessor, of the Indenture Trustee and of each Participant in such policies the
insurance shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction of Lessee and
shall insure Lessor's, the Indenture Trustee's and such Participant's Interests
as they appear, regardless of any breach or violation of any warranty,
declaration or condition contained in such policies by Lessee, (C) shall
provide that, if such insurance is

59
AF-1
<PAGE> 64
cancelled for any reason whatever, or any substantial change is made in the
policy which affects the coverage certified hereunder to Lessor, the Indenture
Trustee or any Participant, or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for
nonpayment of premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be
effective as to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or such Participant for 30 days
(seven days, or such other period as is customarily obtainable in the industry,
in the case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt by
Lessor, by the Indenture Trustee or by such Participant, respectively, of
written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse, (D)
shall provide that neither Lessor, the Indenture Trustee nor any Participant
shall have any obligation or liability for premiums, commissions, assessments
or calls in connection with such insurance, (E) shall provide that the insurers
shall waive (i) any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction,
whether by attachment or otherwise, which they may have against Lessor, the
Indenture Trustee or any Participant and (ii) any rights of subrogation against
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant to the extent that Lessee has
waived its rights by its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to
this Lease or the Participation Agreement; provided that the exercise by such
insurers of rights of subrogation derived from the rights retained by Lessee
shall not, in any way, delay payment of any claim that would otherwise be
payable by such insurers but for the existence of rights of subrogation derived
from rights retained by Lessee, (F) shall be primary without right of
contribution from any other insurance which may be carried by Lessor, the
Indenture Trustee or any Participant with respect to its Interests as such in
the Aircraft and (G) shall expressly provide that all of the provisions
thereof, except the limits of liability, shall operate in the same manner as if
there were a separate policy covering each insured. "Interests" as used in
this Section 11(a) and Section 11(b) with respect to any Person means the
interests of such Person in its capacity as Lessor, Owner Trustee (including in
its individual capacity under the Participation Agreement), Indenture Trustee
or Participant, as the case may be, in the leasing transaction contemplated by
this Lease, the Participation Agreement and the Indenture. Lessee shall
arrange for appropriate certification that the requirements of this Section
11(a) have been met to be made to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Participant (and the Indenture Trustee may furnish such certificates to each
Loan

60
AF-1
<PAGE> 65
Participant) as soon as practicable by each insurer or its authorized
representative with respect thereto, provided that all information contained
therein shall be held confidential by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and each
Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other
than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and
any Person with whom any Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations
relating to the possible transfer and sale of such Participant's Certificates
or interest in the Aircraft, as the case may be, if such Person shall have
entered into an agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(a)
whereby such Person agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as
may be required by an order of any court or administrative agency or by any
statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. In the case
of a sublease or contract with any Government in respect of the Aircraft or any
Engine, or in the case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine
by any Government, a valid agreement, reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and the
Owner Participant, to indemnify Lessee against any of the risks which Lessee is
required hereunder to insure against by such Government shall be considered
adequate insurance to the extent of the risks and in the amounts that are the
subject of any such agreement to indemnify.

(b) Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Aircraft. Subject to
the rights of Lessee to establish and maintain self- insurance with respect to
loss or damage to aircraft (including the Aircraft) in the manner and to the
extent specified in the next sentence, Lessee shall maintain, or cause to be
maintained, in effect with insurers of recognized responsibility, at no expense
to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant, all-risk aircraft hull
insurance covering the Aircraft and all-risk coverage with respect to any
Engines or Parts while removed from the Aircraft (including, without
limitation, war risk and allied perils insurance if and to the extent the same
is maintained by Lessee or any Permitted Air Carrier subleasing the same with
respect to other aircraft owned or operated by Lessee or such Permitted Air
Carrier, as the case may be, on the same routes) which is of the type and in
substantially the amount usually carried by corporations engaged in the same or
similar business and similarly situated with Lessee; provided that (i) such
insurance (including the permitted self-insurance) shall at all times while the
Aircraft is subject to this Lease be for

61
AF-1
<PAGE> 66
an amount not less than the Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft from time to
time and (ii) such insurance need not cover an Engine while attached to an
airframe not owned, leased or operated by Lessee. Lessee may self-insure, by
way of deductible or premium adjustment provisions in insurance policies, the
risks required to be insured against pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in
no case shall the self-insurance (including the self-insurance permitted by
Section 11(a)) with respect to all of the aircraft and engines in Lessee's
fleet (including, without limitation, the Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month
policy year the lesser of (i) 50% of the largest replacement value of any
single aircraft in Lessee's fleet or (ii) 1-1/2% of the average aggregate
insurable value (for the preceding year) of all aircraft (including, without
limitation, the Aircraft) on which Lessee carries insurance; provided that, in
the event that there shall have occurred a material adverse change in the
financial condition of Lessee from such condition as is reflected in the
consolidated financial statements of Lessee at December 31, 1982, then, upon
not less than 30 days' written notice from Lessor to Lessee, Lessee will, until
Lessee's financial condition is on an overall basis equivalent to its financial
condition at December 31, 1982, reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder
to such reasonable amount as Lessor may require; provided, further, that a
deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce handling that, in the case of the
Aircraft, is not in excess of the amount customarily allowed as a deductible in
the industry, shall be permitted in addition to the above-mentioned
self-insurance. Any policies carried in accordance with this Section 11(b) and
any policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any such policies (A)
shall provide that any loss up to the amount of Stipulated Loss Value for any
loss or damage constituting an Event of Loss with respect to the Aircraft, and
any loss in excess of $7,000,000, up to the amount of Stipulated Loss Value,
for any loss or damage to the Aircraft (or Engines) not constituting an Event
of Loss with respect to the Aircraft, shall be paid to the Indenture Trustee as
long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been discharged pursuant to the
terms and conditions thereof, and thereafter to Lessor, unless, in each case,
the insurer shall have received notice that an Event of Default exists, in
which case all insurance proceeds up to Stipulated Loss Value shall be payable
to the Indenture Trustee or Lessor, as the case may be, (B) shall provide that
in respect of the respective interests of Lessor, of the Indenture Trustee and
of

62
AF-1
<PAGE> 67
each Participant in such policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any
action or inaction of Lessee and shall insure Lessor's, the Indenture Trustee's
and such Participant's Interests, as they appear, regardless of any breach or
violation of any warranty, declaration or condition contained in such policies
by Lessee, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is cancelled for any
reason whatever, or any material change is made in the policy which affects the
coverage certified hereunder to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any
Participant, or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of
premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be effective as to
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or such Participant for 30 days (seven days, or
such other period as may from time to time be customarily obtainable in the
industry, in the case of any war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt
by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or such Participant, respectively, of written
notice from such insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse, (D) shall be
primary without right of contribution from any other insurance which may be
carried by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant with respect to its
Interests as such in the Aircraft and (E) shall provide that the insurers shall
waive (i) any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction, whether
by attachment or otherwise, which they may have against Lessor, the Indenture
Trustee or any Participant and (ii) any rights of subrogation against Lessor,
the Indenture Trustee and any Participant to the extent that Lessee has waived
its rights by its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to this Lease
or the Participation Agreement; provided that the exercise by such insurers of
rights of subrogation derived from rights retained by Lessee shall not, in any
way, delay payment of any claim that would otherwise be payable by such
insurers but for the existence of rights of subrogation derived from rights
retained by Lessee. Lessee shall arrange for appropriate certification that
the requirements of this Section 11(b) have been met to be made promptly to
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant (and the Indenture
Trustee shall furnish such certification to each Loan Participant) by each
insurer or its authorized representative with respect thereto, provided that
all information contained therein shall be held confidential by Lessor, the
Indenture Trustee and each Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed
by them to anyone other than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants,
agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom any Participant is in

63
AF-1
<PAGE> 68
good faith conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale
of such Participant's Certificates or interest in the Aircraft, as the case may
be, if such Person shall have entered into an agreement similar to that
contained in this Section 11(b) whereby such Person agrees to hold such
information confidential, and except as may be required by an order of any
court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or order of
any governmental authority. In the case of a sublease or contract with any
Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, or in the case of any
requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine by any Government, a valid
agreement, reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and the Owner Participant, to
indemnify Lessee against any of the risks which Lessee is required hereunder to
insure against by such Government in any amount up to the Stipulated Loss Value
of the Aircraft from time to time shall be considered adequate insurance to the
extent of the risks and in the amounts that are the subject of any such
agreement to indemnify.

As between Lessor and Lessee it is agreed that all insurance
payments received under policies required to be maintained by Lessee hereunder,
exclusive of any payments received in excess of the Stipulated Loss Value for
the Aircraft from such policies, as the result of the occurrence of an Event of
Loss with respect to the Airframe or an Engine will be applied as follows:

(x) if such payments are received with respect to the
Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines installed on the
Airframe that has been or is being replaced by Lessee as contemplated
by Section 10(a), such payments shall be paid over to, or retained by,
Lessor, and upon completion of such replacement be paid over to, or
retained by, Lessee;

(y) if such payments are received with respect to the Airframe
or the Airframe and any Engines or engines installed thereon that has
not been and will not be replaced as contemplated by Section 10(a), so
much of such payments remaining after reimbursement of Lessor for
costs and expenses as shall not exceed the Stipulated Loss Value
required to be paid by Lessee pursuant to Section 10(a) shall be
applied in reduction of Lessee's obligation to pay such Stipulated
Loss Value, if not already paid by Lessee, or, if already paid by
Lessee, shall be applied to reimburse

64
AF-1
<PAGE> 69
Lessee for its payment of such Stipulated Loss Value, and the
balance, if any, of such payment remaining thereafter will be paid
over to, or retained by, Lessee; and

(z) if such payments are received with respect to an Engine
under the circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b), so much of such
payments remaining after reimbursement of Lessor for costs and
expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee; provided that
Lessee shall have fully performed the terms of Section 10(b) with
respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

As between Lessor and Lessee the insurance payment of any
property damage loss in excess of the Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft
shall be paid to Lessee.

As between Lessor and Lessee the insurance payments of any
property damage loss not constituting an Event of Loss with respect to the
Airframe or an Engine will be applied in payment (or to reimburse Lessee) for
repairs or for replacement property in accordance with the terms of Sections 7
and 8, and any balance remaining after compliance with such Sections with
respect to such loss shall be paid to Lessee. Any amount referred to in the
preceding sentence or in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the second preceding
paragraph which is payable to Lessee shall not be paid to Lessee or, if it has
been previously paid directly to Lessee, shall not be retained by Lessee, if at
the time of such payment an Event of Default (or event that with lapse of time
would constitute an Event of Default under Section 14(a), 14(g), 14(h) or
14(i)) shall have occurred and be continuing, but shall be paid to and held by
Lessor, as security for the obligations of Lessee under this Lease, and at such
time as there shall not be continuing any such Event of Default or event, such
amount shall be paid to Lessee, provided that if any such amount has been so
held by Lessor as security for more than 90 days after an Event of Default
shall have occurred and during which period (i) Lessor shall not have been
limited by operation of law or otherwise from exercising remedies hereunder and
(ii) Lessor shall not have exercised any remedy available to it under Section
15, then such amount shall be paid to Lessee.

(c) Reports, Etc. On or before the Delivery Date, and
annually upon renewal of Lessee's insurance

65
AF-1
<PAGE> 70
coverage, Lessee will furnish to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Participant (and the Indenture Trustee shall furnish to each Loan Participant)
a report signed by a firm of independent aircraft insurance brokers appointed
by Lessee, stating the opinion of such firm that the insurance then carried and
maintained on the Aircraft complies with the terms hereof; provided that all
information contained in such report shall be held confidential by Lessor, the
Indenture Trustee and each Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed
by them to anyone other than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants,
agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom any Participant is in good
faith conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale of
such Participant's Certificates or interest in the Aircraft, as the case may
be, if such Person shall have entered into an agreement similar to that
contained in this Section 11(c) whereby such Person agrees to hold such
information confidential, and except as may be required by an order of any
court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or order of
any governmental authority. Lessee will cause such firm to advise Lessor, the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant, in writing promptly of any default
in the payment of any premium and of any other act or omission on the part of
Lessee of which such firm has knowledge and which might invalidate or render
unenforceable, in whole or in part, any insurance on the Aircraft. Lessee will
also cause such firm to advise Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Participant, in writing as promptly as practicable after such firm acquires
knowledge that an interruption or reduction of any insurance carried and
maintained on the Aircraft pursuant to the provisions of this Section 11 will
occur.

(d) Insurance for Own Account. Nothing in this Section 11
shall limit or prohibit the Owner Participant (either directly or in the name
of the Owner Trustee) or Lessee from obtaining insurance for its own account
with respect to the Airframe or any Engine and any proceeds payable thereunder
shall be payable as provided in the insurance policy relating thereto, provided
that (i) no such insurance may be obtained which would limit or otherwise
adversely affect the coverage or amounts payable under insurance required to be
maintained pursuant to this Section 11, it being understood that all salvage
rights to the Airframe or such Engine shall remain with Lessee's insurers at
all times, and (ii) the Owner Participant may obtain hull insurance on the
Aircraft only to the extent

66
AF-1
<PAGE> 71
the procurement of such insurance does not have an adverse effect on Lessee's
ability or cost to obtain such insurance, except that the limitation in the
foregoing clause (i) on the Owner Participant's right to obtain liability
insurance shall not apply during any period in which Lessee is providing a
Government indemnity in lieu of the liability insurance required by Section
11(a) and the limitations in clauses (i) and (ii) on the Owner Participant's
rights to obtain hull insurance shall not apply during any period in which
Lessee is providing a Government indemnity in lieu of the hull insurance
required by Section 11(b).

Section 12. Inspection. At all reasonable times during the
Term, but upon at least 5 days' prior written notice to Lessee, Lessor or the
Indenture Trustee or any of their respective authorized representatives may at
their own expense and risk conduct a visual walk-around inspection of the
Aircraft and any Engine (including a visual walk-around inspection of the
Aircraft during any regularly scheduled heavy maintenance visit for the
Aircraft conducted by Lessee during the Term) and may inspect the books and
records of Lessee relating thereto; provided that (a) such representatives
shall be fully insured to the reasonable satisfaction of Lessee by Lessor or
the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, with respect to any risks incurred
in connection with any such inspection, (b) any such inspection shall be
subject to the safety, security and workplace rules applicable at the location
where such inspection is conducted and any applicable governmental rules or
regulations and (c) in the case of an inspection during a maintenance visit,
such inspection shall not in any respect interfere with the normal conduct of
such maintenance visit or extend the time required for such maintenance visit.
All information obtained in connection with any such inspection shall be held
confidential by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and each Participant and shall
not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other than their bank
examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and any Person with
whom any Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations relating to the
possible transfer and sale of such Participant's Certificates or interest in
the Aircraft, as the case may be, if such Person shall have entered into an
agreement similar to that contained in this Section 12 whereby such Person
agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be required by
an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule,

67
AF-1
<PAGE> 72
regulation or order of any governmental authority. Lessee will, upon the
request of Lessor or the Indenture Trustee at any time, notify Lessor or the
Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, of the time and location of the next
scheduled heavy maintenance visit to be conducted by Lessee in respect of the
Aircraft during the Term; provided that Lessee shall have the right in its sole
discretion to reschedule, or change the location of, any maintenance visit of
which it shall have notified Lessor or the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this
sentence, Lessee hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts to notify Lessor or
the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, of any such rescheduling or change.
None of Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant shall have any duty to
make any such inspection and shall not incur any liability or obligation by
reason of not making any such inspection. No inspection pursuant to this
Section 12 shall relieve Lessee of any of its obligations under this Lease. No
inspection pursuant to this Section 12 shall interfere with the use, operation
or maintenance of the Aircraft or the normal conduct of Lessee's business, and
Lessee shall not be required to undertake or incur any additional liabilities
in connection therewith.

Section 13. Assignment, Citizenship, Etc. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 7(b) or in the case of any requisition for use by
any Government referred to in Section 7(a), Lessee will not, without the prior
written consent of Lessor, assign any of its rights hereunder, except as
permitted by Section 13 of the Participation Agreement. Except as elsewhere
herein provided or as expressly permitted by the provisions of the
Participation Agreement, Lessor agrees that it will not assign or convey its
right, title and interest in and to this Lease or the Aircraft; provided,
however, that, in each case where so provided or permitted, the transferee
shall be domiciled in the United States, shall be a "citizen of the United
States" within the meaning of Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act and
shall assume all of the obligations of Lessor under this Lease. The terms and
provisions of this Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
Lessor and Lessee and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

Section 14. Events of Default. The following events shall
constitute Events of Default (whether any such event shall be voluntary or
involuntary or come about or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to or
in

68
AF-1
<PAGE> 73
compliance with any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule
or regulation of any administrative or governmental body) and each such Event
of Default shall be deemed to exist and continue so long as, but only as long
as, it shall not have been remedied:

(a) Lessee shall fail to make any payment of Basic Rent,
Stipulated Loss Value or Termination Value within 15 days after the
same shall have become due or of any other amount of Supplemental Rent
within 15 days after written notice of such failure by Lessor; or

(b) Lessee shall fail to carry and maintain insurance on or
with respect to the Aircraft in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11;provided that, in the case of insurance with respect to
which cancellation, change or lapse for nonpayment of premium shall
not be effective as to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner
Participant for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as may from
time to time be customarily obtainable in the industry, in the case of
any war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt of notice by
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Participant of such
cancellation, change or lapse, no such failure to carry and maintain
insurance shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder until the
earlier of (i) the date such failure shall have continued unremedied
for a period of 20 days (five days in the case of any war risk and
allied perils coverage) after receipt by Lessor of the notice of
cancellation, change or lapse referred to in Section 11(a)(C) or
11(b)(C), or ii) such insurance not being in effect as to any of
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant; or

(c) Lessee shall operate the Aircraft at a time when public
liability insurance required by Section 11(a) shall not be in effect;
or

(d) Lessee shall fail to perform or observe any other
covenant, condition or agreement to be performed or observed by it
hereunder or under the Participation Agreement, any Lease Supplement,
the Bills of Sale or the Purchase Agreement Assignment, and such
failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days after
written notice thereof by

69
AF-1
<PAGE> 74
Lessor; provided that, if such failure is capable of being remedied,
so long as Lessee is diligently proceeding to remedy such failure, no
such failure shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder for a
period of up to 365 days; or

(e) any material representation or warranty made by Lessee in
this Lease or in the Participation Agreement, any Lease Supplement,
the Bills of Sale or the Purchase Agreement Assignment shall prove to
have been incorrect in any material respect at the time made, and such
incorrectness shall continue to be material and unremedied for a
period of 30 days after written notice thereof by Lessor; or

(f) Lessee shall consent to the appointment of a receiver,
trustee or liquidator of itself or of a substantial part of its
property, or Lessee shall admit in writing its inability to pay its
debts generally as they come due, or shall make a general assignment
for the benefit of creditors; or

(g) Lessee shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or a
voluntary petition or an answer seeking reorganization in a proceeding
under any bankruptcy laws (as now or hereafter in effect) or an answer
admitting the material allegations of a petition filed against Lessee
in any such proceeding, or Lessee shall by voluntary petition, answer
or consent seek relief under the provisions of any other now existing
or future bankruptcy or other similar law providing for the
reorganization or winding-up of corporations, or providing for an
agreement, composition, extension or adjustment with its creditors; or

(h) an order, judgment or decree shall be entered by any
court of competent jurisdiction appointing, without the consent of
Lessee, a receiver, trustee or liquidator of Lessee or of any
substantial part of its property, or sequestering any substantial part
of the property of Lessee, and any such order, judgment, or decree of
appointment or sequestration shall remain in force undismissed,
unstayed or unvacated for a period of 90 days after the date of entry
thereof; or

(i) a petition against Lessee in a proceeding under the
Federal bankruptcy laws or other insolvency

70
AF-1
<PAGE> 75
laws, as now or hereafter in effect, shall be filed and shall not be
withdrawn or dismissed within 90 days thereafter, or, under the
provisions of any law providing for reorganization or winding-up of
corporations which may apply to Lessee, any court of competent
jurisdiction shall assume jurisdiction, custody or control of Lessee
or of any substantial part of its property and such jurisdiction,
custody or control shall remain in force unrelinquished, unstayed or
unterminated for a period of 90 days;

provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Lease, any failure of Lessee to perform or observe any covenant, condition, or
agreement herein shall not constitute an Event of Default if such failure is
caused solely by reason of an event referred to in the definition of "Event of
Loss" so long as Lessee is continuing to comply with the applicable terms of
Section 10.

Section 15. Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default and at any time thereafter so long as the same shall be continuing,
Lessor may, at its option, declare this Lease to be in default by a written
notice to Lessee (provided that this Lease shall be deemed to have been
declared in default without the necessity of such written notice upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default described in paragraph (g), (h) or (i) of
Section 14 hereof); and at any time thereafter, so long as Lessee shall not
have remedied all outstanding Events of Default, Lessor may do one or more of
the following with respect to all or any part of the Airframe and any Engines
as Lessor in its sole discretion shall elect, to the extent permitted by, and
subject to compliance with any mandatory requirements of, applicable law then
in effect; provided that during any period when the Aircraft is subject to the
Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program in accordance with the provisions of Section
7(b) and in the possession of the United States government or an
instrumentality or agency thereof, Lessor shall not, on account of any Event of
Default, be entitled to do any of the following in such manner as to limit
Lessee's control under this Lease (or any sublessee's control under any
sublease permitted by the terms of this Lease) of any Airframe or any Engines,
unless at least 60 days' (or such lesser period as may then be applicable under
the Military Airlift Command Program of the United States Government) prior
written notice of default hereunder shall have been given by Lessor by
registered or certified mail to Lessee (or any sublessee)

71
AF-1
<PAGE> 76
with a copy addressed to the Contracting Office Representative for the Military
Airlift Command of the United States Air Force under any contract with Lessee
(or any sublessee) relating to the Aircraft:

(a) cause Lessee, upon the written demand of Lessor and at
Lessee's expense, to return promptly, and Lessee shall return
promptly, all or such part of the Airframe or any Engine as Lessor may
so demand to Lessor or its order in the manner and condition required
by, and otherwise in accordance with all the provisions of, Section 5,
as if the Airframe or such Engine were being returned at the end of
the Term, or Lessor, at its option, may enter upon the premises where
all or any part of the Airframe or any Engine are located and take
immediate possession of and remove the same (together with any engine
which is not an Engine but which is installed on the Airframe, subject
to all of the rights of the owner, lessor, lienor or secured party of
such engine;provided that the Airframe with an engine (which is not an
Engine) installed thereon may be flown or returned only to a location
within the continental United States, and such engine shall be held
for the account of any such owner, lessor, lienor or secured party or,
if owned by Lessee, may, at the option of Lessor, be exchanged with
Lessee for an Engine in accordance with the provisions of Section
5(b)) by summary proceedings or otherwise, all without liability
accruing to Lessor for or by reason of such entry or taking of
possession or removal, whether for the restoration of damage to
property caused by such taking or otherwise;

(b) sell all or any part of the Airframe and any Engine at
public or private sale, whether or not Lessor shall at the time have
possession thereof, as Lessor may determine, or otherwise dispose of,
hold, use, operate, lease to others or keep idle all or any part of
the Airframe or such Engine as Lessor, in its sole discretion, may
determine, all free and clear of any rights of Lessee except as
hereinafter set forth in this Section 15 and without any duty to
account to Lessee with respect to such action or inaction or for any
proceeds with respect thereto, except to the extent required by
paragraph (d) below if Lessor elects to exercise its rights under such
paragraph (d) in lieu of its rights under paragraph (c) below;

72
AF-1
<PAGE> 77
(c) whether or not Lessor shall have exercised, or shall
thereafter at any time exercise, any of its rights under paragraph (a)
or paragraph (b) above with respect to all or any part of the Airframe
or any Engine, Lessor, by written notice to Lessee specifying a
payment date (which date shall be deemed to be a "Termination Date"
for purposes of computing Termination Value) which shall be not
earlier than 30 days from the date of such notice, may demand that
Lessee pay to Lessor, and Lessee shall pay Lessor, on the payment date
specified in such notice, as liquidated damages for loss of a bargain
and not as a penalty (in lieu of the Basic Rent due for Lease Periods
commencing on or after the Lease Period Date next preceding the
payment date specified in such notice), if the Termination Date is a
Lease Period Date, the Basic Rent installment due and payable on that
date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it being understood and agreed that
Lessee shall not be required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic
Rent installment designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as
being payable in advance) or, if the Termination Date is not a Lease
Period Date and if Basic Rent is payable in arrears during the Lease
Period commencing on the Lease Period Date next preceding the
Termination Date, an amount equal to the Accrued Arrears Basic Rent
for the period from and including such Lease Period Date to but
excluding the Termination Date, less any credit to which Lessee shall
be entitled as hereinafter in this Section 15(c) provided, plus
whichever of the following amounts Lessor, in its sole discretion,
shall specify in such notice: i) an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of the Termination Value for the Airframe or such Engine or part
thereof, computed as of the payment date specified in such notice,
over the aggregate fair market rental value (computed as hereafter
provided in this Section 15) of the Airframe or such Engine or part
thereof for the remainder of the Term, after discounting such
aggregate fair market rental value semi- annually (effective on the
Lease Period Dates) to present worth as of the payment date specified
in such notice at the Assumed Debt Rate; or ii) an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of the Termination Value for the Airframe or such
Engine or part thereof computed as of the payment date specified in
such notice, over the fair market sales value (computed 

73
AF-1
<PAGE> 78
as hereafter provided in this Section 15) of the Airframe or such 
Engine or part thereof as of the payment date specified in such
notice;provided that if the Termination Date is not a Lease Period
Date and if any portion of the Basic Rent installment paid in respect
of the Lease Period commencing on the Lease Period Date next preceding
the Termination Date is designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule
as having been payable in advance, Lessee shall, if and so long as it
shall have paid in full all Rent otherwise payable by it hereunder or
pursuant hereto, be entitled to a credit against the amounts payable
by it pursuant to this Section 15(c) in an amount equal to the lesser
of the Unearned Advance Basic Rent as of the Termination Date and the
amount, if any, by which such aggregate fair market rental value or
such fair market sales value, as the case may be, exceeds such
Termination Value; and provided, further, that in the event that the
amount calculated pursuant to this sentence to be credited exceeds the
amount payable by Lessee pursuant to this Section 15(c) and any other
amounts payable by Lessee hereunder as a result of the applicable
Event of Default or the exercise of Lessor's remedies with respect
thereto, the Owner Participant will be obligated to rebate an amount
equal to such excess to Lessee;

(d) in the event Lessor, pursuant to paragraph (b) above,
shall have sold all or any part of the Airframe or any Engine, Lessor,
in lieu of exercising its rights under paragraph (c) above with
respect to the Airframe or such Engine or part thereof, may, if it
shall so elect, demand that Lessee pay Lessor, and Lessee shall pay to
Lessor, on the date of such sale (which date shall be deemed a
"Termination Date" for purposes of computing Termination Value), as
liquidated damages for loss of a bargain and not as a penalty (in lieu
of the Basic Rent due for Lease Periods commencing on or after the
Lease Period Date next preceding the date of such sale), if the
Termination Date is a Lease Period Date, the Basic Rent installment
due and payable on that date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it being
understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be required to pay the
portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment designated in Exhibit
A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in advance) or, if the
Termination Date is not a Lease Period Date and if Basic Rent is
payable

74

<PAGE> 79
in arrears during the Lease Period commencing on the Lease Period Date
next preceding the Termination Date, an amount equal to the Accrued
Arrears Basic Rent for the period from and including such Lease Period
Date to but excluding the Termination Date, less any credit to which
Lessee shall be entitled as hereinafter in this Section 15(d)
provided, plus the amount of any deficiency between the net proceeds
of such sale and the Termination Value for the Airframe or such Engine
or part thereof, computed as of the date of such sale;provided that if
the Termination Date is not a Lease Period Date and if any portion of
the Basic Rent installment paid in respect of the Lease Period
commencing on the Lease Period Date next preceding the Termination
Date is designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as having been
payable in advance, Lessee shall, if and so long as it shall have paid
in full all Rent otherwise payable by it hereunder or pursuant hereto,
be entitled to a credit against the amounts payable by it pursuant to
this Section 15(d) in an amount equal to the lesser of the Unearned
Advance Basic Rent as of the Termination Date and the amount, if any,
by which such net proceeds of such sale exceed such Termination Value;
and provided, further, that in the event that the amount calculated
pursuant to this sentence to be credited exceeds the amount payable by
Lessee pursuant to this Section 15(d) and any other amounts payable by
Lessee hereunder as a result of the applicable Event of Default or the
exercise of Lessor's remedies with respect thereto, the Owner
Participant will be obligated to rebate an amount equal to such excess
to Lessee; and

(e) Lessor may rescind this Lease as to the Airframe and any
or all Engines, or may exercise any other right or remedy which may be
available to it under applicable law or proceed by appropriate court
action to enforce the terms or to recover damages for the breach
hereof.

In addition, Lessee shall be liable, except as otherwise
provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) above and without limiting the effect of the
penultimate sentence of Section 3(c), without duplication of any amounts
payable hereunder, for any and all unpaid Rent due hereunder before, after or
during the exercise of any of the foregoing remedies and for all legal fees and
other costs and expenses

75
AF-1
<PAGE> 80
incurred by reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default or the exercise 
of Lessor's remedies with respect thereto, including all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the retaking or return of the Airframe or any
Engine in accordance with the terms of Section 5 or in placing such Airframe or
Engine in the condition and airworthiness required by such Section; provided
that, if Lessee returns or surrenders possession of all or any part of the
Airframe or any Engine in accordance with this Section 15 and Lessor does not
within 365 days after the date of such return or surrender exercise its rights
under paragraph (c) or (d) above with respect to such Airframe or Engine or
part thereof, there shall be deducted from each payment of Basic Rent becoming
due after the expiration of such 365-day period an amount equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing the aggregate fair market rental value (computed as
hereafter provided in this Section 15) of such Airframe or Engine or part
thereof, for the remainder of the Term after the expiration of such 365-day
period (computed as of the date of such expiration), by the number of Basic
Rent installments remaining with respect to the Aircraft after the expiration
of such 365-day period to the end of the Term; and provided, further, that
Lessor and Lessee agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Lease, the Trust Indenture, the Participation Agreement, the Tax
Indemnity Agreement or any other document or instrument relating hereto or
thereto, Lessee shall have no responsibility or liability for any amounts
payable to any Loan Participant in respect of the Break Amount, if any, payable
with respect to the Certificates as a result of (x) a purchase of the
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture as a result of an
Indenture Default that does not also constitute an Event of Default or (y) an
Indenture Default that does not also constitute an Event of Default. For
purposes of paragraph (c) above and the preceding sentence, the "aggregate fair
market rental value" or the "fair market sales value" of the Airframe or any
Engine or any part thereof shall be as specified in an Independent Appraisal.
At any sale of the Airframe or any Engine or part thereof pursuant to this
Section 15, Lessor or the Owner Participant may bid for and purchase such
property. Except as otherwise expressly provided above, no remedy referred to
in this Section 15 is intended to be exclusive, but each shall be cumulative
and in addition to any other remedy referred to above or otherwise available to
Lessor at law or in equity; and the exercise or beginning of exercise by Lessor
of any one or more of such remedies

76
AF-1
<PAGE> 81
shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by Lessor of any or
all of such other remedies. No express or implied waiver by Lessor of any
Event of Default shall in any way be, or be construed to be, a waiver of any
future or subsequent Event of Default.

Section 16. Single Transaction. Lessor and Lessee agree that
the transactions contemplated by this Lease, the Participation Agreement, the
Tax Indemnity Agreement, the other Operative Documents and the Rent Schedule
are intended to and shall be construed to constitute one transaction.

Section 17. Further Assurances; Financial Information.
Forthwith upon the execution and delivery of each Lease Supplement and Trust
Agreement and Indenture Supplement, Lessee will cause such Lease Supplement and
Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement (and, in the case of the initial Lease
Supplement and Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement with respect to the
Aircraft, this Lease, the Trust Indenture and the Trust Agreement) to be duly
filed and recorded in accordance with the Federal Aviation Act. In addition,
each of Lessor and Lessee will promptly and duly execute and deliver to the
other party hereto such further documents and assurances and take such further
action as such other party may from time to time reasonably request in order
effectively to carry out the intent and purpose of this Lease, including,
without limitation, if requested by Lessor, the execution and delivery of
supplements or amendments hereto or, in the case of Lessor, to the Trust
Indenture, in recordable form, subjecting to this Lease and, in the case of
Lessor, the Trust Indenture any Replacement Airframe or Replacement Engine and
the recording or filing of counterparts hereof or thereof, in accordance with
the laws of such jurisdictions as Lessor may from time to time deem advisable;
provided that this sentence is not intended to impose upon Lessee any
additional liabilities not otherwise contemplated by this Lease and the
Participation Agreement. Lessee also agrees to furnish Lessor, the Owner
Participant and the Indenture Trustee (i) within 60 days after the end of each
of the first three quarterly fiscal periods in each fiscal year of Lessee, a
consolidated balance sheet of Lessee and its consolidated subsidiaries prepared
by it as of the close of such period, together with the related consolidated
statements of income and cash flows for such period, (ii) within 120 days after
the close of each fiscal year of Lessee, a consolidated

Section 19. No Setoff, Counterclaim, Etc. This Lease is a
net lease and Lessee's obligation to pay all Rent payable hereunder shall,
subject to Section 3(f) and the final sentence of Section 3(c), be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including,
without limitation, (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
right which Lessee may have against Lessor, any Participant, the Indenture
Trustee or anyone else for any reason whatsoever, (ii) any defect in the title,
airworthiness, condition, design, operation or fitness for use of, or any

3(f), to pay to Lessor an amount equal to each Basic Rent and Supplemental Rent
payment under Section 3 at the time such payment would have become due and
payable in accordance with the terms hereof had this Lease not been terminated
in whole or in part. Lessee hereby waives, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, any and all rights which it may now have or which at any time
hereafter may be conferred upon it, by statute or otherwise, to terminate,
cancel, quit or surrender this Lease except in accordance with the express
terms hereof. Each payment of Rent made by Lessee shall be final as to Lessor

AF-1
<PAGE> 84
from Lessor or from the Indenture Trustee for any reason whatsoever; provided
that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to modify or limit in any way
Lessee's rights under Section 3(f) and the penultimate sentence of Section 3(c)
or its rights to rebate under Section 9(b), 9(d), 15(c) or 15(d).

Section 20. Renewal Options; Purchase Options. (a) Renewal
Options. Lessee shall have the right to extend this Lease with respect to the
Aircraft for up to five additional periods of one year each (each such period
being hereinafter referred to as a "Renewal Term"), each commencing at the end
of the Term or a Renewal Term. Such option to renew shall be exercised upon
irrevocable written notice from Lessee to Lessor given not less than 120 days
prior to the commencement of the first day of each Renewal Term and if no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such date, then this Lease
shall be extended for the additional period of such Renewal Term on the same
conditions provided for herein, and upon such extension, the word "Term"
whenever used herein shall be deemed to refer, unless the context otherwise
requires, to such Renewal Term; provided that the rental payable during such
Renewal Term shall be at a rental rate equal to (i) in the case of the first
Renewal Term the lesser of (x) the Renewal Term Rate and (y) the fair market
rental value for the Aircraft determined within 90 days after such election by
mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they shall be unable to agree, by
an Independent Appraisal, and (ii) in the case of any Renewal Term thereafter,
the fair market rental value of the Aircraft determined within 90 days after
such election by mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they shall be
unable to agree, by an Independent Appraisal; and provided, further, that the
provisions of Section 9 shall not be applicable during any Renewal Term. The
amounts which are payable during any such Renewal Term in respect of
Termination Value as used in Section 15 and Stipulated Loss Value with respect
to the Aircraft shall be determined on the basis of the fair market sales value
of the Aircraft as of the commencement of such Renewal Term, amortized on a
straight-line basis over such Renewal Term to the fair market sales value of
the Aircraft as of the expiration of such Renewal Term, as such fair market
sales value in each case is determined prior to the commencement of such
Renewal Term by mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they shall be
unable to agree, as determined by an Independent Appraisal.

(b) Special Purchase Option. On January 2, 2013, or, if such
date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (the "Special
Purchase Option Date"), Lessee shall have the right, at its option, to purchase
the Aircraft. Such option to purchase the Aircraft shall be exercised
irrevocably upon written notice from Lessee to Lessor given not less than 120
days prior to the Special Purchase Option Date. In the event that Lessee shall
have so elected to purchase the Aircraft, on the Special Purchase Option Date,
(x) Lessee shall pay the Basic Rent installment due on the Special Purchase
Option Date (it being understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be required
to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment designated in
Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in advance), and at its
option shall either (A) pay to Lessor, in funds of the type specified in
Section 3(d), (1) an amount determined by multiplying Lessor's Cost for the
Aircraft by the Special Purchase Price Percentage (the "Special Purchase
Price"), plus (2) all Supplemental Rent (including, without limitation, the
Break Amount, if any, on the Certificates) due and owing on such Special
Purchase Option Date, plus (3) all Basic Rent due prior to and unpaid on such
Special Purchase Option Date, or (B) assume all of the rights and obligations
of the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture in respect of the Certificates
(including, without limitation, any scheduled payment of principal of or
accrued interest on the Certificates due and payable on the Special Termination
Date but only to the extent that any Basic Rent installment payable by Lessee
pursuant to clause (x) above does not cover such scheduled payment of principal
or accrued interest on the Certificates and excluding any obligations or
liabilities of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity incurred on or
prior to the Special Purchase Option Date, which obligations and liabilities
shall remain the sole responsibility of the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity) in accordance with Section 2.16 of the Trust Indenture and
simultaneously shall pay to Lessor, in funds of the type specified in Section
3(d), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Special Purchase Price over
an amount equal to the sum of the principal of, and any accrued and unpaid
interest on, the outstanding Certificates on such Special Purchase Option Date,
after taking into account any payments of principal or interest made in respect
of the outstanding Certificates on such Special Purchase Option Date, and (y)
Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without

81
AF-1
<PAGE> 86
recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all of Lessor's right,
title and interest in and to the Aircraft and, if Lessee shall not have assumed
the rights and obligations of the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture in
respect of the Certificates as provided for above, Lessor will request the
Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument
releasing the Airframe and Engines with respect to which title is transferred
from the Lien of the Trust Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and
the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge thereunder.

(c) Purchase Option. Lessee shall have the right, at its
option, at the expiration of the Term or any Renewal Term, to elect to purchase
the Aircraft at a price equal to the fair market sales value of the Aircraft,
as determined as provided below. Such option to purchase shall be exercised
irrevocably upon written notice from Lessee to Lessor given not less than 120
days prior to the last day of the Term or any Renewal Term, as the case may be.
If Lessee shall have so elected to purchase the Aircraft, Lessor shall transfer
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens) the Aircraft to
Lessee, against payment by Lessee of the applicable purchase price and any
other amounts due hereunder in immediately available funds. In order to enable
Lessee to determine whether it wishes to exercise such election to purchase,
the fair market sales value for the Aircraft shall, at Lessee's request made in
sufficient time to permit such determination, be determined not less than 150
days prior to the end of the Term or any Renewal Term by mutual agreement of
Lessor and Lessee or, if they shall be unable to agree, by an Independent
Appraisal.

Section 21. Successor Owner Trustee. Lessee agrees that, in
the case of the appointment of any successor Owner Trustee pursuant to the
terms of the Trust Agreement and Section 9(d) of the Participation Agreement,
such successor Owner Trustee shall succeed to all the rights, powers and title
of Lessor hereunder and shall be deemed to be Lessor of the Aircraft for all
purposes without in any way altering the terms of this Lease or Lessee's
obligations hereunder. Lessee further agrees that in the case of the
appointment of any additional trustee to act as co-trustee or as a separate
trustee pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement and Section 9(d) of the
Participation Agreement, such additional trustee shall acquire such rights,
power and title of Lessor hereunder

82
AF-1
<PAGE> 87
as are specified in the instruments appointing such additional trustee, without
in any way altering the terms of this Lease or Lessee's obligations hereunder.
One such appointment and designation of a successor or additional Owner Trustee
shall not exhaust the right to appoint and designate further successor or
additional Owner Trustees pursuant to the Trust Agreement and Section 9(d) of
the Participation Agreement, but such right may be exercised repeatedly as long
as this Lease shall be in effect.

Section 22. Security for Lessor's Obligation to Loan
Participants. In order to secure the indebtedness evidenced by the
Certificates, Lessor has agreed in the Trust Indenture, among other things, to
assign to the Indenture Trustee this Lease and the Lease Supplements and to
mortgage in favor of the Indenture Trustee all of Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to the Aircraft, subject to the reservations and conditions
therein set forth. Lessee hereby consents to such assignment and to the
creation of such mortgage and security interest and acknowledges receipt of
copies of the Trust Indenture and the Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement,
it being understood that such consent shall not affect any requirement or the
absence of any requirement for any consent under any other circumstances. To
the extent, if any, that this Lease Agreement constitutes chattel paper (as
such term is defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any
applicable jurisdiction), no security interest in this Lease may be created
through the transfer or possession of any counterpart hereof other than the
original counterpart, which shall be identified as the counterpart containing
the receipt therefor executed by the Indenture Trustee on the signature page
thereof.

Section 23. Lessor's Right to Perform for Lessee. If Lessee
fails to make any payment of Rent required to be made by it hereunder or fails
to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, Lessor may,
on behalf of Lessee and upon prior notice to Lessee, itself make such payment
or undertake such performance or compliance. The amount of any such payment
and the amount of the reasonable expenses of Lessor incurred in connection with
such payment, performance or compliance together with interest thereon, at the
Overdue Rate, shall be deemed Supplemental Rent, payable by Lessee upon demand.

83
AF-1
<PAGE> 88
Section 24. Maintenance of Certain Engines. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, an aircraft engine which is not an
Engine, but which is installed on the Airframe, shall be maintained in
accordance with Section 7(a).

Section 25. Investment of Security Funds; Miscellaneous. Any
moneys required to be paid to or retained by Lessor which are not required to
be paid to Lessee pursuant to Section 10(f) or 11(b) solely because an Event of
Default hereunder (or event that with lapse of time would constitute an Event
of Default under Section 14(a), 14(g), 14(h) or 14(i)) shall have occurred, or
which are required to be paid to Lessee pursuant to Section 10(c) or 11(b)
after completion of a replacement to be made pursuant to Section 10(a) shall,
until paid to Lessee as provided in Section 10 or 11 or applied as provided
herein or in the Trust Agreement and Trust Indenture, be invested in Permitted
Investments by Lessor (unless the Trust Indenture shall not have been
discharged, in which case, by the Indenture Trustee as provided in Section 3.07
of the Trust Indenture) from time to time as directed in writing by Lessee.
There shall, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred or be
continuing, be promptly remitted to Lessee as a rebate of Rent any gain
(including interest received) realized as the result of any such investment
(net of any fees, commissions and other expenses, if any, incurred in
connection with such investment) and Lessee will promptly pay to Lessor or the
Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, on demand, as Supplemental Rent the
amount of any loss realized as the result of any such investment (together with
any fees, commissions and other expenses, if any, incurred in connection with
such investment), such amount to be disposed of in accordance with the terms of
the Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture.

Section 26. Concerning the Lessor. Wilmington Trust Company
is entering into this Lease Agreement solely in its capacity as Owner Trustee
under the Trust Agreement and not in its individual capacity (except as
expressly stated herein) and in no case shall Wilmington Trust Company (or any
entity acting as successor Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement) be
personally liable for or on account of any of the statements, representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations stated to be those of Lessor hereunder;
provided, however, that Wilmington Trust Company (or any such successor Owner
Trustee) shall be

84
AF-1
<PAGE> 89
personally liable hereunder for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct
or for its breach of its covenants, representations and warranties contained
herein, to the extent covenanted or made in its individual capacity.

Section 27. Sublessee's Performance and Rights. Any
obligation imposed on Lessee in this Lease shall require only that Lessee
perform or cause to be performed such obligation, even if stated herein as a
direct obligation, and the performance of any such obligation by any permitted
assignee, sublessee or transferee under an assignment, sublease or transfer
agreement then in effect shall constitute performance by Lessee and to the
extent of such performance discharge such obligation by Lessee. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, any right granted to Lessee in this Lease
shall grant Lessee the right to exercise such right or permit such right to be
exercised by any such assignee, sublessee or transferee; provided that no such
assignee, sublessee or transferee shall be permitted to exercise the
self-insurance rights of Lessee set forth in Section 11. The inclusion of
specific references to obligations or rights of any such assignee, sublessee or
transferee in certain provisions of this Lease shall not in any way prevent or
diminish the application of the provisions of the two sentences immediately
preceding with respect to obligations or rights in respect of which specific
reference to any such assignee, sublessee or transferee has not been made in
this Lease.

Section 28. Miscellaneous. Any provision of this Lease which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. This Lease
may be executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed and delivered, subject to Section 22, shall be an original,
but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same
instrument. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lessee hereby waives
any provision of law which renders any provision prohibited or unenforceable in
any respect. Neither this Lease nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated,
amended, supplemented, waived or modified orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which the enforcement of the termination,

85
AF-1
<PAGE> 90
amendment, supplement, waiver or modification is sought. This Lease shall
constitute an agreement of lease, and nothing herein shall be construed as
conveying to Lessee any right, title or interest in the Aircraft except as a
lessee only. To the extent consistent with the provisions of Title 11 U.S.C.
Section 1110, or any analogous section of the Federal bankruptcy laws, as
amended from time to time, it is hereby expressly agreed that, notwithstanding
any other provisions of the Federal bankruptcy laws, as amended from time to
time, the title of Lessor to the Aircraft and any right of Lessor to take
possession of the Aircraft in compliance with the provisions of this Lease
shall not be affected by the provisions of the Federal bankruptcy laws, as
amended from time to time. The section and paragraph headings in this Lease
and the table of contents are for convenience of reference only and shall not
modify, define, expand or limit any of the terms or provisions hereof and all
references herein to numbered sections, unless otherwise indicated, are to
sections of this Lease.

THIS LEASE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED IN THE STATE OF NEW
YORK AND SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION,
VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE.

86

shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee shall

Lease at any time on or after the fifth anniversary of
the Delivery Date, if in Lessee's good faith
determination (evidenced by a certificate of a
Responsible Officer of Lessee to such effect) the
Aircraft is surplus to Lessee's requirements or
economically obsolete to Lessee, and (ii) at any time
on or after the eighth anniversary of the Delivery
Date to terminate this Lease for any reason
whatsoever, in each case by delivering to Lessor a
written notice of termination specifying a proposed
date of termination (the "Termination Date") which
shall be a Business Day occurring not earlier than 90
days after the date of such notice, and, if the
Termination Date is a Special Termination Date,
whether or not Lessee is thereby electing to purchase
the Aircraft on such Special Termination Date as
provided in Section 9(e). The termination of this
Lease shall, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Section 9, be effective on (i) if Lessee
has not elected to purchase the Aircraft as provided
in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected to sell the
Aircraft, as provided below, the date of sale of the
Aircraft, if any, referred to in Section 9(b), (ii) if

provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected to

date of termination referred to in Section 9(d), or
(iii) if Lessee has elected to purchase the Aircraft
as provided in Section 9(e), the date of purchase
referred to in Section 9(e). Where Lessee has not
elected to purchase the Aircraft as provided for in
Section 9(e), Lessor shall give Lessee irrevocable
notice of its election to sell or retain the Aircraft
no later than 45 days after Lessor receives the notice
from Lessee referred to in the first sentence of this
Section 9(a). In the event Lessor shall fail to give
notice pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
notice of its election to sell the Aircraft shall be
deemed to have been given as of such forty-fifth day.
Unless Lessor shall have given to Lessee a timely
notice of its election to retain the Aircraft as
provided in Section 9(d), Lessee (1) shall withdraw
such termination notice on the Termination Contract
Date if the Person who shall have submitted the
highest cash bid notified by Lessee to

10

<PAGE> 14
Lessor or by Lessor or the Owner Participant to Lessee
pursuant to Section 9(b) prior to the Termination
Contract Date (or, with the consent of Lessor, another
person who shall have submitted a bid for the purchase
of the Aircraft, acceptable to Lessor and Lessee)
shall not have entered into a binding contract of sale
on or prior to such Termination Contract Date
reasonably acceptable to the Owner Participant
providing for the sale by Lessor without recourse or
warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens) for cash of the
Airframe and the Engines installed thereon to such
Person (the "Contract Purchaser") (Lessor hereby
agreeing, subject to Lessor's right to retain the
Aircraft, promptly to execute and deliver any such
contract of sale in the form thereof furnished by
Lessee for execution and delivery and Lessee hereby
agreeing to consult with the Owner Participant
regarding the terms of such contract of sale and to
submit the execution form thereof to the Owner
Participant a reasonable period of time prior to the
Termination Contract Date) and (2) may withdraw the
termination notice referred to above at any time on or
prior to the third Business Day prior to the
Termination Contract Date, whereupon this Lease shall
continue in full force and effect. In the event
Lessee withdraws, on or after the third Business Day
prior to the Termination Contract Date, a notice of
termination given pursuant to this Section 9(a) or
such notice is deemed withdrawn pursuant to the final
sentence of Section 9(b), Lessee will reimburse Lessor
and the Owner Participant for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection
with the proposed sale, except Lessee shall not be
obligated to reimburse Lessor or the Owner Participant
for any out-of-pocket expenses to the extent Lessor
shall have failed to comply with its obligations under
this Section 9. Lessee shall not be entitled to
exercise its right of termination provided for in this
Section 9(a) more than four times during the Term (not
including for purposes of this sentence any exercise
by Lessee of such right of termination immediately
following a failure of this Lease to be terminated by
reason of Lessor's failure to comply with its
obligations under this Section 9).

(b) Sale of Aircraft. If Lessee has not
elected to purchase the Aircraft as provided in
Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected or is deemed to
have elected to sell the Aircraft pursuant to Section
9(a), Lessee will

Lessor to obtain bids for the cash purchase on or
prior to the Termination Date of the Aircraft. Lessor
agrees to pay Lessee a commercially reasonable
brokerage fee based on the then current industry
practice in the event that Lessee locates the Person
who purchases the Aircraft pursuant to this Section
9(b). If Lessee acts as such agent, no later than ten
Business Days prior to the Termination Contract Date,
Lessee shall certify to Lessor in writing the amount
and terms of each cash bid received by Lessee and the
name and the address of the Person submitting each
such bid. Lessor may (but need not), also, at its
expense (which expense, including without limitation
any broker's or finder's fees, shall be for the Owner
Participant's own account), independently obtain cash
bids for such purchase and, in the event Lessor
receives any such bid, Lessor shall promptly, and in
any event at least five Business Days prior to the
Termination Contract Date certify to Lessee in writing
the amount and terms of such bid and the name and
address of the Person submitting such bid. Neither
the Owner Participant, Lessee, nor any Affiliate of
either may submit a bid for the Aircraft, directly or
indirectly, in connection with such proposed sale. On
the Termination Date (or such earlier date of sale as
may be agreed to by Lessor and Lessee, which date
shall thereafter be deemed the Termination Date), (x)
Lessee shall, subject to receipt (i) by Lessor (or, so
long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been
discharged, the Indenture Trustee) of the full
purchase price thereof and all amounts owing to Lessor
pursuant to the next sentence and (ii) by the Persons
entitled thereto of all unpaid Supplemental Rent due
on or before the Termination Date, deliver the
Aircraft at a location selected by Lessee to the
Contract Purchaser (or such other purchaser acceptable
to Lessor and Lessee), in the same manner as if
delivery were made to Lessor at the end of the Term
pursuant to Section 5, and shall duly transfer to
Lessor title to any engines installed on the Airframe
but not owned by Lessor, all in accordance with the
terms of Section 5, and (y) Lessor shall
simultaneously therewith sell, without recourse or
warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), for cash all
of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the
Aircraft to such Contract Purchaser (or other
purchaser). The total selling price realized at such
sale shall be retained by Lessor (or, so long as the

12

<PAGE> 16

Trust Indenture shall not have been discharged,
distributed by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the
terms of the Trust Indenture) and, in addition, on the

the case of Supplemental Rent, to the Persons entitled
thereto, in funds of the type specified in Section
3(d), an amount equal to (I) the sum of (1) the

Aircraft as of the Termination Date, over (B) the
proceeds of the sale of the Aircraft after deducting
the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Lessor and the Owner Participant (including any
brokerage fee paid to Lessee or any other Person),
plus (2) that amount of interest that will accrue on
the principal of all Outstanding Certificates during
the period from and including the Termination Date to
but excluding the Redemption Date specified in Section

if any) other than Termination Value, due and owing on

Date is a Lease Period Date, the Basic Rent
installment due and payable on that date pursuant to
Section 3(b) (it being understood and agreed that

any, of such Basic Rent installment designated in
Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in
advance), or (B) if the Termination Date is not a
Lease Period Date and if Basic Rent is payable in
arrears during the Lease Period commencing on the
Lease Period Date next preceding the Termination Date,
an amount equal to the Accrued Arrears Basic Rent for
the period from and including such Lease Period Date

any portion of the Basic Rent installment paid in
respect of the Lease Period commencing on the Lease
Period Date next preceding the Termination Date is
designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as
having been payable in advance, Lessee shall be
entitled to a credit against the amounts payable by it

Rent as of the Termination Date, and
(y) the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of the
sale of the Aircraft after deducting the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lessor and the

provided that, in the event that the amount calculated
pursuant to this sentence to be credited exceeds the
amounts payable by Lessee pursuant to this Section
9(b), the Owner Participant shall be obligated to

Termination Price") equal to the greater of (i) the
Termination Value for the Aircraft, computed as of the

Termination Date and (ii) the then fair market sales
value of the Aircraft, as determined by mutual
agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they shall be
unable to agree, by an Independent Appraisal. On such
Special Termination Date, (x) Lessee (i) shall pay to
Lessor or to the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of
the type specified in Section 3(d), all unpaid
Supplemental Rent (including, without limitation,
Premium Amount, if any), other than Termination Value,
due and owing on such Special Termination Date, all
Basic Rent due and payable prior to the Special
Termination Date and unpaid and the Basic Rent
installment due and payable on the Special Termination
Date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it being understood and
agreed that Lessee shall not be required to pay the
portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment
designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as
being payable in advance) and (ii) at its option shall
either (A) pay to Lessor, in funds of the type
specified in Section 3(d), the Special Termination
Price, or (B) assume all of the rights and obligations
of the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture in
respect of the Certificates (including, without
limitation, any scheduled payment of principal of or
accrued interest on the Certificates due and payable
on the Special Termination Date but only to the extent
that the Basic Rent installment payable by Lessee
pursuant to clause (i) above does not cover such
scheduled payment of principal of or accrued interest
on the Certificates but excluding any obligations or
liabilities of the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity incurred on or prior to the Special
Termination Date, which obligations and liabilities
shall remain the sole responsibility of the Owner
Trustee) in accordance with Section 7.03 of the Trust
Indenture and simultaneously shall pay to Lessor, in
funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the Special
Termination Price over an amount equal to the sum of
the principal of and any accrued and unpaid interest
on the outstanding Certificates on such Special
Termination Date, after taking into account any
payments of principal or interest made in respect of
the outstanding Certificates on such Special
Termination Date, and (y) Lessor will sell to Lessee,
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's
Liens), all of Lessor's right, title and interest in

obligations of the Owner Trustee under the Trust
Indenture in respect of the Certificates as provided
for above, Lessor will request the Loan Trustee to
execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate
instrument releasing the Airframe and Engines with
respect to which title is transferred from the lien of
the Trust Indenture and releasing the Purchase
Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from
the assignment and pledge thereunder.

occurring subsequent to the applicable Termination
Value Determination Date, and (ii) the obligation of
Lessee to pay Supplemental Rent (subject to Section
3(f), other than payments of Supplemental Rent to be
made by Lessee (x) surviving pursuant to Section 7(d)
of the Participation Agreement or Section 12 of the
Tax Indemnity Agreement or (y) in respect of
liabilities and obligations of Lessee which have
accrued under any Operative Document but have not been
paid or which are in dispute as of the date of such
sale or retention) shall cease as of the Termination
Date and, in each case, the Term shall end effective
as of the Termination Date.

no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Lessee shall have the right at its option
at any time, on at least 60 days' prior written
notice, to terminate this Lease with respect to any
Engine. In such event, and prior to the date of such

Participation Agreement. Lessee hereby agrees that such acceptance of delivery
by such authorized representative or representatives on behalf of Lessor shall,
without further act, irrevocably constitute acceptance by Lessee of the
Aircraft for all purposes of this Lease.

Section 3. Term and Rent. (a) Term. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the Term for the lease of the Aircraft hereunder shall
commence on the Delivery Date and end on the Base Lease Expiration Date.

(b) Basic Rent. Lessee hereby agrees to pay Lessor Basic
Rent for the Aircraft throughout the Term in consecutive semi-annual
installments payable on each Lease Period Date commencing on the Lease Period
Date next following the Base Lease Commencement Date. Each such installment of
Basic Rent in respect of the Aircraft shall be in an amount determined by
multiplying Lessor's Cost by the Basic Rent percentage set forth in Exhibit A
to the Rent Schedule for the applicable Lease Period Date.

Although the Basic Rent percentages set forth in Exhibit A to
the Rent Schedule have been computed on the assumption that each Certificate
will bear interest at the Assumed Debt Rate for such Certificate throughout the
Term, Lessor and Lessee recognize that the actual rate of interest on each
Certificate may be a rate from time to time which may be greater or less than
the Assumed Debt Rate for such Certificate and that the related basis upon
which interest on the Certificates will be computed will be as provided in the
Trust Indenture. Accordingly, each installment of Basic Rent shall be
increased or decreased, as the case may be, by an amount (the "Rent
Differential Amount") equal to, as of any Lease Period Date on which Basic Rent
is payable, the difference between (i) the aggregate amount of interest ac-

17
<PAGE> 23
tually due and payable on such Lease Period Date on the Certificates for the
period from and including the Lease Period Date next preceding such Lease
Period Date to but excluding such Lease Period Date, determined as provided in
the Trust Indenture, and (ii) the aggregate amount of interest on the
Certificates that would have been due and payable on such Lease Period Date if
each Certificate had borne interest at the Assumed Debt Rate for such
Certificate for the period from and including the Lease Period Date next
preceding such Lease Period Date to but excluding such Lease Period Date. If,
as of any Lease Period Date on which Basic Rent is payable, the amount
determined in accordance with clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be greater than the amount determined in accordance with clause (ii) of
such sentence, the amount of Basic Rent payable on such Lease Period Date shall
be increased by the Rent Differential Amount. If, as of any Lease Period Date
on which Basic Rent is payable, the amount determined in accordance with such
clause (ii) shall be greater than the amount determined in accordance with such
clause (i), the amount of Basic Rent due on such Lease Period Date shall be
decreased by the Rent Differential Amount. The interest actually accruing with
respect to the Certificates shall be as specified by the notification to be
delivered by the Indenture Trustee to Lessor, Lessee and the Owner Participant
as provided in Section 1(c) of the Participation Agreement.

Anything contained herein or in the Participation Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, each installment of Basic Rent (both before and
after any adjustment pursuant to Section 3(e), or any deduction pursuant to
Section 3(f)), as well as the amount of any Prepaid Rent paid pursuant to
Section 3(f), together with any payment made by the Owner Participant under
Section 16(a) of the Participation Agreement, shall be, under any circumstances
and in any event, in an amount at least equal to, as of the due date of such
installment, or Base Lease Commencement Date, as the case may be, the amount of
principal of and interest on the Certificates required to be paid by Lessor
pursuant to the Trust Indenture on the due date of such installment of Basic
Rent or on the Base Lease Commencement Date, as the case may be. Further, and
anything contained herein or in the Participation Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, Termination Value and Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft
(both before and after any adjustment pursuant to Section 3(e), or any
deduction pursuant to Section 3(f)) will, under any circumstances and in any
event, be an amount which, together with any other amounts (excluding Excepted

18
<PAGE> 24
Payments) then required to be paid by Lessee hereunder in connection therewith,
will be at least equal to, as of the date of payment thereof, the aggregate
unpaid principal of the outstanding Certificates, together with all unpaid
interest thereon accrued to the date on which such amount is paid in accordance
with the terms hereof.

Basic Rent accrues or is earned with respect to each Lease
Period in accordance with Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule.

(c) Supplemental Rent. Lessee also agrees to pay to Lessor,
or to whomsoever shall be entitled thereto, any and all Supplemental Rent
promptly as the same shall become due and owing, and in the event of any
failure on the part of Lessee to pay any Supplemental Rent, Lessor shall have
all rights, powers and remedies provided for herein or by law or in equity or
otherwise as in the case of nonpayment of Basic Rent. In addition, Lessee will
pay as Supplemental Rent (i) on demand, an amount equal to interest at the
Overdue Rate on any part of any installment of Basic Rent not paid when due for
any period for which the same shall be overdue and on any payment of
Supplemental Rent not paid when due or demanded, as the case may be, for the
period until the same shall be paid, (ii) in the case of any prepayment of the
Certificates or purchase of the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.13 of the
Trust Indenture, on the date the same is payable by Lessor under the Trust
Indenture, an amount equal to the BREAK AMOUNT, if any, payable with respect to
the Certificates and (iii) any amounts payable by Lessor under Section 2.04 or
2.18 of the Trust Indenture; provided that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in any Operative Document or any document or instrument
relating thereto, Lessee shall have no responsibility or liability for any
amounts payable to any Loan Participant in respect of the BREAK AMOUNT, if any,
payable with respect to the Certificates, as a result of (i) a prepayment of
the Certificates or a purchase of the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.13 of
the Trust Indenture as a result of an Indenture Default that does not also
constitute an Event of Default or (ii) an Indenture Default that does not also
constitute an Event of Default. All Supplemental Rent to be paid pursuant to
this Section 3(c) shall be payable in the type of funds and in the manner set
forth in Section 3(d).

(d) Payment to Lessor. All Rent shall be paid by Lessee to
Lessor at its office at Rodney Square North,

19
<PAGE> 25
Wilmington, Delaware 19890, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration (AA 1991
AF-2), in funds consisting of lawful currency of the United States of America
which shall be immediately available at such office of Lessor not later than
1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of payment, provided that so long as
the Trust Indenture shall not have been discharged pursuant to the terms
thereof, Lessor hereby directs, and each of Lessor and Lessee agrees, that all
Rent (excluding Excepted Property) or other sums payable to Lessor hereunder or
pursuant hereto shall be paid directly to the Indenture Trustee at the times
and in funds of the type specified in this Section 3(d) at the offices of the
Indenture Trustee at 33 North Avenue, Suite 700, Atlanta, Georgia 30308,
Attention: Corporate Trust Department (AA 1991 AF-2), or at such other location
in the United States as the Indenture Trustee may otherwise direct. Whenever
the date scheduled for any payment of Rent to be made hereunder shall not be a
Business Day, then such payment need not be made on such scheduled date but may
be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as
if made on such scheduled date and (provided such payment is made on such next
succeeding Business Day) no interest shall accrue on the amount of such payment
from and after such scheduled date to the time of such payment on such next
succeeding Business Day.

(e) Adjustments to Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value and
Termination Value. In the event that (i) the Transaction Costs (as such term
is defined in Section 18(a) of the Participation Agreement) are less or more
than 1.0% of Lessor's Cost, or (ii) prior to the acceptance of the Aircraft on
the Delivery Date: (A) there shall have occurred a Change in Tax Law and (B)
after having been advised in writing by the Owner Participant of such Change in
Tax Law and the proposed adjustment to the payments of Basic Rent resulting
therefrom, Lessee shall have waived its right under Section 11 of the
Participation Agreement to decline to proceed with the transaction, or (iii) a
refunding or refinancing as contemplated by Section 17 or Section 20 of the
Participation Agreement occurs, or (iv) the Delivery Date is other than July
10, 1991, or (v) if the Certificates are not refunded or refinanced on or prior
to the Base Lease Commencement Date, the Excess Payment Amount (after
adjustment for any Excess Payment Differential Amount) is other than
$1,947,948.23, then, in each such case, all payments of Basic Rent, Excess
Payment Amount and Stipulated Loss Values and Termination Values with respect
to the Term will, subject always to the

20
<PAGE> 26
penultimate paragraph of Section 3(b), be adjusted (upwards or downwards, as
the case may be) in accordance with the provisions of Section 18 or Section 20,
as applicable, of the Participation Agreement to preserve the Owner
Participant's Net Economic Return, or the Owner Participant's Revised Net
Economic Return, as the case may be, and, to the greatest extent possible, to
minimize the net present value of the payments of Basic Rent. In addition, in
the event of a refunding or refinancing as contemplated by Section 17 or
Section 20 of the Participation Agreement, the Special Purchase Price
Percentage and the Special Purchase Option Date shall be recalculated in
accordance with the provisions of Section 18 or Section 20, as applicable, of
the Participation Agreement.

(f) Prepayments of Certain Rent Payments. To the extent, if
any, that there shall not have been received by the Indenture Trustee at the
office of Indenture Trustee referred to in Section 3(d) hereof, by 1:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on or before the Base Lease Commencement Date from Lessor,
an amount equal to the Excess Payment Amount payable for such date, Lessee
shall advance to Lessor on the Base Lease Commencement Date an amount equal to
the Excess Payment Amount not so paid (such amount being herein called "Prepaid
Rent") provided that Lessee will also pay to the Indenture Trustee, on demand,
as Supplemental Rent, to the extent permitted by applicable law, interest at
the Overdue Rate on any Excess Payment Amount not paid when due for any period
for which the same shall be overdue. Any Rent prepaid pursuant to this Section
3(f) shall be offset against installments of Basic Rent in the order in which
they become due, subject to the penultimate sentence of this paragraph. Lessor
agrees to reimburse Lessee in the manner and subject to the conditions provided
in the following sentence for (x) the Prepaid Rent so paid by Lessee determined
as of the date such payment was made, plus (y) the Supplemental Rent so paid by
Lessee pursuant to this Section 3(f) plus (z) accrued interest on the
unreimbursed portion thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Overdue Rate plus
three percent (3%) from the date such amount is paid by Lessee to but not
including the date of each such reimbursement (such amounts to be reimbursed
being herein called the "Reimbursement Amount"). So long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, Lessee may with written notice to the
Owner Participant and Indenture Trustee offset (without duplication) against
each succeeding payment (other than as limited by the proviso to this sentence)
due from Lessee to Lessor in respect of Basic

21
<PAGE> 27
Rent, Stipulated Loss Value, Termination Value or any other amount due
hereunder to Lessor, until Lessee has been fully reimbursed for the
Reimbursement Amount; provided, however, that in the case of any payment due
from Lessee which is distributable under the terms of the Indenture, Lessee's
right of offset shall be limited to amounts distributable to Lessor or the
Owner Participant thereunder. No such offset or aggregate combined effect of
separate offsets shall reduce the amount of any installments of Basic Rent to
an amount insufficient, together with all other amounts payable simultaneously
by Lessee, to pay in full the payments then required to be made on account of
the principal of and interest on the Certificates then outstanding.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 3(f) to the contrary, Lessee's
obligation to advance an amount equal to the Excess Payment Amount shall
terminate at such time as its obligation to pay Basic Rent terminates under
this Lease.

Section 4. Lessor's Representations, Warranties and
Covenants; Quiet Enjoyment. (a) Lessor's Representations, Warranties and
Covenants. NONE OF LESSOR (IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY OR AS OWNER TRUSTEE),
THE OWNER PARTICIPANT, ANY LOAN PARTICIPANT, OR THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE MAKES OR
SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, AND LESSEE HEREBY
WAIVES, RELEASES AND RENOUNCES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE TITLE, AIRWORTHINESS, VALUE, CONDITION,
WORKMANSHIP, DESIGN, OPERATION, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR USE FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE AIRCRAFT, AS TO THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE, AS TO THE ABSENCE OF ANY INFRINGEMENT OF
ANY PATENT, TRADEMARK OR COPYRIGHT, OR AS TO THE ABSENCE OF OBLIGATIONS BASED
ON STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT, WHETHER IN STRICT OR ABSOLUTE LIABILITY OR ARISING
FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF LESSOR, INDENTURE TRUSTEE, ANY LOAN PARTICIPANT, OR THE
OWNER PARTICIPANT, ACTUAL OR IMPUTED, except that Lessor in its individual
capacity represents and warrants that on the Delivery Date Lessor shall have
received whatever rights, title and interests in, to and under the Aircraft
were conveyed to it by Lessee and Lessor represents, warrants and covenants in
its individual capacity that the Aircraft shall be free of Lessor's Liens
attributable to it in its individual capacity. Lessor also represents and
warrants in its individual capacity that it is, in its individual capacity, a
"citizen of the United States" as defined in Section 101(16) of the Federal
Aviation Act.

22
<PAGE> 28
(b) Quiet Enjoyment. Lessor covenants that, so long as no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, it will not take any
action contrary to Lessee's rights under this Lease, or otherwise in any way
interfere with the quiet enjoyment of the use and possession of the Aircraft,
the Airframe or any Engine by Lessee or any sublessee, assignee or transferee
under any sublease, assignment or transfer then in effect and permitted by the
terms of this Lease.

Section 5. Return of Aircraft. (a) Return of Airframe and
Engines. Upon the termination of this Lease at the end of the Term, a Renewal
Term or pursuant to Section 9, unless Lessee shall have exercised its option to
purchase the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(e), 20(b) or 20(c), Lessee will
return the Aircraft by delivering the same, at its own expense, to any airport
chosen by Lessee in the United States which is on Lessee's route system or, if
Lessor has requested storage pursuant to Section 5(d), to the location
determined in accordance with Section 5(d), fully equipped with two Engines
(which may be Replacement Engines), or other Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4-B engines
(or engines of the same or another manufacturer of a comparable or an improved
model and suitable for installation and use on the Airframe) owned by Lessee
(and each such engine shall be of the same make, model and manufacture as the
other Engine or engine installed on the Airframe), duly installed thereon. At
the time of such return, (A) such Airframe and Engines or engines (i) shall be,
if the Aircraft is then registered under the laws of the United States, duly
certificated as an airworthy aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration
or, if the Aircraft is not then registered under the laws of the United States
as provided in the penultimate sentence of this Section 5(a), shall be duly
certificated as an airworthy aircraft by the central civil aviation authority
of the jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is then registered, and, in addition,
if the Aircraft is not registrable in the United States because one of the
conditions specified in the proviso to such sentence apply, shall be eligible
for certification as an airworthy aircraft by the Federal Aviation
Administration, (ii) shall be free and clear of all Liens (other than Lessor's
Liens and Permitted Liens of the type described in clause (i) or (iii) of
Section 6), (iii) shall be in as good operating condition as when delivered to
Lessee hereunder, ordinary wear and tear excepted, or, in the case of any such
engines owned by Lessee, shall have a value and utility at least equal to, and
shall be in as good operating condition as re-

23
<PAGE> 29
quired by the terms hereof with respect to, Engines constituting part of the
Aircraft but not then installed on the Airframe and (iv) in the event that
Lessee does not use a progressive overhaul program in which no out-of-service
phase with respect to the Airframe exceeds 240 hours or a condition-monitored
maintenance program with respect to such Engines or engines, and Lessee adopts
a time-related overhaul program with respect to the Airframe or a scheduled
shop visit or module change maintenance program with respect to such Engines or
engines, or both, such Airframe shall have at least 1,500 hours of operation
remaining to the next heavy maintenance visit and the aggregate number of hours
of operation on all such Engines or engines remaining until the next scheduled
shop visit or module change shall be at least 3,000 hours and (B) such Aircraft
shall, except as otherwise provided herein, be clean and in a configuration
suitable for commercial passenger service, and shall be in compliance with all
mandatory environmental, noise, air pollution and other standards prescribed by
the Federal government of the United States of America and applicable to the
Aircraft and shall have all of Lessee's and any other Person's exterior
markings removed or painted over with the areas thereof refinished to match
adjacent areas. In the event that Lessee has adopted a time-related overhaul
program with respect to the Airframe and does not meet the above conditions
with respect thereto, Lessee shall pay Lessor a dollar amount computed by
multiplying (i) 110% of Lessee's direct cost (during the preceding twelve
months) of such heavy maintenance visit by (ii) a fraction of which (x) the
numerator shall be the difference between 1,500 hours and the actual number of
hours of operation remaining on the Airframe to the next heavy maintenance
visit and (y) the denominator shall be the aggregate number of hours allowable
between heavy maintenance visits. In the event that Lessee has adopted a
scheduled shop visit or module change program with respect to such Engines or
engines and Lessee does not meet the above conditions with respect to such
Engines or engines, Lessee shall pay Lessor a dollar amount computed by
multiplying (i) the product of (x) 110% of Lessee's direct cost (during the
preceding twelve months) of such scheduled shop visit or module change and (y)
the number of Engines or engines returned by (ii) a fraction of which (A) the
numerator shall be the difference between 3,000 hours and the actual aggregate
number of hours of operation remaining to the next scheduled shop visit or
module change for the Engines or engines on the Aircraft and (B) the
denominator shall be the aggregate number of hours allowable between scheduled
shop visits or module changes for such Engines or

24
<PAGE> 30
engines. At the time of such return, Lessee will, unless requested by Lessor
at least 90 days prior to such time of return to retain the existing
registration of the Aircraft, cause the Aircraft, if it is not then so
registered, to be registered under the laws of the United States with the
Federal Aviation Administration in the name of Lessor or its designee; provided
that Lessee shall be relieved of its obligations under this sentence if (x)
such registration is prohibited by reason of the failure of Lessor, the Owner
Participant or Lessor's designee to be eligible on such date to own an aircraft
registered with the Federal Aviation Administration or (y) such registration is
otherwise prohibited by applicable law and such prohibition does not result
from an act or failure to act on the part of Lessee or any sublessee. In the
event the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue any directive which would
require improvements to the Aircraft in order for the airworthiness certificate
of the Aircraft to be maintained in good standing, and if such directive by its
terms is not applicable to the Aircraft prior to the return thereof pursuant to
this Section 5, Lessee shall nevertheless comply with such directive if, prior
to such return, (x) Lessee commences compliance with such directive with
respect to any other Boeing 757-200 aircraft affected by such directive and in
use by Lessee and (y) subsequent to any such commencement, the Aircraft is
subjected to a maintenance check of the type at which such modification is
made, in accordance with Lessee's general maintenance program.

(b) Return of Engines. In the event that any engine not
owned by Lessor shall be delivered with the Airframe as set forth in paragraph
(a) of this Section 5, Lessee, concurrently with such delivery, will, at its
own expense, furnish Lessor with a warranty (as to title) bill of sale in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor (which warranty shall except
Lessor's Liens and Permitted Liens of the type described in clause (i) of
Section 6), with respect to each such engine and with a written opinion of
Lessee's counsel (which may be Lessee's General Counsel) to the effect that
such bill of sale constitutes an effective instrument for the conveyance of
title to such engine to Lessor, and thereupon Lessor will transfer to Lessee,
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all Lessor's right,
title and interest in and to an Engine constituting part of the Aircraft but
not installed on the Airframe at the time of the return of the Airframe.

25
<PAGE> 31
(c) Fuel; Manuals. Upon the return of the Airframe pursuant
to this Section 5, (i) Lessee shall have no obligation with respect to the
amount of fuel or oil contained in the Airframe and all fuel or oil remaining
on board the Airframe shall be the property of Lessor without charge and (ii)
Lessee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Lessor all logs, manuals and
data, and inspection, modification and overhaul records required to be
maintained with respect thereto under applicable rules and regulations of the
Federal Aviation Administration and, if the Aircraft has been registered under
the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States, of the applicable
foreign governmental authority, and the warranty bill of sale relating to the
Aircraft received from the Manufacturer.

(d) Storage upon Return. Upon written request of Lessor
received at least 30 days prior to the end of the Term, Lessee will provide
Lessor with storage facilities free of charge except as provided below for the
Aircraft for a period not exceeding 30 days at such location in the United
States on Lessee's route system used by Lessee for the storage of surplus
aircraft or engines available for sale as shall be designated by Lessee;
provided that Lessor may request that the Aircraft be stored at any other
location in the United States on Lessee's route system used by Lessee for such
purpose, in which case Lessee may, in its sole discretion, provide such
facilities for such period. Any storage facilities provided by Lessee for the
Aircraft pursuant to this Section 5(d) shall, in all cases, be at the cost to
Lessor of insurance and Lessee's out-of-pocket costs in connection with
providing such facilities (it being understood that such out-of-pocket costs
shall not be deemed to include the cost of making the storage facilities
available) and at the risk of Lessor. In the event Lessor, after a storage
location is determined as provided in the first sentence of this Section 5(d),
shall request Lessee to deliver the Aircraft to a second location, Lessee will,
at Lessor's expense, fly the Aircraft within such 30-day period to a reasonable
location selected by Lessor in the United States, for storage at the risk and
expense of Lessor, upon receipt of evidence of insurance coverage (reasonably
satisfactory to Lessee) as set forth in Section 11(a), provided that (i) Lessee
shall not be required to store the Aircraft at any location used by Lessee for
storage of surplus aircraft available for sale except as provided in the first
sentence of this Section 5(d) and (ii) the delivery by Lessee of the Aircraft
to the first location determined as provided in such sentence shall constitute

26
<PAGE> 32
delivery of the Aircraft as required by Section 5(a). Lessor, at its expense,
may place such other insurance in such circumstances on the Aircraft as it may
deem appropriate. Lessee shall, at Lessor's request, maintain insurance (if
available) for the Aircraft during such period of storage and shall be
reimbursed by Lessor for the cost thereof.

(e) Delayed Return. (i) In the event that the use of the
Aircraft, Airframe or any Engine in the normal course of the business of air
transportation is prohibited on the last day of the Term or the date the
Aircraft is required to be redelivered pursuant to Section 9, Lessee shall,
upon prompt notice of the reasons therefor to Lessor, not be required to return
such Aircraft to Lessor but may retain custody and control of the Aircraft for
a period not in excess of 180 days beyond the last day of the Term or such date
in order to attempt in a diligent manner to remedy any condition prohibiting
such use or (ii) in connection with any sublease of the Aircraft by Lessee
permitted under the terms of this Lease, Lessee may at its option, upon written
notice to Lessor given not less than 30 days prior to the last day of the Term
or such date, extend this Lease for a period not in excess of 60 days beyond
the last day of the Term in order to enable Lessee to bring the Aircraft to the
condition required under this Section 5 on its return to Lessor; provided that
in either case, Lessee shall pay to Lessor at monthly intervals the daily
equivalent of 50% of the average annual Basic Rent payable during the Term
(excluding the Interim Period) pursuant to the terms hereof for each day of
such period.

(f) Overhaul. Immediately prior to the return of the
Airframe and Engines or engines at the end of the Term, Lessee, upon written
request of Lessor received at least 30 days prior to the end of the Term, and
subject to the availability of the appropriate facilities, will overhaul or
cause to be overhauled such Airframe and Engines or engines. Such overhaul
shall be done in the same manner and same care as used by Lessee with similar
airframes and engines of its own, and Lessor shall reimburse Lessee for such
overhaul by payment of an amount equal to 110% of Lessee's actual costs in
connection with such overhaul. This provision is not intended and shall not be
construed to diminish or modify Lessee's other obligations under this Section
5.

27
<PAGE> 33
Section 6. Liens. Lessee will not directly or indirectly
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on or with respect to the
Airframe or any Engine, title thereto or any interest therein or in this Lease
except (i) the respective rights of Lessor and Lessee as herein provided, the
Lien created under the Trust Indenture, the rights of Lessor under the Purchase
Agreement Assignment and the rights of the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee under the Trust Agreement, the Trust Indenture, and
the Participation Agreement, (ii) the rights of others under agreements or
arrangements to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of Sections 7(b)
and 8(b), (iii) Lessor's Liens, Loan Participant Liens and Trustee's Liens,
(iv) Liens for Taxes either not yet due or being contested in good faith (and
for the payment of which adequate reserves have been provided) by appropriate
proceedings so long as such proceedings do not involve any material danger of
the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Airframe or any Engine or interest therein,
(v) materialmen's, mechanics', workmen's, repairmen's, employees' or other like
Liens arising in the ordinary course of Lessee's business for amounts the
payment of which is either not yet delinquent or is being contested in good
faith (and for the payment of which adequate reserves have been provided) by
appropriate proceedings so long as such proceedings do not involve any material
danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Airframe or any Engine or
interest therein, (vi) Liens arising out of judgments or awards against Lessee
with respect to which an appeal or proceeding for review is being prosecuted in
good faith and with respect to which there shall have been secured a stay of
execution pending such appeal or proceeding for review so long as such judgment
or award does not and will not involve any material danger of the sale,
forfeiture or loss of the Airframe or any Engine or interest therein and (vii)
salvage or similar rights of insurers under insurance policies maintained
pursuant to Section 11. Lessee will promptly, at its own expense, take such
action as may be necessary duly to discharge (by bonding or otherwise) any such
Lien not excepted above if the same shall arise at any time.

Section 7. Registration, Maintenance and Operation;
Possession; Insignia. (a) Registration, Maintenance and Operation. Lessee,
at its own cost and expense, shall:

(i) forthwith upon the delivery thereof to Lessor on the
Delivery Date cause the Aircraft to be duly registered, and at all
times thereafter to remain duly

28
<PAGE> 34
registered, under the laws of the United States, in the name of
Lessor, as owner, except (x) as otherwise required by the Federal
Aviation Act, or (y) to the extent that such registration cannot be
effected because of Lessor's or the Owner Participant's failure to
comply with the citizenship or other eligibility requirements for
registration of aircraft under such Act; provided that Lessor shall
execute and deliver all such documents as Lessee shall reasonably
request for the purpose of effecting and continuing such registration.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, but subject always to the
terms and conditions set forth in Section 9(m) and 9(n) of the
Participation Agreement, Lessee may cause the Aircraft to be duly
registered under the laws of any jurisdiction in which a sublessee
pursuant to Section 7(b)(ix) could be principally based, in the name
of Lessor or of any nominee of Lessor, or, if required by applicable
law, in the name of Lessee or any other Person, and shall thereafter
maintain such registration unless and until changed as provided herein
and therein; and Lessor will cooperate with Lessee in effecting such
foreign registration;

(ii) maintain, service, repair, overhaul and test the Aircraft in
accordance with a maintenance program (as approved by the Federal
Aviation Administration) for Boeing 757-200 series aircraft (or, at
Lessee's option, (x) in the event that the Aircraft is reregistered in
another jurisdiction pursuant to Section 7(a)(i), in accordance with
an aircraft maintenance program approved by the central civil aviation
authority of the jurisdiction of such registration or (y) in the event
of any sublease to a foreign air carrier in accordance with Section
7(b)(ix), approved by the central civil aviation authority of one of
the jurisdictions specified in clause (y) of such Section 7(b)(ix))
and in the same manner and with the same care used by Lessee with
respect to comparable aircraft and engines owned or operated by Lessee
and utilized in similar circumstances so as to keep the Aircraft in as
good operating condition as when delivered to Lessee by the
Manufacturer, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and in such condition
as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of the
Aircraft to be maintained in good standing at all times (other than
during temporary periods of storage in accordance with

29
<PAGE> 35
applicable regulations or during periods of grounding by applicable
governmental authorities, except where such periods of grounding are
the result of the failure by Lessee to maintain the Aircraft as
otherwise required herein) under the Federal Aviation Act or, if the
Aircraft is registered under the laws of any other jurisdiction, the
laws of such jurisdiction and in compliance with all applicable
manufacturer's alert service bulletins;

(iii) maintain, in the English language, all records, logs and
other materials required by the appropriate authorities in the
jurisdiction where the Aircraft is registered to be maintained in
respect of the Aircraft; and

(iv) promptly furnish to Lessor such information as may be
required to enable Lessor to file any reports, returns or statements
required to be filed by Lessor with any governmental authority because
of Lessor's or the Owner Participant's interest in the Aircraft.

Lessee agrees that the Aircraft will not be maintained, used
or operated in violation of any law or any rule, regulation or order of any
government or governmental authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign),
or in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or registration
relating to the Aircraft issued by any such authority; provided that Lessee
shall not be in default under this sentence if it is not possible for it to
comply with the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States (or other
than any jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is then registered) because of a
conflict with the applicable laws of the United States (or such jurisdiction in
which the Aircraft is then registered). In the event that any such law, rule,
regulation or order requires alteration of the Aircraft, Lessee will conform
thereto or obtain conformance therewith at no expense to Lessor and will
maintain the Aircraft in proper operating condition under such laws, rules,
regulations and orders; provided, however, that Lessee may, in good faith,
contest the validity or application of any such law, rule, regulation or order
in any reasonable manner which does not materially adversely affect Lessor, the
Aircraft, the Owner Participant or the lien of the Trust Indenture. Lessee
also agrees not to operate or locate the Aircraft, or suffer the Aircraft to be
operated or located, (i) in any area excluded from coverage

30
<PAGE> 36
by any insurance required by the terms of Section 11, except in the case of a
requisition for use by any Government where Lessee obtains indemnity pursuant
to Section 11 in lieu of such insurance from such Government against the risks
and in the amounts required by Section 11 covering such area, or (ii) in any
war zone or recognized or, in Lessee's judgment, threatened area of hostilities
unless covered by war risk insurance in accordance with Section 11, but only so
long as the same remains in effect while the Aircraft is so operated or
located, or unless the Aircraft is operated or used under contract with any
Government entered into pursuant to Section 11, under which contract such
Government assumes liability for any damage, loss, destruction or failure to
return possession of the Aircraft at the end of the term of such contract or
for injury to persons or damage to property of others.

(b) Possession. Lessee will not, without the prior written
consent of Lessor, sublease or otherwise in any manner deliver, transfer or
relinquish possession of the Airframe or any Engine or install any Engine, or
permit any Engine to be installed, on any airframe other than the Airframe;
provided that, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, and so long as the action to be taken shall not deprive the
Indenture Trustee of the perfected lien of the Trust Indenture on the Airframe
or (subject to subclause (B) of the "provided further" clause to subsection (i)
of this Section 7(b)) any Engine, and in any event, so long as Lessee shall
comply with the provisions of Section 11, Lessee may, without the prior consent
of Lessor:

(i) subject the Airframe to normal interchange agreements or
any Engine to normal interchange or pooling agreements or arrangements
in each case customary in the airline industry and entered into by
Lessee in the ordinary course of its business with any other United
States air carrier as to which there is in force a certificate issued
pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act or any successor
provision that gives like authority or with any "foreign air carrier"
(as such term is defined in such Act) as to which there is in force a
permit issued pursuant to Section 402 of said Act (any such United
States certificated air carrier and any such foreign air carrier being
hereinafter called a "Permitted Air Carrier"); provided that no
transfer of the registration of such Airframe shall be effected in
connection

31
<PAGE> 37
therewith; and provided, further, that (A) no such agreement or
arrangement contemplates or requires the transfer of title to the
Airframe and (B) if Lessor's title to any such Engine shall be divested
under any such agreement or arrangement, such divestiture shall be
deemed to be an Event of Loss with respect to such Engine and Lessee
shall comply with Section 10(b) in respect thereof;

(ii) deliver possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the
manufacturer thereof for testing or other similar purposes or to any
organization for service, repair, maintenance or overhaul work on the
Airframe or such Engine or any part thereof or for alterations or
modifications in or additions to the Airframe or such Engine to the
extent required or permitted by the terms of Section 7(a) or 8(c);

(iii) transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the
United States of America or any instrumentality or agency thereof
pursuant to a sublease, contract or other instrument, a copy of which
shall be furnished to Lessor; provided that the term of such sublease
(including, without limitation, any option of the sublessee to renew
or extend) or the term of possession under such contract or other
instrument shall not continue beyond the end of the Term or any
Renewal Term then in effect;

(iv) transfer possession of the Airframe or any Engine to the
United States of America or any instrumentality or agency thereof in
accordance with applicable laws, rulings, regulations or orders
(including, without limitation, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program
authorized under 10 U.S.C. Section 9511 et seq. or any substantially
similar program);

(v) install an Engine on an airframe owned by Lessee free and
clear of all Liens, except (A) those of the type permitted under
clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of Section 6 and those
which apply only to the engines (other than Engines), appliances,
parts, instruments, appurtenances, accessories, furnishings and other
equipment (other than Parts) installed on such airframe (but not to
the airframe as an entirety) and (B) the rights of other Permitted Air
Carriers under normal interchange agreements which are customary in
the airline industry and do not

32
<PAGE> 38
contemplate, permit or require the transfer of title to the airframe 
or engines installed thereon;

(vi) install an Engine on an airframe leased to Lessee or owned
by Lessee subject to a conditional sale or other security agreement;
provided that (A) such airframe is free and clear of all Liens except
the rights of the parties to the lease or conditional sale or other
security agreement covering such airframe and except Liens of the type
permitted by clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (v) of this paragraph
of Section 7(b) and B) Lessee shall have obtained from the lessor or
secured party of such airframe a written agreement (which may be the
lease or conditional sale or other security agreement covering such
airframe), in form and substance satisfactory to Lessor (it being
understood that an agreement from such lessor or secured party
substantially in the form of the final sentence of the penultimate
paragraph of this Section 7(b) shall be deemed to be satisfactory to
Lessor), whereby such lessor or secured party expressly agrees that
neither it nor its successors or assigns will acquire or claim any
right, title or interest in any Engine by reason of such Engine being
installed on such airframe at any time while such Engine is subject to
this Lease or to the lien of the Trust Indenture;

(vii) install an Engine on an airframe owned by Lessee, leased to
Lessee or owned by Lessee subject to a conditional sale or other
security agreement under circumstances where neither subparagraph (v)
nor subparagraph (vi) of this Section 7(b) is applicable; provided that
such installation shall be deemed an Event of Loss with respect to
such Engine and Lessee shall comply with Section 10(b) in respect
thereof, Lessor not intending hereby to waive any right or interest it
may have to or in such Engine under applicable law until compliance by
Lessee with such Section 10(b); and

(viii) sublease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or engines
then installed on the Airframe to any United States air carrier as to
which there is in force a certificate issued pursuant to Section 401
of the Federal Aviation Act or successor provision that gives like
authority; provided that the term of such sublease (including, without
limitation, any option of the sublessee to renew or extend) shall not
continue

33
<PAGE> 39
beyond the end of the Term or any Renewal Term then in effect, unless
Lessee shall have agreed to purchase the Aircraft or renew this Lease
in accordance with the terms hereof at the end of the Term or such
Renewal Term, as the case may be, to a date beyond the end of the term
of such sublease (assuming that all options to renew or extend such
sublease will be exercised); and

(ix) sublease any Engine or the Airframe and Engines or engines
then installed on the Airframe to (A) any foreign air carrier that is
principally based in and a domiciliary of a country (other than Cuba,
El Salvador, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Libya) that is at the inception
of the sublease a party to the Mortgage Convention, or (B) any foreign
air carrier that is principally based in and a domiciliary of a
country listed in Exhibit B hereto, or (C) any foreign air carrier not
described in clause (A) or (B) above; provided that (w) in the case
only of a sublease to a foreign air carrier under clause (C) above,
Lessor receives at the time of such sublease an opinion of counsel to
Lessee (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and
the Owner Participant) to the effect that (a) the terms of the
sublease and the Operative Documents are legal, valid, binding and
enforceable in the country in which such foreign air carrier is
principally based, to substantially the same extent as the Operative
Documents are at that time enforceable in the United States, (b) it is
not necessary for Lessor or the Owner Participant to qualify to do
business in such country solely as a result of the proposed sublease,
(c) there is no tort liability of the owner of an aircraft not in
possession thereof under the laws of such country other than tort
liability no more extensive or onerous than that which might have been
imposed on such owner under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof (it being understood that, in the event such opinion cannot be
given in a form satisfactory to Lessor and the Owner Participant, such
opinion shall be waived if insurance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor
and the Owner Participant is provided by Lessee to cover the risk of
such liability), (d) the laws of such country require fair
compensation by the government of such country for the loss of use of
the Aircraft in the event of the requisition by such government of the
Aircraft (unless Lessee shall have agreed to provide insurance
reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and the Owner

34
<PAGE> 40
Participant covering the risk of requisition of use of the Aircraft by
the government of such jurisdiction so long as the Aircraft is
subleased in such country), and (e) there exist no possessory rights in
favor of such sublessee under the laws of such country which would,
upon bankruptcy of or other default by Lessee or the sublessee,
prevent the return of such Engine or the Airframe and such Engine or
engine to Lessor in accordance with and when permitted by the terms of
Sections 14 and 15(a) hereof upon the exercise by Lessor of its
remedies under Section 15(a), (x) in the case only of a sublease to a
foreign air carrier under clause (C) above, each of Lessor and the
Owner Participant receives assurances reasonably satisfactory to it
that the currency of such country is freely convertible into U.S.
Dollars (unless Lessee shall have agreed to provide the requisition
insurance described in subclause (d) of clause (w) above), (y) in the
case of any sublease to a foreign air carrier, either the sublease, or
an arrangement existing between Lessee, the sublessee and/or one or
more third parties that provide maintenance services, provides that
the Aircraft will be maintained, serviced, repaired, overhauled and
tested in accordance with maintenance standards for Boeing 757-200
series aircraft approved by, or substantially similar to those
approved or required by, the Federal Aviation Administration or the
central civil aviation authority of any of Brazil, Canada, France, The
Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden,
Switzerland or the United Kingdom and (z) in the case of any sublease
to a foreign air carrier (other than a foreign air carrier principally
based in Taiwan) the United States of America maintains diplomatic
relations with the country in which such foreign air carrier is
principally based at the time such sublease is entered into;
and provided, further, that the term of any such sublease (including,
without limitation, any option of the sublessee to renew or extend)
shall not continue beyond the end of the Term or any Renewal Term then
in effect, unless Lessee shall have agreed to purchase the Aircraft or
renew this Lease in accordance with the terms hereof at the end of the
Term or such Renewal Term, as the case may be, to a date beyond the
end of the term of such sublease (assuming that all options to renew
or extend such sublease will be exercised);

35
<PAGE> 41
provided that the rights of any transferee who receives possession by reason of
a transfer permitted by this Section 7(b) (other than the transfer of an Engine
which is deemed an Event of Loss) shall be subject and subordinate to, and any
sublease permitted by this Section 7(b) shall be made expressly subject and
subordinate to, all the terms of this Lease and of the Trust Indenture,
including, without limitation, Lessor's rights to repossession pursuant to
Section 15(a) hereof and to avoid such sublease upon such repossession and the
Indenture Trustee's rights to possession pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Trust
Indenture, and Lessee shall in all events remain primarily liable hereunder for
the performance and observance of all of the terms and conditions of this Lease
to the same extent as if such sublease or transfer had not occurred, and any
such sublease shall include appropriate provisions for the maintenance (subject
to clause (y) of the first proviso to Section 7(b)(ix)) and insurance of the
Aircraft. No interchange agreement, pooling agreement, sublease or other
relinquishment of possession of the Airframe or any Engine permitted by this
Section 7(b) shall in any way discharge or diminish any of Lessee's obligations
under the Operative Documents. With the prior written consent of Lessor, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, Lessee may sub-sublease the
Airframe or Engines in connection with a transaction that involves such a
sub-sublease commencing at the inception of the transaction. Lessee may not
otherwise sub-sublease the Airframe or Engines. Lessee shall not sublease the
Airframe or Engines to any sublessee that is the subject of a bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar proceeding at the inception of such sublease
without the prior written consent of Lessor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Lessee shall, promptly upon entering into a sublease of
the Airframe or Engines, notify Lessor, the Owner Participant and the Indenture
Trustee of the identity of the sublessee and the term of such sublease and
shall provide a copy of such sublease agreement to any of Lessor, the Owner
Participant or the Indenture Trustee upon request therefrom (with economic and
financial provisions and information deleted therefrom if Lessee shall so
choose), provided that, except to the extent required by applicable law, such
parties shall keep confidential the identity of the sublessee and the existence
and terms of such sublease. Lessor hereby agrees, for the benefit of the
lessor or secured party of any airframe leased to Lessee or owned by Lessee
subject to a conditional sale or other security agreement that Lessor will not
acquire or claim, as against such lessor or secured party, any right, title or
interest

36
<PAGE> 42
in any engine or engines owned by the lessor under such lease or subject to a
security interest in favor of the secured party under such conditional sale or
other security agreement as the result of such engine or engines being
installed on the Airframe at any time while such engine or engines are subject
to such lease or conditional sale or other security agreement.

Lessor acknowledges that any "wet lease" or other similar
arrangement under which Lessee maintains operational control of the Aircraft
shall not constitute a delivery, transfer or relinquishment of possession for
purposes of this Section 7(b).

(c) Insignia. Lessee agrees to affix as promptly as
practicable after the Delivery Date and thereafter to maintain in the cockpit
of the Airframe adjacent to the airworthiness certificate therein and (if not
prevented by applicable law or regulations or by any governmental authority) on
each Engine a nameplate bearing the inscription "WILMINGTON TRUST COMPANY, AS
OWNER TRUSTEE, LESSOR", and, so long as the Airframe or such Engine shall
constitute a part of the Indenture Estate, the inscription "C&S/SOVRAN TRUST
COMPANY (GEORGIA), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE/MORTGAGEE" (such
nameplate to be replaced, if necessary, with a nameplate reflecting the name of
any successor Lessor or successor Indenture Trustee). Except as above
provided, Lessee will not allow the name of any Person to be placed on the
Airframe or on any Engine as a designation that might be interpreted as a claim
of ownership; provided that nothing herein contained shall prohibit Lessee (or
any sublessee) from placing its customary colors and insignia on the Airframe
or any Engine.

Section 8. Replacement and Pooling of Parts; Alterations,
Modifications and Additions. (a) Replacement of Parts. Lessee, at its own
cost and expense, will promptly replace all Parts which may from time to time
be incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine and
which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized,
confiscated, damaged beyond repair or rendered permanently unfit for use for
any reason whatsoever, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c). In
addition, Lessee may, at its own cost and expense, remove in the ordinary
course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or testing, any Parts, whether
or not worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond
repair or rendered permanently unfit for use; provided that

37
<PAGE> 43
Lessee, except as otherwise provided in Section 8(c), will, at its own cost and
expense, replace such Parts as promptly as possible. All replacement Parts
shall be free and clear of all Liens (except for pooling arrangements to the
extent permitted by Section 8(b) and Permitted Liens), and shall be in as good
operating condition as, and shall have a value and utility at least equal to,
the Parts replaced, assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition and
repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof. Title to all Parts at
any time removed from the Airframe or any Engine shall remain vested in Lessor
no matter where located, until such time as such Parts shall be replaced by
Parts which have been incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe
or any Engine and which meet the requirements for replacement Parts specified
above. Immediately upon any replacement Part becoming incorporated or
installed in or attached to the Airframe or any Engine as above provided,
without further act, (i) title to the replaced Part shall thereupon vest in
Lessee, free and clear of all rights of Lessor, and such replaced Part shall no
longer be deemed a Part hereunder, (ii) title to such replacement Part shall
thereupon vest in Lessor, free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted
Liens) and (iii) such replacement Part shall become subject to this Lease and
be deemed part of the Airframe or such Engine for all purposes to the same
extent as the Parts originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the
Airframe or such Engine.

(b) Pooling of Parts. Any Part removed from the Airframe or
an Engine as provided in Section 8(a) may be subjected by Lessee to a normal
pooling arrangement customary in the airline industry entered into in the
ordinary course of Lessee's business with Permitted Air Carriers; provided that
the Part replacing such removed Part shall be incorporated or installed in or
attached to the Airframe or such Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) as
promptly as practicable after the removal of such removed Part. In addition,
any replacement Part when incorporated or installed in or attached to the
Airframe or an Engine in accordance with Section 8(a) may be owned by a
Permitted Air Carrier subject to such a normal pooling arrangement; provided
that Lessee, at its expense, as promptly thereafter as practicable, either (i)
causes title to such replacement Part to vest in Lessor in accordance with
Section 8(a) by Lessee acquiring title thereto for the benefit of, and
transferring such title to, Lessor, free and clear of all Liens (other than
Permitted Liens) or (ii) replaces such replacement Part by incorporating or
installing in or at-

38
<PAGE> 44
taching to the Airframe or such Engine a further replacement Part owned by
Lessee free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and by causing
title to such further replacement Part to vest in Lessor in accordance with
Section 8(a).

(c) Alterations, Modifications and Additions. Lessee, at its
own expense, will make such alterations and modifications in and additions to
the Airframe and the Engines as may be required from time to time to meet the
standards of the Federal Aviation Administration or other governmental
authority having jurisdiction in any country in or over which the Aircraft is
flown; provided, however, that Lessee may, in good faith, contest the validity
or application of any such standard in any reasonable manner which does not
materially adversely affect Lessor, the Aircraft, the Owner Participant or the
lien of the Trust Indenture. In addition, Lessee, at its own expense, may from
time to time make or cause to be made such alterations and modifications in and
additions to the Airframe or any Engine as Lessee may deem desirable in the
proper conduct of its business, including, without limitation, removal of
Parts; provided that no such alteration, modification, addition or removal
shall materially diminish the value or utility of the Airframe or such Engine,
or materially impair the condition or airworthiness thereof, below the value,
utility, condition and airworthiness thereof immediately prior to such
alteration, modification, addition or removal assuming the Airframe or such
Engine was then of the value and utility and in the condition and airworthiness
required to be maintained by the terms of this Lease, except that the value
(but not the utility, condition or airworthiness) of the Aircraft may be
reduced by the value of Parts which Lessee deems obsolete or no longer suitable
or appropriate for use in the Airframe or any Engine which shall have been
removed, if the aggregate value of all such obsolete or unsuitable Parts
removed from the Aircraft and not replaced shall not exceed $500,000. Title to
all Parts incorporated or installed in or attached or added to the Airframe or
any Engine as the result of such alteration, modification or addition shall,
without further act, vest in Lessor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee
may, at any time during the Term, remove any Part; provided that (i) such Part
is in addition to, and not in replacement of or substitution for, any Part
originally incorporated or installed in or attached to the Airframe or such
Engine at the time of delivery thereof hereunder or any Part in replacement of,
or substitution for, any such Part,

39
<PAGE> 45
(ii) such Part is not required to be incorporated or installed in or attached
or added to such Airframe or Engine pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 8(c), and (iii) such Part can be removed from the Airframe or such
Engine without materially diminishing or impairing the value, utility,
condition or airworthiness required to be maintained by the terms of this Lease
which the Airframe or such Engine would have had at such time had such removal
not occurred. Upon the removal by Lessee of any Part as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence or the removal of any obsolete or unsuitable
Part permitted by this Section 8(c), title thereto shall, without further act,
vest in Lessee and such Part shall no longer be deemed part of the Airframe or
the Engine from which it was removed. Title to any such Part not removed by
Lessee prior to the return of the Airframe or any Engine to Lessor hereunder
shall remain vested in Lessor.

Section 9. Voluntary Termination. (a) Right of Termination.
So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee
shall have the right at its option (i) to terminate this Lease at any time on
or after the fifth anniversary of the Delivery Date, if in Lessee's good faith
determination (evidenced by a certificate of a Responsible Officer of Lessee to
such effect) the Aircraft is surplus to Lessee's requirements or economically
obsolete to Lessee, and (ii) at any time on or after the eighth anniversary of
the Delivery Date to terminate this Lease for any reason whatsoever, in each
case by delivering to Lessor a written notice of termination specifying a
proposed date of termination (the "Termination Date") which shall be a Business
Day occurring not earlier than 90 days after the date of such notice, and, if
the Termination Date is a Special Termination Date, whether or not Lessee is
thereby electing to purchase the Aircraft on such Special Termination Date as
provided in Section 9(e). The termination of this Lease shall, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Section 9, be effective on (i) if Lessee has not
elected to purchase the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has
elected to sell the Aircraft, as provided below, the date of sale of the
Aircraft, if any, referred to in Section 9(b), (ii) if Lessee has not elected
to purchase the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected to
retain the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(d), the date of termination
referred to in Section 9(d), or (iii) if Lessee has elected to purchase the
Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e), the date of purchase referred to in
Section 9(e). Where Lessee has not elected

40
<PAGE> 46
to purchase the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e), Lessor shall give Lessee
irrevocable notice of its election to sell or retain the Aircraft no later than
30 days prior to the Termination Date. In the event Lessor shall fail to give
notice pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, notice of its election
to sell the Aircraft shall be deemed to have been given as of such thirtieth
day prior to the Termination Date. Unless Lessor shall have given to Lessee a
timely notice of its election to retain the Aircraft as provided in Section
9(d), Lessee may withdraw the termination notice referred to above at any time
on or prior to the date three Business Days prior to the Termination Date,
whereupon this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. In the event
Lessee withdraws, on or after the third Business Day prior to the Termination
Date, a notice of termination given pursuant to this Section 9(a) or such
notice is deemed withdrawn pursuant to the final sentence of Section 9(b),
Lessee will reimburse Lessor and the Owner Participant for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in connection with the proposed sale,
except Lessee shall not be obligated to reimburse Lessor and the Owner
Participant for any out-of-pocket expenses to the extent Lessor shall have
failed to comply with its obligations under this Section 9. Lessee shall not
be entitled to exercise its right of termination provided for in this Section
9(a) more than four times during the Term (not including for purposes of this
sentence any exercise by Lessee of such right of termination immediately
following a failure of this Lease to be terminated by reason of Lessor's
failure to comply with its obligations under this Section 9).

(b) Sale of Aircraft. If Lessee has not elected to purchase
the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected or is deemed to
have elected to sell the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(a), Lessee will have
the option of acting as non-exclusive agent for Lessor to obtain bids for the
cash purchase on or prior to the Termination Date of the Aircraft. Lessor
agrees to pay Lessee a commercially reasonable brokerage fee based on the then
current industry practice in the event that Lessee locates the Person who
purchases the Aircraft pursuant to this Section 9(b). If Lessee acts as such
agent, no later than ten Business Days prior to the Termination Date, Lessee
shall certify to Lessor in writing the amount and terms of each cash bid
received by Lessee and the name and the address of the Person submitting each
such bid. Lessor may (but need not), also, at its expense (which expense,
including without

41
<PAGE> 47
limitation any broker's or finder's fees, shall be for the Owner Participant's
own account), independently obtain cash bids for such purchase and, in the
event Lessor receives any such bid, Lessor shall promptly, and in any event at
least five Business Days prior to the Termination Date, certify to Lessee in
writing the amount and terms of such bid and the name and address of the Person
submitting such bid. Neither the Owner Participant, Lessee, nor any Affiliate
of either may submit a bid for the Aircraft, directly or indirectly, in
connection with such proposed sale. On the Termination Date (or such other
date of sale as may be agreed to by Lessor and Lessee, which shall thereafter
be deemed the Termination Date), (x) Lessee shall, subject to receipt (i) by
Lessor (or, so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been discharged, the
Indenture Trustee) of the full purchase price thereof and all amounts owing to
Lessor pursuant to the next sentence, and (ii) by the Persons entitled thereto
of all unpaid Supplemental Rent due on or before the Termination Date, deliver
the Aircraft at a location selected by Lessee to the Person who shall have
submitted the highest cash bid net of any broker's or finder's fees (or such
other purchaser acceptable to Lessor and Lessee), in the same manner as if
delivery were made to Lessor at the end of the Term pursuant to Section 5, and
shall duly transfer to Lessor title to any engines installed on the Airframe
but not owned by Lessor, all in accordance with the terms of Section 5, and (y)
Lessor shall simultaneously therewith sell, without recourse or warranty
(except as to Lessor's Liens), for cash all of Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to the Aircraft to such highest net cash bidder (or other
purchaser). The total selling price realized at such sale shall be retained by
Lessor (or, so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been discharged,
distributed by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Trust
Indenture) and, in addition, on the Termination Date, Lessee shall pay to
Lessor or, in the case of Supplemental Rent, to the Persons entitled thereto,
in funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), an amount equal to (I) the sum
of (1) the excess, if any, of (A) the Termination Value for the Aircraft as of
the Termination Date, over (B) the proceeds of the sale of the Aircraft after
deducting the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lessor and the
Owner Participant (including any brokerage fee paid to Lessee or any other
Person), plus (2) all Supplemental Rent (including, without limitation, BREAK
AMOUNT, if any, on the Certificates) due and owing on the Termination Date,
plus (3) (A) if the Termination Date is a Lease Period Date, the Basic Rent

42
<PAGE> 48
installment due and payable on that date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it being
understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be required to pay the portion, if
any, of such Basic Rent installment designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent
Schedule as being payable in advance), or (B) if the Termination Date is not a
Lease Period Date and if Basic Rent is payable in arrears during the Lease
Period commencing on the Lease Period Date next preceding the Termination Date,
an amount equal to the Accrued Arrears Basic Rent for the period from and
including such Lease Period Date to but excluding the Termination Date, plus
(4) all Basic Rent due and payable prior to the Termination Date and unpaid,
less (II) any credit to which Lessee may be entitled as hereinafter in this
Section 9(b) provided. Subject always to the provisions of the penultimate
paragraph of Section 3(b), if the Termination Date with respect to which
Termination Value is determined is not a Lease Period Date and if any portion
of the Basic Rent installment paid in respect of the Lease Period commencing on
the Lease Period Date next preceding the Termination Date is designated in
Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as having been payable in advance, Lessee
shall be entitled to a credit against the amounts payable by it pursuant to
this Section 9(b) in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the Unearned Advance
Basic Rent as of the Termination Date, and (y) the amount, if any, by which the
proceeds of the sale of the Aircraft after deducting the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lessor and the Owner Participant (including
any brokerage fee paid to Lessee or any other Person) exceeds the Termination
Value for the Aircraft as of the Termination Date; provided that, in the event
that the amount calculated pursuant to this sentence to be credited exceeds the
amounts payable by Lessee pursuant to this Section 9(b), the Owner Participant
shall be obligated to rebate an amount equal to such excess to Lessee. If on
or prior to the scheduled Termination Date no sale of the Aircraft shall have
occurred and if Lessor shall not have elected to retain the Aircraft in
accordance with Section 9(d) or Lessee shall not have elected to purchase the
Aircraft in accordance with Section 9(e), Lessee's notice given pursuant to
Section 9(a) shall be deemed to be withdrawn as of such scheduled Termination
Date and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect.

(c) Certain Obligations upon Sale of Aircraft. Upon the sale
of the Aircraft pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section
9(b), Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except as
to Lessor's Liens), all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to

43
<PAGE> 49
any Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but which are not then installed
on the Aircraft. Lessor shall be under no duty to solicit bids, to inquire
into the efforts of Lessee to obtain bids or otherwise take any action in
connection with the sale of the Aircraft under Section 9(b), other than to
transfer to the purchaser of the Aircraft (or to such purchaser and to Lessee,
as the case may be), without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's
Liens), all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the Aircraft
against receipt of the payments provided for herein, and to pay the amounts, if
any, required to be paid by Lessor under Section 9(b) or this Section 9(c), and
to request the Indenture Trustee upon the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to
Section 9(b) to execute and deliver to such purchaser (or to such purchaser and
to Lessee, as the case may be) an appropriate instrument releasing the Aircraft
from the lien of the Trust Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and
the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge under the
Trust Indenture. Lessor agrees to notify promptly Lessee of the appointment by
Lessor of any broker or finder (other than Lessee) in connection with the sale
of the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(b) and, subject to Section 9(b), to pay
the fees or commissions of any such broker or finder employed by Lessor in
connection with the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(b).

(d) Retention of Aircraft by Lessor. If Lessee has not elected
to purchase the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected to
retain the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(a), on the Termination Date specified
in Lessee's termination notice, Lessor shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
Indenture Trustee funds of the type and in an amount equal to (1) the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Certificates and all accrued interest
thereon, plus (2) all other sums due and payable on such Termination Date under
the Trust Indenture, the Participation Agreement or such Certificates. Subject
to receipt by the Indenture Trustee of such funds, on the Termination Date, (i)
Lessee (x) shall deliver the Aircraft to Lessor in the same manner as if
delivery were made to Lessor at the end of the Term pursuant to Section 5, and
shall duly transfer to Lessor title to any engines installed on the Airframe
but not owned by Lessor, all in accordance with the terms of Section 5, and (y)
shall pay to Lessor or to the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of the type
specified in Section 3(d), (A) all Supplemental Rent (including, without
limitation, BREAK AMOUNT, if any, on the Certifi-

44
<PAGE> 50
cates), other than Termination Value, and, if the Termination Date is a Lease
Period Date, the Basic Rent installment due and payable on that date pursuant
to Section 3(b) (it being understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be
required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment designated
in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in advance) or, if the
Termination Date is not a Lease Period Date and if Basic Rent is payable in
arrears during the Lease Period commencing on the Lease Period Date next
preceding the Termination Date, an amount equal to the Accrued Arrears Basic
Rent for the period from and including such Lease Period Date to but excluding
the Termination Date, and all Basic Rent due and payable prior to the
Termination Date and unpaid, less (B) any credit to which Lessee may be
entitled as hereinafter in this Section 9(d) provided, and (ii) Lessor (x)
shall transfer or cause to be transferred to Lessee, without recourse or
warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all of Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to any Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but which are
not then installed on the Aircraft, and (y) Lessor shall request the Indenture
Trustee to execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument releasing
the Aircraft from the lien of the Trust Indenture and releasing the Purchase
Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge
under the Trust Indenture. If the Termination Date is not a Lease Period Date
and if any portion of the Basic Rent installment paid in respect of the Lease
Period commencing on the Lease Period Date next preceding the Termination Date
is designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as having been payable in
advance, Lessee shall, subject always to the provisions of the penultimate
paragraph of Section 3(b), be entitled to a credit against the amounts payable
by it pursuant to this Section 9(d) in an amount equal to the Unearned Advance
Basic Rent as of the Termination Date; provided that in the event that the
Unearned Advance Basic Rent exceeds the amount payable by Lessee pursuant to
this Section 9(d), the Owner Participant will be obligated to rebate an amount
equal to such excess to Lessee. If Lessor shall fail to perform any of its
obligations pursuant to this Section 9(d) and as a result thereof this Lease
shall not be terminated on a proposed Termination Date, Lessor shall thereafter
no longer be entitled to exercise its election to retain the Aircraft and
Lessee may at its option at any time thereafter submit a new termination notice
pursuant to Section 9(a).

45
<PAGE> 51
(e) Purchase of Aircraft by Lessee. In the event that
Lessee shall have elected to purchase the Aircraft on a Special Termination
Date pursuant to Section (a), on such Special Termination Date, Lessee shall
purchase the Aircraft at a price (the "Special Termination Price") equal to the
greater of (I) the Termination Value for the Aircraft, computed as of the
Special Termination Date, and (II) the then fair market sales value of the
Aircraft, as determined by mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they
shall be unable to agree, by an Independent Appraisal. On such Special
Termination Date, (x) Lessee (i) shall pay to Lessor or to the Persons entitled
thereto, in funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), all unpaid
Supplemental Rent (including, without limitation, BREAK AMOUNT, if any, on the
Certificates), other than Termination Value, due and owing on such Special
Termination Date, all Basic Rent due and payable prior to the Special
Termination Date and unpaid and the Basic Rent installment due and payable on
the Special Termination Date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it being understood and
agreed that Lessee shall not be required to pay the portion, if any, of such
Basic Rent installment designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being
payable in advance) and (ii) at its option shall either (A) pay to Lessor, in
funds of the type specified in Section 3(d), the Special Termination Price, or
(B) assume all of the rights and obligations of the Owner Trustee under the
Trust Indenture in respect of the Certificates (including, without limitation,
any scheduled payment of principal of, BREAK AMOUNT, if any, on, or accrued
interest on, the Certificates due and payable on the Special Termination Date
but only to the extent that the Basic Rent installment payable by Lessee
pursuant to clause (i) above does not cover such scheduled payment of principal
of or accrued interest on the Certificates but excluding any obligations or
liabilities of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity incurred on or
prior to the Special Termination Date, which obligations and liabilities shall
remain the sole responsibility of the Owner Trustee) in accordance with Section
2.16 of the Trust Indenture and simultaneously shall pay to Lessor, in funds of
the type specified in Section 3(d), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
the Special Termination Price over an amount equal to the sum of the principal
of, and any accrued and unpaid interest on, the outstanding Certificates on
such Special Termination Date, after taking into account any payments of
principal or interest made in respect of the outstanding Certificates on such
Special Termination Date, and (y) Lessor will sell to Lessee, without recourse
or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all of Lessor's right,

46
<PAGE> 52
title and interest in and to the Aircraft and all of Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to any Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but which are
not then installed on the Aircraft and, if Lessee shall not have assumed the
rights and obligations of the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture in
respect of the Certificates as provided for above, Lessor will request the
Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument
releasing the Airframe and Engines with respect to which title is transferred
from the lien of the Trust Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and
the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge thereunder.

(f) Termination of Lease, Etc. Upon the sale or retention or
purchase of the Aircraft, as the case may be, in compliance with the provisions
of this Section 9, (i) the obligation of Lessee to pay Basic Rent under Section
3(b) on any Lease Period Date occurring subsequent to the applicable
Termination Value Determination Date, and (ii) the obligation of Lessee to pay
Supplemental Rent (subject to Section 3(f), other than payments of Supplemental
Rent to be made by Lessee (x) surviving pursuant to Section 7(d) of the
Participation Agreement or Section 10 of the Tax Indemnity Agreement, or (y) in
respect of liabilities and obligations of Lessee which have accrued under any
Operative Document but not been paid or which are in dispute as of the date of
such sale or retention) shall cease as of the Termination Date and, in each
case, the Term shall end effective as of the Termination Date.

(g) Termination as to Engines. So long as no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee shall have the right at
its option at any time, on at least 60 days' prior written notice, to terminate
this Lease with respect to any Engine. In such event, and prior to the date of
such termination, Lessee shall replace such Engine hereunder by complying with
the terms of Section 10(b) to the same extent as if an Event of Loss had
occurred with respect to such Engine.

Section 10. Loss, Destruction, Requisition, Etc. (a) Event
of Loss with Respect to the Airframe. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss
with respect to the Airframe, Lessee shall forthwith (and, in any event, within
30 days after such occurrence) give Lessor notice of such Event of Loss and of
its election to perform one of the following options (it being agreed that, if
Lessee shall not have

47
<PAGE> 53
given notice of such election within such 30 days after such occurrence, Lessee
shall be deemed to have elected to perform the option set forth in the
following clause (ii)):

(i) as promptly as practicable, and in any event on or before
the Business Day next preceding the 121st day next following the date
of occurrence of such Event of Loss, in replacement for the Airframe,
Lessee shall convey or cause to be conveyed to Lessor title to a
Replacement Airframe (together with the same number of Replacement
Engines as the Engines, if any, installed on the Airframe at the time
such Event of Loss occurred) to be leased to Lessee hereunder, such
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines to be free and clear of
all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), to have a value and utility at
least equal to, and to be in as good operating condition as, the
Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced (assuming such Airframe and
Engines were in the condition and repair required by the terms of this
Lease); provided that, if Lessee shall not perform its obligation to
effect such replacement under this clause (i) during the period of
time provided herein, then Lessee shall pay on the fifteenth day next
following the end of such period to Lessor, or, in the case of
Supplemental Rent, to the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of the
type specified in Section 3(d) hereof, the amounts specified in clause
(ii) below; or

(ii) on or before the earlier of 30 days following the date on
which insurance proceeds are received with respect to such Event of
Loss and the Business Day next preceding the 121st day next following
the date of occurrence of such Event of Loss or on the date specified
in the proviso to clause (i) above, if such proviso is applicable (the
"Loss Payment Date"), Lessee shall pay to Lessor or, in the case of
Supplemental Rent, to the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of the
type specified in Section 3(d), (A) the Stipulated Loss Value for the
Aircraft, determined as of the Loss Payment Date, plus (B) all
Supplemental Rent (including, without limitation, the BREAK AMOUNT, if
any, on the Certificates) due and owing on such Loss Payment Date,
plus (C) if the Casualty Loss Determination Date with respect to the
Stipulated Loss Value is a Lease Period Date, the Basic Rent
installment due and payable on that date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it
being understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be

48
<PAGE> 54
required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment
designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in
advance), plus (D) all Basic Rent due and payable prior to the
Casualty Loss Determination Date and unpaid.

In the event of payment in full of the Stipulated Loss Value
for the Aircraft and all amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10, (1) the
obligation of Lessee to pay any Basic Rent under Section 3(b) on any Lease
Period Date occurring subsequent to the Casualty Loss Determination Date with
respect to which Stipulated Loss Value is determined shall terminate, (2) the
obligation of Lessee to pay Supplemental Rent (subject to Section 3(f), other
than payments of Supplemental Rent to be made by Lessee (x) surviving pursuant
to Section 10 of the Tax Indemnity Agreement or Section 7(d) of the
Participation Agreement, or (y) in respect of liabilities and obligations of
Lessee which have accrued under any of the Operative Documents but not been
paid or which are in dispute as of the date of such payment) shall terminate,
(3) the Term for the Aircraft shall end, (4) Lessor will transfer to Lessee,
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all Lessor's right,
title and interest in and to the Airframe and Engines (if any) with respect to
which such Event of Loss occurred, as well as all Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to any Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but not
installed thereon when such Event of Loss occurred, and (5) Lessor will assign
to or as directed by Lessee all claims of Lessor against third Persons relating
to such Airframe and Engines arising from such Event of Loss. Upon such
transfer, Lessor shall request the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to
Lessee an appropriate instrument releasing the Airframe and Engines with
respect to which title is transferred from the lien of the Trust Indenture and
releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the
assignment and pledge thereof thereunder.

At the time of or prior to any replacement of the Airframe and
such Engines, if any, Lessee, at its own expense, will (A) furnish Lessor with
a warranty (as to title) bill of sale in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Lessor (which warranty shall except Permitted Liens) with
respect to the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, together
with an assignment of any and all manufacturer's warranties applicable thereto
(to the extent such warranties may be so assigned by Lessee) in

49
<PAGE> 55
a form substantially similar to the Form of Purchase Agreement Assignment
attached as Exhibit III to the Participation Agreement, (B) cause a Lease
Supplement substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, subjecting such
Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, to this Lease, and duly
executed by Lessee, to be delivered to Lessor for execution and, upon such
execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act or,
if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of such jurisdiction other than
the United States of America in which such Replacement Airframe and Replacement
Engines, if any, are to be registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the
case may be, (C) so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been satisfied
and discharged, cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement substantially
in the form of Exhibit A to the Trust Indenture or other requisite documents or
instruments for such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, to
be delivered to Lessor and to the Indenture Trustee for execution and, upon
such execution, to be filed for recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation
Act or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of such jurisdiction
other than the United States of America in which such Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, are to be registered in accordance with Section
7(a), as the case may be, (D) so long as the Trust Indenture shall not have
been satisfied and discharged, cause a financing statement or statements with
respect to the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, or other
requisite documents or instruments to be filed in such place or places as
necessary in order to perfect the security interest therein created by or
pursuant to the Trust Indenture, or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable
laws of the jurisdiction in which such Replacement Airframe and Replacement
Engines, if any, are to be registered in accordance with Section 7(a), as the
case may be, (E) furnish Lessor and the Indenture Trustee with an opinion of
Lessee's counsel addressed to each (which may be Lessee's General Counsel), to
the effect that the bill of sale referred to in clause (A) above constitutes an
effective instrument for the conveyance of title to the Replacement Airframe
and Replacement Engines, if any, to Lessor and to the further effect that upon
such conveyance such substituted property will be leased hereunder and
subjected to the lien of the Trust Indenture, (F) furnish Lessor with a
certificate of an independent aircraft engineer or appraiser certifying that
the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, have a value and
utility at least equal to, and are in as good operating

50
<PAGE> 56
condition as, the Airframe and Engines, if any, so replaced assuming such
Airframe and Engines were in the condition and repair required by the terms
hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss, (G) furnish
Lessor and the Indenture Trustee with (i) such evidence of compliance with the
insurance provisions of Section 11 with respect to such Replacement Airframe
and Replacement Engines as Lessor may reasonably request and (ii) a certificate
from a Responsible Officer of Lessee certifying that at the time of such
replacement there is no continuing Event of Default, and (H) furnish Lessor and
the Indenture Trustee with a reasoned opinion of Lessee's counsel (which may be
Lessee's General Counsel) addressed to each, to the effect that the Owner
Trustee, as Lessor under the Lease, and the Indenture Trustee, as assignee of
the Owner Trustee's rights under the Lease pursuant to the Indenture, should be
entitled to the benefits of Title 11 U.S.C. Section 1110 with respect to the
Replacement Airframe, provided that (i) such opinion need not be delivered to
the extent that, by reason of a change in law or in judicial or other
governmental interpretation thereof, the benefits of such Section 1110 were not
available to the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee with respect to the
Aircraft immediately prior to such substitution and (ii) such opinion may
contain qualifications and assumptions of the tenor contained in the opinion of
Debevoise & Plimpton delivered pursuant to Section 4(J) of the Participation
Agreement on the Delivery Date and such other qualifications and assumptions as
shall at the time be customary in opinions rendered in comparable
circumstances. In the case of each Replacement Airframe and each Replacement
Engine, if any, conveyed to Lessor under this Section 10, and each Replacement
Engine conveyed to Lessor under this Section 10, promptly upon the registration
of the Replacement Aircraft and the recordation of the Lease Supplement and the
Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement or other requisite documents or
instruments covering such Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any,
or such Replacement Engine pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act (or pursuant to
the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which such Replacement Airframe and
Replacement Engines, if any, or such Replacement Engine, are to be registered
in accordance with Section 7(a)), Lessee will cause to be delivered to Lessor
and the Indenture Trustee an opinion of counsel to Lessee as to the due
registration of such Replacement Aircraft, the due recordation of such Lease
Supplement and such Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement or other requisite
documents or instruments and the validity and perfection of the security
interest in the Replacement

51
<PAGE> 57
Aircraft, Replacement Engines or Replacement Engine, as the case may be,
granted to the Indenture Trustee under the Trust Indenture.

For all purposes hereof, upon passage of title thereto to
Lessor the Replacement Airframe and Replacement Engines, if any, shall be
deemed part of the property leased hereunder, the Replacement Airframe shall be
deemed an "Airframe" as defined herein, and each such Replacement Engine shall
be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein. No such replacement of the Airframe
or any Engines under the circumstances contemplated by the terms of this
Section 10(a) shall result in any reduction of Basic Rent. Upon such passage
of title, Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except
as to Lessor's Liens), all Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the
replaced Airframe and Engines (if any) installed thereon at the time such Event
of Loss occurred, and upon such transfer, Lessor will request in writing that
the Indenture Trustee execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument
releasing such replaced Airframe and Engines (if any) installed thereon at the
time such Event of Loss occurred from the lien of the Indenture and releasing
the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement Assignment from the
assignment and pledge under the Indenture.

(b) Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under circumstances in
which there has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe,
Lessee shall give Lessor prompt written notice thereof and shall, within 90
days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, convey or cause to be conveyed
to Lessor, as replacement for the Engine with respect to which such Event of
Loss occurred, title to a Replacement Engine free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens) and having a value and utility at least equal to, and
being in as good operating condition as, the Engine with respect to which such
Event of Loss occurred, assuming such Engine was of the value and utility and
in the condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior to
the occurrence of such Event of Loss. Prior to or at the time of any such
conveyance, Lessee, at its own expense, will (i) furnish Lessor with a warranty
(as to title) bill of sale (which warranty shall except Permitted Liens) with
respect to such Replacement Engine, (ii) cause a Lease Supplement substantially
in the form of Exhibit A hereto, subjecting such Replacement Engine to this
Lease, and duly executed by Lessee, to be delivered to

52
<PAGE> 58
Lessor for execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for recordation
pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, or, if necessary, pursuant to the
applicable laws of such jurisdiction other than the United States of America in
which the Aircraft is registered, (iii) so long as the Trust Indenture shall
not have been satisfied and discharged, comply with the applicable provisions
thereof and cause a Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement substantially in
the form of Exhibit A to the Trust Indenture or other requisite documents or
instruments for such Replacement Engine to be delivered to Lessor and to the
Indenture Trustee for execution and, upon such execution, to be filed for
recordation pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act or, if necessary, pursuant to
the applicable laws of such jurisdiction other than the United States of
America in which the Aircraft is or is to be registered in accordance with
Section 7(a), as the case may be, (iv) furnish Lessor and the Indenture Trustee
with an opinion of Lessee's counsel addressed to each (which may be Lessee's
General Counsel) to the effect that the bill of sale referred to in clause (i)
above constitutes an effective instrument for the conveyance of title to such
Replacement Engine to Lessor and to the further effect that upon such
conveyance such substituted property will be leased hereunder and subjected to
the lien of the Trust Indenture, (v) furnish Lessor with a certificate of an
aircraft engineer or appraiser (who may be an employee of Lessee) certifying
that such Replacement Engine has a value and utility at least equal to, and is
in as good operating condition as, the Engine so replaced assuming such Engine
was in the condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior
to the occurrence of such Event of Loss, (vi) so long as the Trust Indenture
shall not have been satisfied and discharged, cause a financing statement or
statements with respect to the Replacement Engine or other requisite documents
or instruments to be filed in such place or places as necessary in order to
perfect the security interest therein created by or pursuant to the Trust
Indenture, or, if necessary, pursuant to the applicable laws of the
jurisdiction in which the Aircraft is or is to be registered in accordance with
Section 7(a), as the case may be, and (vii) furnish Lessor and the Indenture
Trustee with such evidence of compliance with the insurance provisions of
Section 11 with respect to such Replacement Engine as Lessor may reasonably
request. Upon full compliance by Lessee with the terms of this paragraph (b),
Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty (except as to
Lessor's Liens), all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the Engine
with respect

53
<PAGE> 59
to which such Event of Loss occurred, and Lessor will assign to or as directed
by Lessee all claims of Lessor against third Persons relating to such Engine
arising from such Event of Loss. In addition, upon such transfer Lessor shall
request in writing that the Indenture Trustee execute and deliver to Lessee an
appropriate instrument releasing such Engine from the lien of the Trust
Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Agreement
Assignment (in respect solely of such Engine) from the assignment and pledge
under the Trust Indenture. For all purposes hereof, each such Replacement
Engine shall, after such conveyance, be deemed part of the property leased
hereunder and shall be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein. No Event of Loss
with respect to an Engine under the circumstances contemplated by the terms of
this Section 10(b) shall result in any reduction in Basic Rent.

(c) Application of Payments from Governmental Authorities for
Requisition of Title or Use. Any payments (other than insurance proceeds the
application of which is provided for in Section 11) received at any time by
Lessor or by Lessee from any governmental authority or other Person with
respect to an Event of Loss resulting from the condemnation, confiscation,
theft or seizure of, or requisition of title to or use of, the Airframe or any
Engine, other than a requisition for use by any Government or by the government
of the country of registry of the Aircraft not constituting an Event of Loss,
will be applied as follows:

(i) if such payments are received with respect to the
Airframe or the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on the
Airframe that has been or is being replaced by Lessee pursuant to
Section 10(a), such payments shall be paid over to, or retained by,
Lessor and upon completion of such replacement be paid over to, or
retained by, Lessee;

(ii) if such payments are received with respect to the Airframe
or the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on the Airframe
that has not been and will not be replaced pursuant to Section 10(a),
such payments shall, after reimbursement of Lessor for costs and
expenses, be applied in reduction of Lessee's obligation to pay the
Stipulated Loss Value required to be paid by Lessee pursuant to
Section 10(a), if not already paid by Lessee, or, if already paid by
Lessee, shall be applied to reimburse Lessee for its payment of such
Stipulated Loss Value, and the balance, if any, of

54
<PAGE> 60
such payments remaining thereafter shall be paid over to, and retained
by, Lessee and Lessor, as their interests may appear; and

(iii) if such payments are received with respect to an Engine
under circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b), so much of such
payments remaining after reimbursement of Lessor for costs and
expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee; provided that
Lessee shall have fully performed the terms of Section 10(b) with
respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

(d) Requisition for Use by the Government of the Airframe and
the Engines Installed Thereon. In the event of the requisition for use by any
Government or by the government of the country of registry of the Aircraft
(including for this purpose any agency or instrumentality thereof), including,
without limitation, pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program referred to
in Section 7(b)(iv), of the Airframe and the Engines or engines installed on
the Airframe during the Term, Lessee shall promptly notify Lessor of such
requisition and all of Lessee's obligations under this Lease with respect to
the Aircraft shall continue to the same extent as if such requisition had not
occurred. All payments received by Lessor or Lessee from such Government or
government for the use of the Airframe and Engines or engines during the Term
for the Aircraft shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee. In the case of
any requisition for use by the government of the United States (or any agency
or instrumentality thereof whose obligations bear the full faith and credit of
such government) of the Airframe and Engines or engines installed on the
Airframe that would extend beyond the end of the Term, Lessee at its option
may, by written notice to Lessor given not more than 30 nor less than 10 days
before the end of the Term, elect to declare an Event of Loss with respect to
the Airframe and Engines or engines. Such Event of Loss will be deemed to have
occurred on the final day of the Term. If Lessee does not so elect to declare
an Event of Loss and (1) such requisition fully terminates and (2) the Airframe
and Engines or engines are returned to Lessee before the first anniversary of
the end of the Term, Lessee shall be obligated to return the Airframe and the
Engines or engines to Lessor pursuant to, and in all other respects to comply
with the provisions of, Section 5 as soon as practicable after the Airframe and
Engines or engines are returned to Lessee unless Lessee shall have exercised
its

55
<PAGE> 61
option to purchase the Aircraft pursuant to Sections 9(e), 20(b) or 20(c). In
addition, Lessee shall pay to Lessor at monthly intervals (until the earlier of
(i) the return of the Aircraft to Lessor pursuant to Section 5 and (ii) the
first anniversary of the end of the Term), an amount equal to the difference,
if any, between (A) the daily equivalent of the lesser of (x) 50% of the
average annual Basic Rent for the Aircraft payable during the Term (excluding
for this purpose the Interim Period) and (y) the fair market rental value of
the Aircraft for such period, and (B) the amounts received by Lessor from such
government for the use of the Aircraft for such period. All payments received
by Lessor or Lessee from such government for the use of such Airframe and
Engines or engines during the first year after the end of the Term for the
Aircraft shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessor unless Lessee shall have
exercised its option to purchase the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(e), 20(b)
or 20(c), in which event all such payments received after such purchase shall
be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee.

(e) Requisition for Use by the Government of an Engine. In
the event of the requisition for use by any Government or by the government of
the country of registry of the Aircraft (including for this purpose any agency
or instrumentality thereof) of any Engine (but not the Airframe), Lessee will
replace such Engine hereunder by complying with the terms of Section 10(b) to
the same extent as if an Event of Loss had occurred with respect to such
Engine, and any payments received by Lessor or Lessee from such Government or
government with respect to such requisition shall be paid over to, or retained
by, Lessee.

(f) Application of Payments During Existence of Event of
Default. Any amount referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 10(c),
Section 10(d) or Section 10(e) which is payable to Lessee shall not be paid to
Lessee, or if it has been previously paid directly to Lessee, shall not be
retained by Lessee, if at the time of such payment an Event of Default (or
event that with lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under
Section 14(a), 14(g), 14(h) or 14(i)) shall have occurred and be continuing,
but shall be paid to and held by the Lessor as security for the obligations of
Lessee under this Lease, and at such time as there shall not be continuing any
such Event of Default or event, such amount shall be paid to Lessee, provided
that if any such amount has been so held by Lessor as security for more than 90
days after an Event of

56
<PAGE> 62
Default shall have occurred and during which period (i) Lessor shall not have
been limited by operation of law or otherwise from exercising remedies
hereunder or (ii) Lessor shall not have commenced to exercise any remedy
available to it under Section 15, then such amount shall be paid to Lessee.

Section 11. Insurance. (a) Public Liability and Property
Damage Insurance. Subject to the rights of Lessee to establish and maintain
self-insurance with respect to public liability and property damage liability
insurance for aircraft and engines (including the Aircraft and Engines) in the
manner and to the extent specified in the next sentence, Lessee will carry, or
cause to be carried, at no expense to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or the
Owner Participant, public liability (including, without limitation, contractual
liability and passenger legal liability) and property damage liability
insurance (exclusive of manufacturer's product liability insurance) with
respect to the Aircraft (i) in amounts which are not less than the public
liability and property damage insurance applicable to similar aircraft and
engines which comprise Lessee's fleet on which Lessee carries insurance,
provided that such liability insurance shall not be less than the amount
certified to Lessor on the Delivery Date, (ii) of the type usually carried by
corporations engaged in the same or similar business, similarly situated with
Lessee, and owning or operating similar aircraft and engines and covering risks
of the kind customarily insured against by Lessee, and (iii) which is
maintained in effect with insurers of recognized responsibility. Lessee may
self-insure, by way of deductible or premium adjustment provisions in insurance
policies, the risks required to be insured against pursuant to the preceding
sentence, but in no case shall the self-insurance (including the self-insurance
permitted by Section 11(b)) with respect to all of the aircraft and engines in
Lessee's fleet (including, without limitation, the Aircraft) exceed for any
12-month policy year the lesser of (x) 50% of the largest replacement value of
any single aircraft in Lessee's fleet or (y) 1-1/2% of the average aggregate
insurable value (for the preceding year) of all aircraft (including, without
limitation, the Aircraft) on which Lessee carries insurance; provided that, in
the event that there shall have occurred a material adverse change in the
financial condition of Lessee from such condition as is reflected in the
consolidated financial statements of Lessee at December 31, 1982, then, upon
not less than 30 days' written notice from Lessor to Lessee, Lessee will, until

57
<PAGE> 63
Lessee's financial condition is on an overall basis equivalent to its financial
condition at December 31, 1982, reduce the self-insurance permitted hereunder
to such reasonable amount as Lessor may require; provided, further, that a
deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce handling that, in the case of the
Aircraft, is not in excess of the amount customarily allowed as a deductible in
the industry, shall be permitted in addition to the above-mentioned
self-insurance. Any policies of insurance carried in accordance with this
Section 11(a) and any policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any
of such policies (A) shall name Lessor, as lessor of the Aircraft and in its
individual capacity, the Indenture Trustee and each Participant as additional
insureds as their respective Interests may appear (and, so long as the Owner
Participant is a direct or indirect subsidiary of American Telephone and
Telegraph Company, shall name AT&T Capital Corporation and American Telephone
and Telegraph Company as additional insureds), (B) shall provide that in
respect of the respective interests of Lessor, of the Indenture Trustee and of
each Participant in such policies the insurance shall not be invalidated by any
action or inaction of Lessee and shall insure Lessor's, the Indenture Trustee's
and such Participant's Interests as they appear, regardless of any breach or
violation of any warranty, declaration or condition contained in such policies
by Lessee, (C) shall provide that, if such insurance is cancelled for any
reason whatever, or any substantial change is made in the policy which affects
the coverage certified hereunder to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any
Participant, or if such insurance is allowed to lapse for nonpayment of
premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be effective as to
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or such Participant for 30 days (seven days, or
such other period as is customarily obtainable in the industry, in the case of
any war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt by Lessor, by the
Indenture Trustee or by such Participant, respectively, of written notice from
such insurers of such cancellation, change or lapse, (D) shall provide that
neither Lessor, the Indenture Trustee nor any Participant shall have any
obligation or liability for premiums, commissions, assessments or calls in
connection with such insurance, (E) shall provide that the insurers shall waive
(i) any rights of set-off, counterclaim or any other deduction, whether by
attachment or otherwise, which they may have against Lessor, the Indenture
Trustee or any Participant and (ii) any rights of subrogation against Lessor,
the Indenture Trustee or any Participant to the extent that Lessee has

58
<PAGE> 64
waived its rights by its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to
this Lease or the Participation Agreement; provided that the exercise by such
insurers of rights of subrogation derived from the rights retained by Lessee
shall not, in any way, delay payment of any claim that would otherwise be
payable by such insurers but for the existence of rights of subrogation derived
from rights retained by Lessee, (F) shall be primary without right of
contribution from any other insurance which may be carried by Lessor, the
Indenture Trustee or any Participant with respect to its Interests as such in
the Aircraft and (G) shall expressly provide that all of the provisions
thereof, except the limits of liability, shall operate in the same manner as if
there were a separate policy covering each insured. "Interests" as used in
this Section 11(a) and Section 11(b) with respect to any Person means the
interests of such Person in its capacity as Lessor, Owner Trustee (including in
its individual capacity under the Participation Agreement), Indenture Trustee
or Participant, as the case may be, in the leasing transaction contemplated by
this Lease, the Participation Agreement and the Indenture. Lessee shall
arrange for appropriate certification that the requirements of this Section
11(a) have been met to be made to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Participant (and the Indenture Trustee may furnish such certificates to each
Loan Participant) as soon as practicable by each insurer or its authorized
representative with respect thereto, provided that all information contained
therein shall be held confidential by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and each
Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other
than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and
any Person with whom any Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations
relating to the possible transfer and sale of such Participant's Certificates
or interest in the Aircraft, as the case may be, if such Person shall have
entered into an agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(a)
whereby such Person agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as
may be required by an order of any court or administrative agency or by any
statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. In the case
of a sublease or contract with any Government in respect of the Aircraft or any
Engine, or in the case of any requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine
by any Government, a valid agreement, reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and the
Owner Participant, to indemnify Lessee against any of the risks which Lessee is
required hereunder to insure against by such Government shall be considered

59
<PAGE> 65
adequate insurance to the extent of the risks and in the amounts that are the
subject of any such agreement to indemnify.

(b) Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Aircraft. Subject to
the rights of Lessee to establish and maintain self-insurance with respect to
loss or damage to aircraft (including the Aircraft) in the manner and to the
extent specified in the next sentence, Lessee shall maintain, or cause to be
maintained, in effect with insurers of recognized responsibility, at no expense
to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant, all-risk aircraft hull
insurance covering the Aircraft and all-risk coverage with respect to any
Engines or Parts while removed from the Aircraft (including, without
limitation, war risk and allied perils insurance if and to the extent the same
is maintained by Lessee or any Permitted Air Carrier subleasing the same with
respect to other aircraft owned or operated by Lessee or such Permitted Air
Carrier, as the case may be, on the same routes) which is of the type and in
substantially the amount usually carried by corporations engaged in the same or
similar business and similarly situated with Lessee; provided that (i) such
insurance (including the permitted self-insurance) shall at all times while the
Aircraft is subject to this Lease be for an amount not less than the Stipulated
Loss Value for the Aircraft from time to time and (ii) such insurance need not
cover an Engine while attached to an airframe not owned, leased or operated by
Lessee. Lessee may self-insure, by way of deductible or premium adjustment
provisions in insurance policies, the risks required to be insured against
pursuant to the preceding sentence, but in no case shall the self-insurance
(including the self-insurance permitted by Section 11(a)) with respect to all
of the aircraft and engines in Lessee's fleet (including, without limitation,
the Aircraft) exceed for any 12-month policy year the lesser of (i) 50% of the
largest replacement value of any single aircraft in Lessee's fleet or (ii)
1-1/2% of the average aggregate insurable value (for the preceding year) of all
aircraft (including, without limitation, the Aircraft) on which Lessee carries
insurance; provided that, in the event that there shall have occurred a
material adverse change in the financial condition of Lessee from such
condition as is reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Lessee at
December 31, 1982, then, upon not less than 30 days' written notice from Lessor
to Lessee, Lessee will, until Lessee's financial condition is on an overall
basis equivalent to its financial condition at December 31, 1982, reduce the
self-insurance permitted

60
<PAGE> 66
hereunder to such reasonable amount as Lessor may require; provided, further,
that a deductible per occurrence utilized to reduce handling that, in the case
of the Aircraft, is not in excess of the amount customarily allowed as a
deductible in the industry, shall be permitted in addition to the
above-mentioned self-insurance. Any policies carried in accordance with this
Section 11(b) and any policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any
such policies (A) shall provide that any loss up to the amount of Stipulated
Loss Value for any loss or damage constituting an Event of Loss with respect to
the Aircraft, and any loss in excess of $7,000,000, up to the amount of
Stipulated Loss Value, for any loss or damage to the Aircraft (or Engines) not
constituting an Event of Loss with respect to the Aircraft, shall be paid to
the Indenture Trustee as long as the Trust Indenture shall not have been
discharged pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof, and thereafter to
Lessor, unless, in each case, the insurer shall have received notice that an
Event of Default exists, in which case all insurance proceeds up to Stipulated
Loss Value shall be payable to the Indenture Trustee or Lessor, as the case may
be, (B) shall provide that in respect of the respective interests of Lessor, of
the Indenture Trustee and of each Participant in such policies the insurance
shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction of Lessee and shall insure
Lessor's, the Indenture Trustee's and such Participant's Interests, as they
appear, regardless of any breach or violation of any warranty, declaration or
condition contained in such policies by Lessee, (C) shall provide that, if such
insurance is cancelled for any reason whatever, or any material change is made
in the policy which affects the coverage certified hereunder to Lessor, the
Indenture Trustee or any Participant, or if such insurance is allowed to lapse
for nonpayment of premium, such cancellation, change or lapse shall not be
effective as to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or such Participant for 30 days
(seven days, or such other period as may from time to time be customarily
obtainable in the industry, in the case of any war risk and allied perils
coverage) after receipt by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or such Participant,
respectively, of written notice from such insurers of such cancellation, change
or lapse, (D) shall be primary without right of contribution from any other
insurance which may be carried by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any
Participant with respect to its Interests as such in the Aircraft and (E) shall
provide that the insurers shall waive (i) any rights of set-off, counterclaim
or any other deduction, whether by attachment or otherwise, which they may have
against Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any

61
<PAGE> 67
Participant and (ii) any rights of subrogation against Lessor, the Indenture
Trustee and any Participant to the extent that Lessee has waived its rights by
its agreements to indemnify any such party pursuant to this Lease or the
Participation Agreement; provided that the exercise by such insurers of rights
of subrogation derived from rights retained by Lessee shall not, in any way,
delay payment of any claim that would otherwise be payable by such insurers but
for the existence of rights of subrogation derived from rights retained by
Lessee. Lessee shall arrange for appropriate certification that the
requirements of this Section 11(b) have been met to be made promptly to Lessor,
the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant (and the Indenture Trustee
shall furnish such certification to each Loan Participant) by each insurer or
its authorized representative with respect thereto, provided that all
information contained therein shall be held confidential by Lessor, the
Indenture Trustee and each Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed
by them to anyone other than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants,
agents and legal counsel and any Person with whom any Participant is in good
faith conducting negotiations relating to the possible transfer and sale of
such Participant's Certificates or interest in the Aircraft, as the case may
be, if such Person shall have entered into an agreement similar to that
contained in this Section 11(b) whereby such Person agrees to hold such
information confidential, and except as may be required by an order of any
court or administrative agency or by any statute, rule, regulation or order of
any governmental authority. In the case of a sublease or contract with any
Government in respect of the Aircraft or any Engine, or in the case of any
requisition for use of the Aircraft or any Engine by any Government, a valid
agreement, reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and the Owner Participant, to
indemnify Lessee against any of the risks which Lessee is required hereunder to
insure against by such Government in any amount up to the Stipulated Loss Value
of the Aircraft from time to time shall be considered adequate insurance to the
extent of the risks and in the amounts that are the subject of any such
agreement to indemnify.

As between Lessor and Lessee it is agreed that all insurance
payments received under policies required to be maintained by Lessee hereunder,
exclusive of any payments received in excess of the Stipulated Loss Value for
the Aircraft from such policies, as the result of the occurrence of an Event of
Loss with respect to the Airframe or an Engine will be applied as follows:

62
<PAGE> 68
(x) if such payments are received with respect to the
Airframe or the Airframe and any Engines or engines installed on the
Airframe that has been or is being replaced by Lessee as contemplated
by Section 10(a), such payments shall be paid over to, or retained by,
Lessor, and upon completion of such replacement be paid over to, or
retained by, Lessee;

(y) if such payments are received with respect to the Airframe
or the Airframe and any Engines or engines installed thereon that has
not been and will not be replaced as contemplated by Section 10(a), so
much of such payments remaining after reimbursement of Lessor for
costs and expenses as shall not exceed the Stipulated Loss Value
required to be paid by Lessee pursuant to Section 10(a) shall be
applied in reduction of Lessee's obligation to pay such Stipulated
Loss Value, if not already paid by Lessee, or, if already paid by
Lessee, shall be applied to reimburse Lessee for its payment of such
Stipulated Loss Value, and the balance, if any, of such payment
remaining thereafter will be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee; and

(z) if such payments are received with respect to an Engine
under the circumstances contemplated by Section 10(b), so much of such
payments remaining after reimbursement of Lessor for costs and
expenses shall be paid over to, or retained by, Lessee; provided that
Lessee shall have fully performed the terms of Section 10(b) with
respect to the Event of Loss for which such payments are made.

As between Lessor and Lessee the insurance payment of any
property damage loss in excess of the Stipulated Loss Value for the Aircraft
shall be paid to Lessee.

As between Lessor and Lessee the insurance payments of any
property damage loss not constituting an Event of Loss with respect to the
Airframe or an Engine will be applied in payment (or to reimburse Lessee) for
repairs or for replacement property in accordance with the terms of Sections 7
and 8, and any balance remaining after compliance with such Sections with
respect to such loss shall be paid to Lessee. Any amount referred to in the
preceding sentence or in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the second preceding
paragraph which is payable to Lessee shall not be paid to Lessee or, if it has
been previously paid directly to Lessee, shall not be retained by Lessee, if at

63
<PAGE> 69
the time of such payment an Event of Default (or event that with lapse of time
would constitute an Event of Default under Section 14(a), 14(g), 14(h) or
14(i)) shall have occurred and be continuing, but shall be paid to and held by
Lessor, as security for the obligations of Lessee under this Lease, and at such
time as there shall not be continuing any such Event of Default or event, such
amount shall be paid to Lessee, provided that if any such amount has been so
held by Lessor as security for more than 90 days after an Event of Default
shall have occurred and during which period (i) Lessor shall not have been
limited by operation of law or otherwise from exercising remedies hereunder and
(ii) Lessor shall not have exercised any remedy available to it under Section
15, then such amount shall be paid to Lessee.

(c) Reports, Etc. On or before the Delivery Date, and
annually upon renewal of Lessee's insurance coverage, Lessee will furnish to
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant (and the Indenture
Trustee shall furnish to each Loan Participant) a report signed by a firm of
independent aircraft insurance brokers appointed by Lessee, stating the opinion
of such firm that the insurance then carried and maintained on the Aircraft
complies with the terms hereof; provided that all information contained in such
report shall be held confidential by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and each
Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other
than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and
any Person with whom any Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations
relating to the possible transfer and sale of such Participant's Certificates
or interest in the Aircraft, as the case may be, if such Person shall have
entered into an agreement similar to that contained in this Section 11(c)
whereby such Person agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as
may be required by an order of any court or administrative agency or by any
statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. Lessee will
cause such firm to advise Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Participant, in writing promptly of any default in the payment of any premium
and of any other act or omission on the part of Lessee of which such firm has
knowledge and which might invalidate or render unenforceable, in whole or in
part, any insurance on the Aircraft. Lessee will also cause such firm to
advise Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant, in writing as
promptly as practicable after such firm acquires knowledge that an interruption
or

64
<PAGE> 70
reduction of any insurance carried and maintained on the Aircraft pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 11 will occur.

(d) Insurance for Own Account. Nothing in this Section 11
shall limit or prohibit the Owner Participant (either directly or in the name
of the Owner Trustee) or Lessee from obtaining insurance for its own account
with respect to the Airframe or any Engine and any proceeds payable thereunder
shall be payable as provided in the insurance policy relating thereto, provided
that (i) no such insurance may be obtained which would limit or otherwise
adversely affect the coverage or amounts payable under insurance required to be
maintained pursuant to this Section 11, it being understood that all salvage
rights to the Airframe or such Engine shall remain with Lessee's insurers at
all times, and (ii) the Owner Participant may obtain hull insurance on the
Aircraft only to the extent the procurement of such insurance does not have an
adverse effect on Lessee's ability or cost to obtain such insurance, except
that the limitation in the foregoing clause (i) on the Owner Participant's
right to obtain liability insurance shall not apply during any period in which
Lessee is providing a Government indemnity in lieu of the liability insurance
required by Section 11(a) and the limitations in clauses (i) and (ii) on the
Owner Participant's rights to obtain hull insurance shall not apply during any
period in which Lessee is providing a Government indemnity in lieu of the hull
insurance required by Section 11(b).

Section 12. Inspection. At all reasonable times during the
Term, but upon at least 5 days' prior written notice to Lessee, Lessor or the
Indenture Trustee or any of their respective authorized representatives may at
their own expense and risk conduct a visual walk-around inspection of the
Aircraft and any Engine (including a visual walk-around inspection of the
Aircraft during any regularly scheduled heavy maintenance visit for the
Aircraft conducted by Lessee during the Term) and may inspect the books and
records of Lessee relating thereto; provided that (a) such representatives
shall be fully insured to the reasonable satisfaction of Lessee by Lessor or
the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, with respect to any risks incurred
in connection with any such inspection, (b) any such inspection shall be
subject to the safety, security and workplace rules applicable at the location
where such inspection is conducted and any applicable governmental rules or
regulations and (c) in the case of an inspection during a

65
<PAGE> 71
maintenance visit, such inspection shall not in any respect interfere with the
normal conduct of such maintenance visit or extend the time required for such
maintenance visit. All information obtained in connection with any such
inspection shall be held confidential by Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and each
Participant and shall not be furnished or disclosed by them to anyone other
than their bank examiners, auditors, accountants, agents and legal counsel and
any Person with whom any Participant is in good faith conducting negotiations
relating to the possible transfer and sale of such Participant's Certificates
or interest in the Aircraft, as the case may be, if such Person shall have
entered into an agreement similar to that contained in this Section 12 whereby
such Person agrees to hold such information confidential, and except as may be
required by an order of any court or administrative agency or by any statute,
rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. Lessee will, upon the
request of Lessor or the Indenture Trustee at any time, notify Lessor or the
Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, of the time and location of the next
scheduled heavy maintenance visit to be conducted by Lessee in respect of the
Aircraft during the Term; provided that Lessee shall have the right in its sole
discretion to reschedule, or change the location of, any maintenance visit of
which it shall have notified Lessor or the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this
sentence, Lessee hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts to notify Lessor or
the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, of any such rescheduling or change.
None of Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant shall have any duty to
make any such inspection and shall not incur any liability or obligation by
reason of not making any such inspection. No inspection pursuant to this
Section 12 shall relieve Lessee of any of its obligations under this Lease. No
inspection pursuant to this Section 12 shall interfere with the use, operation
or maintenance of the Aircraft or the normal conduct of Lessee's business, and
Lessee shall not be required to undertake or incur any additional liabilities
in connection therewith.

Section 13. Assignment, Citizenship, Etc. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 7(b) or in the case of any requisition for use by
any Government referred to in Section 7(a), Lessee will not, without the prior
written consent of Lessor, assign any of its rights hereunder, except as
permitted by Section 13 of the Participation Agreement. Except as elsewhere
herein provided or as expressly permitted by the provisions of the
Participation Agreement, Lessor agrees that it will not assign or convey

66
<PAGE> 72
its right, title and interest in and to this Lease or the Aircraft; provided,
however, that, in each case where so provided or permitted, the transferee
shall be domiciled in the United States, shall be a "citizen of the United
States" within the meaning of Section 101(16) of the Federal Aviation Act and
shall assume all of the obligations of Lessor under this Lease. The terms and
provisions of this Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
Lessor and Lessee and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

Section 14. Events of Default. The following events shall
constitute Events of Default (whether any such event shall be voluntary or
involuntary or come about or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to or
in compliance with any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order,
rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body) and each such
Event of Default shall be deemed to exist and continue so long as, but only as
long as, it shall not have been remedied:

(a) Lessee shall fail to make any payment of Basic Rent,
Stipulated Loss Value or Termination Value within 15 days after the
same shall have become due or of any other amount of Supplemental Rent
within 15 days after written notice of such failure by Lessor; or

(b) Lessee shall fail to carry and maintain insurance on or
with respect to the Aircraft in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11; provided that, in the case of insurance with respect to
which cancellation, change or lapse for nonpayment of premium shall
not be effective as to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner
Participant for 30 days (seven days, or such other period as may from
time to time be customarily obtainable in the industry, in the case of
any war risk and allied perils coverage) after receipt of notice by
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Participant of such
cancellation, change or lapse, no such failure to carry and maintain
insurance shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder until the
earlier of (i) the date such failure shall have continued unremedied
for a period of 20 days (five days in the case of any war risk and
allied perils coverage) after receipt by Lessor of the notice of
cancellation, change or lapse referred to in Section 11(a)(C) or
11(b)(C), or (ii) such insurance not being in effect as

67
<PAGE> 73
to any of Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant; or

(c) Lessee shall operate the Aircraft at a time when public
liability insurance required by Section 11(a) shall not be in effect;
or

(d) Lessee shall fail to perform or observe any other
covenant, condition or agreement to be performed or observed by it
hereunder or under the Participation Agreement, any Lease Supplement,
the Bills of Sale or the Purchase Agreement Assignment, and such
failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days after
written notice thereof by Lessor; provided that, if such failure is
capable of being remedied, so long as Lessee is diligently proceeding
to remedy such failure, no such failure shall constitute an Event of
Default hereunder for a period of up to 365 days; or

(e) any material representation or warranty made by Lessee in
this Lease or in the Participation Agreement, any Lease Supplement,
the Bills of Sale or the Purchase Agreement Assignment shall prove to
have been incorrect in any material respect at the time made, and such
incorrectness shall continue to be material and unremedied for a
period of 30 days after written notice thereof by Lessor; or

(f) Lessee shall consent to the appointment of a receiver,
trustee or liquidator of itself or of a substantial part of its
property, or Lessee shall admit in writing its inability to pay its
debts generally as they come due, or shall make a general assignment
for the benefit of creditors; or

(g) Lessee shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or a
voluntary petition or an answer seeking reorganization in a proceeding
under any bankruptcy laws (as now or hereafter in effect) or an answer
admitting the material allegations of a petition filed against Lessee
in any such proceeding, or Lessee shall by voluntary petition, answer
or consent seek relief under the provisions of any other now existing
or future bankruptcy or other similar law providing for the
reorganization or winding-up of corporations, or providing for an
agreement, composition, extension or adjustment with its creditors; or

68
<PAGE> 74
(h) an order, judgment or decree shall be entered by any
court of competent jurisdiction appointing, without the consent of
Lessee, a receiver, trustee or liquidator of Lessee or of any
substantial part of its property, or sequestering any substantial part
of the property of Lessee, and any such order, judgment, or decree of
appointment or sequestration shall remain in force undismissed,
unstayed or unvacated for a period of 90 days after the date of entry
thereof; or

(i) a petition against Lessee in a proceeding under the
Federal bankruptcy laws or other insolvency laws, as now or hereafter
in effect, shall be filed and shall not be withdrawn or dismissed
within 90 days thereafter, or, under the provisions of any law
providing for reorganization or winding-up of corporations which may
apply to Lessee, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume
jurisdiction, custody or control of Lessee or of any substantial part
of its property and such jurisdiction, custody or control shall remain
in force unrelinquished, unstayed or unterminated for a period of 90
days;

provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Lease, any failure of Lessee to perform or observe any covenant, condition, or
agreement herein shall not constitute an Event of Default if such failure is
caused solely by reason of an event referred to in the definition of "Event of
Loss" so long as Lessee is continuing to comply with the applicable terms of
Section 10.

Section 15. Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default and at any time thereafter so long as the same shall be continuing,
Lessor may, at its option, declare this Lease to be in default by a written
notice to Lessee (provided that this Lease shall be deemed to have been
declared in default without the necessity of such written notice upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default described in paragraph (g), (h) or (i) of
Section 14 hereof); and at any time thereafter, so long as Lessee shall not
have remedied all outstanding Events of Default, Lessor may do one or more of
the following with respect to all or any part of the Airframe and any Engines
as Lessor in its sole discretion shall elect, to the extent permitted by, and
subject to compliance with any mandatory requirements of, applicable law then
in effect; provided that during any period when the Aircraft is subject to the
Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program in accordance with the provisions of Sec-

69
<PAGE> 75
tion 7(b) and in the possession of the United States government or an
instrumentality or agency thereof, Lessor shall not, on account of any Event of
Default, be entitled to do any of the following in such manner as to limit
Lessee's control under this Lease (or any sublessee's control under any
sublease permitted by the terms of this Lease) of any Airframe or any Engines,
unless at least 60 days' (or such lesser period as may then be applicable under
the Military Airlift Command Program of the United States Government) prior
written notice of default hereunder shall have been given by Lessor by
registered or certified mail to Lessee (or any sublessee) with a copy addressed
to the Contracting Office Representative for the Military Airlift Command of
the United States Air Force under any contract with Lessee (or any sublessee)
relating to the Aircraft:

(a) cause Lessee, upon the written demand of Lessor and at
Lessee's expense, to return promptly, and Lessee shall return
promptly, all or such part of the Airframe or any Engine as Lessor may
so demand to Lessor or its order in the manner and condition required
by, and otherwise in accordance with all the provisions of, Section 5,
as if the Airframe or such Engine were being returned at the end of
the Term, or Lessor, at its option, may enter upon the premises where
all or any part of the Airframe or any Engine are located and take
immediate possession of and remove the same (together with any engine
which is not an Engine but which is installed on the Airframe, subject
to all of the rights of the owner, lessor, lienor or secured party of
such engine; provided that the Airframe with an engine (which is not an
Engine) installed thereon may be flown or returned only to a location
within the continental United States, and such engine shall be held
for the account of any such owner, lessor, lienor or secured party or,
if owned by Lessee, may, at the option of Lessor, be exchanged with
Lessee for an Engine in accordance with the provisions of Section
5(b)) by summary proceedings or otherwise, all without liability
accruing to Lessor for or by reason of such entry or taking of
possession or removal, whether for the restoration of damage to
property caused by such taking or otherwise;

(b) sell all or any part of the Airframe and any Engine at
public or private sale, whether or not Lessor shall at the time have
possession thereof, as Lessor may determine, or otherwise dispose of,
hold, use,

70
<PAGE> 76
operate, lease to others or keep idle all or any part of the Airframe
or such Engine as Lessor, in its sole discretion, may determine, all
free and clear of any rights of Lessee except as hereinafter set forth
in this Section 15 and without any duty to account to Lessee with
respect to such action or inaction or for any proceeds with respect
thereto, except to the extent required by paragraph (d) below if
Lessor elects to exercise its rights under such paragraph (d) in lieu
of its rights under paragraph (c) below;

(c) whether or not Lessor shall have exercised, or shall
thereafter at any time exercise, any of its rights under paragraph (a)
or paragraph (b) above with respect to all or any part of the Airframe
or any Engine, Lessor, by written notice to Lessee specifying a
payment date (which date shall be deemed to be a "Termination Date"
for purposes of computing Termination Value) which shall be not
earlier than 30 days from the date of such notice, may demand that
Lessee pay to Lessor, and Lessee shall pay Lessor, on the payment date
specified in such notice, as liquidated damages for loss of a bargain
and not as a penalty (in lieu of the Basic Rent due for Lease Periods
commencing on or after the Lease Period Date next preceding the
payment date specified in such notice), if the Termination Date is a
Lease Period Date, the Basic Rent installment due and payable on that
date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it being understood and agreed that
Lessee shall not be required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic
Rent installment designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as
being payable in advance) or, if the Termination Date is not a Lease
Period Date and if Basic Rent is payable in arrears during the Lease
Period commencing on the Lease Period Date next preceding the
Termination Date, an amount equal to the Accrued Arrears Basic Rent
for the period from and including such Lease Period Date to but
excluding the Termination Date, less any credit to which Lessee shall
be entitled as hereinafter in this Section 15(c) provided, plus
whichever of the following amounts Lessor, in its sole discretion,
shall specify in such notice: (i) an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of the Termination Value for the Airframe or such Engine or part
thereof, computed as of the payment date specified in such notice,
over the aggregate fair market rental value (computed as hereafter
provided in this Section 15) of the Airframe or such Engine or part

71
<PAGE> 77
thereof for the remainder of the Term, after discounting such
aggregate fair market rental value semiannually (effective on the
Lease Period Dates) to present worth as of the payment date specified
in such notice at the Assumed Debt Rate; or (ii) an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of the Termination Value for the Airframe or such
Engine or part thereof computed as of the payment date specified in
such notice, over the fair market sales value (computed as hereafter
provided in this Section 15) of the Airframe or such Engine or part
thereof as of the payment date specified in such notice; provided that
if the Termination Date is not a Lease Period Date and if any portion
of the Basic Rent installment paid in respect of the Lease Period
commencing on the Lease Period Date next preceding the Termination
Date is designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as having been
payable in advance, Lessee shall, if and so long as it shall have paid
in full all Rent otherwise payable by it hereunder or pursuant hereto,
be entitled to a credit against the amounts payable by it pursuant to
this Section 15(c) in an amount equal to the lesser of the Unearned
Advance Basic Rent as of the Termination Date and the amount, if any,
by which such aggregate fair market rental value or such fair market
sales value, as the case may be, exceeds such Termination Value; and
provided, further, that in the event that the amount calculated
pursuant to this sentence to be credited exceeds the amount payable by
Lessee pursuant to this Section 15(c) and any other amounts payable by
Lessee hereunder as a result of the applicable Event of Default or the
exercise of Lessor's remedies with respect thereto, the Owner
Participant will be obligated to rebate an amount equal to such excess
to Lessee;

(d) in the event Lessor, pursuant to paragraph (b) above,
shall have sold all or any part of the Airframe or any Engine, Lessor,
in lieu of exercising its rights under paragraph (c) above with
respect to the Airframe or such Engine or part thereof, may, if it
shall so elect, demand that Lessee pay Lessor, and Lessee shall pay to
Lessor, on the date of such sale (which date shall be deemed a
"Termination Date" for purposes of computing Termination Value), as
liquidated damages for loss of a bargain and not as a penalty (in lieu
of the Basic Rent due for Lease Periods commencing on or after the
Lease Period Date next preceding the

72
<PAGE> 78
date of such sale), if the Termination Date is a Lease Period Date,
the Basic Rent installment due and payable on that date pursuant to
Section 3(b) (it being understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be
required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment
designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in
advance) or, if the Termination Date is not a Lease Period Date and if
Basic Rent is payable in arrears during the Lease Period commencing on
the Lease Period Date next preceding the Termination Date, an amount
equal to the Accrued Arrears Basic Rent for the period from and
including such Lease Period Date to but excluding the Termination
Date, less any credit to which Lessee shall be entitled as hereinafter
in this Section 15(d) provided, plus the amount of any deficiency
between the net proceeds of such sale and the Termination Value for
the Airframe or such Engine or part thereof, computed as of the date
of such sale; provided that if the Termination Date is not a Lease
Period Date and if any portion of the Basic Rent installment paid in
respect of the Lease Period commencing on the Lease Period Date next
preceding the Termination Date is designated in Exhibit A-1 to the
Rent Schedule as having been payable in advance, Lessee shall, if and
so long as it shall have paid in full all Rent otherwise payable by it
hereunder or pursuant hereto, be entitled to a credit against the
amounts payable by it pursuant to this Section 15(d) in an amount
equal to the lesser of the Unearned Advance Basic Rent as of the
Termination Date and the amount, if any, by which such net proceeds of
such sale exceed such Termination Value; and provided, further, that in
the event that the amount calculated pursuant to this sentence to be
credited exceeds the amount payable by Lessee pursuant to this Section
15(d) and any other amounts payable by Lessee hereunder as a result of
the applicable Event of Default or the exercise of Lessor's remedies
with respect thereto, the Owner Participant will be obligated to
rebate an amount equal to such excess to Lessee; and

(e) Lessor may rescind this Lease as to the Airframe and any
or all Engines, or may exercise any other right or remedy which may be
available to it under applicable law or proceed by appropriate court
action to enforce the terms or to recover damages for the breach
hereof.

73

<PAGE> 79
In addition, Lessee shall be liable, except as otherwise
provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) above and without limiting the effect of the
penultimate sentence of Section 3(c), without duplication of any amounts
payable hereunder, for any and all unpaid Rent due hereunder before, after or
during the exercise of any of the foregoing remedies and for all legal fees and
other costs and expenses incurred by reason of the occurrence of any Event of
Default or the exercise of Lessor's remedies with respect thereto, including
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the retaking or return of
the Airframe or any Engine in accordance with the terms of Section 5 or in
placing such Airframe or Engine in the condition and airworthiness required by
such Section; provided that, if Lessee returns or surrenders possession of all
or any part of the Airframe or any Engine in accordance with this Section 15
and Lessor does not within 365 days after the date of such return or surrender
exercise its rights under paragraph (c) or (d) above with respect to such
Airframe or Engine or part thereof, there shall be deducted from each payment
of Basic Rent becoming due after the expiration of such 365-day period an
amount equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate fair market
rental value (computed as hereafter provided in this Section 15) of such
Airframe or Engine or part thereof, for the remainder of the Term after the
expiration of such 365-day period (computed as of the date of such expiration),
by the number of Basic Rent installments remaining with respect to the Aircraft
after the expiration of such 365-day period to the end of the Term; and
provided, further, that Lessor and Lessee agree that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Lease, the Trust Indenture, the Participation
Agreement, the Tax Indemnity Agreement or any other document or instrument
relating hereto or thereto, Lessee shall have no responsibility or liability
for any amounts payable to any Loan Participant in respect of the BREAK AMOUNT,
if any, payable with respect to the Certificates as a result of (x) a purchase
of the Certificates pursuant to Section 2.13 of the Trust Indenture as a result
of an Indenture Default that does not also constitute an Event of Default or
(y) an Indenture Default that does not also constitute an Event of Default.
For purposes of paragraph (c) above and the preceding sentence, the "aggregate
fair market rental value" or the "fair market sales value" of the Airframe or
any Engine or any part thereof shall be as specified in an Independent
Appraisal. At any sale of the Airframe or any Engine or part thereof pursuant
to this Section 15, Lessor or the Owner Participant may bid for and purchase
such

74
<PAGE> 80
property. Except as otherwise expressly provided above, no remedy referred to
in this Section 15 is intended to be exclusive, but each shall be cumulative
and in addition to any other remedy referred to above or otherwise available to
Lessor at law or in equity; and the exercise or beginning of exercise by Lessor
of any one or more of such remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or
later exercise by Lessor of any or all of such other remedies. No express or
implied waiver by Lessor of any Event of Default shall in any way be, or be
construed to be, a waiver of any future or subsequent Event of Default.

Section 16. Single Transaction. Lessor and Lessee agree that
the transactions contemplated by this Lease, the Participation Agreement, the
Tax Indemnity Agreement, the other Operative Documents and the Rent Schedule
are intended to and shall be construed to constitute one transaction.

Section 17. Further Assurances; Financial Information.
Forthwith upon the execution and delivery of each Lease Supplement and Trust
Agreement and Indenture Supplement, Lessee will cause such Lease Supplement and
Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement (and, in the case of the initial Lease
Supplement and Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement with respect to the
Aircraft, this Lease, the Trust Indenture and the Trust Agreement) to be duly
filed and recorded in accordance with the Federal Aviation Act. In addition,
each of Lessor and Lessee will promptly and duly execute and deliver to the
other party hereto such further documents and assurances and take such further
action as such other party may from time to time reasonably request in order
effectively to carry out the intent and purpose of this Lease, including,
without limitation, if requested by Lessor, the execution and delivery of
supplements or amendments hereto or, in the case of Lessor, to the Trust
Indenture, in recordable form, subjecting to this Lease and, in the case of
Lessor, the Trust Indenture any Replacement Airframe or Replacement Engine and
the recording or filing of counterparts hereof or thereof, in accordance with
the laws of such jurisdictions as Lessor may from time to time deem advisable;
provided that this sentence is not intended to impose upon Lessee any
additional liabilities not otherwise contemplated by this Lease and the
Participation Agreement. Lessee also agrees to furnish Lessor, the Owner
Participant and the Indenture Trustee (i) within 60 days after the end of each
of the first three quarterly fiscal periods in each fiscal year of

75
<PAGE> 81
Lessee, a consolidated balance sheet of Lessee and its consolidated
subsidiaries prepared by it as of the close of such period, together with the
related consolidated statements of income and cash flows for such period, (ii)
within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year of Lessee, a consolidated
balance sheet of Lessee and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the close of
such fiscal year, together with the related consolidated statements of income
and cash flows for such fiscal year, as certified by independent public
accountants, (iii) within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year of
Lessee, a certificate of Lessee, signed by a Responsible Officer of Lessee and
addressed to Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Participant, to the
effect that the signer has reviewed the relevant terms of this Lease and the
Participation Agreement and has made, or caused to be made under his
supervision, a review of the transactions and condition of Lessee during the
accounting period covered by the financial statements referred to in clause
(ii) above, and that such review has not disclosed the existence during such
accounting period, nor does the signer have knowledge of the existence as at
the date of such certificate, of any condition or event which constitutes an
Event of Default or which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute an Event of Default, or, if any such condition or event existed or
exists, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof and what action
Lessee has taken or is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto, and
(iv) from time to time such other non-confidential information as Lessor may
reasonably request.

Section 18. Notices. All notices required under the terms
and provisions of this Lease shall be in English and in writing, and any such
notice may be given by United States mail, courier service, telegram, telex,
cable or facsimile (confirmed by telephone or in writing in the case of notice
by telegram, telex, cable or facsimile) or any other customary means of

the discharge of the lien of the Trust Indenture, Lessee shall furnish the
Indenture Trustee directly with a copy of each report, notice, request, demand,
certificate, financial statement or other instrument or document furnished to
Lessor hereunder.

Section 19. No Setoff, Counterclaim, Etc. This Lease is a
net lease and Lessee's obligation to pay all Rent payable hereunder shall,
subject to Section 3(f) and the final sentence of Section 3(c), be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including,
without limitation, (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
right which Lessee may have against Lessor, any Participant, the Indenture
Trustee or anyone else for any reason whatsoever, (ii) any defect in the title,
airworthiness, condition, design, operation or fitness for use of, or any
damage to or loss or destruction of, the Aircraft, or any interruption or
cessation in or prohibition of the use or possession thereof by Lessee for any
reason whatsoever, (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceedings by or against Lessee or any other Person or (iv) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not unforeseen or
similar to any of the foregoing. If for any reason whatsoever this Lease shall
be terminated in whole or in part by operation of law or otherwise, except as
specifically provided herein, Lessee nonetheless agrees, subject to Section
3(f), to pay to Lessor an amount equal to each Basic Rent and Supplemental Rent
payment under Section 3 at the time such payment would have become due and
payable in accordance with the terms hereof had this Lease not been terminated
in whole or in part. Lessee hereby waives, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, any and all rights which it may now have or which at any time
hereafter may be conferred upon it, by statute or otherwise, to terminate,
cancel, quit or surrender this Lease except in accordance with the express
terms hereof. Each payment of Rent made by

77
<PAGE> 83
Lessee shall be final as to Lessor and Lessee, and Lessee will not seek to
recover all or any part of any such payment of Rent from Lessor or from the
Indenture Trustee for any reason whatsoever; provided that nothing in this
sentence shall be construed to modify or limit in any way Lessee's rights under
Section 3(f) and the penultimate sentence of Section 3(c) or its rights to
rebate under Section 9(b), 9(d), 15(c) or 15(d).

Section 20. Renewal Options; Purchase Options. (a) Renewal
Options. Lessee shall have the right to extend this Lease with respect to the
Aircraft for up to five additional periods of one year each (each such period
being hereinafter referred to as a "Renewal Term"), each commencing at the end
of the Term or a Renewal Term. Such option to renew shall be exercised upon
irrevocable written notice from Lessee to Lessor given not less than 120 days
prior to the commencement of the first day of each Renewal Term and if no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such date, then this Lease
shall be extended for the additional period of such Renewal Term on the same
conditions provided for herein, and upon such extension, the word "Term"
whenever used herein shall be deemed to refer, unless the context otherwise
requires, to such Renewal Term; provided that the rental payable during such
Renewal Term shall be at a rental rate equal to (i) in the case of the first
Renewal Term the lesser of (x) the Renewal Term Rate and (y) the fair market
rental value for the Aircraft determined within 90 days after such election by
mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they shall be unable to agree, by
an Independent Appraisal, and (ii) in the case of any Renewal Term thereafter,
the fair market rental value of the Aircraft determined within 90 days after
such election by mutual agreement of Lessor and Lessee or, if they shall be
unable to agree, by an Independent Appraisal; and provided, further, that the
provisions of Section 9 shall not be applicable during any Renewal Term. The
amounts which are payable during any such Renewal Term in respect of
Termination Value as used in Section 15 and Stipulated Loss Value with respect
to the Aircraft shall be determined on the basis of the fair market sales value
of the Aircraft as of the commencement of such Renewal Term, amortized on a
straight-line basis over such Renewal Term to the fair market sales value of
the Aircraft as of the expiration of such Renewal Term, as such fair market
sales value in each case is determined prior to the commencement of such
Renewal Term by mutual agreement of Lessor and

78
<PAGE> 84
Lessee or, if they shall be unable to agree, as determined by an Independent
Appraisal.

(b) Special Purchase Option. On January 10, 2013, or, if
such date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (the
"Special Purchase Option Date"), Lessee shall have the right, at its option, to
purchase the Aircraft. Such option to purchase the Aircraft shall be exercised
irrevocably upon written notice from Lessee to Lessor given not less than 120
days prior to the Special Purchase Option Date. In the event that Lessee shall
have so elected to purchase the Aircraft, on the Special Purchase Option Date,
(x) Lessee shall pay the Basic Rent installment due on the Special Purchase
Option Date (it being understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be required
to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic Rent installment designated in
Exhibit A-1 to the Rent Schedule as being payable in advance), and at its
option shall either (A) pay to Lessor, in funds of the type specified in
Section 3(d), (1) an amount determined by multiplying Lessor's Cost for the
Aircraft by the Special Purchase Price Percentage (the "Special Purchase
Price"), plus (2) all Supplemental Rent (including, without limitation, the
BREAK AMOUNT, if any, on the Certificates) due and owing on such Special
Purchase Option Date, plus (3) all Basic Rent due prior to and unpaid on such
Special Purchase Option Date, or (B) assume all of the rights and obligations
of the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture in respect of the Certificates
(including, without limitation, any scheduled payment of principal of or
accrued interest on the Certificates due and payable on the Special Termination
Date but only to the extent that any Basic Rent installment payable by Lessee
pursuant to clause (x) above does not cover such scheduled payment of principal
or accrued interest on the Certificates and excluding any obligations or
liabilities of the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity incurred on or
prior to the Special Purchase Option Date, which obligations and liabilities
shall remain the sole responsibility of the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity) in accordance with Section 2.16 of the Trust Indenture and
simultaneously shall pay to Lessor, in funds of the type specified in Section
3(d), an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Special Purchase Price over
an amount equal to the sum of the principal of, and any accrued and unpaid
interest on, the outstanding Certificates on such Special Purchase Option Date,
after taking into account any payments of principal or interest made in respect
of the outstanding Certificates on such Special Purchase Option

79
<PAGE> 85
Date, and (y) Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty
(except as to Lessor's Liens), all of Lessor's right, title and interest in and
to the Aircraft and, if Lessee shall not have assumed the rights and
obligations of the Owner Trustee under the Trust Indenture in respect of the
Certificates as provided for above, Lessor will request the Indenture Trustee
to execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate instrument releasing the
Airframe and Engines with respect to which title is transferred from the Lien
of the Trust Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the Purchase
Agreement Assignment from the assignment and pledge thereunder.

(c) Purchase Option. Lessee shall have the right, at its
option, at the expiration of the Term or any Renewal Term, to elect to purchase
the Aircraft at a price equal to the fair market sales value of the Aircraft,
as determined as provided below. Such option to purchase shall be exercised
irrevocably upon written notice from Lessee to Lessor given not less than 120
days prior to the last day of the Term or any Renewal Term, as the case may be.
If Lessee shall have so elected to purchase the Aircraft, Lessor shall transfer
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens) the Aircraft to
Lessee, against payment by Lessee of the applicable purchase price and any
other amounts due hereunder in immediately available funds. In order to enable
Lessee to determine whether it wishes to exercise such election to purchase,
the fair market sales value for the Aircraft shall, at Lessee's request made in
sufficient time to permit such determination, be determined not less than 150
days prior to the end of the Term or any Renewal Term by mutual agreement of
Lessor and Lessee or, if they shall be unable to agree, by an Independent
Appraisal.

Section 21. Successor Owner Trustee. Lessee agrees that, in
the case of the appointment of any successor Owner Trustee pursuant to the
terms of the Trust Agreement and Section 9(d) of the Participation Agreement,
such successor Owner Trustee shall succeed to all the rights, powers and title
of Lessor hereunder and shall be deemed to be Lessor of the Aircraft for all
purposes without in any way altering the terms of this Lease or Lessee's
obligations hereunder. Lessee further agrees that in the case of the
appointment of any additional trustee to act as co-trustee or as a separate
trustee pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement and Section 9(d) of the
Participation Agreement, such additional trustee shall acquire such rights,
power and title of Lessor hereunder as are specified in the

80
<PAGE> 86
instruments appointing such additional trustee, without in any way altering the
terms of this Lease or Lessee's obligations hereunder. One such appointment
and designation of a successor or additional Owner Trustee shall not exhaust
the right to appoint and designate further successor or additional Owner
Trustees pursuant to the Trust Agreement and Section 9(d) of the Participation
Agreement, but such right may be exercised repeatedly as long as this Lease
shall be in effect.

Section 22. Security for Lessor's Obligation to Loan
Participants. In order to secure the indebtedness evidenced by the
Certificates, Lessor has agreed in the Trust Indenture, among other things, to
assign to the Indenture Trustee this Lease and the Lease Supplements and to
mortgage in favor of the Indenture Trustee all of Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to the Aircraft, subject to the reservations and conditions
therein set forth. Lessee hereby consents to such assignment and to the
creation of such mortgage and security interest and acknowledges receipt of
copies of the Trust Indenture and the Trust Agreement and Indenture Supplement,
it being understood that such consent shall not affect any requirement or the
absence of any requirement for any consent under any other circumstances. To
the extent, if any, that this Lease Agreement constitutes chattel paper (as
such term is defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any
applicable jurisdiction), no security interest in this Lease may be created
through the transfer or possession of any counterpart hereof other than the
original counterpart, which shall be identified as the counterpart containing
the receipt therefor executed by the Indenture Trustee on the signature page
thereof.

Section 23. Lessor's Right to Perform for Lessee. If Lessee
fails to make any payment of Rent required to be made by it hereunder or fails
to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, Lessor may,
on behalf of Lessee and upon prior notice to Lessee, itself make such payment
or undertake such performance or compliance. The amount of any such payment
and the amount of the reasonable expenses of Lessor incurred in connection with
such payment, performance or compliance together with interest thereon, at the
Overdue Rate, shall be deemed Supplemental Rent, payable by Lessee upon demand.

81
<PAGE> 87
Section 24. Maintenance of Certain Engines. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, an aircraft engine which is not an
Engine, but which is installed on the Airframe, shall be maintained in
accordance with Section 7(a).

Section 25. Investment of Security Funds; Miscellaneous. Any
moneys required to be paid to or retained by Lessor which are not required to
be paid to Lessee pursuant to Section 10(f) or 11(b) solely because an Event of
Default hereunder (or event that with lapse of time would constitute an Event
of Default under Section 14(a), 14(g), 14(h) or 14(i)) shall have occurred, or
which are required to be paid to Lessee pursuant to Section 10(c) or 11(b)
after completion of a replacement to be made pursuant to Section 10(a) shall,
until paid to Lessee as provided in Section 10 or 11 or applied as provided
herein or in the Trust Agreement and Trust Indenture, be invested in Permitted
Investments by Lessor (unless the Trust Indenture shall not have been
discharged, in which case, by the Indenture Trustee as provided in Section 3.07
of the Trust Indenture) from time to time as directed in writing by Lessee.
There shall, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred or be
continuing, be promptly remitted to Lessee as a rebate of Rent any gain
(including interest received) realized as the result of any such investment

perform or cause to be performed such obligation, even if stated herein as a
direct obligation, and the performance of any such obligation by any permitted
assignee, sublessee or transferee under an assignment, sublease or transfer

unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate
or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. This Lease
may be executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed and delivered, subject to Section 22, shall be an original,
but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same
instrument. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lessee hereby waives
any provision of law which renders any provision prohibited or unenforceable in
any respect. Neither this Lease nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated,
amended, supplemented, waived or modified orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party against which the enforcement of the termination,
amendment, supplement, waiver or modification is sought. This Lease shall
constitute an

83
<PAGE> 89
agreement of lease, and nothing herein shall be construed as conveying to
Lessee any right, title or interest in the Aircraft except as a lessee only.
To the extent consistent with the provisions of Title 11 U.S.C. Section 1110,
or any analogous section of the Federal bankruptcy laws, as amended from time
to time, it is hereby expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other
provisions of the Federal bankruptcy laws, as amended from time to time, the
title of Lessor to the Aircraft and any right of Lessor to take possession of
the Aircraft in compliance with the provisions of this Lease shall not be
affected by the provisions of the Federal bankruptcy laws, as amended from time
to time. The section and paragraph headings in this Lease and the table of
contents are for convenience of reference only and shall not modify, define,
expand or limit any of the terms or provisions hereof and all references herein
to numbered sections, unless otherwise indicated, are to sections of this
Lease.

YORK AND SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION,

Aircraft, if any, referred to in Section 9(b), (ii) if
Lessee has not elected to purchase the Aircraft as
provided in Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected to
retain the Aircraft as provided in Section 9(d), the
date of termination referred to in Section 9(d), or
(iii) if Lessee has elected to purchase the Aircraft
as provided in Section 9(e), the date of purchase
referred to in Section 9(e). Where Lessee has not
elected to purchase the Aircraft as provided for in
Section 9(e), Lessor shall give Lessee irrevocable
notice of its election to sell or retain the Aircraft
no later than 45 days after Lessor receives the notice
from Lessee referred to in the first sentence of this
Section 9(a). In the event Lessor shall fail to give
notice pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
notice of its election to sell the Aircraft shall be
deemed to have been given as of such forty-fifth day.
Unless Lessor shall have given to Lessee a timely
notice of its election to retain the Aircraft as
provided in Section 9(d), Lessee (1) shall withdraw
such termination notice on the Termination Contract
Date if the Person who shall have submitted the
highest cash bid notified by Lessee to Lessor or by
Lessor or the Owner Participant to Lessee pursuant to
Section 9(b) prior to the Termination Contract Date
(or, with the consent of Lessor, another person who
shall have submitted a bid for the purchase of the
Aircraft, acceptable to Lessor and Lessee) shall not
have entered into a binding contract of sale on or
prior to such Termination Contract Date reasonably
acceptable to the Owner Participant providing for the
sale by Lessor without recourse or warranty (except as

10

Series AC

<PAGE> 14

to Lessor's Liens) for cash of the Airframe and
the Engines installed thereon to such Person (the
"Contract Purchaser") (Lessor hereby agreeing, subject
to Lessor's right to retain the Aircraft, promptly to
execute and deliver any such contract of sale in the
form thereof furnished by Lessee for execution and
delivery and Lessee hereby agreeing to consult with
the Owner Participant regarding the terms of such
contract of sale and to submit the execution form
thereof to the Owner Participant a reasonable period
of time prior to the Termination Contract Date) and
(2) may withdraw the termination notice referred to
above at any time on or prior to the third Business
Day prior to the Termination Contract Date, whereupon
this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. 
In the event Lessee withdraws, on or after the third
Business Day prior to the Termination Contract Date, a
notice of termination given pursuant to this Section
9(a) or such notice is deemed withdrawn pursuant to
the final sentence of Section 9(b), Lessee will
reimburse Lessor and the Owner Participant for any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with the proposed sale, except Lessee shall
not be obligated to reimburse Lessor or the Owner
Participant for any out-of-pocket expenses to the
extent Lessor shall have failed to comply with its
obligations under this Section 9. Lessee shall not be
entitled to exercise its right of termination provided
for in this Section 9(a) more than four times during
the Term (not including for purposes of this sentence
any exercise by Lessee of such right of termination
immediately following a failure of this Lease to be
terminated by reason of Lessor's failure to comply
with its obligations under this Section 9).

(b) Sale of Aircraft. If Lessee has not
elected to purchase the Aircraft as provided in
Section 9(e) and Lessor has elected or is deemed to
have elected to sell the Aircraft pursuant to Section
9(a), Lessee will have the option of acting as
non-exclusive agent for Lessor to obtain bids for the
cash purchase on or prior to the Termination Date of
the Aircraft. Lessor agrees to pay Lessee a
commercially reasonable brokerage fee based on the
then current industry practice in the event that
Lessee locates the Person who purchases the Aircraft
pursuant to this Section 9(b). If Lessee acts as such
agent, no later than ten Business Days prior to the
Termination Contract Date, Lessee shall certify to
Lessor in writing the amount and terms of each cash
bid

11

Series AC

<PAGE> 15

received by Lessee and the name and the address
of the Person submitting each such bid. Lessor may
(but need not), also, at its expense (which expense,
including without limitation any broker's or finder's
fees, shall be for the Owner Participant's own
account), independently obtain cash bids for such
purchase and, in the event Lessor receives any such
bid, Lessor shall promptly, and in any event at least
five Business Days prior to the Termination Contract
Date certify to Lessee in writing the amount and terms
of such bid and the name and address of the Person
submitting such bid. Neither the Owner Participant,
Lessee, nor any Affiliate of either may submit a bid
for the Aircraft, directly or indirectly, in
connection with such proposed sale. On the
Termination Date (or such earlier date of sale as may
be agreed to by Lessor and Lessee, which date shall
thereafter be deemed the Termination Date), (x) Lessee
shall, subject to receipt (i) by Lessor (or, so long
as the Trust Indenture shall not have been discharged,
the Indenture Trustee) of the full purchase price
thereof and all amounts owing to Lessor pursuant to
the next sentence and (ii) by the Persons entitled
thereto of all unpaid Supplemental Rent due on or
before the Termination Date, deliver the Aircraft at a
location selected by Lessee to the Contract Purchaser
(or such other purchaser acceptable to Lessor and
Lessee), in the same manner as if delivery were made
to Lessor at the end of the Term pursuant to Section
5, and shall duly transfer to Lessor title to any
engines installed on the Airframe but not owned by
Lessor, all in accordance with the terms of Section 5,
and (y) Lessor shall simultaneously therewith sell,
without recourse or warranty (except as to Lessor's
Liens), for cash all of Lessor's right, title and
interest in and to the Aircraft to such Contract
Purchaser (or other purchaser). The total selling
price realized at such sale shall be retained by
Lessor (or, so long as the Trust Indenture shall not
have been discharged, distributed by the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Trust Indenture)
and, in addition, on the Termination Date, Lessee
shall pay to Lessor or, in the case of Supplemental
Rent, to the Persons entitled thereto, in funds of the
type specified in Section 3(d), an amount equal to (I)
the sum of (1) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Termination Value for the Aircraft as of the
Termination Date, over (B) the proceeds of the sale of
the Aircraft after deducting the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lessor and the
Owner Par-

Lessee or any other Person), plus (2) that amount of
interest that will accrue on the principal of all
Outstanding Certificates during the period from and
including the Termination Date to but excluding the
Redemption Date specified in Section 6.01 of the Trust
Indenture, plus (3) all Supplemental Rent (including,
without limitation, Premium Amount, if any) other than
Termination Value, due and owing on the Termination
Date, plus (4) (A) if the Termination Date is a Lease
Period Date, the Basic Rent installment due and
payable on that date pursuant to Section 3(b) (it
being understood and agreed that Lessee shall not be
required to pay the portion, if any, of such Basic
Rent installment designated in Exhibit A-1 to the Rent
Schedule as being payable in advance), or (B) if the
Termination Date is not a Lease Period Date and if
Basic Rent is payable in arrears during the Lease
Period commencing on the Lease Period Date next
preceding the Termination Date, an amount equal to the
Accrued Arrears Basic Rent for the period from and
including such Lease Period Date to but excluding the
Termination Date, plus (4) all Basic Rent due and
payable prior to the Termination Date and unpaid, less
(II) any credit to which Lessee may be entitled as
hereinafter in this Section 9(b) provided. Subject
always to the provisions of the penultimate paragraph
of Section 3(b), if the Termination Date with respect
to which Termination Value is determined is not a
Lease Period Date and if any portion of the Basic Rent
installment paid in respect of the Lease Period
commencing on the Lease Period Date next preceding the
Termination Date is designated in Exhibit A-1 to the
Rent Schedule as having been payable in advance,
Lessee shall be entitled to a credit against the
amounts payable by it pursuant to this Section 9(b) in
an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the Unearned
Advance Basic Rent as of the Termination Date, and (y)
the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of the sale
of the Aircraft after deducting the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lessor and the
Owner Participant (including any brokerage fee paid to
Lessee or any other Person) exceeds the Termination
Value for the Aircraft as of the Termination Date;
provided that, in the event that the amount calculated
pursuant to this sentence to be credited exceeds the
amounts payable by Lessee pursuant to this Section
9(b), the Owner Participant shall be obligated to
rebate an amount equal to such excess to Lessee. If
on or prior to the scheduled Termination

if Lessor shall not have elected to retain the 
Aircraft in accordance with Section 9(d) or Lessee

pursuant to Section 9(a) shall be deemed to be
withdrawn as of such scheduled Termination Date and
this Lease shall continue in full force and effect.

(c) Certain Obligations upon Sale of
Aircraft. Upon the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to
and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(b),
Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or
warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all of
Lessor's right, title and interest in and to any
Engines constituting part of the Aircraft but which
are not then installed on the Airframe. Lessor shall
be under no duty to solicit bids, to inquire into the
efforts of Lessee to obtain bids or otherwise take any
action in connection with the sale of the Aircraft
under Section 9(b), other than to transfer to the
purchaser of the Aircraft (or to such purchaser and to
Lessee, as the case may be), without recourse or
warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all of
Lessor's right, title and interest in and to the
Aircraft against receipt of the payments provided for

Lessee, as the case may be) an appropriate instrument
releasing the Aircraft from the lien of the Trust
Indenture and releasing the Purchase Agreement and the
Purchase Agreement Assignment from the assignment and
pledge under the Trust Indenture. Lessor agrees to
notify promptly Lessee of the appointment by Lessor of
any broker or finder (other than Lessee) in connection
with the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to Section 9(b)
and, subject to Section 9(b), to pay the fees or
commissions of any such broker or finder employed by
Lessor in connection with the sale of the Aircraft

the Termination Date; provided that in the event that
the Unearned Advance Basic Rent exceeds the amount
payable by Lessee pursuant to this Section 9(d), the
Owner Participant will be obligated to rebate an

shall fail to perform any of its obligations pursuant
to this Section 9(d) and as a result thereof this
Lease shall not be terminated on a proposed
Termination Date, Lessor shall thereafter no longer be
entitled to exercise its election to retain the
Aircraft and Lessee may at its option at any time
