FORD'S EARNINGS CONTINUE IMPROVEMENT 

DEARBORN, Mich., July 27 -- Substantial gains in both
financial services and automotive operations led to continued
earnings improvement for Ford Motor Company in the second quarter
of 1994. 

The company earned $1.63 per share of common and Class B
stock, compared with $.72 per share in the second quarter of last
year. Earnings per share data have been adjusted to reflect the
company's 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock
dividend which was effective June 6, 1994.

The second quarter results marked the sixth straight quarterly
earnings improvement for Ford Motor Company. Total earnings were
a record $1.711 billion. Earnings in the second quarter of 1993
were $775 million. 

"We feel good about these improvements, but we are by no means
satisfied," said Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive
officer. "Our goals are ambitious and to achieve them we must
remain focused on improving our automotive return on sales. We
will continue to remake ourselves -- to be leaner and even more
efficient."

Summary of Second Quarter 1994 Results
- --------------------------------------

A summary of the 1994 second quarter results compared with
1993 second quarter results follows:

- - Net income from worldwide automotive operations was $1.183
billion, compared with $395 million in the second quarter of
1993.

- - Worldwide automotive after-tax return on sales was 4.2
percent,compared with 1.7 percent last year.

- - Net income from U.S. automotive operations was $907 million,
compared with $367 million.

- - Automotive operations outside the U.S. earned $276 million,
compared with $28 million.

- - The Financial Services Group earned $528 million, compared with
$380 million. 

- - Worldwide sales and revenues were $33.8 billion, compared with
$29.4 billion.

- - Factory unit sales were 1,811,000, compared with 1,675,000.

- - Combined car and truck market share in the U.S. was 25 percent,
the same as last year.

- - European car and truck share was 11.8 percent, compared with 11.4
percent.

- - Stockholders' equity was $18.4 billion, compared with $15.7
billion.

- - Automotive cash and marketable securities were $13.7 billion,
compared with $9.3 billion.

Automotive Operations
- ---------------------

Ford's net income from worldwide automotive operations
improved $788 million, compared with the second quarter of 1993. 
The after-tax return on sales was 4.2 percent, up 2.5 percentage
points from last year. U.S. automotive operations showed continued
strength with a $540 million improvement over the prior year. 
Continued recovery in the U.S. automotive industry resulted in
higher Ford volume and an improved mix of retail sales. Ford
continues to project U.S. industry sales of about 15.5 million cars
and trucks for 1994, compared with 14.2 million units in 1993.

"Our products offer exceptional customer value," Trotman
said. "The introduction of the Mercury Mystique and Ford Contour
this fall will strengthen our product line in an important segment
of the market. We believe these products will exceed buyer
expectations and provide outstanding owner satisfaction, as is the
case in Europe with the Ford Mondeo."
<PAGE>
-3-

Automotive operations outside the U.S. improved $248
million. Ford's European automotive operations (excluding Jaguar)
earned $244 million, compared with a loss of $66 million a year
ago. 

"We're encouraged by Europe's cost reduction
achievements," Trotman said. "As the European economies recover,
the progress we've made there will be even more evident."

European industry sales for 1994 are projected to be
about 13.3 million units, compared with 12.5 million units in 1993. 
In the second quarter, industry volumes were up in most major
markets.

The Financial Services Group
- ----------------------------

The Financial Services Group earned a record $528 million
in the second quarter of 1994. The Group's profit was up $148
million, compared with the $380 million earned during the same
period last year.

"The Financial Services Group, one of the most profitable
financial services companies in the world, has proved, once again,
its value to Ford's bottom line," Trotman said. "And looking
ahead, Ford Credit, The Associates and USL Capital are well-
positioned for continued growth."

The Group's performance was led by Ford Credit, which
earned $368 million, compared with $306 million in the second
quarter of 1993. The Associates and USL Capital also posted
significant improvements over 1993.

Other 1994 Highlights
- ---------------------

- - In the U.S., Ford's truck sales were the highest ever in the
first half of 1994, setting records for any month in March, May
and June. 

- - Through June, Ford was the leading exporter from the U.S. and
Canada, with a record 57,200 units, up 75 percent from last year. 

- - In Europe year-to-date, car volume was up 9 percent from 1993
levels, and the Fiesta and Mondeo were segment leaders.

- - In China, agreements on joint ventures with two Chinese
automotive suppliers established Ford's first manufacturing 
presence there.

- - In Japan, Ford strengthened its product line with the
introduction of the Mustang and right-hand-drive versions of the 
Probe, Mondeo and Laser. For the first half of the year, sales
of Ford imports in Japan were almost three times higher than last
year.

Outlook -- Ford Prepares for Future
- -----------------------------------

"I'm very pleased with the reaction of our people to the
global realignment known as 'Ford 2000'," Trotman said. "The
enthusiasm and dedication of Ford employees around the world make
me confident that we'll have a smooth, successful transition. 
Ford 2000 will pave the way for future growth and strengthen our
worldwide competitiveness."

4. Sale of First Nationwide Bank

On April 14, 1994, an agreement was entered into between First
Nationwide Bank, a Federal Savings Bank (the "Bank") and First
Madison Bank, FSB ("First Madison") for the sale of substantially
all of the Bank's assets to, and the assumption of substantially
all of the Bank's liabilities by, First Madison. The Bank is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of First Nationwide Financial Corporation
("FNFC"), which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford. 
The transaction, which is subject to federal regulatory
approvals, is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of
1994.

The Company recognized in First Quarter 1994 earnings a pre-tax
charge of $475 million and an after-tax charge of $440 million
related to the disposition of FNFC, reflecting the non-recovery
of goodwill and reserves for estimated losses on assets to be
retained or repurchased by FNFC. These assets will be liquidated
over time as market conditions permit. The tax effect of this
transaction takes into account differences between the book and
tax basis of certain assets for which deferred taxes were not
required to be provided under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The
Company's income statement includes the results of operations of

5. Stock Split
-----------

On April 14, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors declared a 2-
for-1 stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend on the
Company's Common Stock and Class B Stock. The stock split became
effective June 6, 1994, and share data have been restated to
reflect the 2-for-1 stock split.

6. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
------------------------------------

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted SFAS No. 115,

Securities". Accordingly, the purchases and sales of trading
securities are included in cash flows from operating activities.

7. Acquisition of The Hertz Corporation
------------------------------------
On March 8, 1994, Ford purchased from Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft, a German bank, additional shares of common
stock of Hertz aggregating 5% of the total outstanding voting
stock, thereby bringing Ford's ownership of the total voting
stock of Hertz to 54% from 49%. On April 29, 1994, Ford acquired
20% of Hertz' common stock from Park Ridge Limited Partnership,
and Hertz redeemed the common stock (26%) and preferred stock of
Hertz owned by AB Volvo for $145 million; these transactions
resulted in Hertz becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford. In
addition, a $150 million subordinated promissory note of Hertz
held by Ford Credit was exchanged for $150 million of preferred
stock of Hertz.
