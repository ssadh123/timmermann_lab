Exhibit 99

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

SOUTHBURY, CONNECTICUT, August 19, 1994 -- Amdura Corporation
(NYSE:ADU) today announced that Judge John L. Kane, Jr. of the
United States District Court for the District of Colorado has
indicated that he will enter an order continuing until Tuesday,
August 23, 1994, his stay of the implementation of the District
Court's order reversing the September 1991 Bankruptcy Court order
that confirmed Amdura's bankruptcy reorganization plan. Judge
Kane has further scheduled oral argument for Tuesday, August 23,
1994, on Amdura's motion to extend the stay until September 9,
1994, during which time Amdura would attempt to establish
procedures through the Bankruptcy Court to evaluate certain class
action claims. The class action claims arise out of a case
originally filed in January 1990, prior to Amdura's filing of a
voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code. The case purported to have been brought on
behalf of a class of persons who purchased Amdura's pre-
bankruptcy preferred or common stock during certain pre-petition
periods, and alleged claims under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 to the effect that Amdura's public business and financial
disclosures were materially false or misleading during those
periods.

Amdura Corporation, headquartered in Southbury, Connecticut,
operates primarily through The Crosby Group, Inc. and The Harris
Waste Management Group, Inc. Crosby, headquartered in Tulsa,
Oklahoma, designs and manufactures lifting equipment, hardware
and accessories for use in energy, construction, manufacturing,
marine and transportation applications. Harris, headquartered in
Peachtree City, Georgia, is engaged in manufacturing and
marketing equipment for plastic, paper and ferrous and non-
ferrous scrap metal processing, as well as waste recycling and
solid waste disposal.
