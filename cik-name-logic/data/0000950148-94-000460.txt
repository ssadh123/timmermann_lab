ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On November 16, 1994, Hotel Investors Trust (the "Trust") and
Hotel Investors Corporation (the "Corporation") reported the completion of
definitive agreements with Starwood Capital Group, L.P. and its affiliates
("Starwood") relating to the previously announced reorganization (the
"Reorganization") with Starwood. Consummation of the Reorganization is subject
to, among other things, approval of the Reorganization and certain related
matters by the shareholders of the Trust and the stockholders of the
Corporation. A proxy statement seeking approval of the Reorganization and
related matters has been sent to shareholders of the Trust and stockholders of
the Corporation for a meeting scheduled to be held on December 15, 1994. The
Reorganization is expected to be consummated by the end of 1994.

The Reorganization will be effected pursuant to a Formation
Agreement among the Trust, the Corporation and Starwood (the "Formation
Agreement"), a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this Report. The
following description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
provisions of the Formation Agreement.

The Reorganization will involve a number of related
transactions that will occur simultaneously on the date of the consummation of
the Reorganization (the "Closing Date") pursuant to the terms of the Formation
Agreement. Such transactions include (i) the contribution by the Trust to a
newly formed limited partnership (the "Realty Partnership") of all of the
properties and assets of the Trust, subject to substantially all of the
liabilities of the Trust (including the senior debt (the "Senior Debt") of the
Trust), in exchange for an approximate 28.3% interest as a general partner in
the Realty Partnership, (ii) the contribution by Starwood to the Realty
Partnership of approximately $4,200,000 in cash and certain hotel properties
and first mortgage notes, in exchange for limited partnership units
representing the remaining approximate 71.7% interest in the Realty
Partnership, (iii) the contribution by the Corporation and its subsidiaries to
a newly formed limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership") of all of
their properties and operating assets (except for their gaming assets, which
are to be contributed upon approval by Nevada gaming authorities), subject to
substantially all of their liabilities, in exchange for an approximate 28.3%
interest as a general partner in the Operating Partnership, (iv) the
contribution by Starwood to the Operating Partnership of approximately $800,000
in cash, furnishings and equipment of the hotel properties, in exchange for
limited partnership units representing the remaining approximate 71.7% interest
in the Operating Partnership, (v) subject to the consent of the holders of the
Senior Debt, the cancellation of approximately $63 million of intercompany
indebtedness from the Corporation to the Trust, in consideration for the
guarantee by the Corporation of up to $25 million of the Senior Debt. The

-2-
<PAGE> 3
percentage interests of the Trust, the Corporation and Starwood referred to
above are subject to adjustment as provided in the Formation Agreement.

The limited partnership units of the Realty Partnership and
the Operating Partnership to be held by Starwood will (subject to the ownership
limitation provisions of the Trust and the Corporation which are designed to
preserve the status of the Trust as a REIT for tax purposes) be exchangeable,
together but not separately, for, at the option of the Trust and the
Corporation, either cash, Paired Shares of the Trust and the Corporation
representing up to approximately 71.7% of the Paired Shares after such
exchange, or a combination of cash and such Paired Shares.

In addition if, within six months from the approval of the
Reorganization by the shareholders of the Trust and the stockholders of the
Corporation, Starwood acquires Senior Debt, Starwood will exchange up to
$12,000,000 of such Senior Debt for up to an additional approximate 3.0% of the
outstanding limited partnership units of the Trust and the Corporation. An
affiliate of Starwood is the general partner of a partnership which has the
right to acquire approximately $74.0 million of Senior Debt. Any such units
issued pursuant to such exchange would be exchangeable for Paired Shares on the
same basis as other units issued to Starwood in connection with the
Reorganization.

The Trust and the Corporation also announced that an
individual holding approximately 9.8% of the outstanding Paired Shares who had
opted out of the settlement of certain previously disclosed shareholder
litigation entered into an agreement (the "Assignment Agreement") pursuant to
which he assigned his claims to Starwood. In connection with such assignment
Starwood has agreed to purchase those Paired Shares, at such individual's
election, in a 60-day period beginning on the earlier of the year after the
Closing Date or December 15, 1995, at a price of $5.625 per Paired Share.
Starwood may also elect to purchase such Paired Shares at the same time and on
the same terms. Such individual has agreed not to purchase or sell any Paired
Shares during such period and not more than 4.9% thereafter.

The Trust and the Corporation have agreed that if the
Formation Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances and if within 60
days after such termination the Trust and the Corporation receive from Starwood
a full release (the "Release") of the claims assigned to Starwood, then the
Trust and the Corporation will indemnify Starwood against liabilities, losses
and expenses under or in respect of the Assignment Agreement (other than to the
extent such liabilities, losses or expenses arose from a breach by Starwood);
provided that the aggregate indemnification obligation of the Trust and the
Corporation is limited to $1,800,000. If the Reorganization is consummated and
if prior to December 15, 1995 the Trust and the Corporation

receive the Release, they will also indemnify Starwood to the extent described
in the preceding sentence. In connection with the Assignment Agreement, the
Trust and the Corporation each accrued shareholder litigation expenses of $1.3
million during the third quarter of 1994.

requisite trust power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as now conducted. HIT has delivered to Starwood

Party in accordance with its respective terms.

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
such Starwood Party nor consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
compliance with or fulfillment of the terms and provisions hereof by such
Starwood Party will (i) conflict with, result in a breach of the terms,
conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default, an event of default or an
event creating rights of acceleration, termination or cancellation or a loss of
rights, or result in the creation or imposition of any encumbrance upon any of
the Starwood Properties under the agreement of limited partnership or other
organizational document of such Starwood Party (or, if such Starwood Party has
any subsidiaries, the organizational documents of such subsidiaries), any
instrument, agreement, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, permit, concession,
grant, franchise, license, judgment, order, award, decree or other restriction
to which such Starwood Party or any of its subsidiaries is a party or any of
their respective properties is subject or by which any of them is bound or any
statute, other law or regulatory provision affecting any of them, or (ii)
require the approval, consent or authorization of, or the making of any

-12-
<PAGE> 17
(x) have a Material Adverse Effect on the Starwood Properties (taken as a
whole) or, in addition, after the Closing, on the Realty Partnership and its
subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or the Operating Partnership and its
subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (y) prevent or hinder the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.3. Investment Representations. Such Starwood Party
is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and (except for Woodstar
Partners I, L.P.) was not organized for the purpose of acquiring limited
partnership interests in the Realty Partnership or the Operating Partnership.
Such Starwood Party has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters and in investing in entities similar to the Realty Partnership
and the Operating Partnership so as to be able to evaluate the risks and merits
of its investment in the Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership and
it is able financially to bear the risks thereof. Such Starwood Party has had
an opportunity to discuss the business, management and financial affairs of
HIT, HIC and the Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership with the
management of HIT and HIC. The limited partnership interests in the Realty
Partnership and the Operating Partnership are being acquired by such Starwood
Party for its own account for the purpose of investment and not with a view to
or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof. Such Starwood Party
understands that (i) the limited partnership interests in the Realty
Partnership and the Operating Partnership have not been registered under the
Securities Act by reason of their issuance in a transaction exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2)
thereof or Rule 505 or 506 promulgated under the Securities Act, and (ii) such
interests and, upon any issuance of Trust Shares and Corporation Shares
pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, such Trust Shares and Corporation Shares
must be held indefinitely unless such Shares are registered upon receipt
thereof, or unless a subsequent disposition thereof is registered under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or is exempt from such
registration.

Section 4.4. Litigation. To the knowledge of such Starwood
Party, except as disclosed in the Starwood Disclosure Schedule, there are no
actions, suits or proceedings or court orders or decrees pending or threatened
to which such Starwood Party is a party or any of its properties is subject or
by which it is bound before or by any court or governmental agency, which if
determined adversely to the interests of such Starwood Party, would reasonably
be expected to either (x) have a Material Adverse Effect on the Starwood
Properties (taken as a whole) or, in addition, after the Closing, on the Realty
Partnership and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or the Operating
Partnership and

-13-
<PAGE> 18
its subsidiaries (taken as a whole), or (y) prevent or hinder the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.5. Certain Matters. To the knowledge of such
Starwood Party, except as disclosed in the Starwood Disclosure Schedule, or in
reports of consultants or title companies delivered to HIT or HIC prior to the
date of this Agreement, there are no structural, mechanical, HVAC,
environmental, zoning or title conditions relating to (a) the Starwood Realty
Properties to be contributed by such Starwood Party, which would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Starwood Realty Properties
(taken as a whole) or, in addition, after the Closing, on the Realty
Partnership and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (b) the Starwood
Operating Properties to be contributed by such Starwood Party, which would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Starwood
Operating Properties (taken as a whole) or, in addition, after the Closing, on
the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole).

Section 4.6. Proxy Statement. Except for the financial
statements described in Section 4.7, none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by such Starwood Party or any of its representatives for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 5.1) will, at the time of the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the shareholders of HIT and the stockholders
of HIC and at the time of the meetings of such shareholders and stockholders
referred to in Section 5.2, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading. Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, HIT, HIC
and the Starwood Parties shall enter into a letter agreement specifying those
portions of the Proxy Statement which were supplied by the Starwood Parties
(the "Proxy Statement Letter").

Section 4.7. Financial Statements. The income statements,
statements of cash flows and other financial statements supplied by such
Starwood Party to be included in the Proxy Statement or used in preparing
financial statements to be included in the Proxy Statement are (to the
knowledge of such Starwood Party) correct in all material respects, are in
accordance with the books and records of such Starwood Party and present fairly
the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the
respective properties covered thereby as of their respective dates and for the
respective periods covered thereby, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Section 4.8. Employee Benefit Plans. Such Starwood Party is
not (1) an "employee benefit plan" as defined in and subject to the Employment
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), (2) a "plan" as
defined in and subject to

-14-
<PAGE> 19
Section 4975 of the Code or (3) an entity any portion or all of the assets of
which are deemed pursuant to United States Department of Labor Regulation
Section 2510.3-101 or otherwise pursuant to ERISA to be, for any purpose of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, assets of any "employee benefit plan" or
"plan" described in clause (1) or (2) above which invests in such entity by
virtue of such investment.

Section 4.9. No Finder. Neither such Starwood Party nor any
party acting on its behalf has paid or become obligated to pay any fee or any
commission to any broker, finder or intermediary for or on account of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than to Merrill Lynch & Co.,
whose fees and expenses, to the extent payable, shall be paid by HIT and HIC
after the Closing.

ARTICLE V

ACTIONS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE

HIT, HIC, and the Starwood Parties (severally and not jointly)
covenant and agree to take the following respective actions between the date
hereof and the Closing Date:

Section 5.1. Proxy Statement. HIT and HIC have prepared and
filed with the SEC a joint proxy statement to solicit proxies in connection
with the meetings of the shareholders of HIT and the stockholders of HIC
referred to in Section 5.2 (the form of such joint proxy statement, together
with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, mailed to the shareholders
of HIT and the stockholders of HIC in connection with such meetings is herein
referred to as the "Proxy Statement"). HIT and HIC will cause the Proxy
Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations
thereunder and will cause the Proxy Statement, at the time of its mailing or
delivery to the shareholders of HIT and the stockholders of HIC and at the time
of the meetings referred to above, to not include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however,
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that any such untrue statement
of a material fact or omission to state a material fact was made by HIT or HIC
in reliance upon and in conformity with information concerning any Starwood
Party and their respective affiliates or representatives furnished to HIT or
HIC by a Starwood Party or its affiliates or representatives for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement, as set forth in the Proxy Statement Letter. Each Starwood
Party shall, and shall cause its affiliates and representatives to, furnish HIT
and HIC all information concerning itself and the Starwood Properties to be
contributed by it and required for use in the Proxy Statement,

-15-
<PAGE> 20
including, without limitation, audited and unaudited financial statements with
respect to the Starwood Realty Properties contributed by it and required to be
included in the Proxy Statement or which are necessary to prepare pro forma
financial statements and information to be included in the Proxy Statement.
If, at any time prior to the Closing Date, any event should occur which is
required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, HIT and HIC will cause such event to be so described, and such
amendment shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law,
disseminated to any shareholders of HIT or any stockholders of HIC. Each of
the Starwood Parties will cooperate fully in connection with such amendment or
supplement, including supplying any and all information with respect to such
Starwood Party (or its affiliates and representatives) and the Starwood
Properties to be contributed by it which is necessary to prepare any such
amendment or supplement.

Section 5.2. Action by HIT, HIC, Shareholders of HIT and
Stockholders of HIC. HIT shall, as soon as practicable after the Proxy
Statement shall be cleared by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of the shareholders of HIT for the purpose of electing trustees
to the Board of Trustees (including the three nominees designated by Starwood
pursuant to Section 5.3) of HIT and approving (i) HIT becoming the general
partner of the Realty Partnership and the contribution to the Realty
Partnership of the HIT Properties, (ii) the issuance of Trust Shares pursuant
to the Exchange Agreement, (iii) the authorization of a reverse stock split of
Trust Shares, (iv) the amendment to the Trust Declaration substantially in the
form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit E, and (v) any other matter required
to be approved by such shareholders pursuant to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, together with the election to
the Board of Trustees of the three nominees designated by Starwood pursuant to
Section 5.3, the "HIT Shareholder Matters"). HIC shall, as soon as practicable
after such clearance, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
the stockholders of HIC for the purpose of electing directors to the Board of
Directors of HIC (including the two nominees designated by Starwood pursuant to
Section 5.3) and approving (i) HIC becoming the general partner of the
Operating Partnership and the contribution to the Operating Partnership of the
HIC Properties, (ii) the issuance of Corporation Shares pursuant to the
Exchange Agreement, (iii) the authorization of a reverse stock split of
Corporation Shares, (iv) the amendment to the HIC Articles in the form attached
to this Agreement as Exhibit F, and (v) any other matter required to be
approved by such stockholders pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (collectively, together with the election to the Board of
Directors of the two nominees designated by Starwood pursuant to Section 5.3,
the "HIC Stockholder Matters"). Subject to the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Trustees of HIT under applicable law and to the last sentence of this
Section 5.2, the

-16-
<PAGE> 21
Board of Trustees of HIT will recommend to its shareholders approval of the HIT
Shareholder Matters. Subject to the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors
of HIC under applicable law and to the last sentence of this Section 5.2, the
Board of Directors of HIC will recommend to its stockholders approval of the
HIC Shareholder Matters. Each of the Board of Trustees of HIT or the Board of
Directors of HIC may at any time prior to the Closing Date withdraw, modify or
change any recommendation regarding the HIT Shareholder Matters, the HIC
Stockholder Matters, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
recommend and declare advisable any other offer, proposal or transaction if in
any such case it determines upon advice of legal counsel that the failure to so
withdraw, modify or change such recommendation could reasonably be expected to
involve it in a breach of fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Section 5.3. Board Representation. HIT shall cause the Board
of Trustees of HIT to consist of five trustees and Starwood will be entitled to
designate three individuals to be nominated in the Proxy Statement by the Board
of Trustees of HIT (the "Starwood HIT Nominees"), such nominees to take office
effective upon their election at the meeting of shareholders of HIT referred to
in Section 5.2. HIC shall, effective upon the receipt of necessary Nevada
Gaming Approvals or such time as such Nevada Gaming Approvals are no longer
required, cause the Board of Directors of HIC to consist of three directors and
Starwood will be entitled to designate two individuals to be nominated in the
Proxy Statement by the Board of Directors of HIC (the "Starwood HIC Nominees"),
such nominees to take office as directors upon receipt of such Nevada Gaming
Approvals or such time as such Nevada Gaming Approvals are no longer required.
One of the Starwood HIT Nominees shall be nominated to each of the classes of
trustees whose terms expire at the annual shareholder meetings of HIT to be
held in 1995, 1996 and 1997. One of the Starwood HIC Nominees shall be
nominated to each of the classes of directors whose terms expire at the annual
stockholders meetings of HIC to be held in 1996 and 1997.

Section 5.4. Investigation. Each of the parties hereto shall
afford to the officers, employees and authorized representatives of each other
party hereto (including, without limitation, independent public accountants,
attorneys, environmental consultants and financial advisors thereof),
reasonable access during normal business hours to its offices, properties,
employees and business and financial records to the extent such party shall
deem necessary or desirable, and shall furnish to each such other party or such
other party's authorized representatives such additional information concerning
the operations, properties and businesses as may be reasonably requested in
writing, to enable such party or such party's authorized representatives to
verify the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, and

-17-
<PAGE> 22
to determine whether the conditions set forth in Articles VII and VIII have
been satisfied. Each of the parties hereto agrees that such investigations
shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operation of the business of any other party. No investigation made by any
party or such party's authorized representatives hereunder shall affect the
representations and warranties of the parties hereunder.

Section 5.5. Lawsuits, Proceedings, Etc. Each party hereto
shall notify each of the other parties hereto promptly upon becoming aware of
any lawsuit, proceeding, claim or investigation that may be threatened,
brought, asserted or commenced against it (a) involving in any way the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (b) that would have been listed
or specified as an exception to Sections 2.5, 3.5 or 4.4, as the case may be,
if such lawsuit, proceeding, claim or investigation had arisen prior to the
date hereof.

Section 5.6. Conduct of Business by HIT, HIC and Starwood
Pending the Closing. (a) During the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
(i) HIT shall carry on its business with respect to the HIT Properties in, and
not enter into any material transaction with respect to the HIT Properties
other than in accordance with, the ordinary course, (ii) HIC shall carry on its

Properties other than in accordance with, the ordinary course (except, in each
case, with respect to HIT or HIC, with the prior written consent of Starwood
and except, in each case with respect to the Starwood Parties, with the prior
written consent of HIT and HIC).

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, during the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, neither HIT nor HIC shall,
without the prior written consent of Starwood (not to be unreasonably
withheld):

(i) take any action that would cause HIT to fail to be

for such taxable year;

offer to Starwood the opportunity to provide such refinancing on terms

refinancing on such terms within five business days of such offer, HIT
and HIC shall be free to effect such proposed refinancing on such
terms;

(iv) incur any costs or expenses that are not in accordance with

the immediately preceding paragraph (viii); provided, however, that
prior to any such

-20-

Section 5.7. Mutual Cooperation; Best Efforts. Subject to
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Trustees of HIT and the Board of Directors
of HIC under applicable law, and the fiduciary duties of general partners of
Starwood Parties under applicable law, the parties hereto shall cooperate with
each other, and shall use their respective best efforts to cause the

obtain as promptly as possible all consents, authorizations, orders or
approvals from each and every third party, whether private or governmental,
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require Starwood, the Starwood
Partners, HIT, HIC, the Realty Partnership or the Operating Partnership to make
any divestiture or consent to any divestiture in order to obtain any waiver,
consent or approval.

Section 5.8. No Public Announcement. None of the parties
hereto shall, without the approval of the other parties hereto (which may not
be unreasonably withheld), make any press release or other public announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to
the extent that such party shall be so obligated by law, in which case each of
such other parties hereto shall be advised and the parties hereto shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or
announcement to be issued.

Section 5.9. No Solicitation. From and after the date
hereof, except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement (including Sections 5.2
and 5.6 of this Agreement) HIT and HIC will not, and will instruct their
respective officers and directors not to, solicit or otherwise engage in any
discussions or negotiations with any person other than the Starwood Parties
relating to any Proposal (as hereinafter defined); provided, however, that HIT
or HIC or their respective officers and directors may engage in discussions or
negotiations with any person (provided that neither HIT nor HIC solicited such
discussions or negotiations on or after June 2, 1994) if the Board of Trustees
of HIT and the Board of Directors of HIC determine in good faith upon advice of
legal counsel that a

-22-
<PAGE> 27
failure to engage in such discussions or negotiations could reasonably be
expected to involve the Board of Trustees of HIT or the Board of Directors of
HIC in a breach of fiduciary duties under applicable law; and provided further,
that nothing herein shall prevent the Board of Trustees of HIT or the Board of
Directors of HIC from taking, and disclosing to the shareholders of HIT and the
stockholders of HIC, a position in respect of a Proposal as contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. In the event that
HIT or HIC reach an agreement with respect to a Proposal with any person other
than the Starwood Parties and such agreement is not consistent with the
obligations of HIT or HIC set forth in this Agreement or with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then, prior to entering into such agreement
they will deliver the notice provided in Section 10.1(g) and pay the fee
provided in Section 11.2. For purposes of this Agreement "Proposal" shall mean
(i) a recapitalization or restructuring of HIT or HIC, (ii) the creation of any
UPREIT, (iii) a sale, disposition or refinancing of all or portions of the HIT
Properties, the Notes Receivable or the HIC Properties, (iv) the issuance of
any additional debt or equity securities of HIT or HIC, (v) the transfer in one
transaction or a series of related transactions of more than 10% of the
existing debt or equity securities of HIT or HIC or (vi) the appointment to the
Board of Trustees of HIT or the Board of Directors of HIC of trustees or
directors designated by a single person and its affiliates, other than Starwood
and its affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided that any
transaction (other than a transaction pursuant to Section 11.2(c)) consented to
by Starwood or permitted by Section 5.6 shall not be a "Proposal."

Section 5.10. Gaming Law Compliance. HIT, HIC and the
Starwood Parties shall make all filings under applicable gaming laws of the
State of Nevada and of the Clark County, Nevada Liquor and Gaming Licensing
Board required to effect the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties
hereto acknowledge that as of the date hereof they have received the Nevada
Gaming Approvals required to be obtained in order to consummate the Closing,
pursuant to the terms of the letter dated September 28, 1994 from the Nevada
Gaming Control Board, a copy of which letter has been made available to all
parties hereto. Each of HIT and HIC and each of the Starwood Parties,
severally and not jointly, warrants that all such filings by it shall be,
accurate as of the date filed and in accordance with the requirements of all
rules and regulations and such gaming laws. Each of HIT, HIC and each of the
Starwood Parties agree to make available, or cause to be made available, to the
other parties such information as may reasonably be requested relative to its
businesses, assets and property as may be required to file any additional
information requested by such agencies under such rules and regulations and
such gaming laws. HIT and HIC will use their best efforts to obtain temporary
approval under Nevada gaming laws for the new directors of HIC to be elected
pursuant to Section 5.3 so as to

-23-
<PAGE> 28
allow each such director to take office as a director as soon as practicable.

Section 5.11. Adjustments. Notwithstanding the provisions of
the Partnership Agreements, the Starwood Realty Contribution Agreement, the
Starwood Operating Contribution Agreement, the HIT Contribution Agreement and
the HIC Contribution Agreement, the respective Partnership Interests (as
defined in the Partnership Agreements) of the partners of the Partnership shall
be increased or decreased on or prior to the date (the "Adjustment Date") which
is ten business days prior to the date on which the Proxy Statement is to be
mailed, and on the Closing Date, in accordance with the following provisions
(without duplication among any such adjustments):

(a) In the case of the Partnership Interest of the Starwood 
Parties in each of the Partnerships:

(i) such Partnership Interests shall be decreased if the
principal amount of the Midlantic Notes or the Harvey
Hotel Notes (as each is defined in the Starwood
Realty Contribution Agreement) is reduced after the
date hereof and prior to the Adjustment Date;

(ii) such Partnership Interests shall be increased if the
principal amount of the Harvey Debt (as defined in
the Starwood Realty Contribution Agreement) or of the
debt encumbering the Midlantic Notes is reduced after
the date hereof and prior to the assumption thereof
by the Realty Partnership on the Closing Date; and

(iii) such Partnership Interests shall be increased in the
event that on or prior to the Adjustment Date
Starwood shall irrevocably commit to contribute to
the Realty Partnership on the Closing Date all or
portions of the equity securing the Harvey Hotel
Notes or the equity interest in the Ramada Suites in
Secaucus, New Jersey (in addition to the notes
secured by such equities) (any such contributions to
be valued using a valuation method which is the same
as the method used for valuing the HIT Properties
(exclusive, however, of extraordinary or
non-recurring expenditures) relative to the Starwood
Realty Properties).

(b) If the principal amount of the Midlantic Notes or the
Harvey Hotel Notes is reduced on or after the Adjustment Date and prior to the
assumption thereof by the Realty Partnership on the Closing Date, then the
Starwood Parties shall contribute an additional amount of cash to the Realty
Partnership equal to the amount of such reduction, and the Partnership
Interests of such

-24-
<PAGE> 29
Starwood Partners, as the case may be, shall not be decreased or increased by
reason of such reduction or such additional cash contribution.

(c) In the case of the Partnership Interests of any partner in
the Partnerships, such Partnership Interests shall be decreased if any assets
which are to be contributed to the Partnerships by such partner are not so
contributed; provided, that if any such decrease would cause the aggregate
Partnership Interests of the Starwood Parties to be less than 51%, then the
Starwood Parties shall contribute additional assets to the Partnerships in
order to cause such aggregate Partnership Interests to be equal to 51%, with
any such additional assets to be subject to the approval of HIT and HIC (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall be valued
using the same valuation principles used in valuing similar assets of the
Starwood Parties contributed to the Partnerships.

(d) In the event and to the extent that the adjustments
provided for in this Section 5.11 would cause the aggregate Partnership
Interests of the Starwood Parties in the Partnerships to be less than 71.725%
(such percentage being the aggregate Partnership Interests of the Starwood
Parties prior to adjustment thereof pursuant to this Section 5.11 (the
"Unadjusted Partnership Interests")), then the Starwood Parties shall have the
right, on or prior to the Adjustment Date, to irrevocably commit to contribute
to the Partnerships on the Closing Date additional cash or other assets in
order to cause the aggregate Partnership Interests of the Starwood Parties, as
adjusted pursuant to this Section 5.11, to equal the aggregate Unadjusted
Partnership Interests of the Starwood Parties. Any such additional
contribution of cash which is to be contributed in lieu of all or a portion of
a note shall be valued based on the discounted value used for purposes of
valuing such note, and any such additional contribution of other assets
(including, without limitation, notes) shall be subject to the approval of HIT
and HIC (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and
shall be valued using the same valuation principles used in valuing similar
assets of the Starwood Parties contributed to the Partnerships.

(e) On or prior to the Adjustment Date, the Starwood Parties
shall have the right to irrevocably commit to contribute to the Partnerships on
the Closing Date additional assets so as to cause the aggregate Partnership
Interests of the Starwood Parties in the Partnerships to be greater than the
aggregate Unadjusted Partnership Interests of the Starwood Parties. Any such
additional contributions shall be subject to the approval of HIT and HIC (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such contributions shall be
valued at such Starwood Party's cost for such assets, plus the excess, if any,
of (x) an amount equal to simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum on the
amount of equity invested by such Starwood Party in such assets during

-25-
<PAGE> 30
the period in which such Starwood Party owned such assets over (y) any net cash
flow (after debt service) received by such Starwood Party during such period.

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Partnership
Agreements, the Starwood Realty Contribution Agreement and the Starwood
Operating Contribution Agreement, at Starwood's election, in lieu of making
contributions to the Partnerships on the Closing Date of certain Starwood
Properties (to be designated by Starwood) in exchange for Units of the
Partnerships, the Starwood Partners shall make such contributions to HIT and
HIC on the Closing Date in exchange for a number of Paired Shares equal to the
number of such Units that such Starwood Partners would have received if such
contributions had been made to the Partnerships; provided that after giving
effect to the issuance of such Paired Shares to such Starwood Partners and
their respective affiliates, the Starwood Parties shall not beneficially own,
in the aggregate, Paired Shares representing more than 4.9% of the then issued
and outstanding Paired Shares (such percentage to be increased to 8.0% after
such time as necessary Nevada Gaming Approvals are obtained or such time as
such Nevada Gaming Approvals are no longer required).

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Section 5.11, no adjustments shall be made to the Partnership Interests in
the Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership to the extent that, as a
result thereof, the Partnership Interest of HIT and HIC, respectively, would be
reduced to below 25%, unless HIT and HIC, respectively, in its sole and
absolute discretion, approves in writing such adjustments, which approval may
be unreasonably withheld.

Debt).

-26-
<PAGE> 31
Section 6.2. Waiver of Certain Claims. None of HIT, HIC, the
Realty Partnership or the Operating Partnership shall ever assert any claim of
equitable subordination or other lender liability claims or defenses against
holders of the Senior Debt based upon any one or more of the following: (a) the
presence on the Board of Trustees of HIT, the Board of Directors of HIC or the
governing board of the Operating Partnership of trustees, directors or members
who were nominated by or at the direction of Starwood, or any actions taken by
such trustees, directors or members as such, (b) the employment by HIT or HIC
of any employees who are affiliates of Starwood or any actions taken by such

contribute to the Operating Partnership, with respect to any HICN Properties or
other assets not previously disposed of, cash equal to the fair value of such
HICN Properties and such other assets on December 31, 1995. Such fair value
shall be conclusively determined by an independent appraiser selected by the
Board of Directors of HIC. No additional interests in the Operating
Partnership will be issued upon the transfer of any of the HICN Properties,
such other assets, such net proceeds or such cash. HIC shall contribute to the
Operating Partnership any dividends or other distributions declared or paid by
HICN to HIC prior to the receipt of the HICN Approval, such contributions to be

the HIT Shareholder Matters shall have been approved by the requisite vote of
the holders of Trust

Starwood affiliate which so acquires Senior Debt shall contribute all of such
Senior Debt to the Partnerships (up to a maximum of $12 million aggregate
principal amount of Senior Debt) in exchange for a number of additional Units
of the Partnerships equal to [______] Units (such number of Units to be adjusted
as provided in Section 4.1(f) of the Realty Partnership Agreement and Section
4.1(g) of the Operating Partnership Agreement) for each $1,000 aggregate
principal amount of Senior Debt so contributed. Any such contribution of
Senior Debt shall be considered a Capital Contribution for purposes of Section
8.2 of each of the Partnership Agreements.

Section 6.5. [Intentionally Omitted]

Section 6.6. Exclusivity; Excluded Assets. (a) So long as
any officer, director or general partner of, or any other person employed by,
any Starwood Party remains on either the Board of Trustees of HIT or the Board
of Directors of HIC (such period during which any such officer, director,
general partner or other person remains on either such Board being referred to
as the "Noncompete Period"), each of the Starwood Parties agrees that it will
not compete within the United States, directly or indirectly, with the Realty
Partnership, the Operating Partnership, HIT or HIC and that such Starwood Party
will present to the Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership all
opportunities for acquisitions of (i) fee interests in hotels in the United
States and (ii) debt interests in hotels in the United States where it is
anticipated that the equity will be acquired by the debt holder within one year

or debt interests described in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The provisions of
this Section 6.6(a) shall not apply to Excluded Assets (as defined in Section

(b) Each Starwood Party hereby grants to the Partnerships the
option, from and after the Closing Date and at any time or times prior to the
earlier of (i) five years from the Closing Date and (ii) the expiration of the
Noncompete Period, to acquire the interest of such Starwood Party in one or
more Excluded Assets (as defined below), subject to receipt of all required
material third party and partner consents and approvals. Upon exercise of such
option from time to time, such Starwood Party shall use its best efforts to
obtain such consents and approvals. Such acquisition by the Partnerships shall
be made for a cash purchase price equal to the fair market value of the
Excluded Assets being acquired, as determined by agreement between the
Partnerships and such Starwood Party or, if they are unable to so agree within
30 days after the exercise of such option, such fair market value shall be
equal to the average of the two closest of three appraisals of such fair market
value,

-28-
<PAGE> 33

majority of the Disinterested Members of HIT and HIC, an independent appraiser
selected by Starwood and a third independent appraiser selected by agreement of
such first two appraisers. HIT and HIC shall pay all costs and expenses of the
appraiser selected by them and one-half of the costs and expenses of such third
appraiser and Starwood shall pay all costs and expenses of the appraiser
selected by it and one-half of the costs and expenses of such third appraiser.
As used herein, "Excluded Assets" means those fee interests, debt interests or
other investments in the hotel asset investment business of any Starwood Party
or their commonly controlled affiliates existing on the Closing Date.

respect of each of the years ending December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, the
amount, if any (the "Shortfall Amount"), by which the Base Amount (as defined

year and (z) for the year ending December 31, 1997, an amount equal to $900,000
less any Credit Amount (as defined below) for such year; and (iii) "Credit
Amount" means (x) for the year ending December 31, 1996, the excess, if any, of
the Cash Flow for 1995 over the Base Amount for 1995 and (y) for the year

Agreement dated April 11, 1994 between SWI and Harvey Hotel Management
Corporation ("HHM"), as such agreement is to be amended pursuant to that

-29-
<PAGE> 34
Agreement") with respect to the Wichita Hotel and, so long as all required
Shortfall Amounts have been contributed as provided in Section 6.7(a), neither
the Trust nor the Corporation shall take any action to cause the termination of
the Management Agreement prior to December 31, 1997, without the prior written
consent of Starwood.

Section 6.8. Indemnification of Directors and Officers. From
and after the Closing Date, each of HIT and HIC shall, and Starwood shall use
its best efforts to cause HIT and HIC to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the respective present officers, directors and employees of HIT and HIC and any
of their respective subsidiaries against all losses, expenses, claims, damages
or liabilities arising out of actions or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) to the full extent permitted or required under applicable law
(and shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such person is not entitled to indemnification). Each of HIT and HIC
agree that all rights to indemnification, including provisions relating to
advances of expenses incurred in defense of any action or suit, existing in
favor of the present directors, officers and employees of HIT and HIC or any of
their respective subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") as

in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Closing and shall continue

Parties.

Kentucky French Quarters Suites; provided, however, that the Starwood Parties
shall be required to indemnify and hold harmless under this Section 9.3 only to
the extent that the aggregate amount of Loss and Expense referred to above in
this Section 9.3 exceeds $100,000; and provided, further, that the obligation
of the Starwood Parties to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to this Section
9.3 shall be limited to the payment by the Starwood Parties in the aggregate of
an amount equal to $5,000,000.

Section 9.4. Notice of Claims. If a party believes that any
of the persons entitled to indemnification under this Article IX has suffered
or incurred any Loss or incurred any Expense, whether or not the applicable
dollar limitation specified by Sections 9.1, 9.2 or 9.3 has been exceeded, such
party shall notify the indemnifying party promptly in writing describing such
Loss or Expense, the amount thereof, if known, and the method of computation of
such Loss or Expense, all with reasonable particularity and containing a
reference to the provisions of this Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto in respect of which such Loss or Expense
shall have occurred; provided, however, that the omission by such indemnified
party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying
party of its indemnification obligation under this Article IX except to the
extent that such indemnifying party is materially damaged as a

-36-
<PAGE> 41
result of such failure to give notice. If any action at law or suit in equity
is instituted by or against a third party with respect to which any of the
persons entitled to indemnification under this Article IX intends to claim any
liability or expense as Loss or Expense under this Article IX, any such person
shall promptly notify the indemnifying party of such action or suit as
specified in this Section 9.4 and Section 9.5. Any party entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall use reasonable efforts to minimize any Loss or
Expense for which indemnification is sought hereunder.

Section 9.5. Third Party Claims. In the event of any claim
for indemnification hereunder resulting from or in connection with any claim or
legal proceeding by a third party, the indemnified persons shall give such
notice thereof to the indemnifying party not later than twenty business days
prior to the time any response to the asserted claim is required, if possible,
and in any event within fifteen days following the date such indemnified person
has actual knowledge thereof; provided, however, that the omission by such
indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
indemnifying party of its indemnification obligation under this Article IX
except to the extent that such indemnifying party is materially damaged as a
result of such failure to give notice. In the event of any such claim for
indemnification resulting from or in connection with a claim or legal
proceeding by a third party, the indemnifying party may, at its sole cost and
expense, assume the defense thereof; provided, however, that counsel for the
indemnifying party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or legal
proceeding, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; and
provided, further, that if the defendants in any such actions include both the
indemnified persons and the indemnifying party and the indemnified persons
shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses or rights
available to them which have not been waived and are in actual or potential
conflict with those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified
persons shall have the right to select one law firm reasonably acceptable to
the indemnifying party to act as separate counsel, on behalf of such
indemnified persons, at the expense of the indemnifying party. Unless the
indemnified persons are represented by separate counsel pursuant to the second
proviso of the immediately preceding sentence, if an indemnifying party assumes
the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding, such indemnifying party
shall not consent to entry of any judgment, or enter into any settlement, that
(a) is not subject to indemnification in accordance with the provisions in this
Article IX, (b) provides for injunctive or other non-monetary relief affecting
the indemnified persons or (c) does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified persons of
a release from all liability with respect to such claim or legal proceeding,
without the prior written consent of the indemnified persons (which consent, in
the case of clauses (b) and (c), shall

-37-
<PAGE> 42
not be unreasonably withheld); and provided, further, that, unless the
indemnified persons are represented by separate counsel pursuant to the second
proviso of the immediately preceding sentence, the indemnified persons may, at
their own expense, participate in any such proceeding with the counsel of their
choice without any right of control thereof. So long as the indemnifying party
is in good faith defending such claim or proceeding, the indemnified persons
shall not compromise or settle such claim or proceeding without the prior
written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If the indemnifying party does not assume the defense
of any such claim or litigation in accordance with the terms hereof, the
indemnified persons may defend against such claim or litigation in such manner
as they may deem appropriate, including, without limitation, settling such
claim or litigation (after giving prior written notice of the same to the
indemnifying party and obtaining the prior written consent of the indemnifying
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) on such terms as the
indemnified persons may deem appropriate, and the indemnifying party will
promptly indemnify the indemnified persons in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 9.5.

Section 9.6. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive until
the first anniversary of the Closing Date (except for the representation of HIT
pursuant to Section 2.6(b), which shall survive until the second anniversary of
the Closing Date), at which time such representations and warranties will
terminate and be of no force and effect. Any claim under this Article IX for
Loss or Expense in respect of any representations and warranties must be
asserted in writing prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, except
for such a claim in respect of the representation of HIT pursuant to Section
2.6(b), which must be asserted in writing prior to the second anniversary of
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a claim of a breach of a
representation or warranty under this Article IX is asserted in writing prior
to the applicable time period set forth above in this Section 9.6, then such
representation or warranty, as it relates to such claim, shall survive until
the Loss or Expense in respect thereof, if any, is finally determined and paid
by the indemnifying party.

Section 9.7. Satisfaction of Indemnification Obligations.
From and after the Closing, any indemnifying party who is otherwise obligated
to make an indemnification payment pursuant to this Article IX may in lieu of
such payment transfer Units (as defined in the Realty Partnership Agreement and
the Operating Partnership Agreement) pursuant to and subject to the provisions
of Section 5.5 of each of the Realty Partnership Agreement and the Operating
Partnership Agreement.
