CLARK SIGNS AGREEMENT FOR PURCHASE OF
CHEVRON'S PORT ARTHUR REFINERY

ST. LOUIS, MO, August 18, 1994 -- Clark Refining & Marketing, Inc. 
announced today that it signed a definitive agreement to purchase Chevron's
Port Arthur, Texas, refinery and related terminal facilities. The sale is
expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to Clark's review of 
environmental, title and labor issues. 
Clark and Chevron agreed to a purchase price of $74 million plus 
inventory of approximately $140 million, with a potential for a payments up 
to $125 million over five years if refining industry margins exceed certain 
levels. Chevron agreed to retain principal responsibility for environmental
clean-up of the site. 
Clark will purchase the entire refining complex and operate the refinery
and terminals. Chevron will retain operation of the chemical and lube oil 
packaging facility. 
"This acquisition is an attractive opportunity for Clark," said Paul D. 
Melnuk, president and chief executive officer of Clark. "Today's agreement
is the beginning of a long-term relationship between the companies."

The purchase of the Port Arthur refinery, with an operating capacity of 
approximately 200,000 barrels per day, will more than do current refining 
capacity. Clark has refineries in the Chicago and St. Louis areas with a 
total capacity of approximately 140,000 barrels per day. 
Clark is an independent petroleum refiner-marketer with sales in excess 
of $2 billion per year and over 5,500 employees. Clark operates 14 petroleum 
product terminals and over 800 retail gasoline and convenience stores in 12 
states. 
Clark is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Horsham Corporation. The 
Horsham Corporation is traded on the New York, Toronto, Montreal, Frankfurt 
and Berlin stock exchanges under the ticker symbol HSM.
