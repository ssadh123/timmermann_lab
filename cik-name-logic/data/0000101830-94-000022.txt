For Immediate Release

SPRINT CONFIRMS IT IS ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS
WITH FRANCE TELECOM, DEUTSCHE TELEKOM

KANSAS CITY, June 7, 1994 -- Sprint confirmed today that it 
is engaged in discussions concerning formation of a global 
partnership with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, two of the 
world's largest telecommunications operating companies. The 
partnership being discussed would concentrate mainly on providing 
seamless, global telecommunications services to business 
customers.

The discussions also contemplate that FT and DT would make 
financial investments in Sprint through purchase of a new class of 
Sprint stock at a premium, and would be represented on the Sprint 
board of directors. Terms of the possible minority equity 
purchases were not disclosed.

Sprint said the parties have reached concurrence on many 
principles, but that some issues remain. Sprint cautioned, 
however, that there is no certainty that agreement will be reached 
or that any transaction would be consummated. Sprint added that 
government approvals would be needed both in the United States and 
Europe. The issuance of a new class of stock would also require 
approval by Sprint's shareholders.

Sprint is a diversified international telecommunications 
company with more than $11 billion in annual revenues and the 
United States' only nationwide all-digital, fiber-optic network. 
Its divisions provide global long distance voice, data and video 
products and services, local telephone services and more than 6 
million subscriber lines in 19 states, and cellular operations 
that serve 42 metropolitan markets and more than 50 rural service 
areas.
