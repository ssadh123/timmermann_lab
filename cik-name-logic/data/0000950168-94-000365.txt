AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT

AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT dated as of October
19, 1994 (this "Agreement") among LADD FURNITURE, INC., a
corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of
the State of North Carolina (the "Company"); each of the
companies listed on the signature pages under the heading
"Guarantors" and any other Guarantor that shall become a party
hereto pursuant to Section 8.16 hereof (the "Guarantors", and
collectively with the Company, the "Obligors"); each of the banks
that is a signatory hereto or that may become a party hereto
after the date hereof pursuant to Section 12.06(b) hereof
(individually, a "Bank" and, collectively, the "Banks"); and
NATIONSBANK OF NORTH CAROLINA, N.A., as agent for the Banks (in
such capacity, together with its successors in such capacity, the
"Agent").

RECITALS

The Company and the Guarantors are engaged as an integrated
group in the business of manufacturing, distributing and selling
furniture and related products, and in related businesses, and in
furnishing the required supplies, services, equipment, credit and
other facilities for such integrated operation. The integrated
operation requires financing on such a basis that credit supplied
to the Company be made available from time to time to the
Guarantors, as required for the continued successful operation of
the Obligors, separately, and the integrated operation as a
whole. The Obligors entered into a Credit Agreement dated as of
January 15, 1993 with The Chase Manhattan Bank (National
Association) as Agent and certain banks party thereto in which
they were provided a credit facility in an amount of $130,000,000
(as amended, the "Prior Credit Agreement"). The Obligors have
additional needs that require a larger credit facility and have
requested current and new lenders to amend and restate the Prior
Credit Agreement to provide for an extension of credit to the
Company (to be made available by the Company to the Guarantors),
in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $190,000,000, to
finance the operations of the Obligors, to refinance certain
existing indebtedness of the Obligors and for general corporate
purposes.

To induce the Banks to extend such credit, the Obligors have
requested that the Banks and the Agent enter into this Agreement
pursuant to which the Banks will make loans to the Company and
each Guarantor will guarantee the credit so extended to the
Company. Each of the Obligors expects to derive benefit,
directly or indirectly, from the credit so extended to the
Company, both in its separate capacity and as a member of the
integrated group, since the successful operation of each of the
Obligors is dependent on 

<PAGE>

the continued successful performance of
the functions of the integrated group as a whole.

Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Section 1
Definitions and Accounting Matters

1.01 Certain Defined Terms. As used herein, the following
terms shall have the following meanings (all terms defined in
this Section 1.01 or in other provisions of this Agreement in the
singular to have the same meanings when used in the plural and
vice versa):

"Acquisition" shall mean any transaction, or any series of
related transactions, consummated after the date of this
Agreement, by which the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries
(in one transaction or as the most recent transaction in a series
of transactions) (i) acquires any going business or all or
substantially all of the assets of any firm, corporation or
division thereof, whether through purchase of assets, merger or
otherwise, (ii) directly or indirectly acquires control of at
least a majority (in number of votes) of the securities of a
corporation which have ordinary voting power for the election of
directors or (iii) directly or indirectly acquires control of a
majority ownership interest in any partnership or joint venture.

"Advance Request" shall mean a request by the Company for a
Revolving Credit Loan in a form agreed to between the Company and
the Agent.

"Affiliate" shall mean, as to any Person, any other Person
which directly or indirectly controls, or is under common control
with, or is controlled by, such Person and, if such Person is an
individual, any member of the immediate family (including
parents, spouse and children) of such individual and any trust
whose principal beneficiary is such individual or one or more
members of such immediate family and any Person who is controlled
by any such member or trust. As used in this definition,
"control" (including, with its correlative meanings, "controlled
by" and "under common control with") shall mean possession,
directly or indirectly, of power to direct or cause the direction
of management or policies (whether through ownership of
securities or partnership or other ownership interests, by
contract or otherwise), provided that, in any event, any Person
which owns directly or indirectly 20% or more of the securities
having ordinary voting power for the election of directors or
other governing body of a corporation or 20% or more of the
partnership or other ownership interests of any other Person
(other than as a limited partner of such other Person) will be
deemed to control such corporation or other Person.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no individual shall be deemed to
be an Affiliate of a corporation solely by reason of his or her
being 
-2-

<PAGE>
an officer or director of such corporation and a Person and
its Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be Affiliates of each
other.

"Agent" means NationsBank of North Carolina, N.A.

"Applicable Lending Office" shall mean, for each Bank and
for each type of Loan, the lending office of such Bank (or of an
affiliate of such Bank) designated for such type of Loan on the
signature pages hereof or such other office of such Bank (or of
an Affiliate of such Bank) as such Bank may from time to time
specify to the Agent and the Company as the office by which its
Loans of such type are to be made and maintained.

"Applicable Margin" shall mean .875% per annum; provided,
however, that (A) if on any Quarterly Date (i) the Leverage Ratio
is less than 35% or (ii) the Company has attained a long term
credit rating of Baa3 or better from Moody's Investors Services,
Inc. or BBB- or better from Standard and Poor's Corporation, then
the "Applicable Margin" shall be reduced, beginning with the next
Eurodollar Loan made after the Applicable Margin Change Date
(whether as a new advance or the conversion or continuation of a
currently existing Loan into a Eurodollar Loan), or with respect
to an existing Eurodollar Loan on the next Interest Payment Date
with respect thereto, to .625% per annum until the next
Applicable Margin Change Date (at which time a new determination
shall be made as to whether the Company meets the requirements of
(i) or (ii) above and, thus, whether it is necessary to adjust
the Applicable Margin, which such adjustment shall be effective
with the next Eurodollar Loan made after the Applicable Margin
Change Date (whether as a new advance or the conversion or
continuation of a currently existing Loan into a Eurodollar
Loan), or with respect to an existing Eurodollar Loan on the next
Interest Payment Date with respect thereto), and (B)
notwithstanding whether the Company meets the requirements of
A(i) or A(ii) above, if on any Quarterly Date subsequent to the
Quarterly Date nearest March, 1997, the ratio of Senior Debt at
such time to Capital at such time is greater than 45%, then the
Applicable Margin shall be increased, beginning with the next
Eurodollar Loan made after the Applicable Margin Change Date
(whether as a new advance or the conversion or continuation of a
currently existing Loan into a Eurodollar Loan), or with respect
to an existing Eurodollar Loan on the next Interest Payment Date
with respect thereto, to 1.125% until the next Applicable Margin
Change Date (at which time a new determination shall be made as
to the Applicable Margin for such period). 

"Applicable Margin Change Date" shall mean, for each
Quarterly Period, the date of delivery by the Borrower of the
quarterly compliance certificate required by Section 8.01 hereof;
provided, that if the Applicable Margin is to change because the
Company has obtained (or failed to maintain) the long term credit
rating set forth in (A)(ii) of the definition of Applicable
Margin, then 
-3-

<PAGE>
Applicable Margin Change Date shall mean the
Quarterly Date which begins such Quarterly Period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, the "Applicable Margin"
shall be .875% or 1.125%, as applicable, (regardless of whether
the Company meets the requirements of (A)(i) or (A)(ii) above)
for the period from the occurrence of such Default or Event of
Default and so long as the same shall be continuing. 

"Base Rate" shall mean, with respect to any Base Rate Loan,
for any day, the higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate for such
day, plus .5% per annum or (b) the Prime Rate for such day;
provided that if in the reasonable judgment of the Agent the
Federal Funds Rate cannot be determined then the Base Rate shall
mean the Prime Rate. Each change in any interest rate provided
for herein based upon the Base Rate resulting from a change in
the Base Rate shall take effect at the time of such change in the
Base Rate.

"Base Rate Loans" shall mean Revolving Credit Loans accruing
interest at the Base Rate and that portion of the Term Loan which
bears interest at the Base Rate.

"Base Rate Revolving Loan" shall mean a Revolving Credit
Loan accruing interest at the Base Rate.

"Basic Documents" shall mean, collectively, this Agreement,
the Notes and the Pledge Agreements.

"Business Day" shall mean any day on which commercial banks
are not authorized or required to close in New York City or
Charlotte, North Carolina and, if such day relates to a borrowing
of, a payment or prepayment of principal of or interest on, or a
conversion of or into, or an Interest Period for, a Eurodollar
Loan or a notice by the Company with respect to any such
borrowing, payment, prepayment, conversion or Interest Period,
then a day which is also a day on which dealings in Dollar
deposits are carried out in the London interbank market.

"Capital" shall mean, as at any date for the Company and the
Consolidated Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in accordance
with GAAP, the difference of (i) total assets as at such date
minus (ii) total current liabilities as at such date plus (iii)
any portion of long-term debt included in current liabilities as
at such date plus (iv) Indebtedness that is classified in
accordance with GAAP as other short-term borrowings as at such
date.

"Capital Lease Obligations" shall mean, as to any Person,
the obligations of such Person to pay rent or other amounts under
a lease of (or other agreement conveying the right to use) real
and/or personal property which obligations are required to be
classified and accounted for as a capital lease on a balance
sheet 

-4-

<PAGE>

of such Person under GAAP (including Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 13 of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board) and, for purposes of this Agreement, the amount of such
obligations shall be the capitalized amount thereof, determined
in accordance with GAAP (including such Statement No. 13).

"Change in Control" of the Company shall be deemed to have
occurred if, after the date hereof, any Person or related group
of Persons (other than Senior Managers employed on the date
hereof, in respect of voting securities acquired while they are
Senior Managers) shall come into possession of, directly or

of Competitive Bid Loans outstanding shall not exceed the
Revolving Credit Commitment and (y) if a Bank does make a

(ii) Competitive Bid Requests. The Company may
solicit Competitive Bids by delivery of a Competitive Bid
Request to the Agent by 12:00 noon (Charlotte, North
Carolina time) on a Business Day not less than three (3) nor

<PAGE>

to the Company for its records as soon as practicable.

Competitive Bid offered to it. To accept a Competitive Bid,
the Company shall give oral notification of its acceptance
of any or all such Competitive Bids to the Agent by 11:00
a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the proposed date
of a Competitive Bid Loan advance which shall be confirmed
in writing by the Company by the end of the day; provided,
however, (1) the failure by the Company to give timely

deemed to be a refusal thereof, (2) to the extent
Competitive Bids are for comparable Interest Periods, the
Company may accept Competitive Bids only in ascending order
of rates, (3) the aggregate amount of Competitive Bids
accepted by the Company shall not exceed the principal
amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request, (4) if the
Company shall accept a bid or bids made at a particular
Competitive Bid Rate, but the amount of such bid or bids
shall cause the total amount of bids to be accepted by the
Company to be in excess of the amount specified in the
Competitive Bid Request, then the Company shall accept a
portion of such bid or bids in an amount equal to the amount
specified in the Competitive Bid Request less the amount of
all other Competitive Bids accepted with respect to such
Competitive Bid Request, which acceptance in the case of
multiple bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be made
pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such bid at
such Competitive Bid Rate and (5) no bid shall be accepted
for a Competitive Bid Loan unless such Competitive Bid Loan
is in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral
multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof, except that where a
portion of a Competitive Bid is accepted in accordance with
the provisions of subsection (4) hereof, then in a minimum
principal amount of $100,000 and integral multiples thereof
(but not in any event less than the minimum amount specified
in the Competitive Bid), and in calculating the pro rata
allocation of acceptances of portions of multiple bids at a
particular Competitive Bid Rate pursuant to subsection (4)
hereof, the amounts shall be rounded to integral multiples
of $100,000 in a manner which shall be in the discretion of
the Company. A notice of acceptance of a Competitive Bid
given by the Company in accordance with the provisions
hereof shall be irrevocable. The Agent shall, not later
than 1:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the
proposed date of a Competitive Bid Loan advance, notify each
bidding Bank whether or not its Competitive Bid has been
accepted (and if so, in what amount and at what Competitive
Bid Rate), and each successful bidder will thereupon become
bound, subject to the 

-21-

<PAGE>

other applicable conditions hereof, to make the Competitive 
Bid Loan in respect of which its bid has been accepted.

(v) Funding of Competitive Bid Loans. Each Bank
which is to make a Competitive Bid Loan shall make its
Competitive Bid Loan advance available to the Agent by 3:00
P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date specified
in the Competitive Bid Request by deposit in Dollars of
immediately available funds at the office of the Agent in
Charlotte, North Carolina, or at such other address as the
Agent may designate in writing. The Agent will, upon
receipt, make the proceeds of such Competitive Bid Loans
available to the Company.

(vi) Maturity of Competitive Bid Loans. Each
Competitive Bid Loan shall mature and be due and payable in
full on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto. Unless the Company shall give notice to the Agent
otherwise, or a Default or Event of Default exists and is
continuing, the Company shall be deemed to have requested a
Revolving Credit Loan advance in the amount of the maturing
Competitive Bid Loan, accruing interest at the Base Rate,
the proceeds of which will be used to repay such Competitive
Bid Loan.

(c) Method of Borrowing for Revolving Credit Loans. 

(i) Base Rate Revolving Loans. By no later than
11:00 a.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the date of
the request for the advance, the Company shall submit an
Advance Request to the Agent setting forth the amount
requested, the desire to have such Revolving Credit Loan
accrue interest at the Base Rate and complying in all
respects with Section 6 hereof.

(ii) Eurodollar Revolving Loans. By no later than
11:00 a.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time, three Business
Days prior to the date of the request for the advance, the
Company shall submit an Advance Request to the Agent setting
forth the amount thereof, the desire to have such Revolving
Credit Loan accrue interest at the Eurodollar Rate, the
Interest Period applicable thereto and complying in all
respects with Section 6 hereof.

(iii) Conversion and Continuation. The Company
shall have the option, on any Business Day, to continue an
existing Eurodollar Revolving Loan into a subsequent
Interest Period, to convert a Base Rate Revolving Loan into
a Eurodollar Revolving Loan or to convert a Eurodollar
Revolving Loan into a Base Rate Revolving Loan; provided,
however, that (i) except as provided in Section 5.03,
Eurodollar Revolving Loans may be converted into Base Rate
Loans only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable
thereto; (ii) Eurodollar Revolving 

-22-

<PAGE>

Loans may be continued and Base Rate Loans may be converted into
Eurodollar Revolving Loans only if no Default or Event of Default
is in existence on the date of extension or conversion; (iii) any
continuation or conversion must comply with all requirements
of this Agreement including, without limitation, the timely
delivery of an Advance Request duly completed; (iv) no more
than ten different Eurodollar Loans may be outstanding under
this Agreement at any one time; and (v) failure by the
Company to properly continue a Eurodollar Revolving Loan at
the end of an Interest Period shall be deemed a conversion
to a Base Rate Revolving Loan.

(d) Funding of Revolving Loans. Upon receipt of an
Advance Request for a Revolving Credit Loan, the Agent shall
promptly inform the Banks as to the terms thereof. Each Bank
will make its pro rata share of each Revolving Credit Loan
available to the Agent by 1:00 p.m. Charlotte, North Carolina
time, on the date specified in the Advance Request by deposit (in
Dollars) of immediately available funds at the offices of the
Agent at its principal office in Charlotte, North Carolina, or at
such other address as the Agent may designate in writing. All
Revolving Credit Loans shall be made by the Banks pro rata on the
basis of each Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage. 

2.02 Term Loan. 

(a) The Term Loan. Each Bank severally agrees, on
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to make a single
term loan to the Company in Dollars on the Effective Date in
an amount equal to (but not exceeding) the amount of such
Bank's Term Loan Commitment Percentage of the Term Loan
Commitment. 

(b) Method of Choosing Interest Rate under the Term
Loan.

(i) Base Rate. By no later than 11:00 a.m.,
Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the date of the
request, the Company shall provide to the Agent a
Term Loan Interest Rate Request setting forth the
amount of the Term Loan that it wishes to have accrue
interest at the Base Rate. From that date forward,
interest shall accrue on that portion of the Term
Loan as set forth in the Term Loan Interest Rate
Request until requested otherwise by the Company. 

(ii) Eurodollar Rate. By no later than
11:00 a.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time, three
Business Days prior to when the Company wishes to
have all or a portion of the Term Loan accrue
interest at the Eurodollar Rate, the Company shall
provide to the Agent a Term Loan Interest Rate
Request setting forth 

-23-

<PAGE>

the amount of the Term Loan it
wishes to have accrue interest at the Eurodollar
Rate, and the Interest Period for which such rate
shall be applicable; provided, however, that (A) the
Company may not request all or part of the Term Loan
to accrue interest at the Eurodollar Rate during the
existence and continuation of a Default or Event of
Default and (B) no more than ten different Eurodollar
Loans may be outstanding under this Agreement at any
one time. From the date three Business Days after
such Term Loan Interest Rate Request is received and
approved, interest shall accrue on that portion of
the Term Loan for the Interest Period specified as
set forth in the Term Loan Interest Rate Request.

(iii) Failure to Submit a Term Loan Interest Rate
Request. If the Company fails to timely submit a Term
Loan Interest Rate Request stating a desire to have
all or a portion of the Term Loan accrue interest at
the Eurodollar Rate (whether on the Effective Date or
at the end of an Interest Period applicable thereto)
or if the Company submits an improper Term Loan
Interest Rate Request, then the Term Loan (or such
portion thereof) shall accrue interest at the Base
Rate until the Agent receives a proper request from
the Company. 

2.03 Reductions of Revolving Credit Commitment.

Upon at least three Business Days notice, the Company shall
have the right to permanently terminate or reduce the aggregate
unused amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment at any time or
from time to time; provided that (i) each partial reduction
shall be in an aggregate amount at least equal to $10,000,000 and
in integral multiples of $1,000,000 above such amount and (ii) no
reduction shall be made which would reduce the Revolving Credit
Commitment to an amount less than the sum of (1) the then
outstanding Revolving Credit Loans plus (2) the then outstanding
Competitive Bid Loans. The Revolving Credit Commitment shall
also be reduced as provided in Section 2.08(b) hereof. Any
reduction in (or termination of) the Revolving Credit Commitment
shall be permanent and may not be reinstated.

2.04 Commitment Fees. The Company shall pay to the Agent
for account of each Bank a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee")
on the daily average unused amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitment, for the period from and including the Effective Date
to but not including the Revolving Credit Commitment Termination
Date, at a rate per annum equal to (A) .25% or (B) if on any
Quarterly Date the Company has (1) a Leverage Ratio less than 35%
or (2) attained a long term credit rating of Baa3 or better from
Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or BBB- or better from Standard
and Poor's Corporation, then .20% or (C) notwithstanding whether
the Company 

-24-

<PAGE>

has met the requirements of (B)(1) or (B)(2) above,
if on any Quarterly Date subsequent to the Quarterly Date nearest
March, 1997, the ratio of Senior Debt at such time to Capital at
such time is greater than 45%, then .375%. For the purpose of
calculating the Commitment Fee, the amount outstanding as
Competitive Bid Loans shall not be included in the amount used
under the Revolving Credit Commitment (notwithstanding the fact
that the amount of Competitive Bid Loans outstanding reduces
availability under the Revolving Credit Commitment). The
applicable Commitment Fee percentage shall be determined on each
Quarterly Payment Date for the preceding Quarterly Period. The
Commitment Fee shall be payable in arrears on each Quarterly
Payment Date, on the date of any reduction in the Revolving
Credit Commitment and on the Revolving Credit Commitment
Termination Date.

2.05 Lending Offices. The Loans of each type made by each
Bank shall be made and maintained at such Bank's Applicable
Lending Office for Loans of such type.

2.06 Several Obligations; Remedies Independent. The
failure of any Bank to make any Loan to be made by it on the date
specified therefor shall not relieve any other Bank of its
obligation to make its Loan on such date, but neither any Bank
nor the Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Bank to make a Loan to be made by such other Bank. The amounts
payable by the Company at any time hereunder and under the Notes
to each Bank shall be a separate and independent debt and,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Bank shall be
entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this
Agreement and the Notes, and it shall not be necessary for any
other Bank or the Agent to consent to, or be joined as an
additional party in, any proceedings for such purposes.

2.07 Notes.

(a) Revolving Notes. The Revolving Credit Loans made by
the Banks shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of the
Company to each Bank in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1
hereto (the "Revolving Credit Loan Note"), dated the Effective

account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Bank
on its books and, prior to any transfer of the Revolving Credit
Loan Note held by it, endorsed by such Bank on the schedule
attached to such Note or any continuation thereof; provided that
the failure of such Bank to make any such recordation or
endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Company to

such Note in respect of the Loans to be evidenced by such 

-25-

<PAGE>

Note, and each such recordation or endorsement shall be conclusive 
and binding absent manifest error.

made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by
such Bank on its books and, prior to any transfer of the Term
Loan Note held by it, endorsed by such Bank on the schedule
attached to such Note or any continuation thereof; provided that
the failure of such Bank to make any such recordation or
endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Company to
make a payment when due of any amount owing hereunder or under
such Note in respect of the Loan to be evidenced by such Note,
and each such recordation or endorsement shall be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error.

(c) Competitive Bid Notes. The Competitive Bid Loans made
by a Bank shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of the
Company to each Bank in substantially the form of Exhibit A-3
hereto (the "Competitive Bid Loan Note"), dated the Effective

amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment and otherwise duly
completed. The amount, type, interest rate and duration of

the Company, and each payment made on account of the principal
thereof, shall be recorded by such Bank on its books and, prior
to any transfer of the Competitive Bid Loan Note held by it,
endorsed by such Bank on the schedule attached to such Note or
any continuation thereof; provided that the failure of such Bank
to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the
obligations of the Company to make a payment when due of any
amount owing hereunder or under such Note in respect of the Loans
to be evidenced by such Note, and each such recordation or
endorsement shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest
error.

(d) Exchange of Notes. No Bank shall be entitled to have
any of its Notes subdivided, by exchange for promissory notes of
lesser denominations or otherwise, except in connection with a
permitted assignment of all or any portion of such Bank's
Commitment, Loans and Notes pursuant to Section 12.06(b) hereof.

2.08 Prepayments.

(a) Voluntary Prepayments. Subject to Section 4.04 hereof,
and upon at least three Business Days notice, the Company shall
have the right to prepay Loans; provided that Eurodollar Loans

such 

-26-

<PAGE>

Loans. Voluntary prepayments of the Loans shall be applied
as the Company shall direct; provided that prepayments of the
Term Loans shall be applied pro rata in accordance with the then
outstanding principal amount (i.e. applied pro-rata to the
remaining installments including the final installment due on the
Term Loan Maturity Date).

(b) Mandatory Prepayments. 

(i) Recapture. Forty five days after each Quarterly
Date, the Company shall prepay the principal amount of the
Loans in an amount equal to (A) all cash Net Proceeds
received by the Company on or after January 2, 1994 from an
Equity Issuance or a Debt Issuance that are not otherwise
paid to the Banks pursuant to Section 2.08(b)(iii) plus (B)
all Net Proceeds received by the Company from Dispositions

1994 in either Acquisitions or capital expenditures plus (D)
all Dividend Payments made by the Company on or after
January 2, 1994 to the extent any such Dividend Payments are
either a special or non recurring Dividend Payment or exceed
by 50% the Company's regularly scheduled Dividend Payment as
at the most recent preceding scheduled dividend payment date
(a "Special Dividend Payment") minus (E) 15% of Total
Tangible Assets as at the most recent preceding Quarterly
Date minus (F) all amounts previously paid to the Banks
pursuant to this Section 2.08(b)(i); provided, that any
amount less than $2,000,000 need not be paid at that time. 

(ii) Overadvance. If, at any time, the sum of
Revolving Credit Loans outstanding plus Competitive Bid

then the Company shall immediately make a payment in the
amount of the deficiency.

month, the ratio of Senior Debt at such time to Capital at
such time is greater than 45%, all cash Net Proceeds from
(A) an Equity Issuance or (B) a Debt Issuance by the Company
shall be paid by the Company to the Banks to the extent
necessary to reduce the ratio of Senior Debt at such time to
Capital at such time to 45%. 

Mandatory prepayments shall be applied: first, (A)
if pursuant to subsection (i) above, pro rata to the
remaining installments of the Term Loan on the basis
provided in Section 2.08(a) hereof, or (B) if pursuant to
Subsection (iii) above, to the remaining installments of the
Term Loan in the inverse order of maturity; second, to the
Revolving Credit Loans; provided that, upon any such
prepayment of the Revolving 

-27-

<PAGE>

Credit Loans under Subsection (i) or (iii) above, the 
Revolving Credit Commitment shall
automatically be reduced on such date by the amount of such
prepayment and, if the amount available for prepayment as
aforesaid exceeds the amount of Revolving Credit Loans
outstanding on such date, the Revolving Credit Commitment
shall be further reduced on such date by such excess amount;
and third, if the Term Loan is paid in full and the
Revolving Credit Commitment has been reduced to zero, to the
Competitive Bid Loans on a pro rata basis to each Bank
holding Competitive Bid Loans.

or any Note for account of a Bank shall be paid promptly (and if
received by the time set forth in (a) above on the same Business
Day) to such Bank, in immediately available funds, for account of
such Bank's Applicable Lending Office for the Loan in respect of
which such payment is made.

(d) If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or
any Note would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business
Day such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business
Day and interest shall be payable for any principal so extended
for the period of such extension (except that in the case of a
payment where the next succeeding Business Day falls in the next
succeeding calendar month, then on the next preceding day).

4.02 Pro Rata Treatment. (a) each borrowing from the Banks
under Sections 2.01(a) and 2.02(a) hereof shall be made pro rata
from the Banks, each payment of Commitment Fees under Section
2.04 hereof shall be made pro rata for the account of the Banks,
and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Revolving
Credit Commitment under Sections 2.03 or 2.08(b) hereof shall be
applied to the Revolving Credit Commitment pro rata according to
the Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages of each Bank; (b) the
making, conversion and continuation of Revolving Credit Loans and
the making of the Term Loan and the allocation of interest rate
options thereunder (other than as provided for by Section 5.04
hereof) shall be made pro rata among the Banks according to the
amounts of their respective Revolving and Term Commitment
Percentages; (c) each payment or prepayment of principal of
Revolving Credit Loans and the Term Loan by the Company shall be
made for the account of the Banks pro rata in accordance with the
respective unpaid principal amounts of such Loans held by the

and the Term Loan by the Company shall be made for the account of
the Banks pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest due

Competitive Bid Loans, the Commitment Fee and on all other
amounts 

-30-

<PAGE>

owing by the Company (other than Base Rate Loans) shall
be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which payable and (b) interest on
Base Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365
or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in
the period for which payable.

4.04 Minimum Amounts. Except for conversions or
prepayments made pursuant to Section 5.04 hereof, each borrowing,
conversion or prepayment of principal of Loans shall be in an
amount equal to at least (a) in the case of Base Rate Loans,
$250,000, (b) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, $5,000,000 (or, in
the case of any prepayment, $1,000,000; provided that any
prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan is subject to Section 5.05) and
in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of such amounts and
(c) in the case of Competitive Bid Loans, $5,000,000 (in the
aggregate per Competitive Bid Request) and in integral multiples
of $1,000,000 in excess of such amount. Each borrowing,
prepayment or conversion of or into Loans of different types or,
if applicable, having different Interest Periods, shall be deemed
to be different borrowings, prepayments or conversions for the
purposes of the foregoing. 

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
the aggregate principal amount of Eurodollar Loans having the
same Interest Period shall be at least equal to $5,000,000 and,
if any Eurodollar Loans would otherwise be in a lesser principal
amount for any period, such Loans shall be Base Rate Loans during
such period.

4.05 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Agent
shall have been notified by a Bank or the Company (the "Payor")
prior to the date on which the Payor is scheduled to make payment
to the Agent of (in the case of a Bank) the proceeds of a Loan to
be made by it hereunder or (in the case of the Company) a payment
to the Agent for account of one or more of the Banks hereunder
(such payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which
notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not
intend to make the Required Payment to the Agent, the Agent may
assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in
reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to),
make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient(s) on
such date and, if the Payor has not in fact made the Required
Payment to the Agent, the recipient(s) of such payment shall, on
demand, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together
with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period
commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the
Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per
annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day and, if such
recipient(s) shall fail promptly to make such payment, the Agent
shall be entitled to recover such amount, on demand, from the
Payor, together with interest as aforesaid.

<PAGE>

4.06 Sharing of Payments, Etc..

(a) Each Obligor agrees that, in addition to (and without
limitation of) any right of set-off, bankers' lien or
counterclaim a Bank may otherwise have, each Bank shall be
entitled, at its option, to offset balances held by it for
account of such Obligor at any of its offices, in Dollars or in
any other currency, against any principal of or interest on any
Loans, or any other amount payable to such Bank hereunder, which
is not paid when due (regardless of whether such balances are
then due to such Obligor), in which case it shall promptly notify
the Company, such Obligor and the Agent thereof; provided that
such Bank's failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity thereof.

(b) If any Bank shall obtain payment of any principal of or
interest on any Loan through the exercise of any right of set-
off, banker's lien or counterclaim or similar right or otherwise,
and, as a result of such payment, such Bank shall have received a
greater percentage of the principal or interest then due
hereunder to such Bank on such Loans than the percentage received
by any other Banks, it shall promptly purchase from such other
Banks participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by
such Bank, direct interests in) the Loans made by such other
Banks (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) in such
amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as
shall be equitable, to the end that all the Banks shall share the
benefit of such excess payment (net of any expenses which may be
incurred by such Bank in obtaining or preserving such excess
payment) pro rata in accordance with the unpaid principal and/or
interest on the Loans held by each of the Banks. To such end all
the Banks shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by
the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment
is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.

(c) Each Obligor agrees that any Bank so purchasing a
participation (or direct interest) in the Loans made by other
Banks (or in interest due thereon, as the case may be) may
exercise all rights of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim or
similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if
such Bank were a direct holder of Loans in the amount of such
participation.

(d) Nothing contained herein shall require any Bank to
exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Bank to
exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right
with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of any
Obligor. If, under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar law, any Bank receives a secured claim in lieu of a
set-off to which this Section 4.06 applies, such Bank shall, to
the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such
secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Banks
entitled under this Section 4.06 to share in the benefits of any
recovery on such secured claim.

4.07 Tax Liabilities.

(a) Any and all payments by the Company hereunder or under
any of the Basic Documents shall be made, in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof, free and clear of and without deduction
for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto ("Taxes"). If the Company shall be required by
law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Bank, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
may be necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section 4.07) such Bank receives an amount equal to the sum
it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the
Company shall make such deductions, (iii) the Company shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority
in accordance with applicable law, and (iv) the Company shall
deliver to such Bank evidence of such payment to the relevant
taxation authority or other authority.

(b) In addition, the Company agrees to pay, upon notice
from a Bank and prior to the date when penalties attach thereto,
all present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other
excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies of the United
States or any state or political subdivision thereof or any
applicable foreign jurisdiction that arise from any payment made
hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or
otherwise with respect to, this Agreement.

Section 5
Yield Protection and Illegality

5.01 Additional Costs.

(a) The Company shall pay directly to each Bank from time
to time such amounts as such Bank may determine to be necessary
to compensate it for any costs which such Bank determines are
attributable to its making of or maintaining any Eurodollar Loans
or its obligation to make any Eurodollar Loans hereunder, or any
reduction in any amount receivable by such Bank hereunder in
respect of any of such Loans or such obligation (such increases
in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called
"Additional Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change which:

(i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts
payable to such Bank under this Agreement or its Notes in
respect of any of such Loans (other than taxes imposed on or
measured by the overall net income of such Bank or of its
Applicable Lending Office for any of such Loans by the
jurisdiction in which such Bank has its principal office or
such Applicable Lending Office); or

-33-

<PAGE>

(ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirements (other than the Reserve
Requirement utilized in the determination of the Fixed Rate
for such Loan) relating to any extensions of credit or other
assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of,
such Bank (including any of such Loans or any deposits
referred to in the definition of "Fixed Base Rate" in
Section 1.01 hereof), or any commitment of such Bank
hereunder; or

(iii) imposes any other condition affecting this
Agreement or its Notes (or any of such extensions of credit
or liabilities) or the Commitment.

If any Bank requests compensation from the Company under this
Section 5.01(a), the Company may, by notice to such Bank (with a
copy to the Agent), suspend the obligation of such Bank to make
or continue Loans of the type with respect to which such
compensation is requested, or to convert Loans of any other type
into Loans of such type, until the Regulatory Change giving rise
to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the
provisions of Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable).

(b) Without limiting the effect of the provisions of
Section 5.01(a) hereof, in the event that, by reason of any
Regulatory Change, any Bank either (i) incurs Additional Costs
based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the
amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such
Bank which includes deposits by reference to which the interest
rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in this
Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets
of such Bank which includes Eurodollar Loans or (ii) becomes
subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of
liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if such Bank so
elects by notice to the Company (with a copy to the Agent), the
obligation of such Bank to make or continue, or to convert Loans
of any other type into, Loans of such type hereunder shall be
suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in
which case the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof shall be
applicable).

(c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions
of this Section 5.01 (but without duplication), the Company shall
pay directly to each Bank from time to time on request such
amounts as such Bank may determine to be necessary to compensate
such Bank for any costs which it determines are attributable to
the maintenance by such Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office),
pursuant to any law or regulation or any interpretation,
directive or request (whether or not having the force of law) of
any court or governmental or monetary authority following any
Regulatory Change, or pursuant to any risk-based capital
guideline or other requirement (whether or not having the force
of law and whether or not the failure to comply therewith would
be unlawful) heretofore or hereafter issued by any government or
governmental or

supervisory authority, including any implementing
at the national level of the Basle Accord, including, without
limitation, (i) the Final Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR Part
208, Appendix A; 12 CFR Part 225, Appendix A), (ii) the Final
Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (12 CFR Part 3, Appendix A) and (iii) the Final
Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (12 CFR Part 325)), of capital in respect of its
Commitments or Loans (such compensation to include, without
limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate of
return on assets or equity of such Bank (or any Applicable
Lending Office) to a level below that which such Bank (or any
Applicable Lending office) could have achieved but for such law,
regulation, interpretation, directive or request). For purposes
of this Section 5.01(c), "Basle Accord" shall mean the proposals
for risk-based capital framework described by the Basle Committee
on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices in its paper
entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and
Capital Standards" dated July 1988, as amended, modified and
supplemented and in effect from time to time or any replacement
thereof.

(d) Each Bank will notify the Company (with a copy to the
Agent) of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement
that will entitle such Bank to compensation under paragraph (a)
or (c) of this Section 5.01 as promptly as practicable, but in
any event within 60 days, after such Bank obtains actual
knowledge thereof; provided that if any Bank fails to give such
notice within 60 days after it obtains actual knowledge of such
an event, such Bank shall, with respect to compensation payable
pursuant to this Section 5.01 in respect of any costs resulting
from such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section
5.01 for costs incurred from and after the date 60 days prior to
the date that such Bank does give such notice; and provided,
further, that each Bank will designate a different Applicable
Lending Office for the Loans of such Bank affected by such event
if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such compensation and will not, in the sole opinion of such
Bank, be disadvantageous to such Bank, except that such Bank
shall have no obligation to designate an Applicable Lending
Office located in the United States of America. Each Bank will
furnish to the Company a certificate setting forth the basis and
amount of each request by such Bank for compensation under
paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 5.01. Determinations and
allocations by any Bank for purposes of this Section 5.01 of the
effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or
(b) hereof, or of the effect of capital maintained pursuant to
Section 5.01(c) hereof, on its costs or rate of return of
maintaining Loans or its obligation to make Loans, or on amounts
receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of the amounts required
to compensate such Bank under this Section 5.01, shall be
conclusive, provided that such determinations and allocations are
made on a reasonable basis.

-35-

<PAGE>

5.02 Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of
any Fixed Base Rate for any Interest Period:

(a) the Agent determines (which determination shall
be conclusive) that quotations of interest rates for the
relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "Fixed
Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof are not being provided in
the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for
purposes of determining rates of interest for Eurodollar
Loans as provided herein; or

(b) the Majority Banks determine (which
determination shall be conclusive) and notify the Agent that
the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definition
of "Fixed Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof upon the basis
of which the rate of interest for Eurodollar Loans for such
Interest Period is to be determined are not likely
adequately to cover the cost to such Banks of making or
maintaining such type of Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Company and each Bank prompt notice
thereof, and so long as such condition remains in effect, the
Banks shall be under no obligation to make additional Loans of
such type, to continue Loans of such type or to convert Loans of
any other type into Loans of such type and the Company shall, on
the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the
outstanding Loans of such type, either prepay such Loans or
convert such Loans into Base Rate Loans. 

5.03 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any
Bank or its Applicable Lending Office to honor its obligation to
make or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Bank shall
promptly notify the Company thereof (with a copy to the Agent)
and such Bank's obligation to make or continue, or to convert
Loans of any other type into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended
until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain
Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 5.04
hereof shall be applicable).

5.04 Treatment of Affected Loans. If the obligation of any
Bank to make or continue, or to convert Loans of any other type
into, Loans of a particular type is suspended pursuant to Section
5.01 or 5.03 hereof (Loans of such type being herein called
"Affected Loans" and such type being herein called the "Affected
Type"), such Bank's Affected Loans shall be automatically
converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then
current Interest Period(s) for the Affected Loans (or, in the
case of a conversion required by Section 5.01(b) or 5.03 hereof,
on such earlier date as such Bank may specify to the Company with
a copy to the Agent) and, unless and until such Bank gives notice
as provided 

-36-

<PAGE>

below that the circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03 
hereof which gave rise to such conversion no longer exist:

(a) to the extent that such Bank's Affected Loans
have been so converted, all payments and prepayments of
principal which would otherwise be applied to such Bank's
Affected Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate
Loans; and

(b) all Loans which would otherwise be made or
continued by such Bank as Loans of the Affected Type shall
be made or continued instead as Base Rate Loans and all
Loans of such Bank which would otherwise be converted into
Loans of the Affected Type shall be converted instead into
(or shall remain as) Base Rate Loans.

If such Bank gives notice to the Company (with a copy to the
Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03
hereof which gave rise to the conversion of such Bank's Affected
Loans pursuant to this Section 5.04 no longer exist (which such
Bank agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to
exist) at a time when Loans of the Affected Type are outstanding,
such Bank's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically converted, on
the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for
such outstanding Loans of the Affected Type, to the extent
necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by
the Banks holding Loans of the Affected Type and by such Bank are
held pro rata (as to principal amounts, types and Interest
Periods) in accordance with their respective commitments.

5.05 Compensation. The Company shall pay to the Agent for
account of each Bank, upon the request of such Bank through the
Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the
reasonable opinion of such Bank) to compensate it for any loss,
cost or expense which such Bank determines are attributable to:

(a) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a
Eurodollar Loan made by such Bank for any reason (including,
without limitation, any mandatory prepayment pursuant to
Section 2.08 hereof or the acceleration of the Loans
pursuant to Section 9 hereof) on a date other than the last
day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or

(b) any failure by the Company for any reason
(including, without limitation, the failure of any of the
conditions precedent specified in Section 6 hereof to be
satisfied) to borrow a Eurodollar Loan from such Bank, or
make a conversion into a Eurodollar Loan of such Bank on the
date for such borrowing or conversion specified in the
relevant notice of borrowing or conversion given pursuant to
Section 2.01 or 2.02 hereof, as the case may be.

-37-

<PAGE>

Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such
compensation shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of (i) the amount of interest which otherwise would have accrued
on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or converted or not
borrowed for the period from the date of such payment,
prepayment, conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of
the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case
of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan which
would have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing) at
the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein
over (ii) the interest component of the amount such Bank would
have bid in the London interbank market for Dollar deposits of
leading banks in amounts comparable to such principal amount and
with maturities comparable to such period (as reasonably
determined by such Bank).

5.06 Replacement of Bank in Event of Adverse Condition. In
the event the Company becomes obligated to pay additional amounts
to any Bank pursuant to Section 5.01 hereof as a result of any
condition described in such Section or in the event that any Bank
gives notice of an election to suspend its obligation to make
Eurodollar Loans pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof, then,
unless a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing or such Bank has theretofore taken steps to remove or
cure, and has removed or cured, the conditions creating the cause
for such obligation to pay such additional amounts, or has
revoked such election, as the case may be, the Company may
designate another bank (such bank being herein called a
"Replacement Bank") acceptable to the Agent (which acceptance
will not be unreasonably withheld) to assume such Bank's
Commitments hereunder and to purchase the Loans and Notes of such
Bank and such Bank's rights hereunder, without recourse to or
representation or warranty (except for its own acts) by, or
expense to, such Bank for a purchase price equal to the
outstanding principal amount of the Loans and Notes payable to
such Bank plus any accrued but unpaid interest on such Loans and
Notes and accrued but unpaid Commitment Fees in respect of such
Bank's Commitment Percentages, and upon such assumption and
purchase and subject to the execution and delivery to the Agent
by the Replacement Bank of documentation satisfactory to the
Agent (pursuant to which such Replacement Bank shall assume the
obligations of such original Bank under this Agreement), the
Replacement Bank shall succeed to the rights and obligations of
such Bank hereunder and such Bank shall no longer be a party
hereto or have any rights hereunder (provided that the
obligations of the Company under Section 5.01 accrued prior to
such replacement and under Section 12.03 hereof shall survive
such replacement).

automatically become immediately due and payable without
presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by each Obligor.
Subsequent to an Event of Default, the Agent (with the consent of
the Majority Banks) may and, upon the request of the Majority
Banks, shall have the right to exercise any remedies it may have

Section 10
The Agent

10.01 Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Bank hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act as its agent
hereunder with such powers as are specifically delegated to the
Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent (which
term as used in this sentence and in Section 10.05 and the first
sentence of Section 10.06 hereof shall include reference to its
affiliates and its own and its affiliates' officers, directors,
employees and agents): (a) shall have no duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this
Agreement, and shall not by reason of this Agreement be a trustee
for any Bank; (b) shall not be responsible to the Banks for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement, or in any certificate or other document referred
to or provided for in, or received by any of them under, this
Agreement, or for the value, validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Basic Document or any other document referred to or
provided for herein or therein or for any failure by the Company
or any other Person to perform any of its obligations hereunder
or thereunder; (c) shall not be required to initiate or conduct
any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder or under any
other Basic Document; and (d) shall not be responsible for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any
other Basic Document or under any other document or instrument
referred to or provided for herein or therein or in connection
herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Agent may employ agents and attorneys-
in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it
in good faith. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of any
Note as the holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and
until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof
shall have been filed with the Agent, together with the written
consent of the Company to such assignment or transfer, and the
Agent shall have consented to such assignment or transfer.

-60-
<PAGE>
10.02 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon any certification, notice or other communication
(including any thereof by telephone, telecopy, telex, telegram or
cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Agent with
reasonable care. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement or any other Basic Document, the Agent shall in
all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, hereunder and thereunder in accordance with instructions
signed by the Majority Banks, and such instructions of the
Majority Banks and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding on all of the Banks.

10.03 Defaults. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of
Default (other than the non-payment of principal of or interest
on Loans or of Commitment Fees) unless the Agent has received
notice from Bank or the Company specifying such Default or Event
of Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default".
In the event that the Agent receives such a notice of the
occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, the Agent shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Banks (and shall give each Bank
prompt notice of each such non-payment). The Agent shall
(subject to Section 10.07 hereof) take such action with respect
to such Default or Event of Default as shall be directed by the
Majority Banks; provided that, unless and until the Agent shall
have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such

action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Banks.

10.04 Rights as a Bank. NationsBank of North Carolina,
N.A. (and any successor acting as Agent), in its capacity as a
Bank hereunder, shall have the same rights and powers hereunder
as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not
acting as the Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless
the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its
individual capacity. NationsBank of North Carolina, N.A. (and
any successor acting as Agent) and its affiliates may (without
having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from,
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust
or other business with the Obligors (and any of their affiliates)
as if it were not acting as the Agent, and NationsBank of North
Carolina, N.A. and its affiliates may accept fees and other
consideration from the Obligors for services in connection with
this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the
same to the Banks.

10.05 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 12.03 hereof,
but without limiting the obligations of the Company under said Section

-61-
<PAGE>

12.03), pro rata in accordance with each Bank's pro rata
share of the total Commitment, for any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Basic Document or any other documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation,
the costs and expenses which the Company is obligated to pay
under Section 12.03 hereof, but excluding, unless a Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, normal
administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance of
its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the
terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents; provided
that no Bank shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the
extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the party to be indemnified.

10.06 Non-Reliance on Agent and other Banks. Each Bank
agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the
Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis of the Company and its Subsidiaries and decision to
enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at
the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any of the
other Basic Documents. The Agent shall not be required to keep
itself informed as to the performance or observance by any
Obligor of this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents or
any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein
or to inspect the properties or books of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other
documents and information expressly required to be furnished to
the Banks by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or
other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of
their affiliates) which may come into the possession of the Agent
or any of its affiliates.

10.07 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required
of the Agent hereunder and under the other Basic Documents, the
Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or
refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it shall receive
further assurances to its satisfaction from the Banks of their
indemnification obligations under Section 10.05 hereof against
any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

10.08 Resignation or Removal of Agent. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, 

-62-
<PAGE>
the Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof
to the Banks and the Company, and the Agent may be removed at any
time with cause by the Majority Banks. Upon any such resignation
or removal, the Majority Banks shall have the right to appoint a
successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Majority Banks and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of
notice of resignation or the Majority Banks' removal of the
retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a bank which has
a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon
the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a
successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any
retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the
provisions of this Section 10 shall continue in effect for its
benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Agent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the removal of any Bank as "Agent" pursuant to this
Section 10.08 shall not affect such Bank's obligations as a
"Bank" hereunder.

10.09 Agency Fee. Until the Revolving Loan Commitment has
been terminated and payment in full of the principal of and
interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by the

Company hereunder has occurred, the Company will pay to the Agent
an agency fee as agreed to between the Company and the Agent,
which fee shall be payable annually in advance first on the
Effective Date and thereafter on each anniversary date of the
Effective Date. Such fee, once paid, shall be non-refundable.

Section 11
The Guarantee

11.01 Guarantee. Subject to the limitation set forth in
Section 11.07 hereof, the Guarantors hereby jointly and
severally, unconditionally guarantee to each Bank and the Agent
and their respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in
full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Loans made by
the Banks to, and the Note(s) held by each Bank of, the Company
and all other amounts (including, without limitation, attorneys'
fees and other expenses payable by the Company hereunder) from
time to time owing to the Banks or the Agent by the Company under
this Agreement and under the Notes and interest thereon, in each
case strictly in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof
(such obligations being herein collectively called the
"Guaranteed Obligations"). The Guarantors hereby further jointly
and severally agree that, subject to the limitation set forth in
Section 11.07 hereof, if the Company shall fail to pay in full
when due (whether at stated 

-63-
<PAGE>

maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed 
Obligations, the Guarantors will promptly pay the same, without 
any demand or notice whatsoever and without any set-off or 
counterclaim whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of 
time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, 
the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at 
extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with 
the terms of such extension or renewal.

11.02 Obligations Unconditional. Subject to the limitation
set forth in Section 11.07 hereof, the obligations of the
Guarantors under Section 11.01 hereof are absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity,
regularity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes or any
other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or
any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of
or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any
other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor,
it being the intent of this Section 11.02 that the obligations of
the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or

more of the following shall not affect the liability of the
Guarantors hereunder:

(i) at any time or from time to time, without notice
to the Guarantors, the time for any performance of or
compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be
extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;

(ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the
provisions of this Agreement or the Notes or any other
agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall
be done or omitted;

(iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed
Obligations shall be modified, supplemented or amended in
any respect, or any right under this Agreement or the Notes
or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or
therein shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any security or collateral
therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part
or otherwise dealt with; or

(iv) any lien or security interest granted to, or in
favor of, the Agent or any Bank or Banks as security for any
of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected.

-64-
<PAGE>
The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment,
demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any
requirement that the Agent or any Bank exhaust any right, power
or remedy or proceed against the Company under this Agreement or
the Notes or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein
or therein, or against any other Person under any other guarantee
of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations; it being
expressly understood that this is a guaranty of payment not a
guaranty of collection.

11.03 Reinstatement. The obligations of the Guarantors
under this Section 11 shall be automatically reinstated if and to
the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the
company in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or
must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy
or reorganization or otherwise and the Guarantors agree that they
will indemnify the Agent and each Bank on demand for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
fees of counsel) incurred by the Agent or such Bank in connection
with such rescission or restoration.

11.04 Primary Liability of Guarantors; Subrogation. Each
Guarantor agrees that this Section 11 may be enforced by the
Agent or the Banks without the necessity at any time of resorting
to or exhausting any other security or collateral and without the
necessity at any time of having recourse to the Notes or any
other of the Basic Documents or any collateral, if any, hereafter
securing the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise and each
Guarantor hereby waives the right to require the Agent or the
Banks to proceed against the Company or any other Person
(including a co-guarantor) or to require the Agent or the Banks
to pursue any other remedy or enforce any other right. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby
specifically waives the benefits of N.C. Gen. Stat. Section 26-7
through 26-9, inclusive and Section 26-12. Each Guarantor hereby
waives all rights of subrogation or contribution, whether arising
by contract or operation of law (including, without limitation,
any such right arising under the United States Bankruptcy Code)
or otherwise by reason of any payment by it pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 11 and further agrees with the Company
for the benefit of each of its creditors (including, without
limitation, each Bank and the Agent) that any such payment by it
shall constitute a contribution of capital by such Guarantor to
the Company.

11.05 Remedies. Each Guarantor agrees that, as between
such Guarantor and the Banks, the obligations of the Company
hereunder and under the Notes may be declared to be forthwith due
and payable as provided in Section 9 hereof (and shall be deemed
to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances
provided in Section 9 hereof) for purposes of Section 11.01
hereof notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition

-65-
<PAGE>

preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming
automatically due and payable) as against the Company and that,
in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being
deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such
obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Company) shall
forthwith become due and payable by such Guarantor for purposes
of said Section 11.01.

11.06 Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this Section
11 is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Guaranteed
Obligations whenever arising.

11.07 Limitation on Guarantee. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 11 to the contrary, the liability of any Guarantor
with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereunder
shall not exceed the Maximum Guaranteed Amount (as defined below)
as determined at the earlier of the date of the commencement of
a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code in which such
Guarantor is a debtor or the date enforcement of this Section 11
is sought against such Guarantor. 

For the purposes hereof, "Maximum Guaranteed Amount", for
each individual Guarantor, means the sum of (a) with respect to
each Loan (or portion thereof) the proceeds of which are

transferred to the Guarantor, the amount of such proceeds that
are transferred to the Guarantor plus (b) with respect to each
Loan (or portion thereof) the proceeds of which are not
transferred to the Guarantor, the lesser of (i) the outstanding
amount of such Loan as of such date or (ii) the greater of (A)
95% of the Adjusted Net Worth (as defined below) of such
Guarantor as of the date of such Loan or (B) 95% of the Adjusted
Net Worth of such Guarantor as determined as of the earliest of
(1) such date, (2) the date of commencement of a case under the
United States Bankruptcy Code in which such Guarantor is a debtor
or (3) the date enforcement is sought against such Guarantor.

For the purposes hereof, "Adjusted Net Worth" means, as of

any of its Loans, its Notes, its Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentage or its Term Loan Commitment Percentage without
the prior consent of the Company and the Agent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld); provided, (i) without the
consent of the Company or the Agent, any Bank may (subject
to the further clauses below and subject to prior written
notice to the Agent) assign to an Affiliate thereof or to
another Bank (or an Affiliate of such other Bank) all or any
portion of its aggregate commitment hereunder, (ii) any such
partial assignment shall be at least $14,000,000 (unless
such partial assignment is to a Bank and then at least
$10,000,000) and in incremental multiples of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof; (iii) such assigning Bank shall also
simultaneously assign to such assignee the same proportion
of each of its Loans, Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage
and Term Loan Commitment Percentage then outstanding
(together with the same proportion of its Note or Notes then
outstanding); (iv) so long as no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, no Bank may make an
assignment if, after giving effect thereto, the remaining
aggregate amount of its commitment hereunder is less than
$12,000,000; and (v) such assignment shall be in
substantially the form of the Assignment Agreement attached

the Agent of an assignment permitted by the preceding
sentence (which notice shall identify the Assignee and the
amount of the assigning Bank's Loans, Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage and Term Loan Commitment Percentage
assigned in detail reasonably satisfactory to the Agent) and

assignment with the consent of the Company and the Agent),
the obligations, rights and benefits of a Bank hereunder
holding the Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage, the Term
Loan Commitment Percentage and Loans (or portions thereof)
assigned to it (in addition to the Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage, the Term Loan Commitment Percentage
and Loans, if any, theretofore held by such assignee) and
the assigning Bank shall, to the extent of such assignment,
be released from the Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage
and Term Loan Commitment Percentage (or portions thereof) so
assigned. The provision of clauses (ii) and (iv) of this
Section 12.06(b) shall not be applicable to any assignment
effected pursuant to Section 5.06 hereof. The assigning
Bank shall pay the Agent an assignment fee of $2500 upon the
effectiveness of any assignment permitted by this Section
12.06(b). No Bank may assign any of its Loans, Notes,

(c) A Bank may sell or agree to sell to one or more
other Persons a participation in all or any part of any Loan
held by it or Loans made or to be made by it, in which event
each such participant shall be entitled to the rights and
benefits of the provisions of Section 8.01(h) hereof with
respect to its participation in such Loan as if (and the
Company shall be directly obligated to such participant
under such provisions as if) such participant were a "Bank"
for purposes of said Section, but shall not have any other
rights or benefits under this Agreement or any Note (the
participant's rights against such Bank in respect of such
participation to be those set forth in the agreement (the
"Participation Agreement") executed by such Bank in favor of
the participant). All amounts payable by the Company to any
Bank under Section 5 hereof shall be determined as if such
Bank had not sold or agreed to sell any participations in
such Loan and as if such Bank were funding all of such Loan
in the same way that it is funding the portion of such Loan
in which no participations have been sold. In no event
shall a Bank that sells a participation be obligated to the
participant under the Participation Agreement to take or

refrain from taking any action hereunder or under such
Bank's Notes except that such Bank may agree in the
Participation Agreement that it will not, without the
consent of the participant, agree to (i) the increase or
extension of the term, or the extension of the time or
waiver of any requirement for the reduction or termination,
of such Bank's Commitments, (ii) the extension of any date
fixed for the payment of principal of or interest on the
related Loan or Loans or any portion of any fees payable to
the participant, (iii) the reduction of any payment of
principal thereof or (iv) the reduction of the rate at which
either interest is payable thereon or (if the participant is
entitled to any part thereof) commitment fee is payable
hereunder to a level below the rate at which the participant
is entitled to receive interest or commitment fee (as the
case may be) in respect of such participation.

(d) A Bank may furnish any information concerning
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of
such Bank from time to time to assignees and participants
(including prospective assignees and participants), subject,
however, to the provisions of Section 12.12 hereof.

(e) Anything in this Section 12.06 to the contrary
notwithstanding, any Bank may assign and pledge all or any
portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve
Bank (and its transferees) as collateral security pursuant
to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by such
Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the
assigning Bank from its obligations hereunder.

PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE TO THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN
SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN
SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

12.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE
GUARANTORS, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO

disclosure of any such non-public information (x) by any
governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any
such request in connection with an examination of the financial
condition of such Bank by such governmental agency) or (y)
pursuant to legal process; and provided finally that in no event
shall any Bank or the Agent be obligated or required to return
any materials furnished by the Company. The obligations of each

Bank under this Section 12.12 shall supersede and replace the
obligations of such Bank under any confidentiality letter in
respect of this financing signed and delivered by such Bank to

[FORM OF OPINION OF OBLIGORS' COUNSEL]

[EFFECTIVE DATE]

Each of the Banks party to 
the Credit Agreement 
referred to below

NationsBank of North Carolina, N.A., as Agent
NationsBank Corporate Center
100 N. Tryon Street
Charlotte, NC 28255

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to LADD Furniture, Inc., a
corporation organized under the laws of North Carolina (the
"Company"), and to Pennsylvania House, Inc., Brown Jordan
Company, Clayton-Marcus Company, Inc., LADD Contract Sales
Corporation, Fournies Furniture, Inc., Barclay Furniture Co.,
American Furniture Company, Incorporated, Pilliod Furniture, Inc.
and Lea Industries, Inc. (together with the Company,
collectively, the "Obligors" and, individually, an "Obligor"), in
connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of ______________,
1994 (the "Credit Agreement") among the Company, the other
Obligors, the banks party thereto (the "Banks") and NationsBank
of North Carolina, N.A., in its capacity as agent for said Banks
(the "Agent"). All capitalized terms used but not defined herein
have the respective meanings given to such terms in the Credit
Agreement.

In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined:

(i) the Credit Agreement;

(ii) the Notes; 

(iii) the Pledge Agreement; and

(iv) such corporate records of the Obligors
and such other documents as we have deemed necessary as
a basis for the opinions expressed below.

In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all
signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as
originals and the conformity with authentic original documents of
all documents submitted to us as copies. When relevant facts
were 

<PAGE>

not independently established, we have relied upon
statements of governmental officials and upon representations
made in or pursuant to the Basic Documents and certificates of
appropriate representatives of the Obligors.

In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed,
with respect to all of the documents referred to in this opinion,
that (except, to the extent set forth in the opinions expressed
below, as to the Obligors):

(i) such documents have been duly authorized by,
have been duly executed and delivered by, and constitute
legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of, all of
the parties to such documents;

(ii) all signatories to such documents have been
duly authorized; and

(iii) all of the parties to such documents are duly
organized and validly existing and have the power and
authority (corporate or other) to execute, deliver and
perform such documents.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to
the comments and qualifications set forth below, and having
considered such questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a
basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of the opinion
that:

1. Each Obligor is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of (i)
in the case of the Company, North Carolina and (ii) in the
case of each other Obligor, the jurisdiction of its
incorporation.

2. Each Obligor has all requisite corporate power to
execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under,
each Basic Document to which it is a party. The Company has
all requisite corporate power to borrow under the Credit
Agreement.

3. The execution, delivery and performance by each
Obligor of each Basic Document to which such Obligor is a
party, and the borrowings by the Company under the Credit
Agreement, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of such Obligor.

4. Each Basic Document has been duly executed and
delivered by each Obligor party thereto.

5. Each Basic Document constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of each Obligor party thereto,
enforceable against each Obligor party thereto in accordance
with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, 

<PAGE>

reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally
and except as the enforceability of the Basic Documents is
subject to the application of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law), including, without limitation, (a) the possible
unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or
any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of materiality,
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.

6. Each Pledge Agreement creates a valid security
interest in favor of the Agent, for the benefit of the
Banks, under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the
State of North Carolina (the "Uniform Commercial Code") in
all of the right, title and interest of each Pledgor in and
to the Pledged Collateral (as defined in the Pledge
Agreements) as collateral security for the payment of the
Secured Obligations (as defined in the Pledge Agreements),
except that (a) such security interest would continue in the
Pledged Collateral after its sale, exchange or other
disposition only to the extent provided in Sections 9-306
and 9-307 of the Uniform Commercial Code and (b) the
security interest in Pledged Collateral in which a Pledgor
acquires rights after the commencement of a case under the
Bankruptcy Code in respect of such Pledgor may be limited by
Section 552 of the Bankruptcy Code.

7. The security interest referred to in paragraph 6
above will be perfected as described below:

(a) the delivery to the Agent of actual physical
possession of the certificates evidencing the Pledged Stock,
and thereafter retention of such certificates by the Agent,
will perfect the security interest in that portion of the
Pledged Collateral consisting of Pledged Stock;

(b) to the extent not expressly covered by paragraph
(a) above, such security interest in that portion of the
Pledged Collateral consisting of "proceeds" (as defined in
the Uniform Commercial Code) may be perfected as and to the
extent provided in Section 9-306 of the Uniform Commercial
Code.

8. The Pledged Collateral consists entirely of
property a security interest in which may be perfected by
the means described in paragraph 7 above.

9. The aggregate issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of each Special Subsidiary consists of the
type and number of shares described in Schedule 1 to the
Pledge Agreement, and there exists no other issued capital
stock. All of said shares have been duly and validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable. Assuming that the
Agent (or any 

<PAGE>

custodian, other than the Pledgors, acting on
the Agent's behalf) obtains, and thereafter maintains,
possession of the portion of the Pledged Collateral
consisting of the certificates representing any Pledged
Stock in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim
(as defined in Section 8-301(1) of the Uniform Commercial
Code) and in bearer form or in registered form issued to the
Agent or endorsed to the Agent or in blank, any perfected
security interest therein will have priority over all other
security interests theretofore or thereafter created under
the Uniform Commercial Code.

10. No authorization, approval or consent of, and no
filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory
authority or agency of the United States of America or the
State of North Carolina is required on the part of any
Obligor for the execution, delivery or performance by any
Obligor of the Basic Documents to which such Obligor is a
party or for any borrowings by the Company under the Credit
Agreement.

11. The execution, delivery and performance by each
Obligor of, and the consummation by each Obligor of the
transactions contemplated by, the Basic Documents to which
such Obligor is a party do not and will not (a) violate any
provision of the charter or by-laws of such Obligor, (b)
violate any applicable law, rule or regulation, (c) violate
any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
governmental authority or agency or any arbitral award
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
which we have knowledge or (d) result in a breach of,
constitute a default under, require any consent under, or
result in the acceleration or required prepayment of any
Indebtedness pursuant to the terms of, any agreement or
instrument listed in Schedule 7.12 of the Credit Agreement,
or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any
property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to the terms of any such agreement of instrument.

12. Other than as previously disclosed in writing to
the Banks or contained in Schedule 7.03 of the Credit
Agreement, we have no knowledge of any legal or arbitral
proceedings, or any proceedings by or before any
governmental or regulatory authority or agency, now pending
or overtly threatened in writing against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties
that, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse
effect on (i) the property, business, operations, financial
condition, prospects, liabilities or capitalization of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) the
ability of any Obligor to perform its obligations under any
of the Basic Documents to which it is a party, (iii) the
validity or enforceability of any of the Basic Documents,
(iv) the rights and remedies of 

<PAGE>

the Banks and the Agent under any of the Basic Documents or 
(v) the timely payment of the principal of or interest on 
the Loans or other amounts payable in connection therewith.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the following
comments and qualifications:

A. The enforceability of Section 12.03 of the Credit
Agreement may be limited by laws rendering unenforceable
indemnification contrary to Federal or state securities laws
and public policy.

B. The enforceability of provisions in the Basic
Documents to the effect that terms may not be waived or
modified except in writing may be limited under certain
circumstances.

C. We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the
laws of any jurisdiction in which any Bank is located (other
than North Carolina) that limit the interest, fees or other
charges such Bank may impose and (ii) the enforceability of
Section 4.06(c) of the Credit Agreement.

D. We express no opinion as to the effect or
applicability to the obligations (or the enforceability of
such obligations) of any of the Guarantors under the Credit
Agreement of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other
provision of law relating to fraudulent conveyances,
transfers or obligations.

E. We express no opinion as to any provision of the
Basic Documents which provide that acceptance of late
payment or other late performance shall not be deemed a
waiver of the default generated thereby. The North Carolina
Court of Appeals has held that when a holder of a note
regularly accepts late payment, it is deemed to waive its
right to accelerate the debt because of the late payments
until it notifies the maker that prompt payments are again
required. Consequently, the principal may be extended to
other late performances under the Basic Documents.

F. We express no opinion as to the enforceability of
any provisions of the Basic Documents which may be
unenforceable or limited by the provisions of N.C. Gen.
Stat. Section 6-21.2 relating to the allowance of attorneys
fees.

G. The provisions of Section 11 of the Credit
Agreement may be limited by the requirements of N.C. Gen.
Stat. Section 26-7 through Section 26-9 inclusive, and
Section 26-12.

H. The obligations of the Obligors under the Basic
Documents may be subject to possible limitations upon the

<PAGE>

exercise of remedial or procedural provisions contained in
the Basic Documents (including limitations on waiver of
certain notices), provided that such limitations do not, in
our opinion, make the remedies and procedures that will be
afforded to the Agent and the Banks inadequate for the
practical realization of the substantive benefits pruported
to be provided to the Agent and the Banks by the Basic
Documents.

I. We express no opinion as to the enforceability of
any provisions in the Basic Documents granting the Agent the
right to act as an agent or attorney-in-fact for the
Obligors, or limiting any fiduciary duty of the Agent to the
Obligors in such capacity.

J. We express no opinion with respect to the
enforceability of Section 12.11 of the Credit Agreement and
Section 10(f) of the Pledge Agreement with respect to waiver
of the right to trial by jury by the Obligors due to the
application of N.C. Gen. Stat. (Section Mark) 22B-10.

K. We express no opinion as to the provisions in the
Pledge Agreement with respect to the right of the Agent to
bid or become a purchaser at any private sale or disposition
of the Pledged Collateral.

The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the
Federal laws of the United States and the law of the State of
North Carolina, and we do not express any opinion as to the laws
of any other jurisdiction.

At the request of our clients, this opinion is, pursuant, to
Section 6.01(d) of the Credit Agreement, provided to you by us in
our capacity as counsel to the Obligors and may not be relied
upon by any Person for any purpose other than in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement without, in
each instance, our prior written consent.

Very truly yours,

satisfactory to the Agent.

(b) Additional Securities. If the Pledgor shall
receive by virtue of its being or having been the owner of
any Pledged Collateral, any (i) stock certificate, including
without limitation, any certificate representing a stock
dividend or distribution in connection with any increase or
reduction of capital, reclassification, merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, combination of shares, stock
splits, spin-off or split-off; (ii) option or right, whether
as an addition to, substitution for, or an exchange for, any
Pledged Collateral or otherwise; (iii) dividends payable in
securities; or (iv) distributions of securities in
connection with a partial or total liquidation, dissolution
or reduction of capital, capital surplus or paid-in surplus,
then the Pledgor shall receive such stock certificate,
instrument, option, right or distribution in trust for the
benefit of the Agent, shall segregate it from the Pledgor's
other property and shall deliver it forthwith to the Agent
in the exact form received together with any necessary
endorsement and/or appropriate updated stock power duly
executed in blank, to be held by the Agent as Pledged
Collateral and as further collateral security for the
Secured Obligations.

Section 4. Pledgor's Representations and Warranties. The
Pledgor represents and warrants the following:

(a) Authorization of Pledged Shares. The Pledged
Stock is duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid
and nonassessable, is not subject to the preemptive rights
of others, constitutes the stated percentage of the issued
and outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Special
Subsidiary as set forth on Schedule 1, and constitutes all
of the Pledged Stock owned by the Pledgor as of the date
hereof. All other shares of stock constituting Pledged
Collateral will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable, and not subject to the preemptive
rights of any person.

(b) Title. The Pledgor has good and indefeasible
title to the Pledged Collateral and will at all times be the
legal and beneficial owner of the Pledged Collateral free
and clear of any Lien, adverse claim, security interest or
other charge or encumbrance except for the security interest
created by this Pledge Agreement. The Pledgor is the
registered owner of all of the Pledged Stock.

<PAGE>
(c) Exercising of Rights. The exercise by the Agent
or the Banks of their rights and remedies hereunder will not
contravene any law or governmental regulation or any
contractual restriction binding on or affecting the Pledgor
or any of its property and will not result in or require the
creation of any Lien, security interest or other charge or
encumbrance upon or with respect to any of its property.

(d) Pledgor's Authority. No authorization, approval
or action by, and no notice or filing with any governmental
authority or regulatory body is required either (i) for the
pledge made by the Pledgor or for the granting of the
security interest by the Pledgor pursuant to this Pledge
Agreement; or (ii) for the exercise by the Agent or the
Banks of their rights and remedies hereunder (except as may
be required by laws affecting the offering and sale of
securities).

(e) Valid Security Interest. This Pledge Agreement
creates a valid security interest in favor of the Agent on
behalf of the Banks in the Pledged Collateral which security
interest constitutes a first priority perfected security
interest in and to all of the Pledged Collateral.

(f) Litigation. No litigation or governmental
proceeding is pending or threatened against Pledgor or any
of its assets which if adversely determined would have a
material adverse effect on the Pledged Collateral or the
Pledgor's performance under this Pledge Agreement.

(g) Chief Executive Office. Each Pledgor's chief
executive office is located in the jurisdiction set forth on
Schedule 2 attached hereto and will remain there unless
prior written notice is provided to the Agent to the
contrary. 

Section 5. Further Assurances. The Pledgor shall, at its
expense, promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and
documents and take all further action that may be necessary,
desirable or that the Agent may request in order to (i) perfect
and protect this security interest created or purported to be
created hereby; (ii) enable the Agent to exercise and enforce its
rights and remedies hereunder in respect of the Pledged
Collateral; and (iii) otherwise effect the purposes of the Pledge
Agreement, including, without limitation and if requested by the
Agent, subsequent to the occurrence and continuation of an Event
of Default delivering to the Agent irrevocable proxies in respect
of the Pledged Collateral. The Pledgor shall mark its books and
records to reflect the security interest granted to the Agent, on
behalf of the Banks, and shall cause the issuer of the Pledged
Stock to mark its books and records to reflect such security
interest and shall have the issuer acknowledge same to the Agent.

<PAGE>

Section 6. Rights of the Agent.

(a) Power of Attorney. The Pledgor hereby irrevocably
appoints the Agent and any officer or agent thereof the
Pledgor's attorney-in-fact and proxy, with full power of
substitution for and on behalf and in the name of the
Pledgor or otherwise, during the existence of an Event of
Default (as defined herein), in the Agent's discretion, to
take any action and to execute any instrument which the
Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the
purpose of this Pledge Agreement, including, without
limitation, the right to demand, sue for, collect or receive
in the name of the Agent or in its own name, any money or
property at any time payable or receivable on account of, or
in exchange for, any of the Pledged Collateral. 

This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable. The Agent shall be under no duty
to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights,
powers, privileges and options expressly or implicitly
granted to the Agent in this Pledge Agreement, and shall not
be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing so.
The Agent shall not be liable for any act or omission or for
any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or law in its
individual capacity or its capacity as attorney-in-fact
except acts or omissions resulting from its gross negligence
or willful misconduct. This power of attorney is conferred
on the Agent solely to protect, preserve and realize upon
its security interest in the Pledged Collateral.

(b) Performance by the Agent of Pledgor's Obligations.
If the Pledgor fails to perform any agreement or obligation
contained herein, the Agent itself may perform, or cause
performance of, such agreement or obligation, and the
expenses of the Agent incurred in connection therewith shall
be payable by the Pledgor pursuant to Section 9 hereof.

(c) Assignment by the Agent. The Agent may from time
to time assign the Secured Obligations and any portion
thereof and/or the Pledged Collateral and any portion
thereof, and the assignee shall be entitled to all of the
rights and remedies of the Agent under this Pledge Agreement
in relation thereto.

(d) The Agent's Duty of Care. Other than the exercise
of reasonable care to assure the safe custody of the Pledged
Collateral while being held by the Agent hereunder, the
Agent shall have no duty or liability to preserve rights
pertaining thereto, it being understood and agreed that the
Pledgor shall be responsible for preservation of all rights
in the Pledged Collateral, and the Agent shall be relieved
of all responsibility for the Pledged Collateral upon
surrendering it or tendering the surrender of it to the
Pledgor. 

<PAGE>

(e) Voting Rights in Respect of the Pledged
Collateral.

(i) So long as no Event of Default (as defined
herein) shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Pledgor may exercise any and all voting and other
consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Collateral
or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent
with the terms of this Pledge Agreement or the
Agreement; and

(ii) Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of the
Pledgor to exercise the voting and other consensual
rights which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise
pursuant to paragraph (i) of this Section shall cease
and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in
the Agent which shall thereupon have the sole right to
exercise such voting and other consensual rights. 

(f) Dividend Rights in Respect of the Pledged
Collateral.

(i) So long as no Event of Default (as defined
herein) shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain all
dividends paid in cash or property out of earned
surplus on the Pledged Collateral.

(ii) Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, any and all
dividends and distributions paid or payable in respect
of any Pledged Collateral shall be, and shall forthwith
be delivered to the Agent and shall, if received by the
Pledgor, be received in trust for the benefit of the
Agent, shall be segregated from the other property of
the Pledgor, and shall be forthwith delivered to the
Agent in the exact form received with, if appropriate,
any necessary endorsement and/or appropriate updated
stock powers duly executed in blank, to be (i) if
cash, applied against amounts owing by Pledgor under
the Credit Agreement and (ii) if not cash held by the
Agent as Pledged Collateral; provided that if such
Event of Default is cured, any such dividend or
distribution theretofore paid to the Agent shall, upon
request of the Pledgor (except to the extent
theretofore applied to the Secured Obligations), be
returned by the Agent to the Pledgor. 

(g) Release of Collateral. The Agent may release any
of the Pledged Collateral from this Pledge Agreement without
altering, varying or diminishing in any way the force,
effect, lien, pledge or security interest of this 

<PAGE>

Pledge Agreement as to the Pledged Collateral not expressly
released, and this Pledge Agreement shall continue as a
first priority lien, security interest, pledge and charge on
all Pledged Collateral not expressly released when any of
the Secured Obligations remain outstanding with respect to
the Agents.

Section 7. Events of Default.

The occurrence of any of the following shall be an Event of
Default hereunder ("Event of Default"):

(a) Credit Agreement. An event which under the Credit
Agreement would constitute an Event of Default; or

(b) Performance by Pledgor. Failure on the part of
the Pledgor in the timely performance or observance of any
covenant, obligation or liability contained herein; or 

(c) Representation and Warranties. Proof that any
warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to
the Agent by or on behalf of the Pledgor herein was false in
any material respect when made or furnished.

Section 8. Remedies Upon Default. 

If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing:

(a) Rights and Remedies. The Agent may exercise in
respect of the Pledged Collateral, in addition to other
rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise
available to it, all rights and remedies of a secured party
under the Uniform Commercial Code or any other applicable
law. 

(b) Sale of Pledged Collateral. Without limiting the
generality of this Section and without notice except as
specified below, the Agent may, in its sole discretion, sell
or otherwise dispose of or realize upon the Pledged
Collateral, or any part thereof, in one or more parcels, at
public or private sale, at any exchange or broker's board or
elsewhere, at such price or prices and on such other terms
as the Agent may deem commercially reasonable, for cash,
credit or for future delivery or otherwise in accordance
with applicable law. The Agent may, in such event, bid for
the purchase of such securities. The Pledgor agrees that,
to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at
least 10 days notice to the Pledgor of the time and place of
any public sale or the time after which any private sale is
to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The
Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Pledged
Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.
The Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time
to time by announcement at the time and place fixed
therefor, and such sale may, 

<PAGE>

without further notice, be made at the time and place to which 
it was so adjourned.

(c) Private Sale. Pledgor recognizes that the Agent
may deem it impracticable to effect a public sale of all or
any part of the Pledged Shares or any of the securities
constituting Pledged Collateral and that the Agent may,
therefore, determine to make one or more private sales of
any such securities to a restricted group of purchasers who
will be obligated to agree, among other things, to acquire
such securities for their own account, for investment and
not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. The
Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at
prices and on terms less favorable to the seller than the
prices and other terms which might have been obtained at a
public sale and, notwithstanding the foregoing, agrees that
such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a
commercially reasonable manner and that the Agent shall have
no obligation to delay sale of any such securities for the
period of time necessary to permit the issuer of such
securities to register such securities for public sale under
the Securities Act of 1933. The Pledgor further
acknowledges and agrees that any offer to sell such
securities which has been (i) publicly advertised on a bona
fide basis in a newspaper or other publication of general
circulation in the financial community of New York, New York
(to the extent that such offer may be advertised without
prior registration under the Securities Act of 1933), or
(ii) made privately in the manner described above shall be
deemed to involve a "public sale" under the Uniform
Commercial Code, notwithstanding that such sale may not
constitute a "public offering" under the Securities Act of
1933, and the Agent may, in such event, bid for the purchase
of such securities.

(d) Application of Proceeds. All cash proceeds
received by the Agent in respect to any sale, collection
from, or other realization upon, all or any part of the
Pledged Collateral shall be applied as follows:

(i) First, to repayment of the reasonable costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
legal fees, incurred by the Agent in connection with
(A) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or
the sale of, collection from, or the other realization
upon any Pledged Collateral, (B) the exercise or
enforcement of any of the rights of the Agent
hereunder, and (C) the failure of the Pledgor to
perform or observe any of the provisions hereof;

(ii) Second, at the option of the Agent, to the
payment or other satisfaction of any Liens and other
encumbrances upon any of the Pledged Collateral;

<PAGE>

(iii) Third, to the reimbursement of the Agent for
the amount of any obligations of the Pledgor paid or
discharged by the Agent pursuant to the provisions of
this Pledge Agreement or the Credit Agreement;

(iv) Fourth, to the satisfaction of the Secured
Obligations;

(v) Fifth, to the satisfaction of any other
obligations owing from Pledgor to the Agent; and

(vi) Sixth, the surplus proceeds, if any, to the
Pledgor or to whomsoever shall be lawfully entitled to
receive the same or as a court of competent
jurisdiction shall direct. 

Section 9. Indemnity and Expenses.

(a) Indemnity. The Pledgor agrees to indemnify the
Agent from and against any and all claims, losses and
liabilities growing out of or resulting from this Pledge
Agreement, including without limitation, enforcement of this
Pledge Agreement, except claims, losses and liabilities
resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of appropriate
jurisdiction in a final judgment not subject to appeal or
review.

(b) Expenses. The Pledgor will, upon demand, pay to
the Agent the amount of any and all costs and expenses,
including the reasonable fees and disbursements of the
Agent's counsel, and of any experts and agents, which the
Agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of
this Pledge Agreement; (ii) the custody, use or operation
of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization
upon any Pledged Collateral; (iii) the exercise or
enforcement of any of the rights of the Agent hereunder; or
(iv) the failure by the Pledgor to perform or observe any of
the provisions hereof, except expenses resulting from the
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as
determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction in a final
judgement not subject to appeal or review.

Section 10. Notices. 

All notices and other communications provided for hereunder
shall be deemed effective if in writing and delivered in
conformance with Section 12.02 of the Credit Agreement.

<PAGE>

Section 11. Miscellaneous.

(a) Amendments; Continuation of Security Interests.
No amendment of any provision of this Pledge Agreement shall
be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the
Pledgor and the Agent, and no waiver of any provision of
this Pledge Agreement, and no consent to any departure by
the Pledgor therefrom, shall be effective unless it is in
writing and signed by the Agent, and then such waiver or
consent will be effective only in the instance and for the
specific purpose for which given.

(b) No Waivers; Cumulative Remedies. No failure on
the part of the Agent to exercise, and no delay in
exercising any right hereunder or under the Credit Agreement
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise and any such right preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.
The rights and remedies of the Agent provided herein and in
the Credit Agreement are cumulative and are in addition to,
and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided by
law.

(c) Severability. Any provision of this Pledge
Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without
invalidating the remaining portions hereof or thereof or
effecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction.

(d) Agreement in Full Force; Successors and Assigns.
This Pledge Agreement shall create a continuing security
interest in the Pledged Collateral and shall (i) remain in
full force and effect until payment in full or release of
the Obligations; and (ii) be binding on the Pledgor and
permitted assigns and shall inure, together with all rights
and remedies of the Agent hereunder to the benefit of the
Agent and its successors, transferees and assigns. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent may
assign or otherwise transfer the Pledge Agreement held by it
to any other person, and such other person shall thereupon
become vested with all of the benefits and respect thereof
granted to the Agent herein or otherwise. None of the
rights or obligations of the Pledgor hereunder may be
assigned or otherwise transferred without prior written
consent of the Agent.

(e) Governing Law; Venue. THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT AND
THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA. THE PLEDGOR HEREBY
SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED
STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH
CAROLINA AND 

<PAGE>

OF ANY NORTH CAROLINA STATE COURT SITTING IN MECKLENBURG 
COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL 
PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. THE
PLEDGOR IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO
THE LAYING OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN
SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT
IN SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

(f) Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
PLEDGE AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLE WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT, ANY OF
THE OTHER BASIC DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

(g) Return of Collateral. When all Secured
Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Commitments
of the Banks under the Credit Agreement shall have expired
or been terminated, this Pledge Agreement shall terminate,
and the Agent shall forthwith cause to be assigned,
transferred and delivered, against receipt but without any
recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever, any
remaining Pledged Collateral and money received in respect
thereof, to or on the order of the Pledgor. The Agent shall
also execute and deliver to the Pledgor upon such
termination such Uniform Commercial Code termination
statements and such other documentation as shall be
reasonably requested by the Pledgor to effect the
termination and release of the Liens on the Pledged
Collateral.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Pledge Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the day
and year first above written.

LADD DIRECTORS AUTHORIZE STOCK REPURCHASE

HIGH POINT, NC LADD Furniture, Inc. announced today that
its board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to one
million shares of LADD common stock from time to time in the open
market, with the number of shares purchased and the prices paid
dependent upon general market conditions. LADD chairman and CEO
Richard R. Allen said such stock repurchases will be conducted on
the Nasdaq National Market (NNM) at market prices through
brokerage firms. The repurchase program represents approximately
4 percent of the 23.1 million shares of LADD common stock
currently outstanding.

According to Allen, "The directors believe that the recent
decline in LADD's stock price does not properly reflect the value
of the company's present strength and future earnings potential.
Consequently, they authorized this selective share repurchase
program, which will be used over an extended time period to
purchase LADD common stock at attractive prices for the benefit
of all LADD shareholders." Allen added that LADD's directors
believe that cash flows from operating earnings and active
balance sheet management will be sufficient to fund the stock
repurchase program without significantly increasing the company's
debt levels.

Headquartered in High Point, NC, LADD is one of the largest
North American manufacturers of residential furniture and a
leading supplier of contract furniture to the hotel/motel,
government and senior living health care markets domestically and
abroad. LADD sells its broad range of wood, upholstered and
metal furniture products under the major brand names American
Drew, American of Martinsville, Barclay, Brown Jordan, Clayton
Marcus, Daystrom, Design Horizons, Fournier, Lea, Pennsylvania
House and Pilliod, and markets these products worldwide through
LADD International. LADD also owns and operates two support
companies, Lea Lumber & Plywood and LADD Transportation. LADD's
stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the trading
symbol LADF.
