LA-Z-BOY HAD RECORD FOURTH QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS; 
THE FULL YEAR WAS "EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG" 

MONROE, MI., June 2, 1994: La-Z-Boy Chair Company's fiscal fourth quarter 
that ended on April 30, 1994 recorded sales up 13% (on a comparable week basis) 
and net income up 6% vs. last year's fourth quarter. Both sales and earnings 
were record highs for a fourth quarter.

Details of Financial Results
- - ----------------------------
Fourth quarter sales grew to $241 million vs. $198 million, an increase of 22%;
however, the current year's fourth quarter contained 14 weeks vs. 13 weeks in
the prior year, therefore sales on a comparable week basis increased 13%. Net
income improved 6% to $12.3 million ($.67 per share) from $11.6 million ($.64
per share) last year. Operating profit rose 10%.

For the 53 weeks ended April '94, sales were $805 million, 18% greater than last
year's $684 million. Net income before an accounting change increased 27% to
$34.7 million ($1.90 per share) vs. $27.3 million ($1.50 per share) last year.
After the accounting change, net income was $2.08 per share vs. $1.50 last year.

Chairman Comments
- - -----------------
La-Z-Boy Chairman and President Charles T. Knabusch said, "Fourth quarter sales
improved more than expected, and profits exceeded last year's strong numbers.
We set many records in 1994, as each of our five divisions had sales gains for
the quarter and full year. La-Z-Boy achieved its financial goals thanks to
extraordinary employee efforts as well as to an improving economy."

Mr. Knabusch said he expects La-Z-Boy to continue outperforming the U.S.
furniture industry. While industry sales currently are forecast to grow five
to seven percent annually, La-Z-Boy is targeting increases of 10 percent per
year, or a rate of growth at least higher than the industry's.

"It appears likely that we will meet this goal again in fiscal 1995," 
Mr. Knabusch said. "Sales orders in recent weeks have exceeded those of last
year's comparable weeks. So, we're off to a good start, but because 1994 sales
were exceptionally strong, it's unrealistic to expect another round of double-
digit sales percentage increases." The Company's fiscal 1995 selling year is
52 weeks long versus 53 weeks in the year just completed.

"Given continued strength in sales, earnings per share should improve in fiscal
1995, even though profit margins may improve only slightly. The Residential
Division's response time to customers and capacity utilization are improving.
The La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture Group is bringing out exciting new products.
La-Z-Boy Canada has just started opening free-standing stores similar to the
La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries that are proving so successful in the U.S. The
Hammary Division's new home theater systems are selling strongly, and plant
expansion should strengthen the Kincaid Division's margins."

Overall:
- - --------
Refer to today's press release for additional comments.

Extra Week in Fourth Quarter:
- - -----------------------------
The fourth quarter ended April 30, 1994 contained 14 weeks compared to 13 
weeks in the prior year's fourth quarter. The full year ended April 30, 1994
contained 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks last year.

Sales:
- - ------
While the fourth quarter reflects a 22% sales increase on the Consolidated
Summary of Operations, on a per week basis the sales increase was 13%. The
full year 18% sales increase was 15% on a per week basis.

Gross Profit:
- - -------------
The fourth quarter ended April 30, 1994 gross profit of 26.6% of sales fell 
short of the prior year's 27.8% primarily as a result of higher health-care
costs. Management is uncertain whether this represents a trend or a one-time
event. In any event, management continues to evaluate various steps it can
take to help reduce the rate of health-care cost increases.

Other Income:
- - -------------
The $784 (181%) decline in other income for the quarter and $1,058 (61%) 
decline for the year were due to exchange losses due to the decline in the
Canadian currency exchange rate throughout the year and changes in pension-
related assumptions which were implemented in the third quarter.

Accounting Change:
- - ------------------
During the first quarter of fiscal year 1994, the Company recorded a change in
accounting principle in connection with the issuance of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board. This change in accounting principle increased net
income and the net deferred tax asset by $3.4 million or $.18 per share.

Capital Expenditures:
- - ---------------------
The 1994 capital expenditures of $17 million exceeded the 1993 and 1992 levels
of $12 million. Management is forecasting 1995 capital expenditures to be 
$19-$24 million.

Report of Independent Accountants 

Price Waterhouse 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of La-Z-Boy Chair Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of income, of cash flows and of changes in shareholders'
equity, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
La-Z-Boy Chair Company and its subsidiaries at April 30, 1994 and April 24,
1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended April 30, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on April 25,
1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1: Accounting Policies

The Company operates in the furniture industry. The following is a summary of
significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial
statements.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of La-Z-Boy Chair
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany 
transactions have been eliminated.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Items capitalized, including significant betterments to existing facilities,
are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using primarily accelerated
methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Goodwill

The excess of the cost of operating companies acquired over the value of their
net assets is amortized on a straight-line basis over 30 years from the date 
of acquisition.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense is provided on all revenue and expense items included in 
the consolidated statement of income, regardless of the period such items are
recognized for income tax purposes. In fiscal 1994 the Company changed its
method of accounting for income taxes (see Note 8).

end of 1994 and 1993, $10 million and $15 million, respectively, was invested
in this bank's certificates.

In April 1991 the Company entered into a $50 million unsecured revolving 
credit line (Credit Agreement) to extend through August 31, 1998, requiring 
interest payments only through August 31, 1994 and periodic payments of 
principal and interest through 1998. The Company is in the process of 
renewing the Credit Agreement to require interest only payments through 
August 1999 and to require principal payment in August 1999. The Credit 
Agreement also includes covenants that, among other things, require the
Company to maintain certain financial statement ratios. The Company has
complied with all of the requirements.

Proceeds from industrial revenue bonds were used to finance the construction
of manufacturing facilities. These arrangements require the Company to insure
and maintain the facilities and make annual payments that include interest.
The bonds are secured by the facilities constructed from the bond proceeds.

Maturities on debt obligations for the five years subsequent to April 30,
1994 are $3 million, $2 million, $3 million, $2 million and $3 million, 
respectively. As of April 30, 1994, the Company had remaining unused lines 
of credit and commitments of $60 million under several credit arrangements.

Note 5: Stock Option Plans

The Company's shareholders adopted an employee stock option plan that provides
grants to certain employees to purchase common shares of the Company at not
less than their fair market value at the date of grant. Options are for five
years and become exercisable at 25% per year beginning one year from date of
grant. The Company is authorized to grant options for up to 1,600,000 common
shares.

Shares available for grants at 
April 30, 1994................. 877,725 
- - --------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company's shareholders have adopted Restricted Share Plans under which the
Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors was 
authorized to offer for sale up to an aggregate of 650,000 common shares to
certain employees and non-employee directors at 25% of the fair market value 
of the shares. The plans require that all shares be held in an escrow account
for a period of three years in the case of an employee, or until the
participant's service as a director ceases in the case of a director. In the
event of an employee's termination during the escrow period, the shares must
be sold back to the Company at the employee's cost. 

Shares aggregating 11,800 and 14,450 were granted and issued during the fiscal
years 1994 and 1993, respectively, under the Restricted Share Plans. Shares
remaining for future grants under the above plans amounted to 442,075 at
April 30, 1994. 

The Company's shareholders have also adopted a Performance-Based Restricted 
Stock Plan. This plan authorizes the Compensation and Stock Option Committee
of the Board of Directors to award up to an aggregate of 400,000 shares to key
employees. Grants of shares are based entirely on achievement of goals over 
a three-year performance period. Any award made under the plan will be at 
the sole discretion of the Committee after judging all relevant factors. At
April 30, 1994, performance awards were outstanding pursuant to which up to
47,000 shares and 43,520 shares may be issued in fiscal years 1996 and 1997,
respectively, depending on the extent to which certain specified performance
objectives are met. The costs of performance awards are expensed over the
performance period.

Note 6: Retirement

The Company has contributory and non-contributory retirement plans covering 
substantially all factory employees. 

Eligible salaried employees are covered under a trusteed profit sharing 
retirement plan. Cash contributions to a trust are made annually based on
profits. 

The Company has established a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for 
highly compensated employees called a SERP (Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan).

The Company offers a voluntary 401(k) retirement plan to eligible employees
within all U.S. operating divisions. Currently over 70% of eligible employees
are participating in the plan. Employee contributions are matched with 
La-Z-Boy stock at $0.50 on the dollar up to a maximum company contribution of
1% of pay.

The actuarially determined net periodic pension cost and retirement costs are
computed as follows (for the years ended):

========= =========

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.5% for 1994 and 9.0%
for 1993 and 1992. The discount rate used in determining the actuarial present
value of accumulated benefit obligations was 7.5% for 1994, 8.0% for 1993 and
8.5% for 1992. Vested benefits included in the accumulated benefit obligation
were $21 million and $17 million at April 30, 1994 and April 24, 1993, 
respectively. Plan assets are invested in a diversified portfolio that
consists primarily of debt and equity securities. 

The Company's pension plan funding policy has been to contribute annually the
maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.

Note 7: Health Care

The Company offers eligible employees an opportunity to participate in group
health plans. Participating employees make required premium payments through
pretax payroll deductions. 

Health-care expenses were as follows (for the years ended):

Participant payments.............. (4,442) (2,356) (1,323) 
-------- -------- --------
Net health care................. $24,619 $21,606 $20,975
======== ======== ========

The 1994 gross health-care expenses increased 21% over 1993 which was a much
higher rate of increase than 1993's 7% increase over 1992, even after 
adjusting for employment increases.

Participant payments increased markedly due to premium payments for most 
employees becoming effective January 1993 making 1994 the first full payment
year. Participant payments covered 15% of health-care expenses in 1994.

Net health-care costs in 1994 increased 14% over 1993 compared to a 3% increase
in 1993 over 1992 even though much higher participant payments occurred.

The Company makes annual provisions for any current and future retirement 
health-care costs which may not be covered by retirees' collected premiums.

Note 8: Income Taxes

Effective April 25, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes," which applies a
balance sheet approach to income tax accounting. In accordance with the new 
standard, the balance sheet reflects the anticipated tax impact of future
taxable income or deductions implicit in the balance sheet in the form of
temporary differences. These temporary differences reflect the difference
between the basis in assets and liabilities as measured in the financial
statements and as measured by tax laws using enacted tax rates. On April 25,
1993, the Company recorded a tax credit of $3 million or $0.18 per share, 
which represents the net increase in the net deferred tax asset as of that 
date. Such amount has been reflected in the consolidated statement of
income as an accounting change. Prior years' financial statements have not
been restated.

Note 9: Contingencies

The Company has been named as defendant in various lawsuits arising in the
normal course of business. It is not possible at the present time to estimate
the ultimate outcome of these actions; however, management and the Company's
legal counsel believe that the resultant liability, if any, will not be
material.

The Company is also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws
and regulations. The Company accrues for certain environmental remediation
activities related to past operations, including Superfund clean-up and Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act compliance activities, for which commitments 
have been made and reasonable cost estimates are possible. Currently, the
Company has been determined to be a "de-minimus" level potentially responsible
party (PRP) at three clean-up sites and has provided for any known costs 
relating to these sites. The Company is also conducting voluntary compliance
audits at Company owned facilities. Although there probably will be future
expenditures in this area, the effect on future financial results is not
subject to reasonable estimation. However, management does not anticipate 
that they will have a material adverse effect.

La-Z-Boy is organized into five operating divisions. Residential (67 years in
business) accounts for the majority of the upholstery category. Kincaid (48
years) is part of the wood category. La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture Group (22
years) is all of the Contract line. Hammary (50 years) is primarily in the
wood category. La-Z-Boy Canada (65 years) is part of the upholstery category.

La-Z-Boy's market share of all U.S. upholstery furniture products is above 8%.

On the basis of available market share data (in dollars), La-Z-Boy has 30-35% 
of the U.S. single-seat recliner market and is the world's largest recliner
manufacturer. (The next largest U.S. competitor holds roughly 20% of the
U.S. market.) La-Z-Boy's sleep sofa current market share, approximately
12%, has been growing over the last three years.

Market share data by individual product lines other than recliners and sleepers
(e.g., sofas, reclining sofas, wood bedroom and dining room, wood occasional,
etc.) indicate that, although La-Z-Boy does not have a market share above 10%
in any one line, the Company's market share has been growing over the last
three years in most lines.

Analysis of Operations
Year Ended April 30, 1994
(1994 compared with 1993)

U.S. furniture industry sales increased roughly 6-8% in La-Z-Boy's fiscal 1994
over 1993. La-Z-Boy's sales increase of 18% over 1993 continued to exceed the
increase experienced by the industry as a whole. Approximately 2% of this
increase was due to 1994 including 53 weeks while 1993 contained 52 weeks.
The sales volume increase was largely due to improvements in the economy.
Selling price increases were generally in the 2-4% range. Major product lines
that experienced rates of unit growth above the Company average were the
modulars, lower end recliners, sofas, reclining sofas, high end recliners and
bedroom (wood).

No divisions or companies were acquired or disposed of during the last six 
years. Therefore, all sales growth has been internally generated.

During 1994, the La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture Group was formed through the
merger of the former La-Z-Boy Contract and RoseJohnson divisions.

The number of independently owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores continued
to grow in 1994. Most of these stores were major upgrades or new locations
for earlier generation La-Z-Boy Showcase Shoppes. These stores are part of 
the reason La-Z-Boy sales growth has exceeded the industry average. In 
addition, the number of smaller in-store galleries continued to grow for all
divisions.

The gross margin (gross profit dollars as a percent of sales) of 26.2% in 1994
was up from the 26.0% gross margin in 1993. Reasons for the improvement 
include: the 18% sales increase covering fixed costs; the lack of some one-
time costs that affected last year relating to start-up and training for new
styles and changes to manufacturing techniques; real selling price increases
and better plant efficiencies. These reasons for improvement more than offset
the effects of increased sales of product lines with lower-than-average gross
margins and increased lumber and health-care costs.

Other income declined in 1994 due to a reduction in interest income, changes
in pension-related assumptions and Canadian currency exchange losses.

Income tax expense as a percent of pretax income increased to 40.3% in 1994 
from 39.8% in 1993. The effect of the 1% increase in the federal tax rate to
35% was partially offset by changes in profitability among divisions.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes", which changed the method of accounting for income taxes, was adopted
by the Company effective April 25, 1993. This change in accounting principle
increased net income and the net deferred tax asset by $3.4 million or $.18
per share.

<PAGE>

Analysis of Operations
Year Ended April 24, 1993
(1993 compared with 1992)

La-Z-Boy's 1993 sales increase of 10% over 1992 once again exceeded the growth
in the U.S. residential furniture industry as a whole. The 1993 sales increase
together with forecasted growth in the industry indicates that the furniture
industry recession which adversely affected results for the previous four years
has ended. Selling price increases during 1993 were generally in the 1-3%
range. Major product lines that experienced rates of unit sales growth above
the Company average were the reclining sofa, high end recliner, lower end
recliners, bedroom (wood) and occasional (wood) product lines.

During 1993, 18 independently owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores opened,
bringing the total number of stores to 63. The rate of new store openings and
their sales volumes are meeting management's expectations. Most of these
openings were major upgrades or new locations for earlier generation La-Z-Boy
Showcase Shoppes.

Gross margin of 26.0% in 1993 was down from the 26.9% gross margin in 1992 
even though unit volume increased. This decline in gross margin was primarily
in the Residential division which generates roughly 70% of consolidated sales.

The Residential division gross margin declined for two main reasons. The
primary reason was that unexpectedly high labor and overhead costs were
incurred at most plants. These costs were primarily caused by the introduction
of new styles and efforts to improve plant methods while at the same time,
reduce inventories, improve the flexibility to handle a greater number of 
different styles, and ship dealer orders more complete and quicker than in the
past. In addition, an anticipated unfavorable product line mix effect occurred
from selling more product lines with lower-than-average gross margins.

S,G & A expense for 1993 of 19.2% of sales was lower than last year's percentage
of 19.9% primarily due to the relatively large sales increase and a decline in
bad debt expense.

Interest expense declined $2.0 million in 1993 from 1992 due to a combination
of lower debt principal amounts and lower interest rates.

The increase in other income was primarily due to increased interest income
realized from higher cash balances throughout the year more than offsetting
lower interest rates.

Income tax expense as a percent of pretax income increased to 39.8% in 1993 
from 37.1% in 1992. In 1992, there was a one-time tax benefit from the merger
of a previously acquired division.

Liquidity and Financial Condition

Cash flows from operations amounted to $28 million in 1994, $35 million in 
1993 and $36 million in 1992 and have usually been adequate for day-to-day
expenditures, dividends to shareholders and capital expenditures.

The 1994 cash flow from operations declined $6.5 million from 1993. Other
assets and liabilities changed from a source of cash in 1993 to a use of cash
in 1994 primarily due to the payment of income taxes. Also, inventories 
increased $6.7 million.

Capital expenditures were $17.5 million in 1994 compared to $12.2 million for
both 1993 and 1992. Some capacity expansions occurred in 1994 while the prior
two years did not require expansions. Capacity utilization of about 70% at 
the end of 1994 was up from about 65% at the end of 1993.

Cash flows relating to debt caused both inflows and outflows of cash. No new
debt was raised in the last three years. During 1992, a $15.0 million bridge
loan was refinanced through a private placement and two industrial revenue
bonds totaling $9.7 million were refinanced at a lower interest rate. 
Retirements of debt totaled between $1 million and $15 million for each of the
last three years and are primarily related to paying down the $53 million debt
incurred in 1987 to acquire an operating division. While the cash flow 
statement shows that $39.3 million of debt was retired in 1992, $24.7 million
relates to refinancing as described above.

In October 1987, the La-Z-Boy Board of Directors authorized a one-million 
share stock repurchase program. In February 1993, the Board authorized the
repurchase of another one million shares. As of April 30, 1994 and April 24,
1993, the Company had acquired about 1,010,000 and 930,000 shares, respectively,
of its own stock. The Company plans to be in the market for its shares as
changes in its stock price and other financial opportunities arise.

The financial strength of the Company is reflected in two commonly used ratios
- - -the current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) and the 
debt-to-capital ratio (total debt divided by beginning of the year shareholders'
equity plus total debt). The current ratio at the end of 1994 and 1993 was
4.1:1 and 3.8:1, respectively. The debt to capital ratio was 17.4% at the end
of 1994 and 18.5% at the end of 1993.

La-Z-Boy provides for all current and future potential liabilities as required
including those relating to postretirement benefits.

The Company is subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations. The Company accrues for certain environmental remediation
activities related to past operations, including Superfund clean-up and
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act compliance activities, for which
commitments have been made and reasonable cost estimates are possible. 
Currently, the Company has been determined to be a "de-minimus" level
potentially responsible party (PRP) at three clean-up sites and has provided
for any known costs relating to these sites. The Company is also conducting
voluntary compliance audits at Company owned facilities.

Outlook

La-Z-Boy's 1995 fiscal year to end April 29, 1995 will include 52 weeks 
compared to fiscal year 1994, which included 53 weeks. This is approximately
a 2% reduction in the length of the year which will affect sales and other
financial comparisons from year to year.

The Company expects the economic recovery to continue through calendar year
1994. Sales in fiscal year 1995 are expected to exceed the 1994 results but
due to the stronger than expected year in 1994, the double digit sales 
increase experienced in 1994 is not expected to repeat.

One of La-Z-Boy's financial objectives is to achieve sales increases of 10%
per year or increases at least greater than that of the furniture industry.
Some furniture industry forecasts for calendar year 1994 over 1993 are in the 
5-7% range. For 1994, La-Z-Boy sales increased 18% over 1993.

The Company's major residential efforts and opportunities for sales growth 
greater than industry averages are focused outside the recliner market segment,
e.g., stationary upholstery (single and multi-seat), reclining sofas and
modulars, wood occasional and wall units and wood bedroom and dining room.

The newly formed La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture Group sales growth rate in the
next few years is expected to exceed the average of the other divisions. 
Today, this division is not generating a profit and profits are not expected
to improve in 1995 due to large research and development expenditures,
reorganization costs and start-up costs associated with the recent merger of
the two formerly separate contract divisions. Eventually, profit margins
comparable to the Company's average rates are believed to be able to be 
achieved. Profitability at this level would help the Company reach the 
financial goals described below even though this division is not large enough
to dramatically affect the results.

A second financial goal is to improve operating profit as a percent of sales
in 1995 compared to 1994. For 1994, the operating profit margin was 7.5% of
sales.

A third goal is to achieve operating profit, interest income and other income 
(return) as a percent of beginning of the year capital of 20%. For 1994, 
return on capital was 19.4%.

La-Z-Boy has an opportunity to improve its margins through increases in
efficiency, improvements in the utilization of equipment and facilities and
increases in sales volumes, even though product line growth may be in lines
with lower gross margins.

Capital expenditures are forecast to be approximately $19 to $24 million in
1995 compared to $17.5 million in 1994. The 1995 forecast includes the
construction of a new upholstery factory in Arkansas. The 396,000 square foot
plant is being constructed to replace an existing older 200,000 square foot
plant. Long-term financing of the expected $7 million cost is planned to be
through the use of industrial revenue bonds.

The effect of environmental costs on future financial results is not subject
to reasonable estimation. However, management does not anticipate that they
will have a material adverse effect.
