Item 5. Other Events.

Energy Service Company, Inc. ("ENSCO") has completed the sale of its
United States land rig operations to Helmerich & Payne International
Drilling Co. ("H&P"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Helmerich & Payne, Inc.
The operations sold to H&P consist of 12 land drilling rigs and related
equipment and pipe, as well as an office building and yard located on
approximately 14.5 acres in Alice, Texas. Prior to the sale, ENSCO's
domestic land rig operations were conducted through ENSCO Drilling Company
("ENSCO Drilling"), a wholly owned subsidiary of ENSCO. The sale is
consistent with ENSCO's strategy to emphasize offshore operations.

The disposition was consummated on June 30, 1994 pursuant to the terms
of two separate purchase agreements between ENSCO Drilling and H&P. The
total purchase price was approximately $15.5 million, consisting of cash, a
promissory note and certain deferred payment obligations. In addition, H&P
assumed ENSCO Drilling's obligations under existing drilling contracts
relating to the 12 rigs. Management does not expect the sale to result in
a material gain or loss to ENSCO.
