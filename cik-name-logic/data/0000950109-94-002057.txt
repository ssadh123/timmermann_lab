Notes to Financial Statements
- - - -----------------------------

Note 1. General
-------

The financial statements in this report have not been audited. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and results of operations for the interim periods have been
made. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These statements
should be read in conjunction with the 1993 annual report on Form F-2 and the
March 31, 1994 report on Form F-4. Results of operations for the six months
ended June 30, 1994 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations
for the full year or any other interim periods.

Note 2. Merger with BB&T Financial Corporation
--------------------------------------

Commerce Bank ("Commerce") entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of June 24, 1994 (the "Agreement"), with BB&T Financial
Corporation, a bank holding company headquartered in Wilson, North Carolina
("BB&T"). The Agreement provides for the merger of Commerce with and into a
subsidiary of BB&T.

As an inducement for BB&T to enter into the Agreement, Commerce entered
into a Stock Option Agreement, dated as of June 24, 1994 (the "Option
Agreement"), whereby it granted BB&T an irrevocable option (the "Option") to
purchase up to that number of shares of Commerce's common stock (the "Option
Shares") as would equal 19.9% of the aggregate shares of Commerce common stock
that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Option Shares
upon full exercise of the Option, at a price of $31.50 per Option Share. The
Option is exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time
for a designated period of time following the occurrence of a "Purchase Event"
(as defined in the Option Agreement).

Note 3. Commitments
-----------

At June 30, 1994, the amount of off-balance sheet commitments to extend
credit were $69.0 million and standby letters of credit and financial guarantees
were $5.25 million.

<PAGE>

COMMERCE BANK
Form F-4
June 30, 1994

Note 4. Accounting Change
-----------------

Effective January 1, 1994, Commerce adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 115 ("SFAS 115") "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities". In accordance with SFAS 115, prior period
financial statements have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting
principle. SFAS 115 requires that certain securities be classified into one of
three categories: held to maturity, available for sale, or trading based on
management's ability and intent at time of purchase. Securities classified as
held to maturity are carried at their amortized cost; securities classified as
available for sale are carried at their fair values with the amount of
unrealized gains or losses, net of income taxes, reported as a separate
component of shareholders' equity; and securities classified as trading are
carried at their fair value with the unrealized gains or losses included in
earnings.

As a result of the adoption of SFAS 115, on January 1, 1994, Commerce
classified securities with a fair value of approximately $155 million as
securities available for sale. The opening balance of shareholders' equity was
increased by $2.32 million relating to net unrealized gain on securities
available for sale of $3.58 million, less applicable income taxes of $1.25
million. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 115, securities deemed available for
sale were carried at the lower of aggregate amortized cost or market value.

Note 5. Earnings Per Share
------------------

Primary earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the period after giving retroactive
effect to the 5% stock dividends declared in 1993 and 1992. Dilutive stock
options have been converted to common stock equivalents for the calculation of
weighted average shares outstanding based upon the average market price of
Commerce's common stock. Fully diluted earnings per share assumes the
conversion of outstanding convertible subordinated capital notes and elimination
of interest paid thereon, after tax effect, and the exercise of dilutive stock
options, as of the beginning of each period. The dilutive effect of outstanding
options and convertible subordinated debt is computed using the greater of the
closing price or the average market price of Commerce's stock. The computation
of earnings per share is provided on the following page.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion is intended to assist readers in understanding and
evaluating the results of operations and financial condition of Commerce Bank
("Commerce"). The following should be read in conjunction with Commerce's 1993
Annual Report on Form F-2 and the March 31, 1994 report on Form F-4.

Performance Summary
- - - -------------------

Net income for the second quarter of 1994 was $1.84 million and represented
a 11.7% increase over second quarter earnings for 1993 of $1.65 million.
Primary earnings per share were $.66 compared with $.60, and fully diluted
earnings per share were $.63 compared with $.57 for the second quarter of 1994
compared with 1993. Net income for the first six months of 1994 was $3.60
million or 14.4% above comparable 1993 net income of $3.15 million. Primary
earnings per share were $1.29 compared with $1.15, and fully diluted earnings
per share were $1.23 compared with $1.11 for the second half of 1993. The
increase in net income for the second quarter and first half of 1993 was due to
a higher net interest income, increased noninterest income and a lower provision
for loan losses. Net income for the second quarter of 1994 was 4.54%, or
$80,000 above the $1.76 million reported for the first quarter of 1994.

The return on annualized average assets was 1.07% for the second quarter of
1994 compared with 1.01% for the same period in 1993. The annualized return of
average equity was 16.00% for the second quarter of 1994. In comparison, ROE
was 16.56% for the same period of 1993. ROA for the first half of 1994 was
1.06% while ROE was 15.62% compared with .99% and 16.21% for the first half of
1993, respectively.

Total assets at June 30, 1994 were $692.1 million while total deposits were
$636.4 million and represented a 3.9% and 3.3% growth rate over the prior year
levels, respectively. Average earning assets increased 5.6% to $635.9 million
during the second quarter of 1994 when compared with 1993.

EARNINGS ANALYSIS

Net Interest Income
- - - -------------------

Net interest income, the principal source of Commerce's earnings, is the
amount of income generated by interest-earning assets (primarily loans and
investment securities) reduced by the total interest cost of the funds (chiefly
deposits) incurred to carry them.

Net interest income for the second quarter of 1994 was $7.15 million, a
8.9% increase over comparative 1993. Net interest income for the first half of
1994 was $14.0 million or 9.3% above comparative 1993. Net interest margin for
the second quarter and first half of 1994 was 4.51% and 4.44%, respectively, and
represented an improvement from 4.37% and 4.35% for the comparative periods of
1993. The increase in net interest income for 1994 benefitted from growth in
average earning assets, including 18% loan growth for both periods, and
favorable interest rate spreads due to a reduced cost of funds. Net interest
spread for the second quarter of 1994 was 3.94% versus 3.81% for the second
quarter of 1993

COMMERCE BANK

June 30, 1994

and 3.83% for the first quarter of 1994. Net interest spread for the first half
of 1994 improved 8 basis points, to 3.88% from 3.80% for the first half of 1993.
Average earning assets increased $33.4 million, or 5.6%, rising from $602.5
million for the second quarter of 1993 to $635.9 million in 1994. Average
earning assets for the first half of 1994 were $633.9 million, or 7.1% above
$592.0 million for comparative 1993. Average earning assets increased 6.4%
during the second quarter of 1994 when compared with the first quarter of 1994
while the mix reflected continued growth in loans.

The annualized yield on earning assets decreased 22 basis points, from
7.90% for the second quarter of 1993 to 7.68% for comparative 1994.

The annualized cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased 35 basis
points, from 4.09% for the second quarter of 1993 to 3.74% for the second
quarter of 1994. The decrease in annualized cost of interest bearing
liabilities is due to the deposit mix to a greater proportion of rate sensitive
products, increased noninterest bearing deposits, and lower rates of interest.
(See Deposits). The cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased 16 basis
points, from 3.71% for the first quarter of 1994 to 3.74% for the second quarter
of 1994.

Substantially, the same factors impacted net interest income when comparing
the first half of 1994 with 1993 as were discussed above for the three months
ended June 30, 1994 and 1993.

The increase in noninterest income, exclusive of securities gains and
mortgage brokerage income, for the second quarter and first half of 1994
benefitted from growth in all categories of income. The decrease in mortgage
brokerage income reflects a decline in refinancing activity due to increased
interest rates.

Noninterest Expense
- - - -------------------

Total noninterest expense for the second quarter and first half of 1994 was
$6.26 million and $12.2 million, respectively, which represented a 13.0% and
12.4% increase over the comparative periods of 1993. The increase in
noninterest expense is primarily due to servicing a larger customer base in
1994.

<PAGE>

COMMERCE BANK
Form F-4
June 30, 1994

Salaries and benefits expense was $2.82 million for the second quarter of
1994, up 6.1% from comparative 1993. Salaries and benefits for the first six
months of 1994 were $5.69 million or 9.2% above comparative 1993. The higher
expense reflected regular merit and promotional increases along with an increase
in the number of employees to service growth in the customer base. The number
of full-time-equivalent employees was 344 at June 30, 1994 compared with 304 for
June 30, 1993.

Occupancy of bank premises expense increased 15.2% or $179,000, during the
first half of 1994 when compared with 1993 due to scheduled rent increases and
increased lease space for branch locations and operations. Furniture and
equipment expense increased 8.4% or $68,000 during the first half of 1994 over
comparative 1993 as a result of expenses associated with maintenance and
depreciation charges from equipment upgrades. FDIC insurance premiums increased
7.7%, or $50,000, during the first half of 1994 when compared with 1993 due to
growth in the deposit base.

Other expenses increased 18.7%, or $567,000 for the first half of 1994 when
compared with 1993. The increase was primarily due to the added expenses of
supporting customer services.

Noninterest expense for the second quarter of 1994 increased $298,000 or
5.0% when compared with the first quarter of 1994.

Provision for Income Taxes
- - - --------------------------

Commerce reported a provision for income taxes of $815,000 and $840,000 for
the second quarter of 1994 and 1993, respectively, for an effective tax rate of
30.7% and 33.8%. The provision for income taxes for the first half of 1994 was
$1.70 million, or 7.2% above the 1993 level and was due to increased earnings.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Temporary Investments
- - - ---------------------

interest bearing deposits with other banks in the amount of $1.0 million,
mortgages held for sale of $1.6 million, and federal funds sold of $10.0
million. Temporary investments are used for daily cash management purposes,
manage-

COMMERCE BANK
Form F-4
June 30, 1994

ment of short-term interest rate opportunities and interest rate risk, and
as a result daily balances vary. The average balance of temporary investments
during the second quarter of 1994 was $14.0 million and represented 2.2% of
total earning assets compared with $16.4 million or 2.7% for 1993. The average
balance of temporary investments for the first half of 1994 was $13.4 million,
or 2.1% of total average earning assets, compared with $15.5 million, or 2.62%
for comparative 1993.

Securities
- - - ----------

As further discussed under Financial Statements Note 4, Commerce adopted
SFAS No. 115 effective January 1, 1994. Total securities were $217.7 million on
June 30, 1994, representing a 14.4% decrease from comparative 1993.

Loans and Asset Quality
- - - -----------------------

During the first six months of 1994, average loans, net of unearned income
and deferred fees, increased 17.7% to $392.2 million and were 61.9% of total
earning assets compared with 56.2% for 1993. Loans, net of unearned income were
$408.4 million at June 30, 1994, or 17.7% and $61.4 million above the $347.1
million reported at June 30, 1993.

Nonperforming assets at June 30, 1994 were $5.27 million as compared with
$4.88 million a year earlier and $4.0 million at the end of 1993.

Net loan charge-offs were $221,000 for the second quarter of 1994, compared
with $291,000 for the same period of 1993. Net loan charge-offs for the first
half of 1994 declined 2.2% to $539,000 from $551,000 for comparative 1993. The
provision for loan losses for the second quarter of 1994 was $600,000, compared
with the $725,000 provision for comparative 1993. The provision for loan losses
for the first half of 1994 was $1.2 million, or 21.3% and $325,000 lower than
the $1.53 million reported for comparative 1993. The decline in the provision
for loan losses during 1994 correlates with a lower level of net loan charge-
offs and improvement in other asset quality indicators.

The allowance for loan losses at June 30, 1994 was $7.19 million, which was
equivalent to 1.76% of period end loans, compared with 1.91% for the second
quarter of 1993.

Deposits
- - - --------

Total deposits at June 30, 1994 were $636.4 million, representing an
increase of 3.3% or $20.2 million over comparative 1993. Total average deposits
increased 6.1% during the first six months of 1994 to $626.8 million when
compared with the first half of 1993.

The cost of interest bearing deposits was 3.67% for the second quarter of
1994 compared with 4.02% for the second quarter of 1993 and 3.64% for the first
quarter of 1994. The cost of interest bearing deposits for the first half of
1994 was 3.65%, or 45 basis points lower than the 4.10% cost for the first half
of 1993. The lower cost in 1994 reflects the continued lowering of market rates
of interest.

Average noninterest bearing demand deposits as a percentage of average
total deposits were 15.41% and 14.24% during the first half of 1994 and 1993,
respectively. Average noninterest bearing demand deposits were 15.8% and 14.8%

Notes to Financial Statements
- - - -----------------------------

Note 1. General
-------

The financial statements in this report have not been audited. In the
opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and results of operations for the interim periods have been
made. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These statements
should be read in conjunction with the 1993 annual report on Form F-2. Results
of operations for the three months ended March 31, 1994 are not necessarily
indicative of the results of operations for the full year or any other interim
periods.

Note 2. Preferred Stock Arrangement with BB&T Financial Corporation
-----------------------------------------------------------

Subsequent to March 31, 1994, Commerce entered into an arrangement with
BB&T Financial Corporation, Wilson, North Carolina under which BB&T has agreed
to purchase up to $12 million of a newly created class of Commerce preferred
stock.

The preferred stock arrangement with BB&T calls for BB&T to purchase
initially 30,000 shares of a new series of Commerce Bank preferred stock for
$3.0 million, with a commitment through December 31, 2000 by BB&T to purchase an
additional 90,000 shares for $9.0 million upon demand by Commerce. The
preferred stock is intended to qualify as Tier 1 capital for bank regulatory
purposes.

The initial annual dividend rate on the preferred stock is 6.75% through
1996. Thereafter, the rate will float to 275 basis points over the interest
rate on the 3-year U.S. Treasury note, subject to a ceiling of 11.0% and a floor
of 5.0%. The preferred stock is nonvoting and will have a liquidation value of
$100 per share.

The preferred stock may be redeemed by Commerce Bank, subject to the
receipt of required bank regulatory approvals. Any redemption is subject to the
payment of the applicable redemption premium, including a special redemption
premium of 10% of the aggregate liquidation value of the outstanding shares of
preferred stock in the case of redemption upon a change in control of Commerce.

If the preferred stock is not first redeemed, it may be converted at the
option of BB&T into Commerce common stock in the limited circumstances where

5
<PAGE>

COMMERCE BANK
Form F-4
March 31, 1994

Commerce's leverage capital ratio falls below a designated minimum level or if a
change in control with respect to Commerce occurs. The conversion price will
equal the closing market price of Commerce common stock on the date of initial
issuance of the preferred stock. Based on Commerce's closing price of $25.00 on
Wednesday, April 20th, each share of preferred stock would be convertible in the
limited circumstances described above into four shares of Commerce common stock,
and the conversion of the initial 30,000 shares of preferred stock would
represent on a pro forma basis 4.2% of Commerce's then outstanding common
shares.

While it is anticipated that the initial sale of $3.0 million of preferred
stock will close by the end of April, there are no definite plans at this time
for sale to BB&T of any of the remaining 90,000 shares of preferred stock
covered by the commitment.

The sale of the Commerce preferred stock to BB&T is subject to receipt of
confirmation from the FDIC that the preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital
and from the Federal Reserve on certain other regulatory matters.

Note 3. Commitments
-----------

At March 31, 1994, the amount of off-balance sheet commitments to extend
credit were $31.4 million and standby letters of credit and financial guarantees
were $5.7 million.

Note 4. Accounting Change
-----------------

Effective January 1, 1994, Commerce adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 115 ("SFAS 115") "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities". In accordance with SFAS 115, prior period
financial statements have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting
principle. SFAS 115 requires that certain securities be classified into one of
three categories: held to maturity, available for sale, or trading based on
management's ability and intent at time of purchase. Securities classified as
held to maturity are carried at their amortized cost; securities classified as
available for sale are carried at their fair values with the amount of
unrealized gains or losses, net of income taxes, reported as a separate
component of shareholders' equity; and securities classified as trading are
carried at their fair value with the unrealized gains or losses 

6
<PAGE>

COMMERCE BANK
Form F-4
March 31, 1994

included in earnings.

As a result of the adoption of SFAS 115, on January 1, 1994, Commerce
classified securities with a fair value of approximately $155 million as
securities available for sale. The opening balance of shareholders equity was
increased by $2.32 million relating to net unrealized gain on securities
available for sale of $3.58 million, less applicable income taxes of $1.25
million. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 115, securities deemed available for
sale were carried at the lower of aggregate amortized cost or market value.

Note 5. Earnings Per Share
------------------

Primary earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the period after giving retroactive
effect to the 5% stock dividends declared in 1993 and 1992. Dilutive stock
options have been converted to common stock equivalents for the calculation of
weighted average shares outstanding based upon the average market price of
Commerce's common stock. Fully diluted earnings per share assumes the
conversion of outstanding convertible subordinated capital notes and elimination
of interest paid thereon, after tax effect, and the exercise of dilutive stock
options, as of the beginning of each period. The dilutive effect of outstanding
options and convertible subordinated debt is computed using the greater of the
closing price or the average market price of Commerce's stock. The computation
of earnings per share is provided on the following page.

EARNINGS ANALYSIS

Net Interest Income
- - - -------------------

Net interest income, the principal source of Commerce's earnings, is the
amount of income generated by interest-earning assets (primarily loans and
investment securities) reduced by the total interest cost of the funds (chiefly
deposits) incurred to carry them.

Net interest margin was 4.38% for the first quarter of 1994, reflecting a 5
basis point improvement over comparative 1993. Net interest margin for 1994 was
favorably impacted by a 18% increase in average loans which was partially offset
by a 66 basis point decrease in yield. The annualized yield on earning assets
decreased 51 basis points from 8.05% for the first quarter of 1994 to 7.54% for
comparative 1994. The decline was principally due to a lower rate environment.

The annualized cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased 54 basis
points, from 4.25% for the first quarter of 1993 to 3.71% for the first quarter
of 1994. The decrease was due to a lower rate environment as the yield on
interest bearing deposits decreased 55 basis points, from 4.19% for the first
quarter of 1993 to 3.64% for compartive 1994. See "Deposits" for further
information on Commerce's deposit structure and cost rates.

Net interest margin improved 13 basis points when comparing the fourth
quarter of 1993 with the first quarter of 1994. Net interest spread improved 12
basis points reflecting a 10 basis point decrease on the cost of interest
bearing deposits. Net interest income was $6.8 million for the first quarter of

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting Policies 
The accounting and reporting policies of Commerce Bank ("Commerce") 
conform to generally accepted accounting principles and general practices within
the financial services industry. The following is a summary of the more
significant policies.

Temporary Investments 
Temporary investments are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or 
market value.

Investment Securities 
Marketable debt securities are stated at cost adjusted for discount 
accreted and premium amortized based on management's intention to hold these
assets on a long-term basis and Commerce's ability to hold them to maturity or
the foreseeable future. In making this determination, management considers
significant known liquidity requirements and capital planning; however,
investment securities may be sold as part of prudent asset/liability management.
Marketable equity securities are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or
market value, and unrealized losses are reflected as a reduction of
shareholders' equity in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 12. Gains and losses on the sale of securities are
determined by the specific identification method and are classified as
securities gains or losses in the accompanying statement of income. As described
in Note 4, Commerce will adopt SFAS No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities" beginning in 1994.

Loans 
Loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned 
income and deferred loan fees, net of costs. Interest on loans and amortization
of unearned income, deferred fees and origination costs are computed by methods
which generally result in level rates of return on principal amounts
outstanding.

Commerce discontinues the accrual of interest on loans based on 
delinquency status, an evaluation of the related collateral and the financial
strength of the borrower. Loans generally are placed in nonaccrual status when
the collection of principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, or earlier
if collection is uncertain based upon an evaluation of the net realizable value
of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower. Income recognized
on consumer loans is generally discontinued after a delinquent status period of
120 days, unless conditions warrant otherwise. Management may elect to continue
the accrual of interest if the loan is well collateralized and in the process of
collection. Income is recognized on the cash basis for nonaccrual loans unless
there is doubt as to collectibility of principal, in which case interest
payments are applied to reduce principal. Loans are charged against the
allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of
the principal is unlikely. When loans are placed on nonaccural, uncollected
interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and uncollected
interest accrued in prior years is charged to the allowance for loan losses.

As described in Note 6, Commerce will be required to adopt SFAS No. 
114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" beginning in 1995. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 
The allowance for loan losses is established by management based on an 
evaluation of the potential loss exposure in the loan portfolio. The level of
the allowance for loan losses is based upon the quality of the loan portfolio as
determined by management after a detailed specific review of problem loans,
consideration of current and historical loan loss experience, diversification as
to the type of loans in the portfolio, the amount of collateralized and
uncollateralized loans, banking industry standards and averages, and general
economic conditions. While management uses available information to recognize
losses on loans and real estate owned, future additions to the allowance for
loan losses and additional write-downs in the valuation of real estate owned may
be necessary based on changes in economic conditions.

Bank Premises and Equipment 
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and amortization. Depreciation and amortization charges are computed by the
straight-line method. Premises and equipment are depreciated over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, except for leasehold improvements which are
amortized over the terms of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives
of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Generally, estimated lives of the
principal items of premise and equipment are buildings and improvements--15 to
40 years, furniture, fixtures and equipment--3 to 20 years, and capital leases
over lease terms. The costs of major renovations are capitalized, while the
costs of ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Gains and
losses on dispositions are reflected in operations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Foreclosed Property 
Foreclosed property consists of properties acquired through foreclosure, 
acceptance in lieu of foreclosure, or insubstance foreclosures. In-substance
foreclosures are properties in which the borrower has little or no equity in the
collateral, where repayment of the loan is expected only from the operation or
sale of the collateral, and the borrower either effectively abandons control of
the property or the borrower has retained control of the property but his
ability to rebuild equity based on current financial conditions is considered
doubtful. These properties are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair
value. Losses from the acquisition of property in full or partial satisfaction
of debt are charged against the allowance for loan losses at transfer from loans
into foreclosed property. Estimated fair value is reviewed periodically by
management on a specific property basis, and an allowance for loss is
established for any declines in value. Net operating expenses are charged to
noninterest expense.

Income Taxes 
Effective January 1, 1993, Commerce changed its method of accounting 
for income taxes from the deferred method under Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 11 to the liability method required by SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes" (see Note 14 "Income Taxes"). For years prior to 1993, Commerce
deferred the past tax effects of timing differences between financial reporting
and taxable income. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities
(i.e., temporary differences) and are measured at the enacted rates that will be
in effect when these differences reverse. As permitted under SFAS No. 109, prior
years' financial statements have not been restated.

The adoption of SFAS 109 did not have a material effect on Commerce's 
financial position or results of operations for 1993.

Earnings Per Share 
Primary earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted 
average number of shares outstanding during the year after giving retroactive
effect to the 5% stock dividends declared in 1993, 1992 and 1991. Dilutive stock
options have been converted to common stock equivalents for the calculation of
weighted average shares outstanding based upon the average market price of
Commerce's common stock. Fully diluted earnings per share assumes the conversion
of outstanding convertible subordinated capital notes and elimination of
interest paid thereon, after tax effect, and the exercise of dilutive stock
options, as of the beginning of each year. The dilutive effect of outstanding
options and convertible subordinated debt is computed using the greater of the
closing price or the average market price of Commerce's common stock.

Trust Assets and Income 
Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not assets of 
Commerce and are not included in the accompanying financial statements. Trust 
service income is recognized on the accrual basis.

Other 
Certain reclassifications have been made to amounts previously reported 
in 1992 and 1991 to conform with the 1993 presentation.

Note 2 -- Restrictions on Cash 
and Due from Banks 

Commerce is required to maintain average reserve balances on 
transactional deposit accounts with the Federal Reserve Bank under Regulation 
D. The daily average amounts of these reserve balances for the years ended 
December 31, 1993 and 1992 were $4.9 million and $4.6 million, respectively. 
On December 31, 1993 and 1992, these reserve balances were $5.2 million and 
$5.4 million, respectively.

During 1993, Commerce purchased $89.8 million in investment securities 
and had sales of $51.4 million that resulted in gains of $1.42 million and 
losses of $20,000. During 1992, Commerce purchased $181.9 million in 
investment securities and had sales of $35.8 million that resulted in gains 
of $1.1 million and losses of $20,000. Securities with carrying values of 
approximately $18.6 million and $13.5 million on December 31, 1993 and 1992, 
respectively, were pledged to provide collateral for public deposits and for 
other purposes required or permitted by law.
In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which
requires investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair
values and all investments in debt securities to be divided into three separate
categories: held-to-maturity, trading, and available-for-sale. The new standard
will be effective for 1994 reporting. Retroactive application is prohibited.
Under SFAS No. 115, securities are classified as held-to-maturity when 
management has the ability and intent to hold them to maturity, and are 
stated at cost adjusted for discount accreted and premium amortized. Trading 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling 
them in the near term are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and 
losses included in earnings. Commerce does not anticipate establishment of a 
trading account upon adoption of SFAS 115 or any effect on the results of 
operations. Available-for-sale securities that management intends to hold

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for an indefinite period of time but not necessarily to maturity, are reported
at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred tax, included
as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
SFAS 115 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 
1993. Commerce plans to adopt the standard as required during the first 
quarter of 1994 and anticipates classification of the investment portfolio at 
January 1, 1994 as follows:

Note 5 -- Loans, Net of Unearned Interest and Deferred Fees 

Excluding loans in nonaccrual status, loans net of unearned interest 
and deferred fees on December 31, 1993 and 1992, with fixed and floating 
rates of interest were $377.3 million and $325.8 million, respectively. Loans 
on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued amounted to $918,000 
and $490,000 on December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Interest income 
would have increased $86,000 and $267,000 for 1993 and 1992, respectively, if 
interest had been accrued on average outstanding nonperforming loans. There 
were no material commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose 
loans were classified as nonperforming on December 31, 1993.
In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 
114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," which is effective 
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994 with earlier application 
permitted. SFAS No. 114 requires that loans within its scope be measured on 
either the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's 
effective interest rate or, if more practical, at the loan's observable 
market price or the fair value of the collateral when the loan is collateral 
dependent. SFAS No. 114 amends SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," to 
clarify that a creditor should evaluate the collectibility of both 
contractual interest and contractual principal of all receivables in 
assessing the need for a loss accrual. The statement also amends SFAS No. 15, 
"Accounting by Debtors and Creditors of Troubled Debt Restructuring," to 
require a creditor to measure all restructured loans from troubled debt 
restructurings that involve a modification of terms in accordance with this 
statement.
Commerce is currently evaluating the impact of the new statement and 
anticipates adoption during the first quarter of 1995, without restatement of 
prior years. Commerce, however, does not believe the adoption of SFAS 114 
will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of 
operations.

Note 7 -- Related Party Transactions 

During 1993 and 1992, certain executive officers and directors of 
Commerce, including their immediate families and companies with which they 
are associated, were loan customers of Commerce. Total loans outstanding to 
these persons on December 31, 1993, and 1992 amounted to $20.3 million and 
$15.9 million, respectively. During 1991 an internally classified loan to a 
former director was resolved by a charge to the allowance for loan losses in 
the amount of $1.1 million.
In the ordinary course of its business, Commerce has engaged in certain 
transactions with certain of its directors and/or corporations and other 
entities in which they are significantly interested. Commerce has engaged 
legal services and has purchased equipment from directors. Except for the 
lease agreement described in the next paragraph, no transactions amounted to 
more than $60,000 for any one interested director for the three years ended 
December 31, 1993. Also, during 1993, on behalf of Commerce, a director 
provided appraisal services to customers of Commerce, which management used 
in credit decisions. Customers reimburse Commerce for these services and the 
director does not participate further on these credit transactions.
Commerce leases office space from an entity in which a director of 
Commerce holds approximately a 33% interest. Lease expense for this location 
was $246,000, $224,000, and $213,000 for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Note 9 -- Intangible Assets 

As of December 31, 1993, Commerce had unamortized intangible assets of 
$1.0 million. This included the excess of cost over the fair value of net 
tangible and identified intangible assets of acquired branches and deposit 
based intangibles. During the third quarter of 1993 Commerce recorded a 
special nonrecurring, noncash adjustment of $910,000 for the writedown of an 
intangible asset of deposits acquired on September 15, 1990. The adjustment 
better aligns management's estimate of the asset's value, given changes in 
market and economic conditions. The remaining intangible asset is amortized 
over a weighted average life of six years.

Note 10 -- Short-Term Borrowings 

Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased in the amount of
$1.4 million on December 31, 1993, and securities sold under agreement to
repurchase in the amount of $563,000 on December 31, 1992. These borrowings
generally mature within 1 to 21 days or are due upon demand. The following
amounts and rates applied during 1993 and 1992:

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The subordinated capital notes were issued by Commerce under terms of 
an indenture dated September 1, 1990, and are convertible into Commerce's 
common stock on or before August 31, 2002, unless previously redeemed at a 
conversion price of $19.00 per share, subject to adjustment in certain 
events. The notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at Commerce's option 
subject to regulatory approval, beginning September 1, 1995 at 105% of the 
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, and at reducing premiums 
thereafter. The notes bear interest at 10% per annum with interest payable 
quarterly. The notes are subordinated to the claims of depositors and certain 
other creditors of Commerce, and are considered equity contract notes, which 
are included in Tier 2 risk-based capital for bank regulatory purposes.

Note 12 -- Shareholders' Equity and Stock Option Plan 

Commerce is authorized to issue 5 million shares of common stock, par

Commerce is authorized to issue 1 million shares of preferred stock, 
par value $5.00 per share. At December 31, 1993, no shares of preferred stock 
were issued. The rights of common shareholders are subordinated to the rights 
of preferred shareholders.
Commerce issued 625,000 additional shares of common stock during May, 
1992, through an underwritten offering resulting in net proceeds of $9.0 
million. During 1993, $5,000 of convertible subordinated capital notes were 
converted to 250 shares of common stock. Prior to 1993, no amounts were 
converted.
Under Commerce's Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, common 
shareholders of record may reinvest quarterly common stock dividends in 
shares of common stock at prices 5% below current average market prices, 
without payment of service charges or brokerage commissions. Optional cash 
purchases of common stock may be made by common shareholders at the current 
average market price. Optional cash payments may not be less than $100 per 
payment and the total of all such payments may not exceed $5,000 in any 
calendar quarter.
The 1985 Stock Option Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock 
options and nonqualified options to key management employees of Commerce. The 
option price is the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. All 
options shall expire not more than 10 years from the date of grant, if not 
previously exercised. 
In 1993, the Board of Directors adopted and the shareholders approved 
the 1993 Incentive Stock Plan which provides for the granting of awards in 
the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock to 
key management employees of Commerce. The option price is the fair market 
value of the stock at the date of grant. No options are exercisable until at 
least six months after grant or after ten years from grant.
All stock option amounts have been adjusted to reflect stock dividends and
stock splits since the inception of the plan. Federal income tax effects
relating to exercised shares are credited to capital surplus. A summary of
activity in the 1985 Stock Option Plan and 1993 Incentive Stock Plan follows:

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In 1993, 1992 and 1991, Commerce declared 5% stock dividends which were
recorded at fair market value with cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares.
In 1993, 1992, and 1991, Commerce declared $.51, $.26 and $.05 per share in cash
dividends, respectively. Total cash dividends declared in 1993, 1992 and 1991
were $1.30 million, $596,000, and $83,000, respectively.
State law imposes restrictions on the ability of all banks chartered 
under Virginia law to pay dividends. Among other requirements that must be 
satisfied, a Virginia bank must maintain a surplus fund amounting to 20% of 
its capital stock, and no dividends may be paid that would reduce the surplus 
fund below this mandatory amount. On December 31, 1993, Commerce had a 
surplus fund in excess of Virginia law. Commerce is also required to maintain 
minimum amounts of capital to total risk-weighted assets, as defined by the 
banking regulators. At December 31, 1993, Commerce was required to have 
minimum Tier 1 and total capital ratios of 4.00% and 8.00%, respectively. 
Commerce's actual ratios at that date were 9.74% and 12.14%, respectively. 
Commerce's Tier 1 leverage ratio at December 31, 1993, was 6.49%.

Note 14 -- Income Taxes 

As discussed in Note 1, Commerce adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," for 1993. 
Applying the provisions of SFAS No. 109 had no material effect on Commerce's 
financial statements. Prior years' financial statements were not restated, 
therefore, the amounts shown for fiscal years 1992 and 1991 were determined 
in accordance with the provisions of the Accounting Principles Board Opinion 
No. 11. 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Commerce's income tax returns through 1991 have been examined or are no
longer subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition to
federal income taxes, Commerce incurred Virginia bank franchise taxes of
$149,000 in 1993, $83,000 in 1992, and $77,000 in 1991. This tax is imposed upon
banks in Virginia in lieu of income and personal property taxes. Commerce remits
80% of the tax to the Virginia municipalities in which it does business and the
remaining 20% to the State.
The applicable federal income tax effect of investment security gains was
$481,000 in 1993, $374,000 in 1992, and $306,000 in 1991.

Note 17 -- Contingent Liabilities 

Commerce is subject to claims and lawsuits which arise primarily in the
ordinary course of business. Based on information presently available and advice
received from legal counsel representing Commerce in connection with such claims
and lawsuits, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate
determination of such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial position of Commerce.

Note 18 -- Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 

In the normal course of business, in order to meet the financing needs of
its customers, Commerce is a party to financial instruments with off-balance
sheet risk. These include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of
credit. These instruments involve, to various degrees, elements of credit and
interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of
financial position. Management conducts regular reviews of these instruments on
an individual customer basis, and the results are considered in assessing the
adequacy of Commerce's allowance for loan losses. Management does not anticipate
any material losses as a result of these transactions.
Commerce's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and
standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those
instruments. Commerce uses the same credit policies in making commitments and
conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements. Commerce evaluates each customer's credit-
worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed
necessary by Commerce upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit
evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts
receivable, inventory, property, plant, and equipment, income-producing
properties and balances left on deposit.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Commerce
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees
are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The
credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as
that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.
The following table indicates the amount of off-balance sheet
transactions:

============================================================================
</TABLE> 

Note 19 -- Risk Factors 

Commerce's operations are affected by various risk factors, including
interest rate risk, credit risk and risk from geographic concentration of
lending activities. Management attempts to manage interest rate risk through
various asset/liability management techniques designed to match maturities of
assets and liabilities. Loan policies and administration are designed to provide
a well diversified loan portfolio and assurance that loans will only be granted
to credit-worthy borrowers. Commerce considers the allowance for loan losses of
$6.53 million to be a reasonable estimate of potential loss exposure in the loan
portfolio on December 31, 1993; however, subjective factors and factors beyond
the control of Commerce could impact this estimate on an on-going basis. In
addition, Commerce is a community bank and, as such, is mandated by the
Community Reinvestment Act and other regulations to conduct most of its lending
activities within the Hampton Roads, Virginia market. As a result, Commerce and
its borrowers may be vulnerable to the consequences of change in the local
economy.

Note 20 -- Retirement Plan 

Commerce has a 401(K) Retirement, Thrift and Profit Sharing Plan. The Plan
is a defined contribution plan covering all employees who have completed at
least 1,000 hours of service during the twelve-month period beginning
<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

on the first day of employment. It is subject to the provisions of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Commerce contributes an amount equal to
at least 50% of participant's payroll savings contribution up to 6% of a
participant's annual compensation. Additionally, a profit sharing contribution
may be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Each participant is
required to contribute at least 1% of their compensation but may contribute up
to the lesser of 15% of their compensation or $8,994. Bank contributions were
$304,000, $232,000, and $118,000 for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Note 21 - Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,"
requires Commerce to disclose estimated fair value for each class of financial
instrument. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on
relevant market information about the financial instrument. These valuations,
where applicable, do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from
offering for sale at one time Commerce's entire holdings of a particular
financial instrument. In addition, no market exists for a significant portion of
Commerce's financial instruments. Fair value estimates are based on judgments
regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk
characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgement, and changes in assumptions could significantly affect the
estimates.
Fair value estimates are based on existing on - and off - balance sheet
financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated
future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered
financial instruments. SFAS 107 specifically excludes certain items that do not
meet the definition of a financial instrument. These items include such things
as Commerce's mortgage brokerage operation that contributes net fee income
annually, the trust department, deferred tax assets, property, plant, and
equipment and goodwill. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the
realization of the unrealized gains and losses may have a significant effect on
fair value and have not been considered in the estimates. Accordingly, the fair
value information presented does not purport to represent any underlying "market
value" of Commerce taken as a whole.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of Commerce's financial instruments.

Cash and Due from Banks 
Cash and due from banks consist of currency and coin, cash items in
process of collection and demand account balances, and their carrying amounts
approximate fair value.

Temporary Investments 
Temporary investments consist of interest bearing deposits with other
banks, and mortgages held for sale, and their carrying amounts approximate fair
value.

Investment Securities 
Fair value for investment securities are based on quoted market prices
where available. Otherwise, fair values are based on bid quotations received
from independent securities dealers or are estimated utilizing independent
pricing services based on available market data. In addition, fair values are
calculated based on the value of one unit without regard to any premium or
discount that may result from concentrations of ownership of a financial
instrument, possible tax ramifications or estimated transactions costs. See Note
4 for related fair value information.

Loans 
Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial
characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as commercial, real estate,
installment and tax-exempt. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed
and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and nonperforming
categories.
The fair values of performing loans (loans that are on accrual status) are
calculated by discounting estimated cash flows using estimated market rates that
reflect the credit and interest rate risk and prepayments inherent in the loan.
For nonperforming loans and certain loans where the credit quality of the
borrower has deteriorated significantly, fair values are estimated by
discounting expected cash flows at a rate commensurate with the risk associated
with the estimated cash flows, or recent appraisals of the underlying
collateral.

Deposit Liabilities 
The recorded amounts of deposits with no stated maturity, such as
noninterest bearing demand deposits, savings and NOW accounts, and money market
and checking accounts, by definition approximate fair value.
The fair value of deposits with contractual maturities is based on the
discounted value of expected cash flows. The discount rates used are those
currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.

Short-term Borrowings 
Short-term borrowings consist of securities sold under agreement to
repurchase and represent overnight transactions, and the carrying values
approximate fair value.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Long-term Debt 
The fair value of the capital notes is calculated by discounting the
contractual cash flows using an incremental rate of borrowing that would be
currently available to Commerce for new debt of similar remaining maturity and
terms.

Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit 
The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the fees
currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the
remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the
counterparties. For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the
difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The
fair value of standby letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for
similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise
settle the obligations with the counterparties which approximates carrying
value.

the footnotes follows:

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Commerce Bank:
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Commerce Bank as of

equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are 
the responsibility of Commerce's management. Our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The financial 
statements of Commerce Bank for the years ended December 31, 1992, and 1991 were
audited by other auditors, whose report, dated January 15, 1993, expressed an 
unqualified opinion on those statements.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the 1993 financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Commerce Bank as of 
December 31, 1993 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
