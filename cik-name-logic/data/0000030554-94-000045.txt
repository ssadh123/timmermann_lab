WILMINGTON, Del., October 26 -- DuPont reported net 
income for the third quarter 1994 of $647 million, or $.95 per 
share, record earnings for any third quarter. This compares to 
a net loss of $680 million, or $1.01 per share, for the third 
quarter of 1993.
Last year's third quarter included nonrecurring 
charges of $1.3 billion after-tax for restructurings, and tax 
benefits of $265 million resulting from tax law changes. The 
current quarter includes several offsetting nonrecurring items 
and tax benefits that, in total, have no effect on earnings per 
share. After adjusting both periods to exclude net nonrecurring 
charges and tax benefits, earnings were up 86 percent.
"This marks the third consecutive quarter of 
significantly improved earnings, as ongoing benefits from cost 
reduction and growth in global markets were major contributors 
to the bottom line," said Chairman Edgar S. Woolard Jr. "As a 
result, we are on track to achieve record earnings for the year. 
This performance confirms that transformation efforts to make 
all of our businesses globally competitive are working. We are 
very pleased with the accomplishments our people have made this 
year on many fronts -- business growth, continued cost reduc- 
tion, productivity improvements and strong cash generation -- 
and importantly, we see opportunity for continued improvements 
in the future."

Earnings improved in all chemical and specialties 
segments, principally driven by higher sales volumes and reduced 
fixed costs. Further, the coal business rebounded from last 
year's strike-impaired results. The Petroleum segment continued 
to perform well in a challenging industry environment.
Total company sales for the third quarter were 
$9.8 billion, up 7 percent from prior year. Petroleum segment 
sales were up 9 percent, principally reflecting increased U.S. 
refinery inputs and the impact of higher worldwide excise taxes. 
Combined segments other than Petroleum were up 5 percent, all 
from higher sales volume, as price levels, on average, were 
about equal to last year. The largest percentage changes in 
sales volume were in the European and Asian regions.
The following compares business segment results for 
the third quarter of 1994 with the same period last year, 
excluding the impact of nonrecurring items and special tax 
benefits described in the accompanying segment footnotes:
Chemicals segment earnings were $104 million, up 
$58 million, or 126 percent, principally attributable to 
improved results for chemical specialties. Sales were up 
11 percent, reflecting 9 percent higher volume and 2 percent 
higher prices.

Fibers segment earnings were $164 million, up 
$55 million, or 50 percent, principally reflecting higher 
sales for nylon, nonwovens, and "Lycra" spandex. Segment sales 
rose 6 percent, reflecting 6 percent higher sales volume, as 
average selling prices remained unchanged.
Polymers segment earnings were $177 million, up 
$106 million, or 149 percent from last year. Engineering 
polymers, packaging and industrial polymers, and elastomers all 
continued strong. Segment sales were up 14 percent after 
adjusting for the absence of a previously sold polyethylene 
business. The sales improvement reflects 15 percent higher 
volume, partly offset by 1 percent lower prices.
Diversified Businesses segment earnings totaled 
$135 million, up $129 million from last year. This reflects 
the recovery of coal earnings which were adversely affected last 
year by strikes, and higher earnings from crop protection 
chemicals and medical products. Segment sales were up 1 percent 
after adjusting for the absence of the sporting goods business 
which was sold last year. Sales volume was equal to last year, 
while prices were 1 percent higher, primarily reflecting a 
weaker U.S. dollar.
Petroleum segment earnings were $172 million, down 
5 percent from prior year. Upstream earnings were $84 million, 
23 percent lower than last year, attributable to lower

<PAGE>

international gas volumes, higher worldwide exploration costs, 
lower U.S. natural gas prices and crude oil volumes, more than 
offsetting lower costs. Downstream earnings were $88 million, 
up 22 percent, largely reflecting higher U.S. refined product 
margins and refinery inputs.
Earnings per share for the first nine months of 1994 
were a record $3.05. This compares with $.48 earned in 1993. 
Excluding nonrecurring charges and tax benefits from both 
periods, year-to-date earnings were $3.12 per share versus
$1.98 last year, up 58 percent. Year-to-date sales totaled 
$29.2 billion, 5 percent higher than prior year. In addition, 
strong earnings and spending controls have generated 
$1.8 billion of net cash flow for the first nine months of this 
year.
