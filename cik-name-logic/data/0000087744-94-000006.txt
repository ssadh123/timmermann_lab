Item 5. Other Events.

Company management believes that the Company's operating results 
have been negatively impacted by certain of its non-core
businesses. As a result, management has developed a plan that
involves the discontinuance of certain of those non-core businesses 
with the objective of future profit margin improvement. The financial 
impact of the plan will be integrated into the Company's March 1994 
quarterly results which will be released with customary timing. 
The impact could result in a net loss for the March 1994 quarter in 
the range of twenty cents per share. 

The Company believes that its overall business posture is strong, 
with March quarter ending backlog of ongoing business at peak levels 
and in a growth trend. June quarter sales are expected to be well 
above the revenue plateau of recent quarters.
