SNET ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS

Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation

(SNET) -- (NYSE: SNG) -- announced today that consolidated net

income for the second quarter of 1994 was $0.71 per share

compared with net income of $0.64 per share for the second

quarter of 1993.

"We had a good quarter. Revenues are stronger and we're

beginning to see benefits from our cost-cutting initiatives,"

said Daniel J. Miglio, SNET chairman and chief executive

officer. "We continue to face immediate challenges that

include operating in an economy lacking vigor and dealing with

mounting competition. We continue to invest in the future.

Our goals are to provide excellent service, expand promising

business opportunities in multimedia and long distance, and

strengthen our marketing initiatives for new and existing

products," he added.

Consolidated revenues and sales for the second quarter

were up over four percent to almost $428 million. That

figure includes revenue for Southern New England Telephone,

the company's largest subsidiary, which was up three percent

to $371 million for the quarter. Access lines in service

grew nearly two

-more-

-2-

percent, and the company continued to increase its sales of

premium services like Totalphone[SM] and SmartLink[SM]. The

increase in revenue was also due to higher rates authorized

by the Department of Public Utility Control in July 1993.

In-state toll revenue decreased due to competitive price

reductions and expanded local-calling service that shifted a

portion of toll revenue to local-service revenue.

SNET's other subsidiaries had an overall revenue

increase of nearly 15 percent to $57 million, as the company

continues to increase its customer base in the cellular and

long-distance businesses.

Operating expenses, excluding depreciation, for the

quarter were up slightly. Salary and wage expenses were

down, but this was more than offset by an increased

commitment of resources for marketing and operating costs in

the long-distance and multimedia businesses. Depreciation

and amortization expense increased almost 16 percent, as

expected, due mainly to higher depreciation rates authorized

by state regulators. Interest expense dropped almost $4

million because of savings from previous refinancings and

less borrowing.

SNET is an independent telecommunications company that

offers through its subsidiaries network and information-

management services and communications systems; in-state,

national, and international long-distance communications

service; directory publishing and advertising services; and

cellular mobile phone and paging services. SNET is building

I-SNET, Connecticut's broadband, information superhighway to

serve all its customers.
