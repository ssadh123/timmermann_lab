AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of
January 9, 1994, by and among HEALTHTRUST, INC. - THE
HOSPITAL COMPANY, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
ODYSSEY ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and EPIC
HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the
Company, Parent and Sub deem it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders to consummate,
and have unanimously approved, the merger of Sub with and
into the Company upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein (the "Merger").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing and the respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

The Merger

Section 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and
subject to all of the conditions hereof, at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.02) Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of
Sub shall cease (Sub and the Company are sometimes referred
to herein as the "Constituent Corporations") and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
Company, in such capacity is sometimes referred to herein
as the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL").

Section 1.02 Effective Time of the Merger. 
The Merger shall become effective at the time (the
"Effective Time") of filing with the Delaware Secretary of
State of a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed in
accordance with, the applicable provisions of the DGCL or
at such later time as may be agreed to by Parent and the
Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger. The
parties will cause the Certificate of Merger to be filed
with the Delaware Secretary of State as soon as practicable
after the Closing (as defined in Section 1.03).
<PAGE>
Section 1.03 Closing. Prior to the filing of
the Certificate of Merger, a closing (the "Closing") will
take place for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction
or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII hereof. The Closing will take place on May 12,
1994 if the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof
shall then have been satisfied or, if permissible, waived,
or as soon thereafter as practicable after the satisfaction
or, if permissible, waiver of such conditions (the date and
time of the Closing being hereinafter referred to as the
"Closing Date"), at the offices of Dewey Ballantine, 1301
Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, 10019, unless
another place is agreed to by the parties hereto.

Section 1.04 Certificate of Incorporation;
By-laws. (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of Sub as
in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The By-laws of Sub as in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.05 Directors and Officers of the
Surviving Corporation. (a) The directors of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Surviving Corporation's Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws, or as otherwise provided by
applicable law.

(b) The officers of Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving
Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, or
as otherwise provided by applicable law.

ARTICLE II

Conversion and Exchange of Securities

Section 2.01 Conversion of Capital Stock. As
of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof:
<PAGE>
(a) Each share of common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of Sub (the "Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Each share of common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock")
held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such
shares.

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of Company Common Stock referred to in
Section 2.01(b) above and other than Dissenting Stock, as
defined in Section 2.01(d)) (the "Outstanding Common
Stock") shall be converted into the right to receive $7.00
in cash, without interest thereon (the "Merger
Consideration") upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such share of Company Common Stock.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of the Company Common
Stock with respect to which appraisal rights have been
demanded and perfected in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (the "Dissenting Stock") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at or
after the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal of
such shares under the DGCL shall effectively withdraw his
demand for such appraisal (in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL) or becomes ineligible for such appraisal
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) then, as of the
Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever
last occurs, such holder's Dissenting Stock shall cease to
be Dissenting Stock and shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest thereon, as provided in Section 2.01(c). 
The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for
appraisal and any other instrument served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
such Section. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company<PAGE>
will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal and will not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, settle or offer to settle any
such demands. From and after the Effective Time, any
payments with respect to any demands for appraisal or in
settlement of any such demands shall be made by the
Surviving Corporation in all circumstances. The parties
further agree that Parent shall have no obligation to make
such payments to the holders of Dissenting Stock pursuant
to this Agreement. Each holder of Dissenting Stock shall
have only such rights and remedies as are granted to such
holder under Section 262 of the DGCL. It is expressly
recognized by the Company and Parent that U.S. Trust
Company of California, N.A. (the "ESOP Trustee"), the
Trustee of the EPIC Healthcare Group, Inc. ("Group")
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP"), may exercise
appraisal rights to the extent permitted by and in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL on behalf of
participants of the ESOP so directing the ESOP Trustee, in
accordance with this Section 2.01(d); provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 2.01(d) shall be deemed to
waive or otherwise change the condition set forth in
Section 7.02(h) hereof.

Section 2.02 Exchange of Certificates. (a) 
As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a bank
or trust company to be designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through
the Exchange Agent, cash in an aggregate amount equal to
the number of shares of Outstanding Common Stock multiplied
by the Merger Consideration. The deposit made pursuant to
the preceding sentence is hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund." Any interest or other income earned on
the investment of cash held in the Exchange Fund shall be
paid to Parent as and when requested by Parent.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") whose shares were converted pursuant to
Section 2.01 into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions,
reasonably acceptable to the Company, as Parent shall<PAGE>
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as Parent or the Exchange Agent shall reasonably
request, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
satisfactory to Parent that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Section 2.02.

(c) The parties hereto agree that the letter
of transmittal mailing described in clause (b) above shall
contain an affidavit to be executed by each person from
whom any interest in the Company is being acquired by
Parent certifying, under penalties of perjury, such
person's taxpayer identification number and that such
person is not a foreign person pursuant to Section
1445(b)(2) of the Code (as hereinafter defined). The
parties hereto acknowledge that if such person does not
provide a properly completed affidavit to the Exchange
Agent, 10% of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to
such person will be withheld in accordance with Section
1445 of the Code.

Section 2.03 No Further Ownership Rights in
Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration delivered
upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been delivered in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, subject,
however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay
any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time which may have been
declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
or prior to the date hereof and which remain unpaid at the<PAGE>
Effective Time, and, at and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares
of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

Section 2.04 Termination of Exchange Fund. 
Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains
undistributed to the stockholders of the Company as of the
date which is six months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any stockholders of
the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of their claim for the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.05 No Liability. None of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.01 into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration for any cash
delivered to a state abandoned property administrator or
other public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

Section 2.06 Lost Certificates. In the event
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance
with Section 2.02. When authorizing such payment in
exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
person to whom the Merger Consideration is to be issued
shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
give Parent a bond satisfactory to Parent in such sum as it
may direct or otherwise indemnify Parent in a manner
satisfactory to Parent against any claim that may be made
against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

ARTICLE III

Representations and Warranties of the Company

The Company represents and warrants to each of
Parent and Sub that, except as disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedule delivered herewith (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"):

Section 3.01 Organization. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 9.09)
is, if a corporation, a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation (or, if a partnership or
other legal entity, is duly organized, is validly existing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and
has completed the filing of any certificates required by
such jurisdiction for the organization and continued
existence thereof) and has all requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted, except when
the failure to be so organized, existing and in good
standing or to make such filings or to have such power and
authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a material adverse effect on the business, operations,
properties, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (a "Company Material Adverse
Effect"). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by
it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and
in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section
3.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, for the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, (i) the jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization and (ii) each jurisdiction
in which such entity is qualified or licensed to do
business. The Company has previously delivered to Parent
complete and correct copies of (i) the Certificates of
Incorporation (or similar governing documents) and all
amendments thereto to the date hereof and (ii) the By-laws
(or similar governing documents) as in effect on the date
hereof, in each case for the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries.

Section 3.02 Capitalization. (a) The
authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock of which, as of<PAGE>
January 8, 1994, 40,167,753 shares were issued and
outstanding (of which 230,535 shares are beneficially owned
by the Company but not yet reflected as such on the records
of the Company's transfer agent because the certificates
therefor have not yet been presented for transfer, and
which shares shall become treasury shares prior to the
Closing Date). As of December 6, 1993, all outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock are owned of record as set
forth in Section 3.02(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. As of the date hereof, 32,000 shares of Company
Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of
outstanding options (the "Company Options") to purchase
Company Common Stock granted under the Group Stock Option
Plan (the "Stock Option Plan"), 5,902,116 shares of Company
Common Stock are reserved for issuance upon exchange of
Stock Appreciation Rights ("SAR"s) granted under the Second
Amended and Restated Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the
"SAR Plan"), of which 5,790,708 SARs are outstanding, and
293,049 shares of Company Common Stock are reserved for
issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase
Company Common Stock ("Warrants") issued pursuant to that
certain Warrant Agreement, dated September 30, 1988, among
the Company (as successor to Group) and the purchasers
named therein and that certain Warrant Agreement, dated
February 15, 1989, among the Company (as successor to
Group), Citibank, N.A. as Warrant Agent and the purchasers
named therein. All of the outstanding shares of the
Company's capital stock are, and all shares which may be
issued pursuant to the exercise of Company Options, SARs or
Warrants will be, when issued in accordance with the
respective terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and free of any preemptive
rights in respect thereto. No bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness having general voting rights (or
convertible into securities having such rights) ("Voting
Debt") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are issued
or outstanding. Section 3.02(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth (i) all Company Options which are
outstanding on the date hereof, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock for which such Company Options are
exercisable, which of such Company Options are currently
exercisable, the exercise price and the identity of the
optionees; (ii) the number of SARs which are outstanding on
January 8, 1994, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock for which such SARs are exercisable and the record
holders thereof; and (iii) the number of Warrants which are
outstanding on the date hereof, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock for which such Warrants are
exercisable, the exercise price and the record holders
thereof. Except as set forth above, except for the
exercise or exchange of the Options, Warrants and SARs<PAGE>
listed in Section 3.02(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, except for up to 111,408 SARs which may be
granted by the Company prior to the Effective Time, except
for shares of Company Common Stock to be allocated to
participants in the ESOP in the ordinary course of business
pursuant to the terms thereof in effect on the date hereof,

Committee (as defined in the ESOP) (the "ESOP Agreement")
and except as set forth in Section 3.02(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, there are no,
and at the Effective Time there will be no, shares of
capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
issued or outstanding or existing options, warrants, calls,
subscriptions or other rights or other agreements or
commitments of any character of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) relating to the issued or unissued capital
stock or Voting Debt of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell, or cause to be
issued, transferred or sold, or to grant rights of first
refusal or similar rights with respect to, any shares of
capital stock or Voting Debt of, or other equity interests
in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interests or (iii) with respect to the sale, transfer or
other disposition of, or grant of rights of first refusal
or similar rights in respect of, assets of the Company
other than in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice. In addition, there are no, and at the
Effective Time there will be no, rights or other agreements
or commitments obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to grant, extend or enter into any option,
warrant, call, subscription or other right, agreement or
commitment described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above. 
Except as set forth in Section 3.02(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and except pursuant to the ESOP
Agreement, there are no, and at the Effective Time there
will be no, outstanding contractual obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except pursuant to
this Agreement and the ESOP Agreement, and except as set
forth in Section 3.02(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are not now, and at the Effective Time
there will not be, any voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or is bound with respect to the
voting of the capital stock (or other ownership interests)
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other<PAGE>
entities listed in Section 3.02(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. 

(b) The Company does not own any capital stock
or other equity securities of any corporation and has no
direct or indirect equity or ownership interest, by way of

Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets before any Governmental Entity which, if decided
adversely, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or would prevent or delay
in any material respect the consummation of the

The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all permits,
licenses, variances, exemptions, authorizations, orders and
approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the "Company
Permits") and the Company and its Subsidiaries are in

Company will, as promptly as practicable, make available to
Parent at the request of Parent correct and complete copies<PAGE>
of all Company Permits. The businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of
any law, ordinance or regulation of any Governmental

Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this
Agreement, no investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the

their employment with the Company or its ERISA Affiliates,
whether or not any of the foregoing is funded, whether
insured or self-funded, and whether written or oral, (i) to
which the Company or its ERISA Affiliates is a party or a
sponsor or a fiduciary thereof or by which the Company or
its ERISA Affiliates (or any of their rights, properties or
assets) is bound or (ii) with respect to which the Company
or its ERISA Affiliates has any obligation to make payments
or contributions or may otherwise have any liability (the
"Employee Benefit Plans"). Any failure to satisfy the
foregoing requirements of this Section 3.14(a) shall not be
considered a breach of the representations contained herein
except to the extent that the existence of any Employee
Benefit Plans which are not listed in Section 3.14(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule would, individually or in
the aggregate, result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA
Affiliates" shall mean any trade or business (whether or
not incorporated) that is part of the same controlled
group, or under common control with, or part of an
affiliated service group that includes, the Company within
the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

(c) As used in this Agreement, "Pension Plan"
means any Employee Benefit Plan which is an employee
pension benefit plan as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA
and "Welfare Plan" means any Employee Benefit Plan which is
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA.

(d) The following representations are true
with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, except to the
extent that, if untrue, any such representations, whether
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(i) No Employee Benefit Plan is (A) a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA, (B) a multiple employer plan subject to the
requirements of Section 413(c) of the Code, (C) a
"defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA or (D) a plan which is subject to Section 412
of the Code, nor has the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates ever had an obligation with respect to any
such Plan, and neither the Company nor any of its<PAGE>
ERISA Affiliates has incurred or reasonably expects
to incur any direct or indirect liability under or by
operation of Title IV of ERISA.

(ii) There are no Employee Benefit Plans
which promise or provide health or life benefits to
retirees or former employees of the Company or its
ERISA Affiliates other than as required by Section
4980B of the Code or Section 601 of ERISA or those
identified in Section 3.14(d)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(iii) Except as otherwise disclosed in
Section 3.14(d)(iii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, each Employee Benefit Plan has been
operated and administered in compliance with the
applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and any
other applicable law (including regulations and
rulings thereunder), and its terms.

(iv) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is
intended to be tax qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service stating that
the Plan meets all the requirements of the Code as of
the date stated in the application for such letter
and that any trust or trusts associated with the plan
are tax exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. To
the knowledge of the Company, there is no reason why
the qualified status under Section 401(a) of the Code
of any such tax qualified Employee Benefit Plan would
be denied or revoked, whether retroactively or
prospectively, by any governmental agency including
the Internal Revenue Service or the United States
Department of Labor. All amendments to the Employee
Benefit Plans which were required to be made through
the date hereof and the Effective Time to maintain
the continued qualified status of such Employee
Benefit Plans under Section 401(a) of the Code
subsequent to the issuance of each Plan's
determination letter have been made, including all
amendments required to be made by each respective
date by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and any other tax
acts or legislation affecting such Employee Benefit
Plans, except for such amendments for which the
remedial amendment period of Section 401(b) of the
Code has not expired. Except as set forth in Section
3.14(d)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there
is no amendment which needs to be made, and no
provision or amendment to the Employee Benefit <PAGE>
Plan(s) which adversely affects the continued
qualified status of such Plan(s) under Section 401(a)
of the Code.

(v) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(d)(v)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge
of the Company, no actual or threatened disputes,
lawsuits, claims (other than routine claims for
benefits), investigations, audits or complaints to,
or by, any person or governmental entity have been
filed with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans or
the Company or its ERISA Affiliates in connection
with any Employee Benefit Plan or the fiduciaries
responsible for such Employee Benefit Plans, and to
the knowledge of the Company, no state of facts or
conditions exist which could subject the Company or
its ERISA Affiliates to any liability (other than
routine claims for benefits) under the terms of the
Plan or applicable law.

(vi) All contributions made or deemed to have
been made to each Pension Plan are presently, and
have been during the years to which they relate,
fully deductible pursuant to Section 404 of the Code
and are not presently, and have never been during the
years to which they relate, subject to any excise tax
under Section 4972 of the Code.

(vii) All group health Employee Benefit Plans
have been operated in compliance with the group
health plan continuation coverage requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code to the extent such
requirements are applicable.

(viii) Except as otherwise disclosed in
Section 3.14(d)(viii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the following clauses are true with respect
to each Employee Benefit Plan:

(A) The Company and each of its ERISA
Affiliates is in compliance with the reporting and
disclosure requirements of ERISA and the Code and the
regulations thereunder with respect to each such
Employee Benefit Plan, and neither the Company nor
any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
liability in connection with such requirements.

(B) Neither the Company nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates has made, or committed to make,
whether written, oral or through other
representation, any payment, contribution or award to<PAGE>
or under any Employee Benefit Plan (other than as
required by its terms, the Code or ERISA and other
than pursuant to the ESOP Agreement).

(C) Except as set forth in Section
3.14(d)(viii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
following statements are true: there are no
delinquent contributions or payments to or in respect
of any Employee Benefit Plan; there are no unfunded
liabilities as of the Effective Time associated with
any Employee Benefit Plan that is a Pension Plan
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code; as of the
Effective Time, all payments of outstanding
contributions, due on or prior to that date, shall
have been made with respect to each and every
Employee Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code or any trust that is
intended to be tax-exempt under Section 501 of the
Code and that is maintained in connection with an
Employee Benefit Plan; and all contributions to and
payments with respect to or under the Employee
Benefit Plans that are required to be made with
respect to periods ending on or before the Effective
Time (including periods from the first day of the
then current plan or policy year to the Effective
Time) have been made or accrued before the Effective
Time by the Company in accordance with the
appropriate plan documents, financial statement,
collective bargaining agreements or insurance
contracts or arrangements.

(D) With respect to each such Employee
Benefit Plan, the Company shall deliver to Parent as
soon as possible upon the request of Parent true and
complete copies of the following documents to the
extent in each case that such documents exist or are
required by law:

(1) current plan documents,
subsequent plan amendments, or any and all
other documents that establish or describe the
existence of the plan, trust, arrangement,
contract, policy or commitment;

descriptions and summaries of material
modifications;

<PAGE>
(3) the most recent tax qualified
determination letters, if any, received from

Plan: nondiscrimination testing results and
the most recent annual and quarterly or
monthly valuations; and

(8) a schedule of any penalties
and/or fines levied, imposed or assessed
during the preceding 5 calendar years by the
Internal Revenue Service and/or the United
States Department of Labor on the Company or
its ERISA Affiliates or in connection with any
Employee Benefit Plan; such schedule shall
indicate (1) the amount of such penalty and/or
fine and (2) the amount of such penalty or
fine, if any, outstanding as of the Effective
Time.

(ix) Each trust fund associated with a
Welfare Plan that is established under Section
501(c)(9) of the Code and is intended to be tax-
exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code (a "VEBA")
has received a favorable determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service stating that the trust
fund is so exempt. To the knowledge of the Company,
there is no reason why the tax-exempt status under
Section 501(a) of the Code of any such VEBA would be
denied or revoked, whether retroactively or
prospectively, by any governmental agency, including
without limitation the Internal Revenue Service and<PAGE>
the United States Department of Labor. Each VEBA has
Satisfied all applicable requirements of Section 419,
419A and 505 of the Code, and neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has become subject to any excise tax

compensation or benefits to any current or former
employees of the Company or its ERISA Affiliates, in
either such case that has been terminated or
otherwise discontinued.

(xi) Except as otherwise disclosed in Section
3.14(d)(xi) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
benefits to be provided to participants under each
Welfare Plan are to be provided exclusively from the
general assets of the Company or through insurance
contracts, or a combination thereof.

(xii) Except as otherwise disclosed in
Section 3.14(d)(xii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the benefits to be provided to participants
under each Pension Plan, other than a tax qualified
Pension Plan under Code Section 401(a), are to be
provided exclusively from the general assets of the
Company.

(xiii) Except as set forth in Section
3.14(d)(xiii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, there has
not occurred, and no person or entity is
contractually bound to enter into, any nonexempt

pursuant to subsection (l) hereof (including, without
limitation, any election under Code Section 338), whether
or not currently in effect, are set forth in Section
3.20(s) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(t) Except as set forth in Section 3.20(t) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has been an "includible

holders under Code Section 133, except to the extent the <PAGE>
failure of any such amounts of interest income to be
excludable under Code Section 133 would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

shall notify Parent in writing of any power of attorney
granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
concerning any Tax matter that will be in force as of the
Effective Time.

representation and warranty under such subsections.

Section 3.21 Properties. (a) Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has good fee or leasehold
title to all of its real property, other than property the
failure of which to so own would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (the
"Material Real Properties"). Except as set forth in the
title insurance policies listed in Section 3.21(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or as otherwise set forth in
Section 3.21(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
Material Real Property is subject to claims, liens, or
encumbrances whether by mortgage, pledge, lien, conditional
sales agreement, charge or otherwise, except for those
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.21(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct
list of the Material Real Properties. Each of the Company

(b) The Company has previously made available
to Parent complete and correct copies of each lease to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
any of its properties are bound, except for such leases the
loss of which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. A complete and
correct list of each such lease is set forth in Section
3.21(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. All of the
leases so listed are valid and subsisting and in full force
and effect with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
and, to the Company's knowledge, with respect to any other
party thereto.

Section 3.22 Contracts. Section 3.22 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate list of
any of the following to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or their
properties or assets may be bound: (i) any contract,
commitment or agreement involving a partnership, joint
venture or similar arrangement, (ii) any contract,
commitment or agreement in which rights or obligations
change upon a change in control of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and which has not been filed as an exhibit
to any Company SEC Document, and (iii) any secrecy, non-
compete or other agreement which (A) restricts the right of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers or employees to engage in any type of business or
activity (other than any such agreement of which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a beneficiary) or (B)
would restrict in any manner the right of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to engage in any type of business or
activity after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Material
Contracts"). The Company has previously delivered to
Parent complete and correct copies of all Material
Contracts. All Material Contracts are in full force and
effect and, to the knowledge of the Company, no default or
breach exists by any other party to a Material Contract and
no such other party intends to terminate or modify a
Material Contract.

Section 3.23 Insurance; Malpractice. (a) 
The Company has previously delivered to Parent correct and
complete copies of all material documents relating to self
insurance and third party administration. The Company has
previously delivered to Parent correct and complete copies <PAGE>
of the audited annual financial statements for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 1992 and the unaudited quarterly
financial statements since September 30, 1992 and through
the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 1993 (together with all
related notes, exhibits and schedules thereto, the "NISC
Statements") of Nenelani Insurance Services Corporation
("NISC") filed with the Department of Insurance of the
State of Hawaii (the "Hawaii Department"). Such statements
(i) were prepared from the books of account and other
financial records of NISC, (ii) were prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
basis consistent with the past practices of NISC (except as
set forth in the notes, exhibits or schedules thereto)
pursuant to the requirements of the insurance regulatory
authority in the State of Hawaii, and complied on their
respective dates of filing or submission in all material
respects with applicable law, (iv) present fairly the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
NISC as of the dates thereof or for the periods covered
thereby (subject, in the case of quarterly statements, to
normal recurring audit adjustments). To the knowledge of
the Company, all reserves and other liabilities reflected
in the NISC Statements ("Reserve Liabilities") (i) were
determined in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial
standards consistently applied, (ii) were fairly stated in
accordance with sound actuarial principles, (iii) met the
requirements of the insurance laws of the State of Hawaii
and any other applicable law in all material respects and
(iv) reflected (on a net basis) in all material respects
any related reinsurance, coinsurance and other similar
agreements of NISC. To the Company's knowledge, the
Company's actuary was provided with all claims data and
other information required to perform its actuarial
analysis and produce the actuarial studies delivered to
Parent, and all information so provided was complete and
correct in all material respects. Adequate provision for
all such Reserve Liabilities has been made (under commonly
accepted actuarial principles consistently applied) to
cover the total amount of all reasonably anticipated
matured and unmatured benefits, claims and other
liabilities of NISC on the respective dates of the NISC
Statements based on commonly accepted actuarial assumptions
as to future contingencies which are reasonable and
appropriate under the circumstances, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list of all
material insurance policies currently in force insuring <PAGE>
against risks of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the
Company has previously delivered to Parent copies of its
directors and officers insurance policies for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 1993 and the binder for such
policies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1994, the
NISC policy and, with respect to the other policies listed
in Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, has
previously delivered to Parent true and correct schedules
listing the name of carrier, policy coverage, policy limits
and deductibles. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with the terms of such policies and there are no
claims by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
such policy as to which any insurance company is denying
liability or defending under a reservation of rights
clause, in each case except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 3.24 Patents, Licenses, Franchises
and Formulas. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
owns all of the patents, trademarks, service marks,
copyrights, permits, trade names, licenses, franchises and
formulas, or rights with respect to the foregoing, and has
obtained assignments of all such rights and other rights of
whatever nature, necessary for the present conduct of its
business, without any known conflict with any rights of
others, in each case except as would not constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 6.05 Legal Requirements; Cooperation. 
Each of the Company, Parent and Sub will take, or cause to
be taken, all reasonable actions necessary to comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed
on it with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to
the other in connection with any such requirements imposed
upon any of them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the
Company, Parent and Sub will promptly make its respective
filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company,
Parent and Sub will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,
take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will
cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity or other public or private third
party, required to be obtained or made by Parent, Sub or
the Company or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with
<PAGE>
the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
agrees to cooperate with Parent and to take all actions
necessary to consummate the Tender Offers/Consent
Solicitations (as hereinafter defined) in an expeditious
manner, including without limitation the making of any
filings, registrations or notices with or to any third
party or any Governmental Entity. Parent will promptly
furnish to the Company any information required in
connection with the Tender Offers/Consent Solicitations and
the Company will promptly furnish to Parent in writing such
information in connection with the Tender Offers/Consent
Solicitations as Parent shall request. The Company
covenants that any information so furnished in writing will
not, at the date any such information is provided to
securityholders, at the date any registration statement
containing such information is declared effective by the
SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Parent shall receive "agreed upon procedures"
letters from the Company's independent certified public
accountants, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory

necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the
appropriate vote of stockholders of the Company described
in Section 7.01(a). In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to and possession of

franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations, the

Agreement are fully authorized to, and shall, take all such
necessary action; and such officers and directors shall be
deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an
irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all
such proper deeds, assignments and assurances in law and to

do all acts necessary or proper to vest such title to and
possession of such properties, assets, rights, approvals
and franchises and otherwise to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement.

Section 6.07 Expenses. Except as provided in
Section 8.02, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
paid by the party incurring such expense; provided,
however, that all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
the Company and its officers and directors in connection
with the Tender Offers/Consent Solicitations (including,
without limitation, legal fees, accounting fees, filing
fees and printing expenses but excluding the fees and
expenses of any investment banker retained by the Company
or any of its officers or directors) shall be paid (i) if
the Tender Offers/Consent Solicitations are consummated, by
the issuers of the applicable Debt Securities (as
hereinafter defined) or (ii) otherwise, by Parent; and

announcement or statement with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue
any such public announcement or statement prior to such
consultation, except that any party may issue such a public
announcement or statement prior to such consultation if and
to the extent required by law or any listing agreement with
a national securities exchange or any other similar
regulatory bodies, in which case such party shall use its
best efforts to consult with the other parties prior to
issuing such public announcement or statement.

Section 6.10 Indemnification and Insurance. 
(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law the
present and former directors and officers of the Company
against all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising from their service in such capacities
prior to and including the Effective Time. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
(i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by Parent
(which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
indemnified party) in advance of the final disposition of
any such action to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, upon receipt from the indemnified party of
any undertaking contemplated by applicable law and (ii)
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; provided, however, that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for
any settlement effected without its written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to keep in effect provisions in its Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws providing for exculpation of
director and officer liability and indemnification of the
present and former directors and officers of the Company to
the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, which provisions
shall not be amended for a period of six years after the
Effective Time except as required by applicable law or
except to make changes permitted by law that would enlarge
the rights to indemnification thereunder. Should any claim
or claims be made against any present or former director or
officer of the Company, arising from his services as such,
on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 6.10 respecting the
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws shall continue in
effect until the final disposition of all such claims.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall cause to
be maintained in effect for a period ending not sooner than
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, at no expense
to the beneficiaries thereof, directors' and officers'
liability insurance providing at least the same coverage
with respect to the Company's officers and directors as the
current policies maintained by or on behalf of the Company,
and containing terms and conditions which are substantially<PAGE>
no less advantageous, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time (to the extent such insurance
is currently available with respect to such matters). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation
shall not be obligated to provide any greater directors'
and officers' liability insurance coverage than generally
afforded to directors and officers of Parent under policies
maintained by Parent with respect to its directors and
officers. 

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
Surviving Corporation will continue to honor, and at the
Effective Time Parent will honor, the Indemnification
Agreements with certain executive officers of the Company
identified on Section 6.10(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, true and correct copies of which Indemnification
Agreements have been delivered to Parent.

(e) In connection with the Tender
Offers/Consent Solicitations and whether or not the Tender
Offers/Consent Solicitations are consummated, Parent shall
indemnify the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, agents, affiliates and
persons deemed to be in control of the Company within the
meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act (the "Company Indemnified
Parties") from and against all losses, damages,
liabilities, claims, costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees), judgments, fines, penalties
and amounts paid in settlement to which such Company
Indemnified Parties may become subject insofar as such
losses, damages, liabilities, claims, costs, expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts arise out of or are
related to the Tender Offers/Consent Solicitations;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be liable in any
such case to the extent that any such losses, damages,
liabilities, claims, costs, expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties or amounts arise out of or relate to (i) an
untrue statement in or omission from any information
requested by Parent and provided in writing by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any representative or agent
thereof or (ii) the gross negligence or wilful misconduct
of any Company Indemnified Party. Parent further agrees
that if any indemnification or reimbursement sought
pursuant to this paragraph (e) were for any reason not to
be available to any Company Indemnified Party or
insufficient to hold it harmless, in each case as and to
the extent contemplated by this paragraph (e), then Parent
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Company Indemnified Party in respect of losses, damages,
liabilities, claims, costs, expenses, judgments, fines,<PAGE>
penalties or amounts in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative benefits to the Company Indemnified
Party on the one hand and Parent on the other hand in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The rights under this paragraph (e) shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights available under
the other paragraphs of this Section 6.10.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each indemnified party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

(g) In the event that there shall occur any
transaction involving a change in control of Parent
pursuant to which the party acquiring control shall agree
to indemnify the officers and directors of Parent in
connection with any claim arising out of the service of
such persons as officers and directors of Parent, then
proper provision shall be made so that the acquiring party
shall assume the obligations of Parent under this Section
6.10; provided, however, that the obligations of the
acquiring party pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall be no
greater than the obligations of such acquiring party to the
officers and directors of Parent.

Section 6.11 Notification of Certain Matters. 
The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence,
or non-occurrence, of which would be likely to cause (x)
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate or (y) any covenant, condition
or agreement contained in this Agreement not to be complied
with or satisfied and (ii) any failure of the Company or
Parent, as the case maybe, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder; provided that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

Section 6.12 Accounting Matters. The Company
agrees that it shall, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, make such adjustments to its books and records as are
requested by Parent; provided that no such adjustments
shall be deemed to cause the breach of a condition to this
Agreement or otherwise constitute a violation of any
provision of this Agreement.
<PAGE>
Section 6.13 Employee Matters. (a) Parent
agrees that, for one year following the Effective Time, it
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor that portion
of the severance policy of the Company described in Section
6.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to
the employees of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Parent agrees that, following the
Effective Time, it shall cause the Surviving Corporation to

Section 3.08 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
described in a letter agreement between Parent and the
Company dated the date hereof.

(c) Parent agrees to provide to the employees
of the Surviving Corporation health benefits comparable to

Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1993,

and in good standing or to have such power and
authority would not individually or in the aggregate
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and in good standing in the
states indicated on a schedule to such opinion. Such
states, to the knowledge of such firm, are the only
states within the United States in which the Company

qualified or licensed would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect;

(ii) the Company has the corporate power to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; and the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action taken on
the part of the Company; 
<PAGE>
(iii) this Agreement has been executed and
delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except (A) as
enforceability may be limited by any bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer

considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and
(C) as enforceability of the obligations contained in
Section 6.10 may be limited by applicable law or
public policy; 

(iv) to the knowledge of such counsel, none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in default
or violation (and no event has occurred which with
notice or the lapse of time or both would constitute a
default or violation) of any term, condition or
provision of (i) its Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws (or similar governing documents) or (ii) any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license,
contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is now
a party or by which any of them or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound and which
is identified in the list of exhibits to the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

express no opinion with respect to any numeric or
financial standards contained in any such note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease license, contract,

Merger as required by the DGCL, no filing with or
notice to, and no permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any court or tribunal or Governmental
Entity of the United States, the State of Texas or the
State of Delaware is necessary for the execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement or the
consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except where the failure to
obtain such permits, authorizations, consents or
approvals or to make such filings or give such notice
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (A) conflict
with or result in any breach of any provision of the
respective Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws (or
similar governing documents) of the Company or of any
its Subsidiaries, (B) result in a violation or breach
of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse
oftime or both) a default (or give rise to any right
of termination, amendment, cancellation or
acceleration) under, or result in the loss of a
benefit under, or result in the creation of a lien or
other encumbrance on any property or asset of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture (other than any indenture as
modified by the Consents), lease, license, contract,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
by which any of them or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound and which is
identified in the list of exhibits to the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1993 or (C) except with respect to the
Tender Offers/Consent Solicitations, violate any
order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or
regulation known to such firm applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets, except in the case of
(B) or (C) for violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations, losses of <PAGE>
benefits, liens or encumbrances which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; and

(vii) such opinions as to the ESOP as are
mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company.

As to any matter in such opinion which involves
matters of fact or matters relating to laws other than
federal securities, Texas or Delaware law, such counsel may
rely upon the certificates of officers and directors of the
Company and of public officials and opinions of local
counsel, reasonably acceptable to Parent, provided a copy
of such reliance opinion shall be attached as an exhibit to
the opinion of such counsel. Such opinion shall be subject
to the normal exceptions and qualifications taken by such
firm; provided that such exceptions and qualifications
shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent.

(g) Parent shall have received the opinion of
Stanley F. Baldwin, Esq., General Counsel of the Company,
dated the date of the Effective Time, in form satisfactory
to Parent, substantially to the effect that:

(i) To the knowledge of such counsel, none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in
default or violation (and no event has occurred which
with notice or the lapse of time or both would
constitute a default or violation) of any term,
condition or provision of any order, writ, injunction,
decree, law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets, except for violations
or defaults that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(ii) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement
and except as set forth in Section 3.09 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of such counsel, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets before any
Governmental Entity which, if decided adversely,
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or would prevent or
delay in any material respect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except
as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed prior <PAGE>

to the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding
order, writ, injunction or decree which, individually
or in the aggregate, would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or would prevent or delay in any
material respect the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and 

(iii) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the Hospitals
and Specialty Facilities are certified for
participation or enrollment in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, have a current and valid provider
contract with the Medicare and Medicaid programs, are
in substantial compliance with the terms and
conditions of participation in such programs and have
received all approvals or qualifications necessary for
capital reimbursement of the Company assets. All of
the Hospitals and Specialty Facilities are accredited

Facility and is authorized to operate the number of
beds utilized therein.

matters of fact or matters relating to laws other than

rely upon the certificates of officers and directors of the
Company and of public officials and opinions of local
counsel, reasonably acceptable to Parent, provided a copy
of such reliance opinion shall be attached as an exhibit to
the opinion of such counsel. Such opinion shall be subject
to the normal exceptions and qualifications taken by such
counsel; provided that such exceptions and qualifications
shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent. Parent and the
Company agree that no personal liability to Parent, the
Company or any other person shall attach to the rendering
of such opinion.

(h) No more than ten percent (10%) of the
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing Date shall constitute Dissenting Stock.

(i) The officers and directors of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries shall have tendered their <PAGE>
written resignations of all such positions held with the
Company and its Subsidiaries except, with respect to
Subsidiaries of the Company that are joint ventures, to the
extent that the Company and its Subsidiaries are prohibited
from causing such resignations by the terms of agreements
governing such joint ventures as in effect on the date
hereof. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a correct and complete list of any such
positions with respect to which resignations cannot be
obtained.

(j) (A) There shall have been no change in the
ownership of the facilities and businesses of the Company
listed on Exhibit 7.02(j) hereof since the date of this
Agreement (other than transfers of ownership interests
among the Company and its wholly owned Subsidiaries and
transfers of ownership interests in the Company's
Subsidiaries that are joint ventures which transfers are
required under the terms of agreements governing such joint
ventures as in effect on the date hereof) and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into
any agreement, commitment or other arrangement that could
result in any such change of ownership; and (B) immediately
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Parent (directly or indirectly through
its Subsidiaries) shall have the ability to conduct the
material businesses and operations of such facilities and
businesses substantially in the manner in which they are
conducted on the date of this Agreement (other than any
inability to conduct such businesses and operations arising
solely from obligations of Parent prior to the Closing
Date).

(k) Parent shall have received, in the forms
attached as exhibits to, and in conformity with, the Master
Severance Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, between
Parent and the Company, the written agreement and release

HEALTHTRUST AGREES TO ACQUIRE EPIC HOLDINGS 
FOR APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION

NASHVILLE, TN, and DALLAS, TX, January 10, 1994 --
Healthtrust, Inc. -The Hospital Company (NYSE:HTI) and EPIC
Holdings, Inc. jointly announced today the signing of an
agreement under which HealthTrust will acquire EPIC in a
transaction valued at approximately $1 billion.

EPIC owns and operates 34 hospitals with 4,444 beds in
10 states. HealthTrust currently has 81 hospital
affiliates in 21 states with a total of 11,011 beds. 
Following the acquisition, HealthTrust will operate 115
acute care hospitals in 22 states and will have
approximately 37,000 employees. For the most recent fiscal
years of HealthTrust and EPIC, the two companies had
combined revenues of approximately $3.4 billion.

Under the terms of the definitive agreement
unanimously approved by the boards of both companies,
shareholders of EPIC will receive $7.00 per share of EPIC
common stock, or approximately $277 million in the
aggregate. Following the acquisition, EPIC will operate as
a subsidiary of HealthTrust. HealthTrust will assume or 
refinance approximately $727 million of EPIC indebtedness. 
In connection with the acquisition, HealthTrust intends to 
offer to purchase the following outstanding EPIC indebtedness; 
EPIC Holdings' 12% Senior Deferred Coupon Notes due 2002; 
EPIC Healthcare Group, Inc.'s 10 % Senior Subordinated Notes 
due 2003; and EPIC Properties, Inc.'s 11 % Class B-1 First Priority
Mortgage Notes due 2001; 11 1/2% Class B-2 First Priority
Mortgage Notes due 2001 and Floating Rate Class B-3 First
Priority Mortgage Notes due 1998. HealthTrust also plans
to seek the consent of the holders of this indebtedness to
amend certain restrictive provisions. In addition,
following the acquisition, HealthTrust expects to redeem<PAGE>
other outstanding EPIC bonds in accordance with their
terms. 

HealthTrust intends to finance approximately 15% of
the transaction through a public offering of its common
stock and approximately 20% through the public offering of
a new series of debt securities. Each of those offerings
will be made only by means of a prospectus. HealthTrust
had 81,167,288 shares of common stock outstanding as of
December 31, 1993. Approximately 60% of funding will be
obtained through the refinancing of HealthTrust's existing
bank credit facility and with available cash. 
Approximately 5% of the acquisition will be financed by
assuming EPIC indebtedness.

R. Clayton McWhorter, Chairman, President, and Chief
Executive Officer of HealthTrust, said, "The EPIC
acquisition is in keeping with HealthTrust's strategy and
will improve HealthTrust's position as a provider of cost
effective, high quality care in the changing health care
environment. This transaction will broaden our coverage of
the markets we currently serve, provide access to new
geographical markets and expand our operations in related
health care areas. We expect to achieve operating and
market synergies of approximately $50 million in fiscal
year 1995 as a result of this acquisition through cost
reduction and improved efficiency."

Kenn S. George, Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of EPIC, stated, "This transaction offers
EPIC hospitals greater access to capital and will thereby
expedite implementation of the Integrated Delivery Systems
strategy we've had in place since last year. In addition,
I think this transaction is a credit to the commitment and
hard work of our people, and clearly positions our
hospitals as winners in each of our markets."

Consummation of the acquisition is subject to a number
of conditions, including the approval of EPIC's
shareholders and the consummation of the debt consent
solicitations described above. American Medical
International, Inc. and the trustee of EPIC's employee
stock ownership plan have agreed, subject to the
fulfillment of certain conditions, to vote their shares of
EPIC common stock in favor of the acquisition. AMI and the
EPIC ESOP trustee each currently hold approximately 26%
(excluding shares over which ESOP participants exercise
voting power) of the EPIC common stock presently
outstanding. The transaction is expected to close in April
or May of 1994.
<PAGE>
Based in Dallas, Texas, EPIC owns and operates 34
acute-care community hospitals throughout 10 states. In
addition to its hospital operations, EPIC owns subsidiaries
which provide contract management services in the areas of
gero-psych, hospital management, rehab and home health. 
With FY93 net revenue of $1.02 billion, EPIC is the second
largest employee-owned company in the nation.

HealthTrust is one of the largest health care
providers in the United States with revenues of $2.4
billion. Operating in 84 markets in 21 southern and
western states, the Company delivers a variety of inpatient
and outpatient health care services through its 81
affiliated hospitals and 3 hospital joint ventures in
Orlando, Florida; Encino, California and Charlotte, North
Carolina.
