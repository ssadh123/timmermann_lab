ITEM 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

Synetic Acquisition

On December 14, 1994, Pharmacy Corporation of America, a California
corporation ("PCA"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Beverly
Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), consummated a
transaction with Synetic, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Synetic"), whereby PCA
acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the "Synetic
Shares") of three Synetic subsidiaries as follows: Dunnington Drug, Inc, a
Delaware corporation; Healthcare Prescription Services, Inc., an Indiana
corporation; and Alliance Health Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(collectively, the "Synetic Subsidiaries"). The Synetic Subsidiaries provide
pharmaceutical dispensing services in New England and Indiana to approximately
45,000 patients in various institutions, including nursing homes, transitional
care facilities, correctional facilities and group homes.

Cash consideration totalling $107,314,000 was paid in exchange for the
Synetic Shares, with such consideration being subject to adjustment pending
certain financial tests based on an audited combined balance sheet of the
Synetic Subsidiaries as of December 14, 1994. Further, $5,000,000 of the
purchase price was placed in escrow pending certain indemnification related
post-closing adjustments, if any.

Insta-Care Acquisition

On November 15, 1994, PCA consummated a transaction, whereby it
acquired all of the authorized, issued and outstanding shares of common stock
(the "Insta-Care Shares") of Insta-Care Holdings, Inc., a Florida corporation
("Insta-Care"), which was a subsidiary of Eckerd Corporation, a Delaware
corporation. Insta-Care provides pharmaceutical dispensing services to
approximately 65,000 patients in various institutions, including nursing homes,
transitional care facilities, correctional facilities and group homes.

Cash consideration totaling $112,000,000 was paid in exchange for the
Insta-Care Shares, with such consideration being subject to adjustment pending
certain financial tests based on an audited consolidated balance sheet of
Insta-Care as of November 14, 1994. Of the $112,000,000 total consideration, up
to $3,000,000 will be rebated to the Company in order to account for certain
transition expenses to be incurred by the Company in connection with the
acquisition. Further, $2,000,000 of the purchase price was placed in escrow
pending certain indemnification related post-closing adjustments, if any.

<PAGE> 3
Financing

On November 1, 1994, the Company executed a $375,000,000 Credit
Agreement (the "1994 Credit Agreement") with Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of
New York which provides for a $225,000,000 Term Loan (the "1994 Term Loan") and
a $150,000,000 Revolver/Letter of Credit Facility (the "1994 Revolver/LOC
Facility"). The proceeds from the 1994 Term Loan were used to consummate the
pharmacy acquisitions discussed above. The 1994 Revolver/LOC Facility has
replaced the Company's revolving credit facility and letter of credit facility
originally entered into in 1993. Currently, the 1994 Term Loan and any Revolver
borrowings will bear interest at adjusted LIBOR plus 1%, the Prime Rate, as
defined, or the adjusted CD rate, as defined, plus 1.125%, at the Company's
option. Such interest rates may be adjusted quarterly based on certain
financial ratio calculations. The 1994 Term Loan requires quarterly principal
and interest payments through October 1999.

General

Neither the acquisition of the Synetic Shares nor the acquisition of
the Insta-Care Shares is by and of itself a significant acquisition. However,
this Report on Form 8-K is being filed because the acquisitions collectively
result in an acquisition of businesses which is deemed to be a significant
acquisition by the Company.

ITEM 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits

a) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF BUSINESS ACQUIRED. In accordance with
the instructions to this form, when considered individually, the financial
statements of the respective businesses acquired are not required.

b) PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION. It is impractical to provide
the required pro forma financial information with this Report on Form 8-K. As
permitted by Item 7(b)(2), such pro forma financial information will be filed
under cover of an amendment to this Form 8-K as soon as practicable, but not
later than 60 days after this Report on Form 8-K must be filed.

c) EXHIBITS.

<PAGE> 14
SECTION 2.03. Closing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Shares contemplated hereby shall take
place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the
third Business Day following the later to occur of (i) the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and (ii) the

Lexington Avenue, New York. New York, or at such other time or on such other
date or at such other place as the Seller and the Purchaser may mutually agree

(b) At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to the Purchaser: (i) stock certificates (in definitive form)
evidencing the Shares duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers
duly executed in blank and otherwise in proper form for transfer; (ii) the
certificate required to be delivered pursuant to Section 8.02; and (iii) all
other previously undelivered documents, instruments and writings required to be
delivered to the Purchaser by the Seller at or prior to the Closing pursuant to
this Agreement.

(c) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to the
Seller: (i) the Purchase Price, less the Escrowed Amount (as defined in Section
2.08), by wire transfer in immediately available funds, to an account or
accounts designated at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date by the
Seller in a written notice to the Purchaser, (ii) the certificate required to
be delivered pursuant to Section 8.01; and (iii) all other previously
undelivered documents, instruments and writings required to be delivered to the
Seller by the Purchaser at or prior to the Closing pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to the

(e) Upon the Closing, the Seller will cause the existing
directors of the Companies and the Subsidiaries to resign from their respective
positions with such Companies and such Subsidiaries and the vacancies resulting
therefrom shall be filled by the Purchaser's designees immediately following
the Closing.

SECTION 2.04. Assumption of Certain Liabilities of the
Seller and Medco. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
the Purchaser shall, on the Closing Date, assume all obligations of the Seller
and Medco under the Acquisition Agreements and shall pay, perform and discharge
when due all Liabilities of the Seller and Medco under the Acquisition
Agreements, including the Earn-Outs. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Companies and the
Subsidiaries, (i) to fulfill their respective obligations with respect to the
calculation of any
<PAGE> 15
10

Earn-Out, (ii) to keep all books and records required to be kept pursuant to the
Acquisition Agreements in the manner required thereby, and (iii) to observe any
applicable covenants contained in the Acquisition Agreements. The Seller shall
indemnify and hold the Purchaser fully and promptly harmless in respect of any
amounts paid in accordance with the respective Acquisition Agreements in
satisfaction of such Earn-Outs, including but not limited to the Purchaser's
cost of defense (including the Purchaser's reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) in defending against any claims made by any party under the
Acquisition Agreements; provided, however, that the Seller shall have no
obligation to indemnify the Purchaser against any such amounts payable to the
extent resulting from (x) the Purchaser's breach of any provision of an
Acquisition Agreement or breach of the Purchaser's covenants contained in this
Section 2.04 and (y) any increase in the amount payable in respect of any
Earn-Out based on any fact or circumstance relating to the Purchaser and that
would not have been payable if the Purchaser had not acquired the Business. The
Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate with and assist each other in the
calculation of the amount of any such Earn-Out and the Seller shall be given
reasonable access to the relevant books and records of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries for such purpose. The Purchaser and the Seller shall jointly
determine the amount of any such Earn-Out in accordance with the provisions of
the relevant Acquisition Agreement, with approval of the amount so calculated
not to be unreasonably withheld by either party .

SECTION 2.05. Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchaser
and the Seller shall allocate the Purchase Price to the Shares of the
respective Companies and to the Seller's noncompetition covenants on IRS Form
8594, in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 1060 and the regulations
thereunder; provided, however, that the Purchaser and the Seller hereby agree
that as of the date of this Agreement the fair market value of the Seller's
noncompetition covenants is $500,000, and that the allocation on said Form 8594
shall reflect such fair market value and hereby agree to allocate the remainder
of the Purchase Price among the Shares of the respective Companies in
accordance with Exhibit 2.05 hereto. Any adjustment to the Purchase Price or
other consideration paid pursuant to this Agreement shall result in an
appropriate adjustment to such allocation.

SECTION 2.06. Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment, if
any, after the Closing Date as specified in this Section 2.06 and in Section
2.07.

(b) As soon as practicable (but in no event later than 60
calendar days following the Closing Date), the Seller shall prepare and deliver
to the Purchaser, at the Seller's expense, an audited combined balance sheet
for the Companies and the Subsidiaries (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), as of the
Closing Date. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by the report
thereon of the Seller's Accountants, to the effect that, in their unqualified
opinion, the Closing Balance Sheet fairly presents the combined financial
position of the Companies and the Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP applied
on a basis consistent with the preparation of the 1994 Audited Balance Sheet.
During the preparation of
<PAGE> 16

11

the Closing Balance Sheet by the Seller and the period of any dispute provided
for in Section 2.06(d), the Purchaser shall provide the Seller and the Seller's
Accountants reasonable access to the books, records, facilities and employees
of the Companies and the Subsidiaries, and the Purchaser shall cooperate fully
with the Seller's Accountants, in each case to the extent required by the
Seller and the Seller's Accountants in order to prepare the Closing Balance
Sheet and to investigate the basis for any such dispute. The Purchaser and its
representatives shall be given reasonable access to the books, records,
facilities and employees of the Seller, including copies of all supporting
documents and auditor's work papers used in the preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet including, but not limited to, combining balance sheets and other
combining work papers, as necessary for them to review the Closing Balance
Sheet.

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section
2.06(d), within 30 Business Days after the date of receipt by the Purchaser of
the Closing Balance Sheet:

(i) If the amount of the Closing Date Combined Net Worth
is less than an amount equal to the sum of (A) the Year-End Combined
Net Worth plus (B) the product of $100,000 multiplied by the number of
months, including fractional months expressed as a percentage, based
on a 30-day month, which shall have elapsed between the date of
execution of this Agreement and the Closing Date (the sum of (A) and
(B) calculated as provided above being hereinafter referred to as the
"Adjusting Amount"), by more than $500,000 (the "Designated Amount"),
the Seller shall immediately pay to the Purchaser, as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to
(x) the Adjusting Amount minus (y) the sum of the amount of the
Closing Date Combined Net Worth and the Designated Amount; and

(ii) If the amount of the Closing Date Combined Net Worth
is greater than the Adjusting Amount by more than the Designated
Amount, the Purchaser shall immediately pay to the Seller, as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, in immediately available funds, an
amount equal to (x) the amount of the Closing Date Combined Net Worth
minus (y) the sum of the Adjusting Amount and the Designated Amount.

(d) If not disputed by the Purchaser in accordance with
this Section 2.06(d), the Closing Balance Sheet delivered by the Seller to the
Purchaser shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. The
Purchaser may dispute any amounts reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet to the
extent that the net effect of such disputed amounts in the aggregate would be
to change the Closing Date Combined Net Worth by more than the Designated
Amount, but only on the basis that the amounts reflected on the Closing Balance
Sheet were not arrived at in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent
with the preparation of the 1994 Audited Balance Sheet; provided, however,
that the Purchaser shall notify the Seller and the Seller's Accountants in
writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and
setting forth, in detail, the basis for such dispute, within 30 Business Days
of the Purchaser's receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet. In
<PAGE> 17
12

the event of such a dispute, each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to reconcile their differences. If such dispute has not
been resolved within 10 Business Days after the notice referred to in the
preceding sentence has been given, Ernst & Young LLP (the "Purchaser's
Accountants") and the Seller's Accountants shall attempt to reconcile their
differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. If any such resolution by
the Purchaser's Accountants and the Seller's Accountants leaves in dispute
amounts the net effect of which in the aggregate would not be to change the
Closing Date Combined Net Worth by at least the Designated Amount, all the
amounts remaining in dispute shall then be deemed to have been resolved in
favor of the Closing Balance Sheet, and such resolution shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the parties hereto. If the Purchaser's Accountants and the
Seller's Accountants are unable to reach a resolution, leaving in dispute
amounts the net effect of which in the aggregate would change the Closing Date
Combined Net Worth by at least the Designated Amount, the Purchaser's
Accountants and the Seller's Accountants shall submit the items remaining in
dispute that the Purchaser shall be entitled to dispute by the terms of this
Section 2.06(d) for resolution to Deloitte & Touche or such other independent
accounting firm as may be mutually acceptable to the Seller and the Purchaser
(the "Independent Accounting Firm"), which shall, within 30 Business Days of
such submission, determine and report to the Seller and the Purchaser upon such
remaining disputed items, and such report shall have the legal effect of an
arbitration award and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Seller and
the Purchaser provided, however, that no such report shall impair any remedies
available to either party under Article IX of this Agreement. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the
Seller and the Purchaser in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of
such remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm
which is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted. No adjustment to any amount payable by the Seller
or the Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.06(c) shall be made with respect to
amounts disputed by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.06(d), unless the
net effect of the amounts successfully disputed by the Purchaser in the
aggregate is to change the Closing Date Combined Net Worth by at least the
Designated Amount, in which case such adjustment shall only be made in an
amount equal to any excess over the Designated Amount. Any amount that is
payable under Section 2.06(c), including, without limitation, any portion
thereof that is subject to dispute under this Section 2.06(d) shall be paid by
the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be, in immediately available
funds, within five Business Days following the resolution of such dispute and
in an amount in accordance with such resolution.

(e) In acting to resolve any dispute pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.06(d), the Purchaser's Accountants, the
Seller's Accountants and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be entitled to
the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

(f) Any payment required to be made by the Seller or the
Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.06(c) shall bear interest from the Closing Date
through the date of payment on the basis of the average of the daily rate of
interest publicly announced by
<PAGE> 18
13

Citibank, N.A. in New York, New York from time to time as its base rate from
the Closing Date to the date of such payment.

SECTION 2.07. Intercompany Amounts.

(a) If the Incremental Intercompany Amount is greater
than zero, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser, as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, an amount equal to the Incremental Intercompany Amount.

(b) If the Incremental Intercompany Amount is less than
zero, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, an amount equal to the amount by which zero exceeds the Incremental
Intercompany Amount.

(c) Any amount that is payable pursuant to the provisions
of this Section 2.07 shall be payable in immediately available funds within
five Business Days after delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet by the Seller to
the Purchaser.

SECTION 2.08. Escrow Account.

(a) Within 15 Business Days after the date hereof, the
Seller and the Purchaser will agree on a form of Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow
Agreement") with Bank of New York or any other commercial bank having total
assets in excess of $1,000,000,000 chosen by the Purchaser and reasonably
acceptable to the Seller (the "Escrow Agent"). The Escrow Agreement shall
contain (i) the terms set forth in this Section 2.08, mutatis mutandis, (ii)
usual and customary provisions for the reasonable protection of the Escrow
Agent, as may be requested by the Escrow Agent and (iii) such other terms as
the parties thereto may mutually agree. Prior to the Closing, the Seller and
the Purchaser shall enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Escrow Agent. At
the Closing, a portion of the Purchase Price equal to $5,000,000 (the "Escrowed
Amount") is to be withheld and deposited into an escrow account (the "Escrow")
with the Escrow Agent, to be held as security for and, as applicable,
distributed pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement to offset amounts
payable by the Seller pursuant to its obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
contained in Section 2.04, Article VII and Article IX of this Agreement (the
"Indemnified Losses").

(b) If, during the term of the Escrow, the Purchaser
contends that it is entitled to receive, all or a part of the Escrowed Amount
still held by the Escrow Agent in accordance herewith, the Purchaser shall (i)
give the Escrow Agent written notice that the Purchaser contends in good faith
that all or a specified portion of the Escrowed Amount is required to offset
the Indemnified Losses, (ii) request such amount to be delivered to the
Purchaser on a specified date (the "Delivery Date"), not sooner than twenty
(20) Business Days after the later of delivery of a copy of such notice to the
Seller and to the Escrow Agent, and (iii) specify in reasonable detail the
grounds on which the claimed Indemnified Losses are based. The Purchaser shall
also certify to the Escrow Agent that a copy of the notice has been delivered
to the Seller accompanied by signed U.S. Postal Service return
<PAGE> 19
14

receipts evidencing delivery of the notice by registered or certified mail to
the Seller or alternate proof of actual delivery acceptable to the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon such certification as
conclusive evidence that proper notice has been given to the Seller.

(c) If, prior to the Delivery Date, the Escrow Agent has
not received written objection from the Seller in the form and manner specified
in paragraph (d) below, to the payment to the Purchaser of the amount requested
by the Purchaser, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Purchaser on the
Delivery Date the requested amount up to the amount of the Escrowed Amount held
by the Escrow Agent.

(d) If, prior to the Delivery Date, the Escrow Agent
receives a written objection from the Seller to payment of the requested amount
to the Purchaser, accompanied by a certification to the Escrow Agent with a
copy delivered to the Purchaser in the same manner as specified for written
notice to be delivered by the Purchaser under paragraph (b) above, that the
Seller in good faith has reasonable grounds for disputing the amount or reasons
for such claim, (i) the Escrow Agent shall so advise the Purchaser and (ii) the
Escrow Agent shall continue to hold such amount in Escrow until receipt of
written instructions executed by each of the Purchaser and the Seller as to the
disposition of such amount. If, however, the Purchaser and the Seller are
unable to agree as to the disposition of such amount within twenty (20)
Business Days after the Delivery Date, the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to
interplead the requested amount (up to the Escrowed Amount held by the Escrow
Agent) into the registry of a court of competent jurisdiction in the Southern
District of New York, and stand fully discharged from further responsibilities
with respect to such amount.

(e) All amounts received by the Escrow Agent to be held
in the Escrow shall be held by the Escrow Agent in an interest bearing account
or similar type of account or certificate of deposit with a bank reasonably
satisfactory to the Escrow Agent, the Purchaser and the Seller (which may be
the Escrow Agent) until delivery of the entire amount is required under the
terms of this Section 2.08. The Escrow Agent shall receive any increase and
shall hold the same in the Escrow in accordance herewith.

(f) The term of the Escrow shall continue from the
Closing Date until the earlier of the date which is 120 days after the Closing
Date or until all Escrowed Amounts shall have been delivered by the Escrow
Agent under the Escrow Agreement. If and to the extent there are any funds
remaining as part of the Escrowed Amount on the date which is 120 days after
the Closing Date, such remaining portion shall be delivered forthwith to the
Seller, and the Escrow Agent shall have no further liabilities or
responsibilities under the Escrow Agreement to any Person.

(g) The Seller and the Purchaser hereby agree to (i)
share equally in the payment of the Escrow Agent's reasonable compensation for
the services to be rendered under the Escrow Agreement; (ii) share equally in
the payment or reimbursement of the
<PAGE> 20
15

Escrow Agent upon request for all expenses, disbursements and advances,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred or made by it in connection with
carrying out its duties under the Escrow Agreement; and (iii) jointly and
severally indemnify the Escrow Agent for, and to hold it harmless against any
loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent, arising out of or in connection
with its performance of the Escrow provided for under the Escrow Agreement and
carrying out its duties under the Escrow Agreement, including the costs and
expenses of defending itself against any claim of liability.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, the Seller
represents and warrants to the Purchaser as follows:

SECTION 3.01. Incorporation and Authority of the Seller.
The Seller is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to carry out its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller, the performance by
the Seller of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Seller of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action on the part of the Seller (other than the requisite approval
of the stockholders of the Seller under the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Seller, and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Purchaser) this Agreement constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Seller enforceable against the Seller in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law).

SECTION 3.02. Incorporation and Qualification of the
Companies and Subsidiaries. Each Company and each Subsidiary is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite power and authority to own,
operate or lease the properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it
and to carry on its business in all material respects as currently conducted by
such Company or Subsidiary, except for such failures which, when taken together
with all such failures, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.02
of the Disclosure Schedule lists each jurisdiction where each Company and each
Subsidiary is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation. Each Company
and each Subsidiary is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction listed in Section 3.02 of the
Disclosure Schedule, which are the only jurisdictions where the
<PAGE> 21
16

character of its properties owned, operated or leased or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except for such failures which,
when taken together with all other such failures, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect, True and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws (or equivalent organization documents) of each Company and each
Subsidiary, each of the foregoing as amended to the date of this Agreement,
have been made available for review by the Purchaser. Complete and accurate
copies of the minute books of the Companies and the Subsidiaries have been
provided by the Seller to the Purchaser. To the knowledge of the Seller, the
minutes contained therein accurately reflect all material corporate actions
voted upon by the stockholders and the board of directors of the respective
Companies and Subsidiaries during the period in which the Seller was the direct
or indirect owner of the outstanding common stock of the respective Companies
and Subsidiaries.

SECTION 3.03. Capital Stock of the Companies. The Shares
constitute all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Companies. The Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive
rights. There are no options, warrants or rights of conversion or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments relating to the capital stock of any
Company obligating any Company to issue or sell any of its shares of capital
stock. The Seller owns the Shares free and clear of all Encumbrances, except
for: (i) the Earn-Outs; (ii) any Encumbrances set forth in Section 3.03 of the
Disclosure Schedule and (iii) any Encumbrances arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement. There are no voting trusts, stockholder
agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect with respect to the voting or
transfer of the Shares.

SECTION 3.04. Subsidiaries.

(a) Other than the Subsidiaries, there are no other
corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, associations or other entities in
which any Company or Subsidiary owns, of record or beneficially, any direct or
indirect equity or other interest or any right (contingent or otherwise) to
acquire the same. No Company or Subsidiary is a member of (nor is any part of
the Business conducted through) any partnership, nor is any Company or
Subsidiary a participant in any joint venture or similar arrangement (other
than the Earn-Outs).

(b) Section 3.04(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
the jurisdiction of incorporation of each Subsidiary, its authorized capital
stock, the number and type of its issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock, and the current ownership by the Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries of such shares (collectively, the "Subsidiary Shares"). The
Subsidiary Shares constitute all the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the respective Subsidiaries. The Subsidiary Shares have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and were not
issued in violation of any preemptive rights. There are no options, warrants
or rights of conversion or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments relating to the capital stock of any Subsidiary obligating any
<PAGE> 22
17

Subsidiary to issue or sell any of its shares of capital stock. Either a
Company or another Subsidiary owns the Subsidiary Shares issued by the
respective Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except (i) as set
forth in Section 3.04 of the Disclosure Schedule; (ii) the Earn-Outs; and (iii)
Encumbrances arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. There are no
voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect
with respect to the voting or transfer of the Subsidiary Shares.

SECTION 3.05. No Conflict. Assuming all consents,
approvals, authorizations and other actions described in Section 3.11 have
been obtained and all filings and notifications listed in Section 3.11 of the
Disclosure Schedule have been made, and except as may result from any facts or
circumstances relating solely to the Purchaser, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Seller do not and will not (a) violate or
conflict with the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Seller, any
Company or any Subsidiary, (b) conflict with or violate any Law or Governmental
Order applicable to the Seller, any Company or any Subsidiary, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or (c)
result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or event which with the
giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a default) under, or
give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance on the Shares or
on any of the assets or properties of any Company or any Subsidiary pursuant
to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument relating to such assets or properties to
which the Seller, any Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which any of
such assets or properties is bound or affected, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.06. Financial Statements. The Seller has
delivered to the Purchaser the 1994 Audited Financial Statements (a copy of
which is included in Section 3.06 of the Disclosure Schedule). The 1994 Audited
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in a manner
consistent with prior periods and present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Companies and
the Subsidiaries as at the date and for the period indicated.

SECTION 3.07. Labor Matters. No Company or Subsidiary is a
party to any labor agreement with respect to its employees with any labor
organization, group or association. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no representation proceedings pending with or, to the knowledge of the Seller,
threatened in writing by any labor organization or group of employees of any
Company or Subsidiary, nor are there, to the knowledge of the Seller, any
organizing activities involving any Company or Subsidiary pending with or
threatened in writing by any such organization or group. Except where the
failure to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect, each Company and
each Subsidiary is in material compliance with all applicable Laws respecting
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, discrimination,
safety and health, workers' compensation, wages, hours of work and the
collection and payment of withholding and/or social security taxes and similar
taxes. Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
<PAGE> 23

or complaint against any Company or Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of
the Seller, threatened in writing before the National Labor Relations Board or
any comparable state agency, (b) there is no complaint, charge or claim pending
or, to the knowledge of the Seller, threatened in writing against any Company
or Subsidiary with any Governmental Authority, arising out of, in connection
with, or otherwise relating to the employment by any Company or Subsidiary of

stoppage pending against any Company or Subsidiary. Except as set forth in
Section 3.07 of the Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement there

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing,
upon reasonable notice, the Seller shall, and shall cause the officers,
employees, auditors and agents of the Seller, the Companies and the
Subsidiaries to, (i) afford the officers, employees and authorized agents and
representatives of the Purchaser reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the offices, properties, books and records of the Companies and the

employees and authorized agents and representatives of the Purchaser such
additional financial and operating data and other information (including

Companies and the Subsidiaries as the Purchaser may from time to time
reasonably request in order to assist the Purchaser in fulfilling its
obligations under this Agreement and to facilitate the consummation of the
transfers contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not
unreasonably interfere with any of the businesses or operations of the Seller,
the Companies, the Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the Seller or any Affiliate
of Merck.

(b) The Purchaser agrees that it shall preserve and keep
all Books and Records in the Purchaser's possession for a period of at least
eight years from the Closing Date. After such eight-year period, before the
Purchaser shall dispose of any of such Books and Records, at least 90 calendar
days' prior written notice to such effect shall be given by the Purchaser to
the Seller, and the Seller shall be given an opportunity, at its cost and
expense, to remove and retain all or any part of such Books and Records as the
Seller may select.

(c) Each party agrees that it will cooperate with and
make available to the other party, during normal business hours, all Books and
Records, information and employees (without substantial disruption of
employment) retained and remaining in existence after the Closing Date which
are necessary or useful in connection with any Tax inquiry, audit,
investigation or dispute, any litigation or investigation or any other matter
requiring
<PAGE> 41

36

any such Books and Records, information or employees for any reasonable
business purpose. The party requesting any such Books and Records, information
or employees shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, attorneys' fees, but excluding reimbursement for salaries
and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with providing such
Books and Records, information or employees. The Seller may require certain
financial information relating to the Business for periods prior to the
Closing Date for the purpose of filing federal, state, local and foreign tax
returns and other governmental reports, and the Purchaser agrees to furnish
such information to the Seller at the Seller's request and expense.

SECTION 5.03. Confidentiality. The terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the Purchaser under this
Section 5.03 shall terminate; provided, however, that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate only in respect of that portion of the Proprietary
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for
any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect.

SECTION 5.04. Regulatory and Other Authorizations;
Consents.

(a) Each party hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to
obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of, and to give all
notices to and make all filings with, all Governmental Authorities and other
third parties that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery
of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and will
cooperate fully with the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, giving such notices, and making
such filings. The Purchaser acknowledges that it shall be solely responsible
for obtaining the Licenses and all other consents, approvals and authorizations
referred to in the writing described in Section 4.03(a) and the Seller agrees
to assist the Purchaser in its efforts with respect thereto. Each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
within five Business Days of the date hereof and to supply promptly any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act. The parties hereto acknowledge that time shall be of the
essence in this Agreement and agree not to take any action that will have the
effect of unreasonably delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any 
required authorizations, consents, orders or approvals.

(b) The Purchaser shall take promptly all reasonable
actions deemed by the Purchaser in its good faith discretion to be necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the
enforcement of any applicable antitrust laws ("Government
<PAGE> 42
37

Antitrust Authority") or any other party to the consummation of the acquisition
of the Shares by the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(c) The Purchaser agrees that if, prior to the Closing,
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates enters into any other agreement with
respect to any acquisition, merger, joint venture or similar transaction which
causes any Government Antitrust Authority to assert an impediment under any
antitrust law to the Purchaser's acquisition of the Shares, the Purchaser will
take all reasonable action as may be required with respect to such other
transaction in order to eliminate each and every impediment asserted by such
Government Antitrust Authority in a timely manner so as not to cause any
material delay in the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 5.04(c),
there shall be deemed to be a "material delay" if the Purchaser has not taken
all such reasonable action required to eliminate each and every such impediment
by the 30th day (but, in any event, not later than three Business Days prior to
February 15, 1994) after receipt by the Purchaser of a Seller's Notice. A
"Seller's Notice" is a written notice in accordance with this Agreement from a
duly authorized officer of the Seller stating that the Seller is ready, willing
and able (but for the existence of any impediment to Closing asserted by any
Government Antitrust Authority) to consummate the Closing pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. In the event that there shall occur a "material
delay" within the meaning of this Section 5.04(c), in addition to any other
rights or remedies that may be available to the Seller, the closing condition
set forth in Section 8.02(a)(i) shall be deemed satisfied in the event that the
certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(iii) states that
the condition contained in Section 8.02(a)(i) was satisfied on the date of the
Seller's Notice.

(d) The Purchaser will cooperate with the Seller in
obtaining any consents of landlords necessary or advisable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
providing to such landlords (i) guarantees by the Purchaser of the obligations
of any Company or any Subsidiary under the Leases and (ii) furnishing such
financial statements and other financial information with respect to the
Purchaser and the Parent as such landlords may reasonably request; provided,
however, that no material adjustments shall be made to any Lease without the
Purchaser's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

SECTION 5.05. Use of the Seller's Name. No interest
in or right to use the name "Synetic" or any derivation thereof or any logo,
trademark or trade name of the Seller (collectively, the "Retained Names and
Marks") is being transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby and such rights of the Companies and the Subsidiaries shall
terminate as of the Closing Date. The Purchaser will, immediately following the
Closing Date, cause each Company and each Subsidiary to remove or obliterate
all the Retained Names and Marks from its signs, purchase orders, invoices,
sales orders, labels, letterheads, shipping documents, and other items and
materials, and not to put into use after the Closing Date any such items and
materials not in existence on the Closing Date that bear any Retained Name or
Mark or any name, mark or logo similar thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Companies and the Subsidiaries may, for a period of 60
<PAGE> 43
38

calendar days following the Closing Date, use any purchase orders, invoices,
sales orders, labels, letterheads, or shipping documents existing on the
Closing Date that bear any Retained Name or Mark or any name, mark or logo
similar thereto, where the removal of any Retained Name or Mark or any such
similar name, mark or logo would be impractical; provided, that the Purchaser
shall place, or cause to be placed, a stamp, mark or other notation on any such
item that identifies the relevant Companies and Subsidiaries as Affiliates or
businesses of the Purchaser (and not of the Seller). The Purchaser agrees that
the Seller shall have no responsibility for claims by third parties arising out
of, or relating to, the use by the Purchaser, the Companies, the Subsidiaries
or any Affiliate thereof of any Retained Name or Mark after the Closing Date,
and the Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller from any and
all claims that may arise out of the use thereof by the Purchaser, the
Companies, the Subsidiaries or any Affiliate thereof.

SECTION 5.06. Investigation.

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has
made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, the Companies, the Subsidiaries and the
Business, (ii) has been furnished with or given adequate access to such
information about the Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Business as it has
requested, and (iii) will not assert any claim against the Seller or any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, Affiliates, consultants,
counsel, accountants, investment bankers or representatives, or hold the Seller
or any such Persons liable, for any inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions
with respect to information (other than, with respect to the Companies, the
Subsidiaries and the Business, the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement) furnished by the Seller or any such Persons concerning the
Seller, its Affiliates, the Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Business.

(b) In connection with the Purchaser's investigation of
the Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Business, the Purchaser has received
from the Seller certain projections and other forecasts for the Companies and
the Subsidiaries and certain plan and budget, information. The Purchaser
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, that the Purchaser is familiar with
such uncertainties, that the Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making
its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to it, and that the Purchaser will
not assert any claim against the Seller or any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents, stockholders, affiliates, consultants, counsel, accountants,
investment bankers or representatives, or hold the Seller or any such persons
liable, with respect thereto. Accordingly, the Seller makes no representation
or warranty with respect to any estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or
budgets referred to in this Section 5.06(b).
<PAGE> 44
39

SECTION 5.07. Stockholders' Meeting.

(a) The Seller shall take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Laws and its Certificate of Incorporation and
By-Laws to convene the Special Meeting. Subject to its fiduciary duties, the
Board of Directors of the Seller shall recommend approval of the proposals
contained in the Proxy Statement and the Seller shall take all lawful action to
solicit, and use all reasonable efforts to obtain, such approval. None of the
information contained in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of the mailing
of such Proxy Statement and at the time of the Special Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If at
any time prior to the Special Meeting any event or circumstance relating to the
Seller or any of its subsidiaries, or its or their respective officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Seller which should be set forth in the
Proxy Statement to be used in connection with the Stockholders' Meeting, the
Seller shall promptly supplement the Proxy Statement. The Seller represents
that all documents that the Seller is responsible for filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Purchase and Sale Agreement will comply
as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(b) The Purchaser will supply such information about the
Purchaser and its Affiliates as may be required for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement and any supplement thereto. None of such
information will, at the time of the mailing of such Proxy Statement and at the
time of the Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

SECTION 5.08. Non-Competition.

(a) The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Business
is conducted in the States of Connecticut, Indiana, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island and that the reputation and goodwill of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries are an integral part of its business success throughout the
respective areas where they conduct their respective businesses. As an
inducement for the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, the Seller agrees
that for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Non-Competion Period"), except with the
Purchaser's prior written consent, the Seller shall not, directly or
indirectly, or through one or more Affiliates, own, manage, operate, join,
control or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of,
any profit or non-profit business or organization in any part of the Territory
(as hereinafter defined) which, directly or indirectly, Competes (as
hereinafter defined) with the Purchaser. For purposes of this Section 5.08, a
profit or non-profit business or organization shall be deemed to "compete" with
the Purchaser if such business or organization engages in the 
<PAGE> 45
40

business as engaged by any Company or any Subsidiary as of the Closing Date,
including but not limited to providing infusion therapy, distributing
urological, enternal and other health care products and supplies, providing
medical record keeping services, or providing prescription vending services and
consultant pharmacist services, in each case to nursing homes and other similar
long-term care facilities. In addition, during the Non-Competition Period,
none of the Seller or any of its Affiliates shall (i) provide or assist any
other Person in the development or provision of an institutional pharmacy
management system using any material component or know-how involved in the
development of the SPMS for use by any Person engaged in the business of any
Company or Subsidiary (as described in the immediately preceding sentence) in
the United States, (ii) solicit, raid, entice or induce any person that
currently is, or at the Closing Date shall be (or, in the case of termination,
is at the time of termination), an employee of any Company or Subsidiary to
become employed by any Person (other than the Purchaser), or (iii) approach any
such employee for such purpose or authorize or participate with the taking of
such actions by any other Person, or assist or participate with any such Person
in taking such action; provided, however, the provisions of this sentence shall
not prohibit the Seller or its Affiliates from advertising generally,
including advertisements designed to attract new employees. For purposes of
this Section 5.08, the term "Territory" means an area comprising the States of
Connecticut, Indiana, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Nothing contained in
this Section 5.08 shall prevent the Seller from acquiring any business that
competes with the Purchaser (the "Acquired Competing Business"), through
merger, stock purchase, acquisition of assets or otherwise, provided that (A)
such Acquired Competing Business constitutes a subsidiary or division (other
than a "significant Subsidiary" as such term is defned in Rule 1-02 of
Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission) of a
larger business acquired at the same time as the Acquired Competing Business,
which larger business does not compete with the Purchaser, and (B) such
Acquired Competing Business is sold to a Person who is not an Affiliate of the
Seller within one year from the date of acquisition thereof.

(b) The Seller acknowledges that a breach of its covenants contained in
Section 5.08(a) may cause irreparable damage to the Purchaser, the exact amount
of which will be difficult to ascertain, and that the remedies at law for any 
such breach will be inadequate. Accordingly, Seller agrees that if it breaches
any of the covenants contained in Section 5.08(a), in addition to any other 
remedy which may be available at law or in equity, the Purchaser shall be 
entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief against the Seller.

(c) The parties further acknowledge that the time, scope,
geographic area and other provisions of Section 5.08(a) have been specifically
negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and agree that all such
provisions are reasonable under the circumstances of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the agreements in Section
5.08(a) shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable by reason of their extending for too great a period of time or
over too great a geographical area or by reason of their being too extensive
in any other respect, they shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum
period of time for which they may be

<PAGE> 46
41

enforceable and/or over the maximum geographical area as to which they may be
enforceable and/or to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which they
may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action.

(d) The existence of any claim or cause of action which
any party may have against another party shall not constitute a defense or bar
to the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Section 5.08, but such
claim or cause of action may be pursued through separate court action by such
party.

SECTION 5.09. SPMS.

(a) On or immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
will transfer and assign to Dunnington or another Company designated by the
Purchaser (the "SPMS Transferee") all right, title and interest of the Seller
in and to the computer systems described and identified in Section 5.09 of the
Disclosure Schedule, and known as the Synetic Pharmacy Management System (the
"SPMS"), including (i) each and every computer program related thereto, and
each copy thereof, all conversions, derivative works, improvements,
modifications, translations and updates of all or part of the SPMS programs in
any form or medium (the "SPMS Programs") and (ii) all human-readable
programming lists, flow charts, input and output charts, instruction materials,
logic charts, technical manuals and other materials intended to assist either
users or programmers working with the SPMS Programs to use it (collectively, the
"Source Code and Documentation"). Section 5.09 of the Disclosure Schedule
includes a list of all license fees or similar charges payable to any third
party in connection with any software, computer program or similar product
required for use of the SPMS or otherwise included in the SPMS. Upon transfer
of the SPMS as contemplated by this Section 5.09, all proprietary rights in the
SPMS shall become the sole and exclusive property of the SPMS Transferee, the
Seller shall retain no rights therein, copies thereof or documentation relating
thereto, in whatever form or medium in which such rights and documentation
exist, and the Seller and its Affiliates will purge all copies of the SPMS from
their computer systems and storage media and shall certify to the Purchaser in
writing promptly following the Closing that such copies have been purged.
This assignment and transfer includes the full and exclusive rights comprised
in the copyright of the work and all revisions thereof, including but not
limited to, the right, by itself or with others throughout the world, to
publish, republish and distribute the work and to prepare, publish and
distribute derivative works based thereon, in all languages and in all formats
and media of expression now known or later developed and to license or permit
others to do so. The Seller recognizes and agrees that the SPMS is considered
to be a valuable asset and trade secret of the Seller and contains proprietary
and confidential information of the Seller, for which the purchase thereof, and
sole and exclusive rights of use pertaining thereto, has been bargained for and
agreed to be paid by the Purchaser as part of the Purchase Price. The Seller
warrants that the SPMS has been developed, implemented and installed in a
proper and workmanlike manner and that, on the Closing Date, the Source Code
and Documentation, together with normal maintenance, updating and modifications
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, will permit
the Purchaser to run the SPMS Programs
<PAGE> 47
42

described in Section 5.09 of the Disclosure Schedule; provided that the Seller
does not warrant that the SPMS is error-free or that its use will be
uninterrupted. To the extent that the Companies and the Subsidiaries do not
have adequate personnel to accomplish the transition, the Seller agrees to,
and to use its reasonable efforts to cause Medco, as necessary, to cooperate
with and assist the Purchaser as reasonably required during a transition
period, not to exceed 90 days following the Closing Date without compensation
(but including reimbursement of the individuals involved for out of pocket
travel and related expenses, if any) and thereafter for an additional period of
90 days at agreed upon rates of compensation for the time and out of pocket
travel and related expenses of the individuals involved, to continue the use of
the SPMS under the management and control of the Purchaser in the Business at
the locations where it is currently in use, including, but not limited to, 
updating the Source Code and Documentation, so that such Source Code and
Documentation, together with normal maintenance, updating and modifications in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, will permit the
Purchaser to run the SPMS Programs approval described in Section 5.09 of the
Disclosure Schedule.

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date, (i) the Seller agrees to hold the SPMS in confidence to the same extent
that it protects other confidential and proprietary information and to take all
reasonable precautions consistent with its past practices to safeguard the
confidentiality of the SPMS, (ii) no portion of the SPMS may be disclosed,
furnished, transferred, displayed or otherwise made available by the Seller to
any Person other than the Purchaser or the Companies and the Subsidiaries. The
Seller agrees to take appropriate action by instruction, agreement and
otherwise with its Affiliates and its and their employees to inform them of the
trade secret proprietary and confidential nature of the SPMS and to obtain
their compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.09.

(c) THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SELLER IS NOT A
MERCHANT WITH RESPECT TO THE SPMS. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 5.09(a), THE
SELLER MAKES AND THE PURCHASER RECEIVES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
REGARDING THE SPMS AND THERE ARE EXRESSLY EXCLUDED ALL WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

(d) In no event shall the Seller be liable for any
special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages, or any damages arising
out of or in connection with the use or performance of the SPMS, whether in
an action based on warranty, contract or tort, including negligence or strict
liability.

SECTION 5. 10. Further Action. Subject to the terms
and conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto covenants and agrees
to use its best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered such documents and
other papers and to take or cause to be taken such further actions as may be
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby and to carry out the intent of
this Agreement.
<PAGE> 48

SECTION 5.11. Maintenance of Assets. From and after
the date hereof and until the Closing, the Seller shall and shall cause the
Companies and the Subsidiaries to use reasonable efforts to maintain all of the
assets of the Companies and the Subsidiaries consisting of tangible property,
and all replacements thereof and improvements thereon, in their existing
condition, normal wear and tear excepted, and use, operate and maintain all of
such assets in a reasonable manner in conformity with past practice. In the
event of material damage to or destruction of any of such assets prior to the
Closing Date, the Seller shall repair or replace such assets as soon as
reasonably practicable after such loss or damage.

SECTION 5.12. Non-Solicitation. The Seller covenants
that, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, from
the date hereof through the Closing Date it will not, and will not permit any
of its representatives to, (i) knowingly solicit, assist, initiate, facilitate
or encourage any inquiries, proposals, offers or bids from any other party
relating to an Acquisition Transaction (as defined below), or (ii) furnish or
cause to be furnished to any Person any non-public information relating to the
Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of the assets or the business of the
Companies or the Subsidiaries, other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. The Seller covenants that from and after the
date hereof until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, it
will not, directly or indirectly, enter into, or permit any of its
representatives or Affiliates to enter into, any agreement with any third party
for the acquisition of any of the Shares or any material portion of the assets
of the Companies or the Subsidiaries (an "Acquisition Transaction"). The
Seller covenants and agrees to inform the Purchaser in writing by facsimile
within twenty-four (24) hours following the receipt by it or any of its
Affiliates or representatives of any proposal, solicitation or bid (including
the terms thereof and the Person making such proposal, solicitation or bid) in
respect of any Acquisition Transaction.

SECTION 5.13. Intercompany Debt.

(a) The Purchaser shall cause the Companies and the
Subsidiaries to pay, immediately after the Closing, to the Seller in
immediately available funds, $2,686,000, representing an estimate of the
Intercompany Amount on the Closing Date.

(b) If the Incremental Intercompany Amount is greater
than zero, the Purchaser shall cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries
to pay such amounts in accordance with such obligations within five Business
Days after delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet by the Seller to the
Purchaser.

(c) If the Incremental Intercompany Amount is less than
zero, the Seller, shall pay to the Companies and the Subsidiaries an amount
equal to the amount by which zero exceeds the Incremental Intercompany Amount
within five Business Days after delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet by the
Seller to the Purchaser.
<PAGE> 49

SECTION 5.14. Other Information. The Seller shall
provide to the Purchaser monthly income statements and balance sheets relating
to the Companies and the Subsidiaries as the Seller customarily prepares for
its own use, in the form customarily prepared on a regular basis.

ARITCLE VI

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

SECTION 6.01. Employees.

(a) The Purchaser will treat employees of the Companies
and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date ("Transferred Employees") no less
favorably with respect to employee benefits than its own similarly situated
employees (excluding the Transferred Employees), as reasonably determined by
the Purchaser in good faith, and will cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries
to adopt on or promptly after the Closing Date employee benefit plans no less
favorable than the employee benefit plans generally available to such similarly
situated employees.

(b) To the extent that service is relevant for purposes
of eligibility, participation, vesting or benefit accrual under any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by the
Purchaser, the Companies or the Subsidiaries, the Purchaser shall cause such
Transferred Employees to be credited for service on or prior to the Closing
with any Company, any Subsidiary, the Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates (including Medco or any of its subsidiaries). The Purchaser shall
not apply any preexisting condition provisions to deny or limit coverage for,
or participation by, any Transferred Employee under any health care coverage
benefit plan maintained by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to the extent
that such Transferred Employee is covered as of the Closing Date under a health
care coverage benefit plan of any Company or any Subsidiary providing health
care coverage benefits, provided that, if there is a dispute with respect to
the coverage of any such Transferred Employee based on a preexisting condition
provision under the health care coverage benefit plans of any Company or
Subsidiary, the health care coverage benefits plans of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall not be required to provide coverage with respect to such
preexisting condition unless and until it has been determined under the terms
of the health care coverage benefits plans of such Company or Subsidiary that
such employee's disputed pre-existing condition was covered under such health
care coverage benefits plans of the Companies and the Subsidiaries.

(c) Seller agrees to reimburse Purchaser upon request for
the cost of salary and other employee benefits (excluding travel and
entertainment expenses) incurred by Purchaser with respect to Peter Scianna,
Louis Scianna and Elliott Tertes under (and for the initial term of) their
respective employment agreements as in effect on the Closing Date.

SECTION 6.02. Certain Dunnington Agreements. The Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser, the Companies and Subsidiaries
from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses and expenses arising
out of or in connection with Section 9.5(c) of the Dunnington Agreement. The
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate (and shall cause the Companies and
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date to reasonably cooperate) in good faith with
the Seller to take any actions, without material cost to the Purchaser, the
Companies and Subsidiaries, necessary or desirable to extinguish or limit the
Seller's liability under this Section.

SECTION 6.03. Survival. The covenants and agreements
of the parties hereto contained in this Article VI shall survive the Closing

of limitations with respect to the respective matters set forth herein.

ARTICLE VII

TAX MATTERS

SECTION 7.01. Tax Indemnities.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Seller agrees to
indemnify, without any gross-up for Taxes, the Purchaser and each Company
against all Taxes (i) imposed on the Seller or any member of an affiliated
group with which the Seller files a consolidated or combined income tax return
(other than the Companies and the Subsidiaries) with respect to any taxable
period that ends on or before the Closing Date or includes the Closing Date, or
(ii) imposed on any Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any taxable
period or portion thereof that ends on or before the Closing Date; provided,
however, that no indemnity shall be provided under this Agreement for any Taxes
resulting from (x) a reduction in any net operating loss, capital loss or Tax
credit carryover allocable to any Company or any Subsidiary or (y) any
transaction of any Company or any Subsidiary occurring on or after the Closing
Date that is not in the ordinary course of business. Any indemnity payment
made hereunder by the Seller to the Purchaser shall, in accordance with Section
7.08(a), be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for tax purposes.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and
the respective Companies shall indemnify, without any gross-up for Taxes, the
Seller and its affiliates against all Taxes imposed on or with respect to such
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries that are not subject to
indemnification pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 7.01, including, but
not limited to, Taxes resulting from any transaction of any such Company and
its Subsidiaries occurring on or after the Closing Date that is not in the
ordinary course of business. Any indemnity payment made hereunder by the 
Purchaser to the Seller shall, in accordance with Section 7.08(a), be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for tax purposes.
<PAGE> 51
46

(c) Payment by the indemnitor of any amount due under
this Section 7.01 shall be made within ten days following written notice by the
indemnitee that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Tax authority is
due, provided that the indemnitor shall not be required to make any payment
earlier than two days before it is due to the appropriate Tax authority. In
the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the provisions of
Section 7.03, payment of the Tax to the appropriate Tax authority will not be
considered to be due earlier than the date a final determination to such effect
is made by the appropriate Taxing authority or a court.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Tax that is imposed on a periodic basis and is payable for a period that begins
before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the portion of such
Taxes payable for the period ending on the Closing Date shall be (i) in the
case of any Tax other than a Tax based upon or measured by income, the amount
of such Tax for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period and (ii) in
the case of any Tax based upon or measured by income, the amount which would be
payable if the taxable year ended on the Closing Date. Any credit shall be
prorated based upon the fraction employed in clause (i) of the next preceding
sentence. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including
net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be
allocated under this Section 7.01(d) shall be computed by reference to the
level of such items on the Closing Date.

(e) The respective indemnification obligations of the
Purchaser and the Seller pursuant to this Section 7.01 shall not be effective
until the aggregate dollar amount of all Taxes which would otherwise be
indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 7.01 by such party exceeds $50,000
(the "Threshold Amount"), and then only to the extent such aggregate amount
exceeds the Threshold Amount.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.01 to the
contrary, if any Company or any Subsidiary is included in a consolidated,
combined or unitary return or report, then (i) neither Purchaser nor Seller nor
any of their affiliates shall be responsible to the other in respect of any Tax
imposed on or measured by the income, property or business activities of any
entity other than any Company or any Subsidiary ("Other Entity"), and (ii)
there shall be no Threshold Amount applicable in respect of any such Other
Entity for purposes of Section 7.01(e).

SECTION 7.02. Refunds and Tax Benefits.

(a) The Purchaser shall promptly pay to the Seller any
refund or credit (including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto)
received by the Purchaser, any Company or any Subsidiary of Taxes (i) relating
to taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date or
(ii) attributable to an amount paid by the Seller under Section 7.01 hereof.
The Purchaser shall, if the Seller so requests and at the Seller's
<PAGE> 52
47

expense, cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain any refund to which
the Seller is entitled under this Section 7.02. The Purchaser shall permit the
Seller to control (at the Seller's expense) the prosecution of any such refund
claim, and shall cause the relevant entity to authorize by appropriate power of
attorney such persons as the Seller shall designate to represent such entity
with respect to such refund claim.

(b) If the Purchaser and each Company shall not make an
election under Section 172(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to relinquish the
entire carryback period with respect to any net operating loss, capital loss
or tax credit attributable to such Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date that could be carried back to a
taxable year of such Company or any such Subsidiary ending on or before the
Closing Date, then the Purchaser or each Company or Subsidiary may carry back
such net operating loss, capital loss or tax credit, as the case may be, to
such prior taxable year, provided, however, that neither the Seller nor any
affiliate thereof shall be required to pay to the Purchaser, any Company, any
Subsidiary or any of their affiliates any refund or credit of Taxes that
results from such carryback or to otherwise indemnify the Purchaser, any
Company, any Subsidiary or any of their affiliates for such refund or credit of
Taxes.

SECTION 7.03. Contests.

(a) After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Seller in writing of the commencement of any Tax audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on the
Purchaser or any Company or Subsidiary which, if determined adversely to the
taxpayer or after the lapse of time would be grounds for indemnification under
Section 7.01. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent
known to the Purchaser or any Company or Subsidiary) describing the asserted
Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or
other document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such
asserted Tax liability. If the Purchaser fails to give the Seller prompt
notice of an asserted Tax liability as required by this Section 7.03, then, if
the Seller is precluded by the failure to give prompt notice from contesting
the asserted Tax liability in both the administrative and judicial forums, then
the Seller shall not have any obligation to indemnify for any loss arising out
of such asserted Tax liability.

(b) The Seller may elect to direct, through counsel of
its own choosing and at its own expense, any audit, claim for refund and
administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted liability with
respect to which indemnity may be sought under Section 7.01 (any such audit,
claim for refund or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability is
referred to herein as a "Contest"). If the Seller elects to direct a Contest,
it shall within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice of asserted Tax
liability notify the Purchaser of its intent to do so, and the Purchaser shall
cooperate and shall cause each Company and/or Subsidiary or its respective
successor or successors to cooperate, at the Seller's expense, in each phase of
such Contest. If the Seller elects not to direct the Contest, fails to notify
the Purchaser of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation to
indemnify under
<PAGE> 53
48

Section 7.01, the Purchaser or any Company and/or Subsidiary may pay,
compromise or contest, at its own expense, such asserted Tax liability. In any
event, the Seller may participate, at its own expense, in the Contest. If
the Seller chooses to direct the Contest, the Purchaser shall promptly empower
and shall cause the Companies or their respective successors promptly to
empower (by power of attorney and such other documentation as may be necessary
and appropriate) such representatives of the Seller as it may designate to
represent the Purchaser or the Companies and/or the Subsidiaries or their
respective successors in the Contest insofar as the Contest involves an
asserted Tax liability for which the Seller would be liable under Section 7.01.

SECTION 7.04. Preparation of Tax Returns. The
Seller shall prepare and file any tax returns and schedules relating to the
Company and the Subsidiaries for the period ending on or before the Closing
Date. Such returns and schedules shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
those prepared for prior tax years unless a different treatment of any item is
required by an intervening change in law. The Purchaser shall prepare or cause
each Company to prepare any tax return relating to such Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any period ending after the Closing Date.

SECTION 7.05. Section 3.38(h)(10) Election.

(a) The parties agree that in connection with the sale of
the Shares contemplated hereby, the parties shall cause an express election
pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code (a "Section 338
Election") to be made in respect of the Companies and the Subsidiaries, and
shall comply with the rules and regulations applicable to such Section 338
Election.

(b) For purposes of executing a Section 338 Election, on
or prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Seller (and/or other
entities as necessary) jointly shall execute four copies (three for the
Purchaser and one for the Seller) of Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 (or any
successor form) and all attachments required to be filed therewith pursuant to
applicable Treasury regulations. The forms relating to the Section 338
Election for federal, state and local Tax purposes hereinafter shall be
referred to as the "Forms". The Purchaser and the Seller agree that the Forms
shall be filed with the appropriate tax authorities not earlier than 60 days
before the latest date for the filing thereof. At least 120 days prior to the
latest date for the filing of each Form, the Purchaser shall prepare and submit
to the Seller any necessary corrections, amendments or supplements to such Form
and the attachments thereto, as executed by the Purchaser and the Seller
(and/or other entities as necessary) on or before the Closing Date. The
Purchaser shall not file any Form or the attachments thereto as corrected,
amended or supplemented unless it shall have obtained the Seller's consent
thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. On or prior to the
30th day after the Seller's receipt of such corrections, amendments or
supplements from the Purchaser, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser
either (A) its consent to such filing or (B) a written notice specifying in
reasonable detail all disputed items and the basis therefor. If, within 30
days after the Purchaser's receipt of the written notice described in clause
(B)
<PAGE> 54
49

above, the Purchaser and the Seller have been unable to resolve their
differences, any remaining disputed issues shall be submitted to a nationally
recognized independent public accounting firm in the United States (other than
a firm which then serves, has been selected to serve in the future or has
served within the past three years as the independent auditor for the Purchaser
or any of its affiliates) selected by the Purchaser, and reasonably acceptable
to the Seller, to resolve in a final binding manner after hearing the views of
both parties. In that event, the Purchaser and the Seller shall execute and
consent to the filing of the corrected, amended or supplemented Form in the
manner determined by such accounting firm. In no event, however, shall the
Forms be filed later than 15 days before they are due. The fees and expenses
of the accounting firm shall be shared equally.

(c) For purposes of making a Section 338 Election, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall agree upon an allocation of the Purchaser's
"adjusted grossed-up basis" in the Shares (within the meaning of the
Treasury Regulations under section 338 of the Internal Revenue Code) to the
tangible and intangible assets of the Companies and the Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date (the "Allocation"). The Allocation shall be binding upon the
Purchaser and the Seller for purposes of allocating the "deemed selling price"
(within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations) among the assets of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries. Neither party shall file any tax return, or
take a position with a Tax authority, that is inconsistent with the Allocation.
If the Purchaser and Seller shall not be able to agree to the Allocation, they
shall submit any dispute to Deloitte & Touche or such other independent
accounting firm as may be mutually acceptable to the Seller and the Purchaser
to resolve all disputed matters related to the Allocation, and such resolution
shall be binding on both parties.

SECTION 7.06. Cooperation and Exchange of Informa-
tion. The Seller and the Purchaser will provide each other with such
cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the
other in filing any tax return, amended return or claim for refund, determining
a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or
conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation
and information shall include providing copies of relevant tax returns or
portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules and related work papers
and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing
authorities. Each party shall make its employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or information
provided hereunder. Each party will retain all returns, schedules and work
papers and all material records or other documents relating to Tax matters of
the Companies for the taxable period first ending after the Closing Date and
for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified by
the other party in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods,
or (ii) eight years following the due date (without extension) for such
returns. Any information obtained under this Section 7.06 shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding.

SECTION 7.07. Conveyance Taxes. The Purchaser 
agrees to assume liability for and to pay all sales, transfer, stamp, stock 
transfer, real property transfer or gains and similar Taxes incurred as a 
result of the sale of the Shares contemplated hereby.

SECTION 7.08. Miscellaneous.

(a) The parties agree to treat all payments made under
this Article VII, under any other indemnity provision contained in this 
Agreement, and for any misrepresentations or breach of warranties or covenants 
as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

(b) Except as expressly provided otherwise and except for
the representations contained in Section 3.16 of this Agreement, this Article 
VII shall be the sole provision governing Tax matters and indemnities therefor
under this Agreement.

(c) For purposes of this Article VII, all references to
the Purchaser, the Seller, the Companies and the Subsidiaries include 
successors.

(d) The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto
contained in this Article VII shall survive the Closing and shall remain in 
full force and effect until the expiration of all statutes of limitations 
with respect to any Taxes that would be indemnifiable by the Seller under 
Section 7.01(a) of this Agreement or by the Purchaser under Section 7.01(b) of 
this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 9.01. Survival. Subject to the limitations and
other provisions of this Agreement, the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of the parties hereto contained herein shall survive the
Closing and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Seller or the Purchaser, for a period
of 18 months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in Sections
2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.08, 3.16, 3.25, 5.02(b), 5.03, 5.05, 5.06, 5.08, 5.09 and
5.10, and Articles VI, VII, and IX shall remain in full force and effect for
the applicable periods specified in the respective Sections or Articles or, if
no such period is specified, indefinitely; and provided further that the
representations and warranties and covenants set forth in Sections 3.07, 3.15
and 5.02(c) shall remain in full force and effect until the termination of all
liabilities arising from the subject matter thereof pursuant to all applicable
statutes of limitations and the provisions of Article XI shall survive until
the last to survive of the other provisions of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.02. Indemnification by the Purchaser.

(a) The Purchaser agrees, subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement and without gross-up for Taxes, to indemnify the
Seller against and hold the Seller harmless from all Losses to the Seller
arising out of (i) the breach of or any inaccuracy in any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of the Purchaser herein (other than Article
VII, it being understood that the sole remedy for breach thereof shall be
pursuant to Article VII). Anything in Section 9.01 to the contrary
notwithstanding no claim
<PAGE> 58
53

may be asserted nor may any action be commenced against the Purchaser for
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or a reement contained herein,
unless written notice of such claim or action is received by the Purchaser
describing in detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim or action on or prior to the date on which the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim or action
is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 9.01, irrespective of
whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have occurred before
or after such date.

(b) The indemnification obligations of the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 9.02(a) shall not be effective until the aggregate dollar amount of all
Losses which would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.02(a)
exceeds $500,000 (the "Purchaser's Threshold Amount"), and then only to the
extent such aggregate amount exceeds the Purchaser's Threshold Amount. In
addition, no claim may be made against the Purchaser for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.02(a) with respect to any individual item of Loss, unless
such item exceeds $15,000 or any related group of items, unless such related
group of items exceeds $50,000, nor shall any such item or related group of
items be applied to or considered part of the Purchaser's Threshold Amount. 
The indemnification obligations of the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 9.02
shall be effective only until the dollar amount paid in respect of the Losses
indemnified against under this Section 9.02 aggregates to an amount equal to 
$110,000,000. For the purposes of this Section 9.02(b), in computing such
individual or aggregate amounts of claims, the amount of each claim shall be
deemed to be an amount (i) net of any Tax benefit to the Seller or any
Affiliate thereof, (ii) net of any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment recoverable by the Seller or any
Affiliate from any third party with respect thereto and (iii) net of any
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.06 with respect to the
subject matter in dispute.

(c) Payments by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.02(a) shall be
limited to the amount of any Losses that remains after deducting therefrom (i)
any Tax benefit to the Seller or any Affiliate thereof, (ii) any insurance
proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recoverable
by the Seller from any third party with respect thereto and (iii) any
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.06 with respect to the
subject matter in dispute. If a payment is made by the Purchaser in accordance
with this Section 9.02, and if in a subsequent taxable year a Tax benefit is
realized by the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller with which the Seller
files a consolidated, combined or unitary tax return (that was not previously
taken into account to reduce an amount otherwise payable by the Purchaser under
Section 9.02), the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser at the time of such
realization the amount of such Tax benefit to the extent that the Tax benefit
would have resulted in a reduction in the amount paid by the Purchaser under
Section 9.02 if the Tax benefit had been obtained in the year of such payment.
A Tax benefit will be considered to be realized for purposes of this Section
9.02 at the time that it is reflected on a tax return of the Seller or any
Affiliate of the Seller with which the Seller files a consolidated, combined or
unitary tax return.

(d) The Seller agrees to give the Purchaser written notice of any
claim, assertion, event or proceeding by or in respect of a third party as to
which it may request indemnification hereunder or as to which the Purchaser's
Threshold Amount may be applied as soon as is practicable and in any event
within 30 days of the time that the Seller learns of such claim, assertion,
event or proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the
Purchaser shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder except to the
extent that the Purchaser is actually prejudiced by such failure. The
Purchaser shall have the right to direct, through counsel of its own choosing,
the defense or settlement of any such claim or proceeding at its own expense.
If the Purchaser elects to assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding,
the Seller may participate in such defense, but in such case the expenses of
the Seller shall be paid by the Seller, provided that such defense or
settlement may be at the Purchaser's expense if: (i) the Purchaser shall have
agreed to the retention of separate counsel; (ii) the defendants or target of
such claim, assertion, event or proceeding involve more than one indemnified
party or both the Purchaser and the Seller have concluded that such
representation by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potentially differing interests between them in the conduct in respect of such
claim, assertion, event or proceeding as if there were legal defenses available
to the Seller that are different from or additional to those available to the
Purchaser, or (iii) the Purchaser shall have failed to employ legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Seller within a reasonable amount of time. The
Seller shall provide the Purchaser with access to its records and personnel
relating to any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding during normal
business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with the Purchaser in the defense
or settlement thereof, and the Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller for all its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. Except as provided
above, if the Purchaser elects to direct the defense of any such claim or
proceeding, the Seller shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any
claim or demand arising from such asserted liability, unless the Purchaser
consents in writing to such payment or unless the Purchaser, subject to the
last sentence of this Section 9.02(d), withdraws from the defense of such
asserted liability, or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken
by or on behalf of the Purchaser is entered against the Seller for such
liability. If the Purchaser shall fail to defend, or if, after commencing or
undertaking any such defense, the Purchaser fails to prosecute or withdraws
from such defense, the Seller shall have the right to undertake the defense or
settlement thereof, at the Purchaser's expense. If the Seller assumes the
defense of any such claim or proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.02(d) and
proposes to settle such claim or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon
or to forego. appeal with respect thereto, then the Seller shall give the
Purchaser prompt written notice thereof and the Purchaser shall have the right
to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such 
claim or proceeding.

(e) The Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from and after
the Closing, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX and in Article VII. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Seller hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of
action it may have, from and after the Closing, against the Purchaser or its
<PAGE> 60
55

officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement.

(f) Except as set forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser is not
making any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to the
matters contained herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of the
Seller, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares
contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall have no liability under any provision of this
Agreement for and in no event shall the Purchaser's Threshold Amount be applied
to any consequential damages. The Seller shall take all reasonable steps to
mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses.

(h) For purposes of this Section 9.02, in determining whether
there has been a breach of any representation or warranty contained in Article
IV, such representations and warranties shall not be qualified by the terms
"Material Adverse Effect" or "Material Adverse Change" or by any phrase using
such terms.

SECTION 9.03. Indemnification by the Seller.

(a) The Seller agrees, subject to the other terms and conditions
of this Agreement and without gross-up for Taxes, to indemnify the Purchaser
against and hold it harmless from all Losses to the Purchaser arising out of
(i) any Action set forth on Section 3.09 of the Disclosure Schedule and any
other Action arising on or after the date of this Agreement and before the
Closing which would, if it had arisen prior to the date of this Agreement, have
been required to be disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to Section
3.09 (but this clause (i) shall not include any Action between the Purchaser
and the Parent, on the one hand, and the Seller on the other hand, or any
Action with respect to the validity of this Agreement), (ii) a breach of
Sections 6.01(c) or 6.02, (iii) the breach of or any inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Seller herein (other
that Section 2.04, Section 3.16 and Article VII, it being understood that the
sole remedy for breach of such provisions shall be pursuant to Section 2.04 and
Article VII, respectively), and (iv) Liabilities to the extent arising from any
failure to maintain insurance by the Companies or the Subsidiaries or their
respective predecessors, for the period from January 1, 1989 through the date
of acquisition by the Seller, comparable in terms of the type of coverage to
that maintained by the Companies and the Subsidiaries on the date hereof.
Anything in Section 9.01 to the contrary notwithstanding, no claim may be
asserted nor any action commenced against the Seller for breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, unless
written notice of such claim or action is received by the Seller describing in
detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the
<PAGE> 61
56

subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the date on which the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim or action
is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 9.01, irrespective of
whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have occurred before
or after such date.

(b) The indemnification obligations of the Seller pursuant to
Section 9.03(a)(iii) shall not be effective until the aggregate dollar amount
of all Losses which would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section
9.03(a)(iii) exceeds $500,000 (the "Seller's Threshold Amount"), and then only
to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds the Seller's Threshold Amount. In
addition, no claim may be made against the Seller for indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.03(a)(iii) with respect to any individual item of Loss, unless
such item exceeds $15,000 or any related group of items, unless such related
group of items exceeds $50,000, nor shall any such item or related group of
items be applied to or considered part of the Seller's Threshold Amount. The
indemnification obligations of the Seller pursuant to this Section 9.03 shall
be effective only until the dollar amount paid in respect of the Losses
indemnified against under this Section 9.03 aggregates to an amount equal to 
$110,000,000. For the purposes of this Section 9.03(b), in computing such
individual or aggregate amounts of claims, the amount of each claim shall be
deemed to be an amount (i) net of any Tax benefit, (ii) net of any insurance
proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recoverable
by the Purchaser or any Affiliate from any third party with respect thereto and
(iii) net of any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.06
with respect to the subject matter in dispute.

(c) Payments by the Seller pursuant to Section 9.03(a) shall be
limited to the amount of any Losses that remains after deducting therefrom (i)
any Tax benefit, (ii) any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment recoverable by the Purchaser or any Affiliate from any
third party with respect thereto and (iii) any adjustments to the Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 2.06 with respect to the subject matter in dispute.
If a payment is made by the Seller in accordance with this Section 9.03, and if
in a subsequent taxable year a Tax benefit is realized by the Purchaser, any
Company, or Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Purchaser, any Company or any
Subsidiary with which any Company or any Subsidiary files a consolidated,
combined or unitary tax return (that was not previously taken into account to
reduce an amount otherwise payable by the Seller under Section 9.03), the
Purchaser, any such Company, any such Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the
Purchaser, any Company or any Subsidiary with which any Company or any
Subsidiary files a consolidated, combined, or unitary tax return shall pay to
the Seller at the time of such realization the amount of such Tax benefit to
the extent that the Tax benefit would have resulted in a reduction in the
amount paid by the Seller under this Section 9.03 if the Tax benefit had been
obtained in the year of such payment. A Tax benefit will be considered to be
realized for purposes of this Section 9.03 at the time that it is reflected on
a tax return of the Purchaser, any Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of
the Purchaser, any Company or any Subsidiary with which the Purchaser, any
Company or any Subsidiary files a consolidated, combined or unitary tax return.

(d) The Purchaser agrees to give the Seller written notice of any 
claim, assertion, event or proceeding by or in respect of a third party as to
which it may request indemnification hereunder or as to which the Seller's
Threshold Amount may be applied as soon as is practicable and in any event 
within 30 days of the time that the Purchaser learns of such claim, assertion,
event or proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the 
Seller shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder except to the 
extent that the Seller is actually prejudiced by such failure. The Seller
shall have the right to direct, through counsel of its own choosing, the 
defense or settlement of any such claim or proceeding at its own expense. If
the Seller elects to assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the
Purchaser may participate in such defense, but in such case the expenses of the
Purchaser shall be paid by the Purchaser, provided that such defense or 
settlement may be at the Seller's expense if: (i) the Seller shall have agreed 
to the retention of separate counsel; (ii) the Defendants or target of such
claim, assertion, event or proceeding involve more than one indemnified party 
or both the Seller and the Purchaser have concluded that such representation by
the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potentially differing 
interests between them in the conduct in respect of such claim, assertion,
event or proceeding as if there were legal defenses available to the purchaser
that are different from or additional to those available to the seller, or
(iii) the seller shall have failed to employ legal counsel reasonably
acceptable to the purchaser within a reasonable amount of time. The purchaser
shall provide the seller with access to its records and personnel relating to
any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding during normal business hours and
shall otherwise cooperate with the seller in the defense or settlement thereof,
and the seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for all its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. If the seller elects to direct
the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the Purchaser shall not pay, or
permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted
liability unless the Seller consents in writing to such payment or unless the
Seller, subject to the last sentence of this section 9.03(d), withdraws from
the defense of such asserted liability or unless a final judgment from which no
appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the seller is entered against the
purchaser for such liability. If the seller shall fail to defend, or if after
commencing or undertaking any such defense, fail to prosecute or withdraws from
such defense, the Purchaser shall have the right to undertake the defense or
settlement thereof, at the Seller's expense. If the Purchaser assumes the
defense of any such claim or proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.03(d) and
proposes to settle such claim or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon
or to forego any appeal with respect thereto, then the Purchaser shall give the
Seller prompt written notice thereof and the Seller shall have the right to
participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claim
or proceeding.

(e) The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from and
after the Closing, except as provided in Section 2.06, its sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article IX, in Section 2.04, and in Article VII. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Purchaser hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all other rights, claims
and causes of action it (or, after the Closing, any Company or Subsidiary) may
have against the Seller or
<PAGE> 63
58

its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

(f) Except as set forth in this Agreement, the Seller is not
making any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to the
matters contained herein. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein
shall give rise to any right on the part of the Purchaser, after the
consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated hereby, to
rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, except for and subject to the express provisions of Section 2.04,
the Seller shall have no liability under any provision of this Agreement for
and in no event shall the Seller's Threshold Amount be applied to: (i) any
Losses to the extent that such Losses result from or arise out of actions taken
by the Purchaser, any Company, any Subsidiary, or their respective Affiliates
after the Closing Date and (ii) any consequential damages. The Purchaser shall
take and shall cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to take all reasonable
steps to mitigate their Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses.

(h) For purposes of this Section 9.03, in determining whether
there has been a breach of any representation or warranty contained in Article
III, such representations and warranties shall not be qualified by the terms
"Material Adverse Effect" or "Material Adverse Change" or by any phrase using
such terms, except any representations and warranties so qualified in Sections
3.08(g) and 3.14(c).

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article IX,
the Seller shall control (and the Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate at the
Seller's expense in connection therewith) the disposition of the Actions
identified in Section 9.03(a)(i); provided, however, that without the prior
consent of the Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) the
Seller shall not enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority to
settle any such Action if the terms of such settlement require the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates to agree to take any action relating to their respective
businesses, other than the making of cash payments and related ministerial
acts, or to agree to refrain from taking any such action.

Form of Parent Guaranty

GUARANTY

Reference is made to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 
9, 1994 (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), by and between Synetic, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Seller") and Pharmacy Corporation of America, a 
California corporation (the "Purchaser") and a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Beverly Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"). Terms 
used in the Purchase Agreement and not defined herein are used herein as 
therein defined.

1. Guaranty

In consideration of the Seller entering into the Purchase
Agreement with the Purchaser, the Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees
to the Seller that the Purchaser (for purposes of this Guaranty, Purchaser
shall be deemed to include any permitted assignee or successor of Purchaser
under the Stock Purchase Agreement) will fully and punctually perform all of
its obligations under the Purchase Agreement to be performed prior to or at the
Closing, including but not limited to the full and punctual payment and
discharge when due of all of the Purchaser's monetary obligations to the
Seller under the Purchase Agreement due at or prior to the Closing and any
instruments and documents executed and delivered pursuant thereto at or prior
to the Closing, including without limitation, all monetary obligations which
the Purchaser may incur to the Seller pursuant to the Purchase Agreement due at
or prior to the Closing, and with respect of any breach prior to the Closing of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Purchaser set forth
in the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the "Obligations"). This Guaranty is
an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual
payment and performance by the Purchaser of the Obligations and not of their
collectibility only and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that the
Seller first attempt to collect any of the Obligations from the Purchaser or
resort to any security or other means of obtaining payment of any of the
Obligations which the Seller now has or may acquire after the date hereof, or
upon any other contingency whatsoever.

2. The Inducement.

In order to induce the Seller to enter into the Purchase
Agreement, the Guarantor warrants and represents as follows: (i) the Guarantor
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all necessary power and authority to
enter into this Guaranty, to carry out its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) the Guarantor has
<PAGE> 72
2

taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Guaranty; (iii) the Guaranty has been duly executed and
delivered by the Guarantor and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms; (iv)
the Purchaser is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Guarantor; (v) the Guarantor
provides financing and financial, accounting, management and other services for
the Purchaser; and (vi) the financial success of the Purchaser will directly
and substantially benefit the Guarantor and the transactions contemplated by
the Purchase Agreement will be to the mutual benefit of the Purchaser and the
Guarantor. The Guarantor acknowledges that the Seller is relying on the
foregoing representations in entering into the Purchase Agreement.

3. Guarantor's Further Agreements to Pay.

The Guarantor further agrees, as the principal obligor and not
as a guarantor only, to pay to the Seller, all costs and expenses (including
court costs and legal expenses) incurred or expended by the Seller in
connection with the enforcement hereof.

4. Liability of Guarantor and Defenses.

The liability of the Guarantor hereunder in connection with
payment or performance of the Obligations shall be limited to that of the
Purchaser under the Purchase Agreement. If for any reason the Purchaser has a
defense to a claim by the Seller that it failed to discharge any of the
Obligations or has any claim against the Seller which would constitute a
counterclaim, then the Guarantor's obligations shall be subject to and have
the benefit of such defenses or counterclaims; provided, however, that anything
contained in this paragraph 4 to the contrary notwithstanding, the liability of
the Guarantor shall not be discharged, impaired or otherwise affected by any
creditors' rights, bankruptcy, receivership or other insolvency proceedings by
or against the Purchaser or any reorganization, dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the Purchaser, none of which shall constitute a defense or claim
of Purchaser to the benefit of which the Guarantor would be entitled. The
Guarantor further agrees that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or
be reinstated, if at any time, payment of any Obligations, or any part thereof,
is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by Seller upon the bankruptcy or
reorganization of Purchaser or otherwise.

5. The Seller's Freedom to Deal with the Purchaser and Other 
Parties.

The Seller shall be at liberty, without giving notice to or
obtaining the assent of the Guarantor and without relieving the Guarantor of
any liability hereunder, to deal with the Purchaser, and with each other party
who is now or after the date hereof becomes liable in any manner for any of
the Obligations, in such manner as the Seller in its sole discretion deems fit
and to this end the Guarantor gives to the Seller full authority in its sole
discretion to do any or all of the following things: (a) vary the terms and
grant extensions or renewals
<PAGE> 73
3

of any present or future indebtedness or obligations to the Seller of the
Purchaser or any such other party, (b) grant time, waivers and other
indulgences in respect thereto, (c) vary, release, exchange or discharge,
wholly or partially, or delay in or abstain from perfecting and enforcing any
security or guaranty or other means of obtaining payment of any of the
Obligations which the Seller now has or acquires after the date hereof, (d)
accept partial payments from the Pumhaser or any such other party, (e) release
or discharge wholly or partially, any endorser or guarantor, and (f) compromise
or make settlement or other arrangement with the Purchaser of any such other
party.

6. Waivers by Guarantor.

The Guarantor waives notice of acceptance hereof, notice of any
action taken or admitted by the Seller in reliance hereon, and any requirement
that the Seller be diligent or prompt in making demands hereunder or asserting
any other rights of the Seller hereunder.

7. Demands and Notices.

It is further agreed that the undersigned waives any demand for
payment and notice of nonpayment or nonperformance under the Purchase Agreement
and that without notice to the undersigned or without affecting the liability
hereunder, the Seller may enforce rights against the Purhaser and/or may take
or release security and or surrender documents, grant extensions, renewals and
indulgences.

8. Amendments, Waivers, etc.

No provision of this Guaranty can be changed, waived,
discharged, or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by the
Seller and the Guarantor expressly referring to the provision of this Guaranty
to which such instrument relates; and no such waiver shall extend to, affect or
impair any right with respect to any Obligation which is not expressly dealt
with therein. No course of dealing or delay or omissions on the part of the
Seller in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise
be prejudicial thereto.

9. Miscelaneous Provisions.

This Guaranty is intended to be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York and shall inure to the
benefit of the Seller and its successors in title, assigns, and legal
representatives and shall be binding on the Guarantor and on Guarantor's 
successors and assigns. The Guarantor hereby submits to the nonexclusive 
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the federal courts of 
the United States of America located in such State in respect of any dispute 
or other matter
<PAGE> 74
4

arising out of or relating to this Guaranty or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as defense in any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty, that it is not
subject thereto, or that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, or that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is
improper. The Guarantor agrees that final judgment (with all right of appeal
having expired or been waived) against such party in any such action, suit or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any jurisdiction by suit
on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of the recovery arising from such judgment.

10. Termination. This Guaranty and the obligations of the
Guarantor hereunder shall terminate upon consummation of the transactions at
the Closing.

In the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions of
this Guaranty and the provisions of the Purchase Agreement, the provisions of
the Purchase Agreement shall prevail.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to be executed
on its behalf by its officer thereunto duly authorized on the 9th day of
August, 1994.

Company, any Subsidiary or the account debtor has commenced
litigation, shall be adjusted on the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet to
be an amount equal to 80% of the gross amount of such outstanding
accounts receivable referred to in clauses (x) and (y) as included in
the accounts receivable reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet. The
Closing Balance Sheet and the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet are
sometimes referred to herein, collectively as the "Balance Sheets".

(ii) Cooperation. During the preparation of the Balance
Sheets by the Seller and the period of any dispute referred to in
Section 2.02(b)(iv), the Purchaser shall provide the Seller and
Seller's Accountants with reasonable access to the books, records,
facilities and employees of the Company and its successors, if any,
and shall cooperate fully with Seller's Accountants, in each case to
the extent required by the Seller and Seller's Accountants in order to
prepare the Balance Sheets and to investigate the basis for any such
dispute; provided, however, that any such investigation shall be
conducted in such a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with
the operation of the Business. Seller shall provide the Purchaser and
Purchaser's Accountants with reasonable access to the books, records,
facilities and employees of the Seller, and shall cooperate fully with
Purchaser's Accountants, in each case to the extent required in order
for Purchaser and Purchaser's Accountants to review the Balance
Sheets. The Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser and shall use
its reasonable efforts to obtain from the Seller's Accountants copies
of all supporting documents and auditor's work papers used in the
preparation of the Balance Sheets, including, without limitation,
consolidating balance sheets and other consolidating work papers, as
necessary for the Purchaser and Purchaser's Accountants to review the
Balance Sheets, it being understood, however, that Seller's
Accountants will require as a condition to making available any work
papers to any Person a customary hold harmless agreement executed by
such Person in respect thereof.

(iii) Total Consideration Adjustment. Subject to the
limitation set forth in Section 2.02(b)(iv)(C) hereof, within 30
Business Days after the date of receipt by the Purchaser of the
Balance Sheets:

(A) in the event that the Adjusted Net Book Value
reflected on the Reference Balance Sheet exceeds the Adjusted
Net Book Value reflected on the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet
by more than the Designated Amount, the Seller shall pay to
the Purchaser, as an adjustment to the Total Consideration,

<PAGE> 13
8

in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such excess
over the Designated Amount; and

(B) in the event that the Adjusted Net Book Value
reflected on the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet exceeds the
Adjusted Net Book Value reflected on the Reference Balance
Sheet by more than the Designated Amount, the Purchaser shall
pay to the Seller, as an adjustment to the Total
Consideration, in immediately available funds, an amount equal
to such excess over the Designated Amount.

Any such adjustment shall also constitute an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

(iv) Disputes. (A) If not disputed by the Purchaser in
accordance with this Section 2.02(b)(iv), the Adjusted Closing Balance
Sheet delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the parties hereto.

(B) The Purchaser may dispute any amounts reflected on
the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet to the extent that the net effect
of such disputed amounts in the aggregate would be to change the
Adjusted Net Book Value reflected on the Adjusted Closing ]Balance
Sheet by more than the Designated Amount, but only on the basis that
(1) the amounts reflected on the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet (other
than the allowance for doubtful accounts in connection with
outstanding accounts receivable established pursuant to clauses (x)
and (y) of Section 2.02(b)(i)) were not arrived at in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with GAAP as applied in the
preparation of the Reference Balance Sheet, or (2) the amount of any
reserves established in connection with the Adjusted Closing Balance
Sheet (other than the allowance for doubtful accounts in connection
with outstanding accounts receivable established pursuant to clauses
(x) and (y) of Section 2.02(b)(i)) has materially changed from the
amount of such reserves established in connection with the Reference
Balance Sheet as a result of a change in the application of accounting
estimates or principles applied in establishing such reserves;
provided, however, that the Purchaser shall notify the Seller and
Seller's Accountants in writing of each disputed item, specifying the
amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the
basis for such dispute, within 30 Business Days of the Purchaser's
receipt of the Balance Sheets. In the event of such a dispute, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to reconcile
their differences as expeditiously as possible, and any resolution by
them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive
on the parties hereto. If any such resolution by the Purchaser and the
Seller leaves in dispute amounts the net effect of which in the
aggregate would not be to change the Adjusted Net Book Value reflected
on the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet by more than the Designated
Amount, all the amounts remaining in dispute shall then be deemed to
have been resolved in favor of the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet, and
such resolution shall be final, binding and

<PAGE> 14
9

conclusive on the parties hereto. If the Purchaser and the Seller are
unable to reach a resolution with such effect within 10 Business Days
after the Purchaser's notification to the Seller of the disputed
items, the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit the items then
remaining in dispute that the Purchaser shall be entitled to dispute
by the terms of this Section 2.02(b)(iv) for resolution to Ernst &
Young LLP ("Purchaser's Accountants") and Seller's Accountants, who
shall attempt to reconcile the remaining disputed amounts and any
resolution by them as to any such remaining disputed amounts shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. If any such
resolution by Purchaser's Accountants and Seller's Accountants leaves
in dispute amounts the net effect of which in the aggregate would not
be to change the Adjusted Net Book Value reflected on the Adjusted
Closing Balance Sheet by more than the Designated Amount, all the
amounts remaining in dispute shall then be deemed to have been
resolved in favor of the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet delivered by
the Seller to the Purchaser. If Purchaser's Accountants and Seller's
Accountants are unable to reach a resolution with such effect within
20 Business Days after submission to them of such items remaining in
dispute, Purchaser's Accountants and Seller's Accountants shall submit
the items then remaining in dispute for resolution to such other
independent accounting firm of national reputation as may be mutually
acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller (the "Independent
Accounting Firm"), which shall, within 30 Business Days after such
submission, determine, on the basis and subject to the provisions set
forth in the first sentence of this paragraph (B), and report to the
Purchaser and the Seller upon such remaining disputed items, and such
report shall have the legal effect of an arbitration award and shall
be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated
between the Purchaser and the Seller in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm which is unsuccessfully disputed by each
such party (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm)
bears to the total amount of such remaining disputed items so
submitted.

(C) No adjustment to any amount payable by the Seller or
the Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.02(b)(iii) shall be made with
respect to amounts disputed by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section
2.02(b)(iv) unless the net effect of the amounts successfully disputed
by the Purchaser in the aggregate is to change the Adjusted Net Book
Value reflected on the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet by more than the
Designated Amount, in which case such adjustment (upward or downward)
shall only be made in an amount equal to any excess over the
Designated Amount.

(D) Any amount that has been disputed under this Section
2.02(b)(iv) shall be paid by the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case
may be, in immediately available funds, within five Business Days
following the resolution of such dispute and in an amount in
accordance with such resolution.

(E) In acting under this Agreement, Seller's Accountants,
Purchaser's Accountants and the Independent Accounting Finn shall be
entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

(v) Interest. Any payment required to be made by the
Seller or the Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.02(b)(iii) shall bear
interest from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the
date of payment at the rate of interest publicly announced from time
to time by Chemical Bank in New York, New York as its base rate.

a stamp, mark or other notation on any such item that identifies the Business
as a business of the Purchaser (and not the Seller). The Purchaser agrees that
the Seller shall have no responsibility for claims by third parties arising out

Date, except that (a) each such Stock Option shall be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of BEI's common stock ("BEI Common Stock") equal to the
product of the number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Stock Option
immediately prior to the Closing Date multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio
(as hereinafter defined), rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of BEI
Common Stock, (b) the per share exercise price for the shares of BEI's Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of such assumed Stock Option shall be equal to
the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Common
Stock at which such Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Closing Date by the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise
price to the nearest whole cent, and (c) each Stock Option shall become
immediately exercisable, if not already exercisable, and shall remain
exercisable for a period of 90 days upon the involuntary termination of the
employment of the holder of such Stock Option with the Company (other than as a
consequence of cause (as hereinafter defined)) occurring within the one-year
period following the Closing Date or, solely in the case of Mr. Dennis Pyburn,
occurring at any time following the Closing Date. The date of grant shall be
the date on which the Stock Option was originally granted by the Company. BEI
shall (i) reserve for issuance the number of shares of BEI Common Stock that
will become issuable upon the exercise of such Stock Options pursuant to this
Section 6.02 and (ii) as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, issue
to each holder of an outstanding Stock Option a document evidencing the
assumption by BEI of the Company's obligations with respect thereto under this
Section 6.02. Nothing in this Section 6.02 shall affect the schedule of vesting
with respect to the Stock Options to be assumed by BEI as provided in this
Section 6.02. It is the intention of the parties hereto that, subject to
applicable law, the Stock Options assumed by BEI qualify following the Closing
Date as "incentive stock options" (as defined in section 422 of the Code) to
the extent that the Stock Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to
the Closing Date, provided that neither the Purchaser nor BEI shall have any
liability to the
<PAGE> 47
42

Seller, the holder of any such Stock Options or any other Person if such Stock
Options are subsequently determined not to be incentive stock options (as so
defined), as a result of the implementation of this Section 6.02. As used
herein, the "Option Exchange Ratio" means a fraction, the numerator of which is
the quotient determined by dividing the Purchase Price by the number of Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, and the denominator of which is
the closing price per share of BEI Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
on the date immediately preceding the Closing Date. As used in this Section,
"cause" means (i) a felony conviction against the holder of any Stock Options,
(ii) the commission of an act of fraud or embezzlement by such holder against
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (iii) with respect to any such
holder who is a party to an employment agreement with the Company, any other
event constituting "cause" as defined in such employment agreement and, with
respect to any such holder who is not a party to any such employment agreement,
any breach of any agreement not to disclose or solicit to which such holder is
a party.

ARTICLE VII

TAX MATTERS

SECTION 7.01. Indemnity. (a) The Seller agrees to indemnify
the Purchaser and the Company against all Taxes of the Company or of any member
of any affiliated group with which the Company files a consolidated or combined
income tax return, with respect to any period or portion thereof that ends on
or before the Closing Date, in excess of the amount reserved for Taxes in the
Closing Balance Sheet not previously taken into account under Section 706(b)
but excluding such Taxes required to be borne by the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 7.08. The Purchaser shall be responsible for Taxes for which it is not
indemnified pursuant to the first sentence hereof, and, in addition, for Taxes
attributable to any transactions occurring on the Closing Date but after the
Closing that are not in the ordinary course of business, other than Taxes based
on income arising by reason of the Election (as hereinafter defined).

(b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to
a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing
Date (excluding any such Taxes that are taken into account in allocating
liabilities under Section 7.08), the portion of any such Tax that is allocable
to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be: (i) in the
case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts
or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property, real or personal, tangible or intangible (other than conveyances
pursuant to this Agreement, as provided under Section 7.08), deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended on the Closing
Date, and (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets of the Company or otherwise, measured by the level of any item,
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the emit period (or, in the case of
such
<PAGE> 48
43

Taxes determined on an annual basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of such period ending on the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire period.

SECTION 7.02. Returns and Payments. (a) From the date of this
Agreement through and after the Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare and file
or otherwise furnish to the appropriate Person or cause to be prepared and
filed or so furnished) in a timely manner all Tax returns, reports and forms
("Returns") with respect to the Company for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date, and the Purchaser shall do the same for any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date. Returns filed by the Seller and returns
filed by the Purchaser for any taxable period that includes the Closing Date
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices employed by
the Seller with respect to the Company (except to the extent there is no
reasonable basis in law therefor) and, if the Election (as hereinafter defined)
is made, consistent with the Allocation (as hereinafter defined). With respect
to any Return required to be filed with respect to the Company after the
Closing Date and as to which an amount of Tax is allocable to the Seller under
Section 7.01(b), the Purchaser shall provide to the Seller and its
authorized representatives, at least 30 days prior to the due date (including
any extension thereof) for the filing of such Return, a copy of such completed
Return and a statement (together with supporting schedules and information)
certifying the amount at Tax shown on such Return that is allocable to the
Seller pursuant to Section 7.01(b), and the Seller and its authorized
representatives shall have the right to review such Return and statement prior
to the filing of such Return. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to consult and
to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of such
review of such Return and statement.

(b) The Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, when due
and payable all Taxes which accrue with respect to the Company and that
are required to be reported on Returns which are required to be filed by the
Seller pursuant to this subsection (b) to the extent such Taxes exceed the
amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes on the Closing Balance Sheet. The
Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, when due and payable all Taxes which
accrue with respect to the Company for any other taxable period (subject to its
right of indemnification from the Seller for the portion of any Tax period that
includes the Closing Date pursuant to Sections 7.01(a) and (b)). Payment by the
Seller of any amounts due under this Article VII shall be made (i) with respect
to agreed amounts, at least three calendar days before the due date of the
applicable estimated or final Return required to be filed by Purchaser on which
is required to be reported or other amounts for a period ending after the
Closing Date for which the Seller is responsible under Section 7.01(a),
provided, however, that no such payment shall be due from the Seller prior to 
10 Business Days following receipt of written notice from the Purchaser, or 
(ii) within 10 Business Days following either an agreement between the Seller 
and the Purchaser that an indemnity amount is payable or a "determination," 
as defined in section 1313(a) of the Code.
<PAGE> 49
44

SECTION 7.03. Refunds. Any refunds received by the
Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective successors of Taxes in
respect of the Company relating to taxable periods or portions thereof ending
on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Seller, and the
Purchaser shall pay over to the Seller any such refund or the amount of any
such benefit within five Business Days of the earlier of receipt or entitlement
thereto. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "refund" shall
include any overpayment relating to taxable periods or portions thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date that are applied to or otherwise reduce
the Tax liability of the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
successors for any Tax period or portion thereof beginning on or after the
Closing Date. the Purchaser shall, if the Seller so requests, cause the
relevant entity to file for and obtain any refunds or equivalent amounts to
which the Seller is entitled under this Section 7.03. The Purchaser shall
permit the Seller to control the prosecution of any such refund claim, and
shall cause the relevant entity to authorize by appropriate power of attorney
such persons as the Seller shall designate to represent such entity with
respect to such refund claim and the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for
all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith.

SECTION 7.04. Contests. (a) After the Closing, the
Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in writing of the commencement of
any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding and shall also
separately notify the Seller in writing of any demand or claim on the Purchaser
or the Company which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the
lapse of time, would be grounds for indemnification by the Seller under this
Article VII. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent
known to the Purchaser or the Company) describing the asserted Tax liability in
reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document
received from any taxing authority in respect of any such asserted Tax
liability.

(b) The Seller may elect to direct, through counsel of
its own choosing and at its own expense, any audit, claim for refund and
administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted liability with
respect to which indemnity may be sought under this Article VII (any such
audit, claim for refund or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability
being referred to herein as a "Contest"). If the Seller elects to direct the
Contest of an asserted Tax liability, it shall, within 30 calendar days of
receipt of the notice of asserted Tax liability, notify the Purchaser of its
intent to do so, and the Purchaser shall cooperate and shall cause the Company
or its successor to cooperate, at the Seller's expense, in each phase of such
Contest. If the Seller elects not to direct the Contest, fails to notify the
Purchaser of its election as herein provided, or contests its obligation to
indemnify under Section 7.01, the Purchaser or the Company may pay, compromise
or contest, at its own expense such asserted liability; provided, however, that
in such case, neither the Purchaser nor the Company may settle or compromise any
asserted liability over the objection of the Seller and provided, further, that
if Seller does not elect to direct such Contest and does not agree to such
settlement it shall bear the cost of any further Contest by paying to Purchaser
each month, within ten (10) days after rendition by Purchaser of an invoice,
all of
<PAGE> 50
45

Purchaser's out of pocket costs and expenses of prosecuting such Contest. In
any event, each of the Purchaser (or the Company) and the Seller may
participate, at its own expense, in the Contest. If the Seller chooses to
direct the Contest, the Purchaser shall promptly empower and shall cause the
Company or its successor promptly to empower (by power of attorney and such
other documentation as may be appropriate) such representatives of the Seller
as Seller may designate to represent the Purchaser or the Company or its
successor in the Contest insofar as the Contest involves an asserted Tax
liability for which the Seller would be liable under this Article VII.

SECTION 7.05. Tax Benefits. The Purchaser agrees to pay to
the Seller the benefit received by the Company or the Purchaser from the use in
any Tax period of a carryforward of a Tax Asset (as hereinafter defined) from a
taxable period or portion thereof on or prior to the Closing Date. Such benefit
shall be considered to equal the excess of (i) the amount of Taxes that would
have been payable by the Company or the Purchaser in the absence of such
carryforward over (ii) the amount of Taxes actually payable by the Company or
the Purchaser. Payment of such amount shall be made within five Business Days
of filing the applicable Returns for the period to which the Tax Asset is
carried forward. If, subsequent to any such payment by the Purchaser to the
Seller, there shall be a final determination resulting from an audit which
results in a reduction of the Tax Asset so carried forward, the Seller shall
promptly repay to the Purchaser any amount exceeding that which would have been
payable to the Seller pursuant to the preceding sentence had the amount of the
benefit been calculated taking into account such determination, together with
an amount equal to any interest and penalties payable by the Purchaser as a
result of such determination. "Tax Asset" means any net operating loss, net
capital loss, investment tax credit, investment or other tax credit or
charitable deduction or any other Tax attribute (including deductions or
credits relating to alternative minimum taxes) which is allocable under
applicable State or local (but not federal) Tax law to the Company.

SECTION 7.06. Certain Audit Adjustments. (a) If an audit
adjustment, claim for refund or amended return ("Adjustment") after the date
hereof shall both increase a State or local (but not federal) Tax liability
which is allocated to the Seller under Section 7.01 (or reduce losses or
credits otherwise available to the Seller) for a period ending on or before the
Closing Date and decrease a Tax liability of the Purchaser or the Company for a
period ending after the Closing Date, then, when and to the extent that the
Purchaser (or the Company) derives a benefit from such decrease (through a
reduction of Taxes, refund of Taxes paid or credit against Taxes due), the
Purchaser shall promptly pay to the Seller an amount equal to the amount of
such refund, reduction or credit to the extent the Seller has not previously
been compensated for such benefit under Section 7.01(b). Similarly, if an
Adjustment shall both decrease a Tax liability which is allocated to the Seller
under Section 7.01 for a period ending on or before the Closing Date and
increase the Tax liability of the Purchaser or the Company (or reduce losses or
credits otherwise available to any such entity) for a period ending after the
Closing Date, then, when and to the extent that the Seller derives a benefit
from such decrease (through a refund or reduction of Taxes paid or credit
<PAGE> 51
46

against Taxes due), the Seller shall promptly pay to the Purchaser the amount
of such refund, reduction or credit up to the Purchaser's correlative increase
in Tax liability for the period ending after the Closing Date.

(b) If Taxes imposed on the Seller with respect to the
Company for taxable periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date are increased as the result of an adjustment on an audit or other
examination by a taxing authority, the Purchaser shall promptly pay the Seller
an amount equal to such increase in Taxes, to the extent that such increase
does not exceed the amount reserved for Taxes in the Closing Balance Sheet not
previously taken into account under Section 7.01.

SECTION 7.07. Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The
Seller and the Purchaser will provide each other, and the Purchaser will cause
the Company to provide the Seller, with such cooperation and information as the
Seller or the Purchaser reasonably may request in filing any Return, amended
Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a
refund of Taxes, or participating in or conducting any audit or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation shall include providing copies
of relevant Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules
and related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by taxing authorities, but in no event shall the Seller be
required to disclose to the Purchaser any information relating to the
operations of the Seller other than the Company. The Seller and the Purchaser
shall make their respective employees, and the Purchaser shall cause the
Company to make the Company's employees, available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide explanations of any documents or information provided
hereunder. The Seller and the Purchaser will retain, and the Purchaser will
cause the Company to retain, all Returns, schedules and work papers and all
material records or other documents relating to Tax matters of the Company for
its taxable period first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior
taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Returns and other documents
relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified by the other
party in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods or (ii) six
years following the due date (without extension) for such Returns. After such
time, the Purchaser shall provide to the Seller, at least 90 calendar days
prior to the disposal of any of such books and records, written notice to such
effect, and the Seller shall be given an opportunity, at its cost and expense,
to remove and retain all or any part of such books and records as the Seller
may select. Any information obtained under this Section 7.07 shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding.

SECTION 7.08. Conveyance Taxes. The Purchaser agrees to
assume liability for, and to hold the Seller harmless against, any sales, use,
transfer, stamp, stock transfer, real property transfer, and value added taxes,
any transfer, registration, recording or other fees, and any similar Taxes
incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall file
such applications and documents as shall permit any such Tax to be assessed and
<PAGE> 52
47

paid on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with any available pre-sale
filing procedure.

SECTION 7.09. Miscellaneous. (a) The Seller and the
Purchaser agree to treat all payments made by either such party to or for the
benefit of the other such party (including any payments to the Company) under
this Article VII, under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement, and for
any misrepresentations or breach of warranties or covenants as adjustments to
the Purchase Price or as capital contributions for Tax purposes, and that such
agreed treatment shall govern for Tax purposes hereof.

(b) Payments by the Seller pursuant to this Article VII
shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after
deducting therefrom or paying to the Seller (i) any indemnity, contribution or
other similar payment recovered by Purchaser from any third party with respect
thereto and (ii) any reserves provided for the item in question on the Closing
Balance Sheet.

(c) For purposes of this Article VII, the terms the
"Purchaser" and the "Seller," respectively, shall include each member of the
affiliated group of corporations of which it is or becomes a member.

(d) The Seller shall cause any tax-sharing agreements or
arrangements with the Company to be terminated as of the Closing Date, with no
amounts to be payable after the Closing in respect of such agreements or
arrangements other than those payable in respect of current tax payable
accounts or as provided in this Agreement.

SECTION 7.10. Section 338(h)(10) Election. (a) The
Purchaser and the Seller shall (i) cooperate in the preparation of an election
under section 338(h)(10) of the Code ("Election") with respect to the purchase
of the Shares hereunder and (ii) jointly file such Election with the Purchaser
on a timely basis and comply with the rules and regulations applicable to such
Election. The Seller and the Purchaser shall, where possible, also make such
election under applicable State or local corporate income or franchise tax law.

(b) The Purchaser shall determine the value of the
tangible and intangible assets of the affected Companies and shall timely
provide the Seller with an allocation of the Purchaser's "adjusted grossed-up
basis" in the Shares (within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations under
section 338 of the Code) to such assets (the "Allocation"); provided, however,
that an officer of the Purchaser shall certify to the Seller in writing that
the Allocation is reasonable. The Allocation shall be binding upon the
Purchaser and the Seller for purposes of allocating the "deemed selling price"
(within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations) among the assets of the
Company and the affected subsidiaries (the "Companies"). If the Allocation is
later adjusted or contested upon audit, settlement or litigation, the Purchaser
shall indemnify the Seller for any costs (including, without limitation,
professional fees) and penalties (but not tax deficiencies or interest)
attributable to
<PAGE> 53
48

such adjusted Allocation or contest; provided, however, that the Seller shall
not incur any professional fees without the Purchaser's consent which shall not
be unreasonably withheld and the Purchaser shall be primarily responsible for
the contest.

understood that the sole remedy for breach thereof shall be pursuant to Article
VII, as the case may be). Anything in Section 9.01 to the contrary
notwithstanding, no claim may be asserted nor may any action be commenced
against the Purchaser for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein, unless written notice of such claim or action is
received by the Purchaser describing in detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the date
on which the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such
claim or action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 9.01,
irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have
occurred before or after such date.

(b) No claim may be made against the Purchaser for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.02 with respect to any individual
item of liability or damage, unless such item exceeds U.S.$25,000 and unless
the aggregate of all such liabilities and damages of the Indemnified Parties
with respect to this Section 9.02 shall exceed U.S.$1,O00,000, and the
Purchaser shall not be required to pay or be liable for the first
U.S.$1,000,000 in aggregate amount of any such liabilities and damages. No
Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this Section 9.02 with
respect to any individual item of liability or damage if the aggregate of all
liabilities and damages of the Indemnified Parties for which the Indemnified
Parties have received indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.02
<PAGE> 58
53

shall have exceeded an amount equal to 100% of the Total Consideration. For the
purposes of this Section 9.02(b), in computing such individual or aggregate
amounts of claims, the amount of each claim shall be deemed to be an amount (i)
net of any Tax benefit to the Indemnified Parties, (ii) net of any insurance
proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recovered by
the Indemnified Parties from any third party with respect thereto and (iii)
without duplication of any adjustments to the Total Consideration paid pursuant
to Section 2.02 with respect to the subject matter in dispute.

(c) Payments by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.02(a)
shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after
deducting therefrom (i) any Tax benefit to the Indemnified Parties, (ii) any
insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
recovered by the Indemnified Parties from any third party with respect thereto
and (iii) any adjustments to the Total Consideration paid to the Seller
pursuant to Section 2.02 with respect to the matter in dispute. A Tax benefit
will be considered to be recognized by the Indemnified Party for purposes of
this Section 9.02 in the tax period in which the indemnity payment occurs, and
the amount of the Tax benefit shall be determined by assuming that the
Indemnified Party is in the maximum applicable statutory tax bracket after any
deductions or other allowances reportable with respect to a payment hereunder.

(d) An Indemnified Party shall give the Purchaser written
notice of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding by or in respect of a third
party of which an Indemnified Party has knowledge concerning any liability or
damage as to which such Indemnified Party may request indemnification hereunder
or any liability or damage as to which the U.S.$1,O00,000 amount referred to in
Section 9.02(b) may be applied as soon as practicable and in any event within
30 days after the time that the Indemnified Party learns of such claim,
assertion, event or proceeding, provided, however, that the failure to so
notify the Purchaser shall not affect the Indemnified Party's rights to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Purchaser is prejudiced
by such failure or such notice is given after the date specified in the last
sentence of Section 9.02(a). The Purchaser shall have the right to direct,
through counsel of its own choosing, the defense or settlement of any such
claim or proceeding at its own expense. If the Purchaser elects to assume the
defense of any such claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party may participate
in such defense, but in such case the expenses of the Indemnified Party shall
be paid by the Indemnified Party, provided that such expenses may be at the
Purchaser's expense if (i) the Purchaser shall have agreed to the retention of
separate counsel, or (ii) counsel for the Purchaser shall have advised the
Purchaser and such Indemnified Party in writing that such representation by the
same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual differing interests between
them in the conduct in respect of such claim, assertion, event or proceeding.
The Indemnified Party shall provide the Purchaser with access to its records
and personnel relating to any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding during
normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with the Purchaser in the
defense or settlement thereof, and the Purchaser shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection
therewith. If
<PAGE> 59
54

the Purchaser elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or
demand arising from such asserted liability, unless the Purchaser consents in
writing to such payment or unless the Purchaser, subject to the last sentence
of this Section 9.02(d), withdraws from the defense of such asserted liability,
or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of
the Purchaser is entered against the Indemnified Party for such liability. If
the Purchaser shall fail to defend, or if, after commencing or undertaking any
such defense, the Purchaser fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense or
settlement thereof, at the Purchaser's expense. If the Indemnified Party
assumes the defense of any such claim or proceeding pursuant to this Section
9.02(d) and proposes to settle such claim or proceeding prior to a final
judgment thereon or to forego appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified
Party shall give the Purchaser prompt written notice thereof and the Purchaser
shall have the right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the
defense of such claim or proceeding.

(e) The Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that,
except as provided in Section 2.02(b), its sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
IX and in Article VII. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Seller hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the Purchaser or its
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement and arising under or based upon any
Federal, state or local statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation (including,
without limitation, any such rights, claims or causes of action arising under
or based upon common law or otherwise).

(f) Except as set forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser
is not making any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect
to the matters contained herein. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of the
Indemnified Party, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the
Shares contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(g) The Purchaser shall have no liability under any
provision of this Agreement for any liabilities and damages to the extent that
such liabilities and damages relate to actions taken by the Seller or its
Affiliates before the Closing Date, and in no event shall the Purchaser be
liable for consequential damages. The Seller shall take all reasonable steps to
mitigate all such liabilities and damages upon and after becoming aware of any
event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to such liabilities and
damages.

(h) For purposes of this Section 9.02, in determining
whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty contained in
Article IV, such representations
<PAGE> 60
55

and warranties shall not be qualified by the terms "Material Adverse Effect" or
"Material Adverse Change" or by any phrase using such terms.

SECTION 9.03. Indemnification by the Seller. (a) The Seller
agrees, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement and
without gross-up for Taxes, to indemnify the Purchaser and its Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and
assigns (as used in this Section 9.03, each an "Indemnified Party") against,
and to hold them harmless from, all liabilities of and damages to the Purchaser
arising out of (i) the material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Seller herein (other than in Section 3.18 and
Article VII, it being understood that the sole remedy for breach thereof shall
be pursuant to Section 3.18 and Article VII, as the case may be), (ii) any
legal or administrative proceeding commenced against the Company or any
Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date, (iii) any Action commenced by a
Governmental Authority against the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary on
or after the Closing Date through the date 18 months after the Closing Date
and to the extent arising out of facts and circumstances existing or occurring
prior to the Closing Date relating to the ownership or operation of the
Business, (iv) any Action commenced by any Person (other than a Governmental
Authority) against the Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary on or after
the Closing Date through the date 18 months after the Closing Date and to the
extent arising out of facts and circumstances existing or occurring prior to
the Closing Date relating to the ownership or operation of The Business, and
(v) any failure by The Company to satisfy all of the obligations referred to
in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of Section 2.03(e). Anything in Section
9.01 to the contrary notwithstanding, no claim may be asserted nor may any
action be commenced against the Seller for (x) breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, unless written notice of
such claim or action is received by the Seller describing in reasonable detail
the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim
or action on or prior to the date on which the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on which such claim or action is based ceases to survive
as set forth in Section 9.01, irrespective of whether the subject matter of
such claim or action shall have occurred before or after such date or (y) any
claim by the Purchaser against the Seller arising out of clause (iii) or (iv)
of the immediately preceding sentence, unless written notice of such claim is
received by the Seller describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim on or prior to
the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date.

(b) No claim may be made against the Seller for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.03(a)(i) or 9.03(a)(iv) with respect to
any individual item of liability or damage, unless such item exceeds
U.S.$25,000 and unless the aggregate of all such liabilities and damages of the
Indemnified Parties with respect to such Section 9.03(a)(i) and 9.03(a)(iv)
shall exceed U.S.$1,000,000, and the Seller shall not be required to pay or be
liable for the first U.S.$1,000,000 in aggregate amount of any such
liabilities and damages. No Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to
Section 9.03(a) with respect to any individual item of liability or damage if
the aggregate of all liabilities and damages of the
<PAGE> 61
56

Indemnified Parties for which the Indemnified Parties have received
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.03 shall have exceeded an amount
equal to 100% of the Total Consideration. For the purposes of this Section
9.03(b), in computing such individual or aggregate amounts of claims, the
amount of each claim shall be deemed to be an amount (i) net of any Tax benefit
to the Indemnified Parties, (ii) net of any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recovered by the Indemnified
Parties from any third party with respect thereto, (iii) net of any reserves
provided for the item in question in the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet and
(iv) without duplication of any adjustments to the Total Consideration paid
pursuant to Section 2.02 with respect to the subject matter in dispute.

(c) Payments by the Seller pursuant to Section 9.03(a)
shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after
deducting therefrom (i) any Tax benefit to the Indemnified Parties, (ii) any
insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
recovered by the Indemnified Parties from any third party with respect thereto,
(iii) any reserves provided for the item in question in the Adjusted Closing
Balance Sheet and (iv) any adjustments to the Total Consideration paid pursuant
to Section 2.02 with respect to the subject matter in dispute. A Tax benefit
will be considered to be recognized by an Indemnified Party for purposes of
this Section 9.03 in the tax period in which the indemnity payment occurs, and
the amount of the Tax benefit shall be determined by assuming that such
Indemnified Party is in the maximum applicable statutory tax bracket after any
deductions or other allowances reportable with respect to a payment hereunder.

(d) An Indemnified Party shall give the Seller written
notice of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding by or in respect of a third
party of which such Indemnified Party has knowledge concerning any liability or
damage as to which such Indemnified Party may request indemnification hereunder
or any liability or damage as to which the U.S.$1,000,000 amount referred to in
Section 9.03(b) may be applied as soon as practicable and in any event within
30 days after the time that the Indemnified Party learns of such claim,
assertion, event or proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so notify
the Seller shall not affect the Indemnified Party's rights to indemnification
hereunder except to the extent that the Seller is prejudiced by such failure or
such notice is given after the date specified in the last sentence of Section
9.03(a). The Seller shall have the right to direct, through counsel of its own
choosing, the defense or settlement of any such claim or proceeding at its own
expense. If the Seller elects to assume the defense of any such claim or
proceeding, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense, but in such
case the expenses of the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnified
Party, provided that such expenses may be at the Seller's expense if (i) the
Seller shall have agreed to the retention of separate counsel, or (ii) counsel
for the Seller shall have advised the Seller and the Indemnified Party in
writing that such representation by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual differing interests between them in the conduct in respect of such
claim, assertion, event or proceeding. The Indemnified Party shall provide the
Seller with
<PAGE> 62
57

access to its records and personnel relating to any such claim, assertion,
event or proceeding during normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate
with the Seller in the defense or settlement thereof, and the Seller shall
reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
in connection therewith. If the Seller elects to direct the defense of any
such claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be
paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability
unless the Seller consents in writing to such payment or unless the Seller,
subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.03(d), withdraws from the
defense of such asserted liability or unless a final judgment from which no
appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Seller is entered against the
Indemnified Party for such liability. If the Seller shall fail to defend, or if
after commencing or undertaking any such defense, the Seller fails to
prosecute or withdraws from such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the Seller's expense.
If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any such claim or proceeding
pursuant to this Section 9.03(d) and proposes to settle such claim or
proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego any appeal with
respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Seller prompt
written notice thereof and the Seller shall have the right to participate in
the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claim or proceeding.

(e) Anything in this Article IX to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Seller shall have no obligation under this Article IX to
indemnify any Indemnified Party with respect to any matter that (i) was the
subject of a dispute with respect to the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet
pursuant to the terms of Section 2.02(b) but did not result in an adjustment
to the Total Consideration pursuant to such Section 2.02(b), or (ii) could have
been the subject matter of a dispute with respect to the Adjusted Closing
Balance Sheet pursuant to the terms of Section 2.02(b) but was not asserted
by the Purchaser regardless of whether any such dispute could have involved an
amount greater or less than the Designated Amount. Any such matter shall be
disregarded for all purposes of this Section 9.03.

(f) The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that,
except as provided in Section 2.02(b), its sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
IX and in Article VII. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Purchaser hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it (or, after the Closing, the Company)
may have against the Seller or its officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives and Affiliates relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement and arising under or based upon any Federal, state or local statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation (including, without limitation, any such
rights, claims or causes of action arising under or based upon common law or
otherwise).

(g) Except as set forth in this Agreement, the Seller is
not making any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to
the matters contained herein. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
no breach of any representation, warranty,
<PAGE> 63
58

covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part
of the Purchaser, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares
contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(h) The Seller shall have no liability under any
provision of this Agreement for any liabilities and damages to the extent that
such liabilities and damages relate to actions taken by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates, including, without limitation, the Company and the Subsidiaries,
after the Closing Date, and in no event shall the Seller be liable for 
consequential damages. The Purchaser shall take, and shall cause the Company
and the Subsidiaries to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate all such
liabilities and damages upon and after becoming aware of any event which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to such liabilities and damages,
including, without limitation, pursuing or authorizing the Seller to pursue on
the Purchaser's, the Company's or any Subsidiary's behalf, any claim the
Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary may have against third parties which
is related to the matter with respect to which the notice or claim for
indemnification may be made or, at the Purchaser's option, assigning any such
claim that may be assigned to the Seller. In connection with the pursuit of any
such claim against a third party or the assignment of any such claim to the
Seller, the Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary
to) cooperate with the Seller, and execute and deliver such documents and other
papers and take such further actions as may be reasonably requested by the
Seller to carry out the provisions of this paragraph.

(i) For purposes of this Section 9.03, in determining
whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty contained in
Article III, such representations and warranties shall not be qualified by the
terms "Material Adverse Effect" or "Material Adverse Change" or by any phrase
using such terms.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Article IX, the Seller shall control (and the Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate at the Seller's expense in connection therewith) the disposition of
the Actions identified in Section 9.03(a) (ii), (iii) and (iv); provided, 
however, that without the prior consent of the Purchaser, the Seller shall not
enter into any agreements with any Governmental Authority to settle any such
Action if the terms of such settlement require the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (i) to agree to take any action relating to their respective
businesses (other than the making of cash payments and related ministerial
acts), or (ii) to agree to refrain from taking any such action (other than
refraining from future violations so long as the Seller does not also agree to
the imposition of any specified penalties on the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates in the event of the occurrence of any such future violations).
