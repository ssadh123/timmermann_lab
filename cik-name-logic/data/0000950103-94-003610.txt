ITEM 5 Other Events

C-TEC Cable Systems, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of C-TEC Corporation, has
entered into a Merger Agreement (the "Merger Agreement")
with Twin County Trans Video, Inc. ("Twin County")
and Bark Lee Yee, Stella C. Yee, Susan C. Yee, Raymond C. Yee and Kenneth C.
Yee, shareholders of Twin County, and Robert Tallman,
as trustee of a trust holding certain shares of Twin County common stock.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Twin County will merge with and
into C-TEC Cable Systems of Pennsylvania, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary
of C-TEC Cable Systems, Inc. The transaction is subject to regulatory
approval and certain other conditions.

The aggregate consideration for the acquisition of all the capital stock of
Twin County and for certain related noncompetition agreements will be cash
of approximately $47.5 million, a promissory note of $4 million, and
exchangeable preferred stock of C-TEC Cable Systems, Inc. with an aggregate
liquidation preference of $52 million (the "Cable Preferred Stock"). The
Cable Preferred Stock consists of Cable Preferred Stock Series A shares
with a total liquidation preference of $41 million (the "Cable Preferred
Stock Series A") and Cable Preferred Stock Series B shares with a total
liquidation preference of $11 million (the "Cable Preferred Stock Series
B"). The cash portion of the purchase price is subject to certain
adjustments, which are not estimated to be material, based on the excess of
Twin County's liabilities over its cash balance at the closing date.

The dividend rate on each series of the Cable Preferred Stock is 5% per
annum of the liquidation preference, and unpaid dividends are cumulative.
Beginning three years from the closing date of the acquisition and expiring
ten years from such closing date, the holders of Cable Preferred Stock
Series A acting unanimously may exchange their Cable Preferred Stock with
C-TEC Corporation for 1,171,428 shares of common stock of C-TEC Corporation
(the "Series A Exchange Shares") and the holders of Cable Preferred Stock
Series B acting unanimously may exchange their Cable Preferred Stock with
C-TEC Corporation for 285,714 shares of common stock of C-TEC Corporation
(the "Series B Exchange Shares"). During the same time period, C-TEC
Corporation may elect to acquire all, but not less than all of either or
both series of Cable Preferred Stock as follows: (i) if the market value
of the Exchange Shares for such series at the time of election is greater
than or equal to the aggregate liquidation preference for such series, the
consideration shall be the Exchange Shares for such series and (ii) if the
market value of the Exchange Shares for such series at the time of election
is less than the aggregate liquidation preference for such series, the
consideration shall be, at the holders' option, either (x) an amount of
cash equal to the aggregate liquidation preference for such series or (y)
the Exchange Shares for such series. If at the end of such period, neither
the holders of the Cable Preferred Stock nor C-TEC Corporation has made any
of the elections described above, then the holders of the Cable Preferred
Stock acting unanimously may elect to sell such stock to C-TEC Corporation
for $52 million.

Twin County provides cable television service to approximately 74,000
subscribers in the Greater Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, situated within
75 miles of the New York, Philadelphia, and Wilkes-Barre metropolitan areas.

Information with respect to Twin County and the historical financial

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

Twin County Trans Video, Inc.
5508 Nor-Bath Boulevard
Northampton, Pennsylvania

Gentlemen:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Twin County Trans Video,
Inc. as of October 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related statements of income,
retained earnings, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Twin County Trans Video, Inc.
as of October 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in Note X to the financial statements, the Company has restated
the financial statements for the years ending October 31, 1993 and 1992.

Very truly yours,

Adams & Associates, P.C.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
October 31, 1993 and 1992

FOOTNOTE I - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Twin County Trans Video, Inc. (the Company), is a Pennsylvania C Corporation.
Its financial statements are reported on the accrual basis. The Company uses
an October 31 fiscal year for both financial statements and tax reporting.

The Company supplies cable television services, including local origination
television programming, to the Greater Lehigh Valley area. Receivables
are based over a concentrated geographic and homogeneous grouping.

The Company adheres to accounting policies and procedures set forth in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 51, Financial Reporting by
Cable Television Companies.

The Company maintains money market accounts at financial institutions over the
F.D.I.C. insured limits.

Cash Flows

For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of six months or less to be
temporary cash equivalents.

Inventory

Inventory is carried at lower of average cost or market and consists of
material, parts and other various items regularly used in the construction of
Cable Television facilities.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is carried at original cost less accumulated
depreciation. Trunk and distribution lines reflect original cost of
construction, including payroll and related employee benefits and other
general administrative costs. Removal of these lines is based on average
cost.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method based on estimated
useful lives of various depreciable property as follows:

Building and improvements 15 - 40 years
Cable lines and equipment 7 - 10 years
Automobiles 5 years
Other equipment 10 years

Gain or loss is recognized on major retirements and dispositions. Major
replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repairs of property, plant and
equipment and minor replacements and renewals are expensed as incurred.

Amortization

The Company amortizes the cost of drop lines and franchises over their useful
life with a maximum life of 40 years. The Company also amortizes the cost to
originate the line of credit over the life of the loan.

Cash Surrender Value - Officers Life Insurance

At October 31, 1993 and 1992, the C.S.V. of Officers Life Insurance policies
amount to $1,987,553.79 and $1,492,415.45 respectively. The increase in cash
value each year is netted against the premiums paid and included in General
Business expense. The policies' beneficiaries assigned to the Company the
cash value of the policies under a revocable limited assignment.

Other assets consist of prepaid fees under apartment service contracts and
equipment maintenance agreements.

FOOTNOTE IV

Income Taxes

Effective November 1, 1992 the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). The
cumulative effect on prior years of the change to this new standard is
reported in prior years' financial statements that have been restated to apply
provisions of SFAS 109.

The adoption of SFAS 109 changes the Company's method of accounting for income
taxes from the deferred approach to an asset and liability approach. The
asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets and
liabilities.

Income Taxes cont'd

The Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Consists of the Following:

1993 1992
__________ __________
Current payable -
Federal $ 343,992 $ 539,303
State 140,510 159,927
__________ __________
Total Current 484,502 699,230

Deferred, net -

__________ __________
Total Deferred (198,639) (221,280)
Provision for income taxes $ 285,863 $ 477,950
========== ==========

Temporary differences and carryforwards which give rise to a significant
portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities at October 31, 1993 are as
follows:

Deferred Tax Deferred Tax
Assets Liability
__________ __________
Benefit plans $ 138,994 $ 0
Property, plant and equipment 0 1,232,926
Intangible assets 99,510 0
Customer prepaids and receivables 1,134,334 0
__________ __________

Subtotal 1,372,838 1,232,926
Valuation allowance 0 0
__________ __________

Total Deferred Taxes $1,372,838 $1,232,926
========== ==========

In the opinion of management, based on the future reversal of existing taxable
temporary differences, primarily depreciation, and its expectations of future
operating results, the Company will realize substantially all of its deferred
tax assets.

Reconciliations of the differences between income taxes computed at federal
statutory tax rates and provisions for income taxes are as follows:

1993 1992
__________ __________
Income taxes computed at federal statutory
tax rate $ 207,985 $ 370,455
State tax provisions 103,236 117,624

In 1993 and 1992, the provision for deferred income taxes of $(198,639) and
$(221,280), respectively, were provided for significant timing differences in
recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes
which consisted primarily of timing differences between book and tax
depreciation.

At October 31, 1993, the cumulative minimum tax credit was $5,535. This
amount can be carried forward indefinitely to reduce regular tax liabilities
that exceed the AMT in future years.

FOOTNOTE V

Long Term Debt

In August of 1992, the Company entered into a financial arrangement with First
Union National Bank of North Carolina. An $18,600,000 reducing revolver
credit line with interest at prime plus .5% was established at this time. At
October 31, 1993, the outstanding loan amount was $11,940,991.11 all of which
is considered long term with a total commitment of $17,300,000 at October 31,
1993 and $18,350,000 at October 31, 1992. Payout of the remaining balance is
based upon a pre-determined schedule that is based upon the balance
outstanding under the line. At the present level, no repayment of principal
is presently due. The line is collateralized by inventory, accounts
receivable, and fixed assets of the Company. In addition, the Company has
available a $2,500,000 standby letter of credit facility with First Union
National Bank of North Carolina.

The retirement of debt is as follows:

of minimum operating cash flow.

remaining balance of loan procurement fees of $143,974.31.

FOOTNOTE VI

Retirement Plans

The Company's defined benefit pension plan covers the majority of its
employees. Aggregate pension costs for fiscal 1993 and 1992 were $168,964 and
$177,985 respectively. The plan provides for benefits based on compensation
earned during the five years of service immediately preceding retirement. The
Company's actuarial cost method for its plan is the unit benefit cost method.
The plan has adopted a fiscal year ending February 28. Actuarial assumptions
and calculations are performed annually. Balances at October 31 are estimates
derived by utilization of straight line amortization.

The Company's funding policy for retirement plans is consistent with the
relevant governmental and tax regulations. The pre-retirement rate of return
is 8% and post retirement return is 7%. An interest cost of 8% was used in
the actuarial calculations of the projected benefit obligation. The
compensation rate increase was calculated at 1% each year.

Plan assets consist primarily of pooled funds under management by an insurance
company.

Pension cost for the defined benefit plan of the Company includes the
following components:

1993 1992
__________ __________

Service cost-benefits earned during the year $ 114,573 $ 15,157

Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(a) Adjustments to record the disposition of certain cellular
properties. The adjustments assume that the sales proceeds, net of certain
escrow reserves and holdbacks discussed below and net of income taxes
estimated to be payable after the utilization of certain net operating loss
carryforwards, are retained as temporary cash investments. The escrow
reserves and holdbacks of approximately $16 million are included in other
current assets. The adjustments assume the realization of deferred tax
assets of approximately $21 million, representing the tax benefits
associated with the utilization of approximately $54.7 million federal net
operating loss carryforwards and approximately $18.9 million state net
operating loss carryforwards. The final resolution of the Company's
current IRS examination may impact the utilization of net operating loss
carryforwards. Adjustments also assume a reduction in a related valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately $6 million. An after-
tax gain of approximately $71 million was assumed to be recognized on the
sale. Certain working capital adjustments to the sales price to be made
ninety days after closing were estimated to be approximately $7 million
based on the historical asset and liability balances at June 30, 1994.

(b) Adjustments to reflect the pending acquisition of Twin
County. The adjustments assume that the consideration for the acquisition
will be cash of approximately $47.5 million, a promissory note of $4
million, and exchangeable preferred stock of C-TEC Cable Systems, Inc. with
a liquidation preference of $52 million (the "Cable Preferred Stock"). The
purchase price will reflect the fair value of the consideration for the
pending acquisition; such fair value may differ from assumptions used in the
preparation of the pro forma statements. The purchase price has been
allocated based on assumptions of the fair values of the tangible
and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

(c) Adjustments to eliminate the historical results of operations of
certain cellular properties. Corporate overhead allocated to cellular
operations has not been eliminated because that overhead would have been
reallocated to other business segments.

(d) The Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations exclude a
non-recurring after-tax gain of approximately $71 million expected to be
realized on the sale, and the reversal of a valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets of approximately $6 million.

(e) Twin County has a fiscal year ending October 31.
Twin County's most recent interim historical balance sheet as of July 31,
1994 is included in the pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet. Twin
County's statement of operations for the year ended October 31, 1993 is
included in the pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 1993. Twin County's results of operations for the
six months ended April 30, 1994 which are included in the pro forma condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 1994
were derived from its most recent interim historical statement of operations
for the nine months ended July 31, 1994, as follows:

interest payments otherwise payable under the Notes;

(4) The cash portion of the Consideration set forth in Section

noncurrent or otherwise) as determined in accordance with GAAP

adjustments pursuant to Sections 2.7(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) as

entitled to have access to the Company's accountants' work papers
and other relevant data and documentation. Within ninety (90)
days after Closing, a final computation of all Consideration
Adjustments (other than any Rate Refund Obligations not yet
determined) pursuant to Section 2.7(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5)
shall be determined by the Company's accountant. In connection
with the foregoing, the Shareholders shall provide to C-TEC a
balance sheet as of the Closing Date and a detailed statement of
operations for the month used in calculating Monthly Operating
Revenues, all prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as
otherwise discussed in Section 3.5). Upon receipt of such
information, C-TEC will have sixty (60) days to review and
evaluate such information. If C-TEC objects to the results of
such accounting, C-TEC shall notify the Company's accountants and
Shareholders of its objection in writing (the "Objection Notice")
prior to the end of such sixty (60) day period. In such event,
C-TEC and the Shareholders shall endeavor to resolve the open
issues. If such issues are not resolved within thirty (30) days
after the receipt of the Objection Notice, the unresolved issues
shall be submitted to an independent public accountant jointly
selected by C-TEC and the Shareholders (the "Independent
Accountant"). The Independent Accountant shall be a "Big Six"
accounting firm (or other firm if agreed to by both parties) and
shall not have provided any services to the Company, C-TEC or any
of the Shareholders for the prior five (5) years. As soon as
reasonably possible, the Independent Accountant shall deliver a
written report to C-TEC and the Shareholders setting forth the
final determination of the Consideration Adjustments. The
decision of the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding
on C-TEC and the Shareholders. The fees and expenses of any
Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by the Shareholders
and C-TEC. Within three (3) Business Days after determination of
the Consideration Adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.7, the
Consideration shall be adjusted in accordance with this Section
2.7 by a transfer of cash from the Company to the Shareholders or
from the Shareholders to the Company, as appropriate. Any Rate
Refund Obligations that are finally determined after the time of
these post-Closing Consideration Adjustments shall be applied as a
set-off to the repayment obligations under the Notes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, there shall be no
decrease to the Consideration by virtue of Section 2.7, or
indemnification obligation for claim made for breach of warranty
or representation (except those relating to Taxes, Rate Refund
Obligations, or environmental representations under Sections 3.25
and 3.29) except to the extent that the total of such claims and
adjustments exceeds $4,680,000 (the "Consideration Threshold").

required, Subsidiary shall join in applications to the FCC and the Franchising
Authorities identified on Schedule 9.1 requesting each such governmental
authority's approvals and authorizations of the transactions contemplated by

except that each party shall bear its own legal, accounting, and other
professional fees related thereto.

9.2. Necessity for FCC and Franchising Authority Approvals. The
obligations of the Company, C-TEC, Subsidiary and the Shareholders under this
Agreement are subject to the receipt prior to the Closing of "Final Orders" of
the FCC and applicable Franchising Authorities approving and authorizing the
transactions contemplated herein. C-TEC, Subsidiary, the Shareholders and the
Company shall not be obligated to consummate such transactions if, in the
judgment of C-TEC's Board of Directors, there is contained in any such order a
term, condition or provision which is unduly burdensome. For the purposes of
this Section 9.2, a "Final Order" shall mean an order of the FCC or a
Franchising Authority (including an order issued by the staff of the FCC or a
Franchising Authority acting under delegated authority) that is not subject or
potentially subject to further action of any kind, including but not limited to
reconsideration, rehearing or review by the FCC or any Franchising Authority
or to judicial review.

Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that if C-TEC, using its
reasonable judgment, determines that an application to any other state or
federal agency not identified on Schedule 9.2 for its approval and
authorization of the transactions contemplated herein is required, then C-TEC
shall file such application at its sole expense and the Shareholders and the
Company shall join in such application with C-TEC.

ARTICLE X
INDEMNIFICATION

10.1. Indemnification. (1) The Shareholders and the Company, jointly
and severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless C-TEC, Subsidiary and their
affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of each of the foregoing
from, against and with respect to any and all claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, costs and expenses (including interest, penalties and reasonable
attorney's fees and disbursements), whether or not resulting from third party
claims (each of the foregoing being referred to herein individually as a
"Loss"), arising out of or as a result of (i) any breach by the Company or
Shareholders of any covenant or obligation of the Company in this Agreement or
in any other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party, or (ii) any breach
by the Company or Shareholders of, or any inaccuracy in, any representation or
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or in any other Transaction
Agreements to which it is a party.

(2) C-TEC and Subsidiary shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and the Shareholders and the Company's directors, officers and
employees from, against and with respect to any and all Losses arising out
of or as a result of (i) any breach by C-TEC or Subsidiary of any covenant
or obligation of C-TEC or Subsidiary in this Agreement or in any other
Transaction Agreement to which it is a party, (ii) any breach by C-TEC or
Subsidiary, or any inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by
C-TEC or Subsidiary in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Agreement
to which it is a party.

10.2. Indemnification Procedures. For the purposes of this Section
10.2, the party seeking indemnification shall be known as the "Indemnified
Party" and the party from whom indemnification is sought shall be known as the
"Indemnifying Party". As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by an
Indemnified Party of notice of any Loss in respect of which an Indemnifying
Party may be liable under Section 7.5, the Indemnified Party shall give notice
thereof to the Indemnifying Party, setting forth in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances pertaining thereto and the Indemnifying Party shall
immediately reimburse the Indemnified Party for any such Loss. In the case of
any action brought by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party, at its option and expense, to assume the defense of any
such claim by counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and to settle or
otherwise dispose of the same; provided that the Indemnified Party may at its
discretion at all times participate (at its own expense) in such defense by
counsel of its own choice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified
Party will have the right to employ its own counsel and to control the defense
or settlement in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of
such counsel will be at the expenses of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the
employment of counsel by the Indemnified Party has been authorized in writing
by the Indemnifying Party, or (ii) a conflict or potential conflict exists
(based on advice of counsel to the Indemnified Party) between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party has not in
fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable
time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action or has not
assumed such defense to the reasonable satisfaction of the Indemnified Party.
The Indemnifying Party shall not, in defense of any such claim, except with
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement
that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff in question to the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates
a release of all liabilities in respect of such claims. In the event of a
dispute under this Section 10.2, each of the parties are entitled to all
remedies available in law or equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Article X, except for claims relating to Taxes and environmental
(Sections 3.25 and 3.29), the Shareholders shall only be required to reimburse
C-TEC for losses to the extent that the total of such Losses and Consideration
adjustments pursuant to Section 2.7 exceeds the Consideration Threshold.
Further, the trustee for the trust that holds shares of Capital Stock shall
have no personal liability pursuant to this Article X or any other provision
in this Agreement.

ARTICLE XI
MISCELLANEOUS

11.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior

Shareholders;

occurred on or prior to February 28, 1995;

(3) Upon notice given by C-TEC if the Company or Shareholders
breach any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement or if any representation or warranty made by
the Company or any Shareholder in or pursuant to this Agreement or

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would
violate, in whole or in part, any nonappealable final order,
decree or judgment of any court or governmental body having
competent jurisdiction.

(6) Either the Company or C-TEC shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement immediately prior to Closing in the event
that the Company or C-TEC shall have defaulted in the performance
of any of the material obligations to be performed hereunder, or
should any covenant, warranty or representation made by any other
party in this Agreement prove to be incorrect or incomplete in any
material sense, provided, however, that the parties hereto shall
have the right until the Closing to correct or satisfy any
condition or covenant necessary to the consummation of this
Agreement. Nothing herein shall be construed as relieving a party
from liability for damages to the other party for breach of its
obligations under or by reason of this Agreement, and this right
to terminate shall be in addition to any of the remedies the
parties may have at law or in equity. In the event that a party

addition to any other remedies the terminating party may have at
law or in equity, the terminating party may sue for specific

11.4. Amendment, Assignment, etc. Neither this Agreement nor any term
hereof may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or terminated other than by
an instrument in writing, signed by the party against which enforcement of

windstorm, accident, flood, act of God, war, seizure or activities of the
armed forces, or other casualty, ordinary wear and tear excepted, or any of the
Company's assets shall, to the extent not covered by insurance. If such loss
or damage shall be sufficiently substantial to preclude the resumption of
normal operation or a substantially complete restoration of any substantial
part of the CATV Systems within thirty (30) days, or if such loss or damage

extent of more than ten (10%) percent of the fair market value thereof, the
Company shall promptly notify C-TEC in writing. C-TEC, at any time within
thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, may elect to either (i) accept

Section 11.6 shall not be subject to the Consideration Threshold set forth in
Section 2.7.

11.7. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable for any reason, it shall be adjusted rather than voided, if
possible, in order to achieve the intent of the parties to this Agreement to
the extent possible. In any event, the invalidity or unenforceability of any
provisions of this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement in that jurisdiction or
the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, including that provision, in
any other competent jurisdiction.

11.8. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Persons who are entitled to
indemnification in accordance with Article 10 of this Agreement are
third-party beneficiaries of Sections 3.11(5)(b) and 3.29. Otherwise, nothing

parties hereto and their successors, heirs and permitted assigns, any right,
remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provisions
hereof, except as specifically provided for herein.

11.9. Further Assurances. From time to time prior to, at and after the
Closing, the Company, Subsidiary and C-TEC will and will cause their
respective directors and officers to execute all such instruments and take all
such actions as C-TEC, the Subsidiary or the Company, being advised by
counsel, shall reasonably request in connection with the carrying out and
effectuating of the intent and purpose hereof and all transactions and things
contemplated by this Agreement including, without limitation, the execution

statement (including notifying existing Subscribers, Franchising
Authorities or parties to any contracts or agreements with the Company) or

status of, the transactions provided for in this Agreement, without first
attempting to the extent reasonably possible (and in all cases with regard
to written matters) to clear such announcement, statement, acknowledgement
or revelation with the other parties hereto. Each party agrees that it
will not unreasonably withhold any such consent or clearance from another
party.

service to Stella C. Yee, at her Pennsylvania residence, without charge.

venturers, or principal and agent among the parties hereto or any of their
respective Affiliates. None of the parties hereto shall have any authority
to represent or to bind the other parties in any manner whatsoever.

Exhibit C
Preliminary

C-TEC Cable Systems, Inc. (the Corporation)
Preferred Stock, 5% Series A

irrespective of series), are as follows:

(A) The series shall be designated as Preferred Stock,
5% Series A.

(B) The dividend rate thereof shall be five percent
(5%) per annum. The dividends on the shares of the Preferred Stock
shall be cumulative from the first day of the calendar month in which

dividends, if any, on the Preferred Stock, 5% Series A outstanding at
the time of the issue thereof.

(C) Except as provided in Subsection (K) and (L), the
Preferred Stock, 5% Series A shall have no voting rights whatsoever.

(D) The sum per share payable upon the voluntary or

and unpaid on such share, whether or not earned or declared.

(E) The holders of the shares of the Preferred Stock,
5% Series A (collectively, the Holders), acting as a whole, may elect,
or may be required, as the case may be, at any time during the period
(the Election Period) commencing on the date that is three (3) years
and expiring on the date that is ten (10) years from the date of
Closing (as such term is defined in that certain Merger Agreement
dated September 23, 1994 (the Agreement)), to exchange their shares of
Preferred Stock, 5% Series A with C-TEC Corporation, a Pennsylvania
corporation (C-TEC), either for shares of Common Stock of C-TEC (C-TEC
Common) or cash. The terms and conditions of such exchange rights are
set forth in that certain Share Exchange Option Agreement between the
Holders and C-TEC dated ___________ (the Exchange Agreement). In the
event that either C-TEC or the Holders exercise their option, in
accordance with the Exchange Agreement to exchange shares of Preferred
Stock, 5% Series A for C-TEC Common or cash, as the case may be, and
provided the Corporation has received notice of any such election in
writing not less than 30 nor more than 90 days prior to the date fixed

accepted accounting principles, (d) total income tax expense
and (e) extraordinary or unusual non-cash losses, less (2)
extraordinary non-cash gains.

consolidated outstanding principal amount of (1)
indebtedness for borrowed money, (2) indebtedness for the
deferred purchase price of property or services (other than
property or services purchased in the ordinary course of
business) and (3) indebtedness evidenced by the issuance of
preferred stock having a payment priority senior to or pari
passu with the shares of Preferred Stock, 5% Series A,
excluding, however, the Preferred Stock, 5% Series B of the
Corporation.

Total Obligations shall mean, with respect to the
Corporation, as of the time of determination, the aggregate
consolidated amount of Obligations.

Transaction shall mean, with respect to the Corporation, (1)
the incurrence of any Obligation; (2) any merger,
reorganization or consolidation to which the Corporation is
a party; or (3) the sale of any assets of the Corporation,
other than in the ordinary course of business.

(G) There shall be no sinking fund with respect to the
shares of the Preferred Stock, 5% Series A.

(H) The holders of the Preferred Stock of each series
shall be entitled to receive, but only when, as and if declared by the
Board of Directors, but in no event more frequently than monthly, dividends
at the rate fixed for such series and no more. Such dividends shall be
payable on a date or dates which shall be fixed by the Board of Directors
and shall be cumulative from such date as may be fixed for the series. All
dividends payable on Preferred Stock shall be fully paid, or declared and
set apart for payment before any dividends on the Common Stock of the
Corporation shall be paid or set apart for payment so that if, for all
dividend periods terminating on the same or an earlier date, dividends on
all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock at the rates fixed for the
respective series shall not have been paid or set apart for payment, the
deficiency shall be fully paid or set apart before payment on the Common
Stock of the Corporation. Dividends in full shall not be paid or set apart
for payment on the Preferred Stock of any one series for any dividend
period unless dividends in full have been or are contemporaneously paid or
set apart for payment on the Preferred Stock of all other series for all
dividend periods in respect of such series terminating on the same or an
earlier date. When the stated dividends are not paid in full on all series
of the Preferred Stock in respect of any dividend period, the shares of all
series having the same dividend period shall share ratably in the payment
of dividends, including accumulations, if any, based on the dividends which
would be payable on said shares if all dividends in respect of such series
were paid in full. A dividend period is the period between any two
consecutive dividend payment dates, excluding the first of such dates, as
fixed for the series to which a share or shares shall belong. Accruals of
dividends shall not bear interest.

(I) Upon any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Preferred
Stock of each and every series then outstanding shall be entitled to
receive out of the net assets of the Corporation, whether capital or
surplus, the sums per share fixed for the shares of the respective series
and payable upon such dissolution, liquidation or winding up, plus, in the
case of each share, an amount equal to the dividends accrued and unpaid
thereon, whether or not earned or declared, before any distribution of the
assets of the Corporation shall be made to the holders of the Common Stock
of the Corporation as such.

If the assets distributable on such dissolution, liquidation or
winding up shall be insufficient to permit the payment to the holders of
each series of the Preferred Stock of the full amounts to which they
respectively are entitled as aforesaid, then said assets shall be
distributed among the holders of the respective series of the Preferred
Stock in the order of priority as specified for each class of stock and in
proportion to the sums which would be payable on such dissolution,
liquidation or winding up if all such sums were paid in full in preference
and priority over the shares of any of the Common Stock of the Corporation.

After payment to the holders of the Preferred Stock of the full
amounts to which they respectively are entitled as aforesaid, the holders
of the Preferred Stock, as such, shall have no right or claim to any of the
remaining assets of the Corporation.

The sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all
of the property of the Corporation, or the merger or consolidation into or
with any other corporation, shall not be deemed a dissolution, liquidation
or winding up for the purposes of this Subsection (I).

(J) Nothing herein contained shall limit any legal right of the
Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of the Preferred
Stock.

(K) So long as any shares of the Preferred Stock, 5% Series A are
outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the consent (given in
writing or by vote at a meeting called for that purpose in the manner
prescribed by the By-Laws of the Corporation) of the holders of record of
at least 50% of the total number of such votes which may be cast by the
Holders, each Holder being entitled to one vote for each such share of
Preferred Stock, 5% Series A:

(1) Create or authorize any kind of stock ranking prior to the
Preferred Stock, 5% Series A with respect to the payment of dividends
or upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary, or create or authorize any
obligation or security convertible into shares of any such kind of
stock;

(2) Amend, alter, change or repeal any of the express terms of
the Preferred Stock, 5% Series A so as to affect the Holders thereof
adversely.

(L) So long as any shares of the Preferred Stock, 5% Series A are
outstanding, in the event that the Corporation shall fail to pay dividends
on the Preferred Stock, 5% Series A or Preferred Stock, 5% Series B for at
least twelve (12) consecutive calendar months sufficient to provide a
cumulative dividend rate of five percent (5%) per annum, the Holders shall
be entitled to elect and designate one (1) director of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation and the size of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation shall thereupon be increased by one (1) director, and such
newly elected director shall hold its position on the Board of Directors of
the Corporation only until such time as the Holders shall have received
dividends sufficient to provide a cumulative dividend rate of five percent
(5%) per annum, in which event such newly elected director shall be deemed
to have resigned and the size of the Board of Directors shall thereupon
decrease by one (1) member. The right of the Holders to elect and
designate a member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be
exercised jointly with, and not separately from, the corresponding right
granted to the Holders of the Preferred Stock, 5% Series B, such that only
one (1) member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be elected
and designated, in the aggregate, by the Holders of the Preferred Stock, 5%
Series A and the Preferred Stock, 5% Series D.

Preferred Stock.

(K) So long as any shares of the Preferred Stock, 5%

shall have received dividends sufficient to provide a cumulative dividend
rate of five percent (5%) per annum, in which event such newly elected
director shall be deemed to have resigned and the size of the Board of
Directors shall thereupon decrease by one (1) member. The right of the

the available exemption,] subject to paragraphs (i) and (ii) of
this paragraph (b), such number of Transfer Shares with respect
to which C-TEC has received written requests for inclusion
therein by the Holders within ten (10) days after the giving of
notice by C-TEC. All registrations requested pursuant to this
Section 7(b) are referred to herein as Piggyback Registrations.
This paragraph is not applicable to a Registration Statement
filed by C-TEC with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
SEC) on Forms S-4 or S-8 or any successor form or any
Registration Statement filed with the SEC prior to the Closing.

(i) Priority or Primary Registrations. If a
Piggyback Registration includes an
underwritten primary registration on behalf
of C-TEC and the underwriter(s) for the
offering being registered by C-TEC shall
determine in good faith and advise C-TEC in
writing that in its opinion the number of
Transfer Shares requested to be included in
such registration exceeds the number that can
be sold in such offering without materially
adversely affecting the distribution of such
securities by C-TEC, C-TEC will include in
such registration (A) first, the securities
that C-TEC proposes to sell and (B) second,
to the extent feasible, the Transfer Shares
requested to be included in such registration,
apportioned ratably among the Holders of Transfer
Shares requiring to be included in such registration.

(ii) Priority on Secondary Registrations. If a
Piggyback Registration consists only of an
underwritten secondary registration on behalf
of holders of securities of C-TEC (other than
pursuant to Section 7(a)), and the
underwriter(s) for the offering being
registered by C-TEC advise C-TEC in writing
that in its opinion the number of Transfer
Shares requested to be included in such
registration exceeds the number which can be
sold in such offering without materially
adversely affecting the distribution of such
securities by C-TEC, C-TEC will include in
such registration (A) first, the securities
requested to be included therein by the
holders requesting such registration and (B)
second, to the extent feasible, the Transfer
Shares requested to be included in such
registration above, apportioned ratably,
among all such Holders on the basis of the
number of shares requested to be included by
each such Holder.

(c) Restrictions on Registration Rights.

(i) Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in
Sections (b)(i) and (b)(ii) above or any
other provisions, if any such underwriter
shall determine in good faith and advise
C-TEC in writing that the distribution of the
Transfer Shares requested to be included in
the registration concurrently with the
securities being registered by C-TEC would
materially adversely affect the distribution
of such securities by C-TEC, then the Holders
of such Transfer Shares shall delay their
offering and sale for such period ending on
the earliest of (1) [90] days following the
effective date of C-TEC's registration
statement, (2) the day upon which the
underwriting syndicate, if any, for such
offering shall have been disbanded or, (3)
such date as C-TEC, the underwriter(s) and
the Holders shall otherwise agree. In the
event of such delay, C-TEC shall file such
supplements, post-effective amendments and
take any such other steps as may be
reasonably necessary to permit such Holders
to make their proposed offering and sale for
a period not to exceed [90] days immediately
following the end of such period of delay.
If any party disapproves of the terms of any
such underwriting, it may elect to withdraw
therefrom by written notice to C-TEC and the
underwriter. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
C-TEC shall not be required to file a
registration statement to include Transfer
Shares pursuant to this Section 7 if an
opinion of independent counsel, reasonably
satisfactory to counsel for C-TEC, that the
Transfer Shares proposed to be disposed of
may be transferred pursuant to the provisions
of Rule 144 under the Act shall have been
delivered to counsel for C-TEC [and the
Holders shall have agreed to indemnify C-TEC
with respect to the accuracy of the matter
described in any such opinion and the actions
of C-TEC taken in reliance thereon.]

(ii) C-TEC shall not be required to file a
Registration Statement or Amendment at a time
when the audited financial statements
required to be included therein are not
available, [which time shall be limited to
the period commencing 45 days after the end
of C-TEC's last fiscal year and ending 90
days after the end of such fiscal year
existing at the time of the proposed
offering.]

(iii) C-TEC shall not be required to file a
Registration Statement or Amendment if
C-TEC furnishes to the Holders a
certificate signed by C-TEC's Chairman
or President stating that in his or her
good faith judgment it would be
detrimental or otherwise disadvantageous
to C-TEC or its shareholders for such a
Registration Statement or Amendment to
be filed as expeditiously as possible,
in which case C-TEC shall have a period
of not more than 180 days within which
to file such Registration Statement or
Amendment measured from the date of the
C-TEC's receipt of Holders' request for
registration.

(d) Costs of Registration.

(i) All costs, expenses, fees and other charges,
including but not limited to reasonable
attorneys' and accounting fees and expenses
(collectively, the Expenses), arising as a

Section 7(a) shall be borne by C-TEC and the

immediately available funds at Closing)
through and until the expiration of the
Election Period, the Expenses shall be
borne solely by C-TEC.

(ii) With respect to any election made by the
Holders pursuant to Section 7(b), the
