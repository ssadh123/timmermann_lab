ITEM OF INFORMATION

Item 5. Other Event

On December 31, 1993, GTE South Incorporated (the "Company")
entered into an Agreement of Merger with Contel of Kentucky,
Inc., a Kentucky corporation ("Contel Kentucky"), Contel of North
Carolina, Inc., a North Carolina corporation ("Contel North
Carolina"), Contel of South Carolina, Inc., a South Carolina
corporation ("Contel South Carolina"), and Contel of Virginia,
Inc., a Virginia corporation ("Contel Virginia"). The agreement
provides that the aforementioned companies (collectively, the
"Contel Subsidiaries") would merge with and into the Company,
with the Company to be the surviving corporation in the merger
(the "Merger"). Each of the Contel Subsidiaries is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Contel Corporation, which is itself a wholly-
owned subsidiary of GTE Corporation. The Contel Subsidiaries
provide communications services in the states of Kentucky, North
Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.

The Merger, which is expected to occur on or after July 1, 1994,
will be accounted for in a manner consistent with a transfer of
entities under common control which is similar to a "pooling of
interests." A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Exhibit 2.1.

Included under Item 7 of this report are copies of the audited
financial statements of Contel of Kentucky, Inc., Contel of North
Carolina, Inc. and Contel of Virginia, Inc. for the years ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992. In addition, included are copies of
the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidating balance sheet as
of March 31, 1994, and the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidating statements of income for the three months ended
March 31, 1994 and 1993, and for the years ended December 31,
1993-1991.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors of
Contel of Virginia, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Contel of
Virginia, Inc. (a Virginia corporation), d/b/a GTE Virginia (the
Company), as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
statements of income, reinvested earnings and cash flows for the
years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Contel of Virginia, Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years
then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective
January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions. Also as discussed
in Note 1, effective January 1, 1992, the Company changed its
method of accounting for income taxes.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Accounting Policies

Contel of Virginia, Inc., d/b/a GTE Virginia (the Company), is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Contel Corporation (the Parent
Company). The Parent Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GTE
Corporation (GTE).

Transactions with Affiliates - Purchases

Certain affiliated companies supply construction and maintenance
materials, supplies and equipment to the Company. These
purchases amounted to approximately $18.7 million and $25.0
million for the years 1993 and 1992, respectively. Such
purchases are recorded in the accounts of the Company at cost,
including a normal return realized by the affiliates.

The Company is also billed for data processing services and
equipment rentals, and receives management, consulting, research
and development and pension management services from other
affiliated companies. These charges amounted to $58.8 million
and $52.4 million for the years 1993 and 1992, respectively. The
amounts charged for these affiliated transactions are based on
management's best estimate of a proportional cost allocation
method.

Telephone Plant

Maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred.
Additions to, replacements and renewals of property are charged
to telephone plant accounts. Property retirements are charged in
total to the accumulated depreciation account. No adjustment to
depreciation is made at the time properties are retired or
otherwise disposed of, except in the case of significant sales
of property where profit or loss is recognized.

The Company provides for depreciation on telephone plant over the
estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line
method, based upon rates prescribed by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) and the Virginia State Corporation Commission
(VSCC). The provisions for depreciation and amortization were
equivalent to composite annual rates of 6.6% and 6.2% for the
years 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Regulatory Accounting

The Company follows the accounting prescribed by the Uniform
System of Accounts of the FCC and the VSCC and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 , "Accounting for
the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation". This accounting
recognizes the economic effects of rate regulation by recording
costs and a return on investment as such amounts are recovered
through rates authorized by regulatory authorities. The Company
annually reviews the continued applicability of SFAS No. 71 based
on the current regulatory and competitive environment.

8
Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized when earned. This is generally based on
usage of the Company's local exchange networks or facilities.
For other products and services, revenue is recognized when
products are delivered or services are rendered to customers.

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market
value.

Employee Benefit Plans

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions." The new standard requires that the expected costs of
postretirement benefits be charged to expense during the years
that the employees render service. The Company elected to adopt
this new accounting standard on the delayed recognition method
and commencing January 1, 1993, began amortizing the estimated
unrecorded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation over
twenty years.

The Company also adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits" effective January 1, 1993. SFAS No. 112
requires employers to accrue the future cost of benefits provided
to former or inactive employees and their dependents after
employment but before retirement. Previously, the cost of these
benefits was charged to expense as paid. The impact of this
change in accounting on the Company's results of operations was
immaterial.

Income Taxes

Investment tax credits were repealed by the Tax Reform Act of
1986 (the Act). Those credits claimed prior to the Act were
deferred and are being amortized over the lives of the properties
giving rise to the credits.

As further explained in Note 6, during the fourth quarter of
1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes", retroactive to January 1, 1992. SFAS No. 109 changed the
method by which companies account for income taxes. Among other
things, the Statement requires that deferred tax balances be
adjusted to reflect new tax rates when they are enacted into law.
The impact of this change in accounting on the Company's results
of operations was immaterial.

Financial Instruments

The fair values of financial instruments other than long-term
debt, closely approximate their carrying values. The estimated
fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 1993 and 1992, based
on either reference to quoted market prices or an option pricing
model, exceeded the carrying value by approximately $15.0
million and $10.2 million, respectively.

Prior Year's Financial Statements

Reclassifications of prior year data have been made in the
financial statements to conform to the 1993 presentation.

9
2. Restructuring Costs

Results for 1993 include a one-time pretax restructuring charge
of $45.3 million related to the Company's re-engineering plan
over the next three years. The re-engineering plan will redesign
and streamline processes to improve customer-responsiveness and
product quality, reduce the time necessary to introduce new
products and services and further reduce costs. The re-
engineering plan includes $18.6 million to upgrade or replace
existing customer service and administrative systems and enhance
network software, $21.0 million for employee separation benefits
associated with workforce reductions and $5.7 million primarily
for the consolidation of facilities and operations and other
related costs.

3. Common Stock

The authorized common stock of the Company consists of 5,000,000
shares with a par value of $10 per share. All outstanding shares
of common stock are held by the Parent Company.

There were no shares of common stock held by or for the account
of the Company and no shares were reserved for officers and
employees, or for options, warrants, conversions or other rights.

At December 31, 1993, $107.2 million of reinvested earnings was
restricted as to the payment of cash dividends on common stock
under the most restrictive terms of the Company's indentures.

10
4. Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt outstanding, exclusive of current maturities, is
as follows:

December 31

Total long-term debt $ 129,349 $ 160,465

The aggregate principal amount of bonds and debentures that may
be issued is subject to the restrictions and provisions of the
Company's indentures.

None of the securities shown above were held in sinking or other
special funds of the Company or pledged by the Company.

Maturities, installments and sinking fund requirements for the
five-year period from January 1, 1994 are summarized below (in
thousands of dollars):

1994 $ 59,354
1995 46,402
1996 5,812
1997 9,007
1998 7,387

Substantially all of the Company's telephone plant is subject to
the liens of the indentures under which the bonds listed above
were issued.

11
5. Notes Payable to Affiliates

The Company finances part of its construction program through the
use of interim short-term notes payable to affiliates, which are
generally refinanced at a later date by the issuance of long-term
debt or equity. During 1993 and 1992, the Company supplemented
its internal generation of cash with funds borrowed from GTE.
These arrangements require payment of interest based on GTE
Corporation's daily intercompany interest rate (which is based
primarily on the costs associated with the issuance of commercial
paper). In addition, a $2.3 billion line of credit is available
to the Company through shared lines with GTE and other
affiliates.

12
6. Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is as follows:

1993 1992

The components of deferred income tax (benefit) expense are as
follows:

A reconciliation between the statutory Federal income tax rate
and the effective income tax rate is as follows:

1993 1992

Statutory Federal income tax rate 35.0% 34.0%
State and local income taxes, net of
Federal income tax benefits 3.9 4.1
Amortization of deferred investment
tax credits (8.1) (5.1)
Depreciation of telephone plant
construction costs previously
deducted for tax purposes - net 1.6 1.2
Rate differentials applied to
reversing temporary differences (3.1) (2.0)
Change in tax reserves 2.4 --
Other - net 0.1 --

Effective income tax rate 31.8% 32.2%

As a result of implementing SFAS No. 109, the Company recorded
additional deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to
temporary differences which had not previously been recognized in
accordance with established rate-making practices. Since the
manner in which income taxes are treated for rate-making has not
changed, pursuant to SFAS No. 71, a corresponding regulatory
asset was also established. In addition, deferred income taxes
were adjusted and a regulatory liability established to give
effect to the current statutory Federal income tax rate and for
unamortized investment tax credits. The net unamortized
regulatory liability balances at December 31, 1993 and 1992
amounted to $15.7 million and $21.3 million, respectively. The
regulatory liabilities are reflected as other deferred credits in
the accompanying Balance Sheets. These amounts are being
amortized over the lives of the related depreciable assets
concurrent with recovery in rates and in conformance with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The assets and
liabilities established in accordance with SFAS No. 71 have been
increased for the tax effect of future revenue requirements.

The tax effects of all temporary differences that give rise to
the deferred tax liability and deferred tax asset at December 31
are as follows:

1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Depreciation and amortization $ 91,547 $ 72,728
Employee benefit obligations (15,026) (4,693)
Restructuring cost (17,393) --
Other - net 3,063 3,630
Total $ 62,191 $ 71,665

7. Employee Benefit Plans

The Company participates in the Parent Company's trusteed pension
plan (the Plan), which covers substantially all employees. The
benefits are based on an employee's years of service and average
earnings for the five highest consecutive calendar years
preceding retirement. The Company's policy is to fund pension
cost in accordance with applicable regulations. Total pension
(credits) costs for 1993 and 1992 were $(3.3) million and $2.2
million, respectively.

The net assets available for benefits are maintained for the
total Plan and amounted to $782.6 million. The Plan's net assets
available for benefits exceeded projected benefit obligations by
$534.7 million as computed under SFAS No. 87 "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions" as of December 31, 1993.

As described in Note 1, effective January 1, 1993, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions."

Substantially all of the Company's employees are covered under
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans. The
health care benefits paid under the plans are generally based on
comprehensive hospital, medical and surgical benefit provisions,
while the life insurance benefits are currently based on annual
earnings at the time of retirement. The Company funds amounts
for postretirement benefits as deemed appropriate from time to
time.

The postretirement benefit cost for 1993 includes the following
components (in thousands of dollars):

1993
Service cost-benefits earned
during the period $ 1,623
Interest cost on accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation 5,215
Amortization of transition obligation
and prior service cost 2,993
Postretirement benefit cost $ 9,831

During 1992, the cost of postretirement health care and life
insurance benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis was $2.0 million.

15
The following table sets forth the plans' funded status and the
accrued obligation as of December 31, 1993 (in thousands of
dollars):

1993
Accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation attributable to:
Retirees $ 42,739
Fully eligible active plan participants 4,302
Other active plan participants 19,642
Total accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation 66,683
Fair value of plan assets 82
Excess of accumulated obligation over plan
assets 66,601
Unrecognized transition obligation (44,668)
Unrecognized net loss (7,012)
Accrued postretirement benefit obligation $ 14,921

The assumed discount rate used to measure the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5% at December 31, 1993.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.25%
for 1993. The assumed health care cost trend rate in 1993 was
13% for pre-65 participants and 9.5% for post-65 retirees, each
rate declining on a graduated basis to an ultimate rate in the
year 2004 of 6%. A one percentage point increase in the assumed
health care cost trend rate for each future year would have
increased 1993 costs by $1.1 million and the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 by $7.8
million.

During 1993, the Company made certain changes to its
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for non-
union employees that are effective January 1, 1995. These
changes include, among others, newly established limits to the
Company's annual contribution to postretirement medical costs and
a revised sharing schedule based on a retiree's years of service.
The net effect of these changes reduced the accumulated benefit
obligation at December 31, 1993 by $8.7 million.

16
8. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company's anticipated construction costs in 1994 are
approximately $57.1 million, for which the Company had
substantial purchase commitments as of December 31, 1993.

The Company has noncancelable lease contracts covering certain
buildings, office space and equipment. The lease contracts
contain varying renewal options for terms up to 18 years.

Minimum rental commitments for noncancelable leases for periods
subsequent to December 31, 1993 are as follows (in thousands of
dollars):

1994 $ 471
1995 358
1996 240
1997 223
1998 223
Thereafter 6,623

Total minimum rental
commitments $ 8,138

The total amounts of rents charged to expense were $3.7 million
and $4.5 million for the years 1993 and 1992, respectively.

9. Property, Plant and Equipment

Telephone plant and equipment, including amounts for leases which
have been capitalized, consists of the following:

1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Land and buildings $ 51,369 $ 47,760
Plant in service 840,377 781,388
Plant under construction 6,402 6,565
Other 5,081 7,247
Total telephone plant 903,229 842,960

Accumulated depreciation (307,690) (263,217)

Net telephone plant $ 595,539 $ 579,743

17
10. Regulatory Matters

The Company is subject to regulation by the FCC for interstate
business and the VSCC for intrastate operations.

Intrastate Services

The Company provides long distance services within designated
geographic areas called Local Access and Transport Areas (LATAs).
For intraLATA network access service, the VSCC ordered the
implementation of the Originating Responsibility Toll
Compensation Plan. Under this plan, the toll rate billed to end
users for intraLATA toll calls originating in the Company's
service area are retained by the Company. The Company, in turn,
pays access charges to the carrier hauling and terminating the
call based on that carrier's approved access charge tariff.
Likewise, the Company receives access charges for terminating any
intraLATA toll call that originates outside of its service area
based on its approved access charge tariff. The Company records
this revenue on a bill-and-keep basis.

Intrastate-interLATA network access service revenue is recovered
through access charges paid by interexchange carriers for use of
the Company's facilities in originating and terminating
intrastate toll messages between LATAs. The Company records this
revenue on a bill-and-keep basis.

Interstate Services

For the provision of interstate services, the Company operates
under the terms of the FCC's price cap incentive plan. The
"price cap" mechanism serves to limit the rates a carrier may
charge, rather than just regulating the rate of return which may
be achieved. Under this approach, the maximum price that the
Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) may charge is increased or decreased
each year by a price index based upon inflation less a
predetermined productivity target. LECs may within certain
ranges price individual services above or below the overall cap.

As a safeguard under its new price cap regulatory plan, the FCC
has also adopted a productivity sharing feature. Because of this
feature, under the minimum productivity-gain option, the Company
must share equally with its ratepayers any realized interstate
returns above 12.25% up to 16.25%, and all returns higher than
16.25%, by temporarily lowering prospective prices. During 1994,
the FCC is scheduled to review the LEC price cap plan to
determine whether it should be continued or modified.

18
Other Rate Matters

After reviewing its experimental incentive regulation plan, the
VSCC ordered on December 17, 1993 that several modifications to
the plan should be made effective January 1, 1994. The Company
has operated under the experimental plan since January 1, 1989.
These modifications include a lowering of the Company's
authorized Return on Equity from the current 12-14% range to
10.55-12.55% for 1994, with provisions for annual adjustments
beginning January 1, 1995. The VSCC also ordered that 25% of the
Company's yellow page advertising income should be used to
calculate its regulated earnings under the plan, but the Company
may file to restructure its rates on a revenue neutral basis
without filing a full rate case. This new plan will be in place
for an interim period, pending the completion of a new docket
commenced by the VSCC to investigate which changes should be made
on a permanent basis. The Company does not expect these
proceedings to have a material impact on its results of
operations.

Significant Customer

Revenues received from AT&T including access, billing and
collection and interexchange leased facilities during the years
1993 and 1992 under various arrangements amounted to $65.5
million and $61.5 million, respectively.

12. Legal Entity Merger

On October 15, 1993 the Company filed an application to legally
merge into GTE South Incorporated, a subsidiary of GTE. The
merger of the Company into GTE South Incorporated will simplify
the corporate structure and will provide greater efficiency of
operations through consolidation of record keeping and control of
expenses. The new Company will have an enhanced market presence
both in the providing of competitive telecommunications services
and the procurement of capital. Pending regulatory approvals,
the Company expects the merger to be completed by July 1, 1994.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Accounting Policies

Contel of Kentucky, Inc., d/b/a GTE Kentucky (the Company), is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Contel Corporation (the Parent
Company). The Parent Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GTE
Corporation (GTE).

Transactions with Affiliates - Purchases

Certain affiliated companies supply construction and maintenance
materials, supplies and equipment to the Company. These
purchases amounted to approximately $9.3 million and $4.7 million
for the years 1993 and 1992, respectively. Such purchases are
recorded in the accounts of the Company at cost, including a
normal return realized by the affiliates.

The Company is also billed for data processing services and
equipment rentals, and receives management, consulting, research
and development and pension management services from other
affiliated companies. These charges amounted to $14.1 million
and $11.5 million for the years 1993 and 1992, respectively. The
amounts charged for these affiliated transactions are based on
management's best estimate of a proportional cost allocation
method.

Telephone Plant

Maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred.
Additions to, replacements and renewals of property are charged
to telephone plant accounts. Property retirements are charged in
total to the accumulated depreciation account. No adjustment to
depreciation is made at the time properties are retired or
otherwise disposed of, except in the case of significant sales of
property where profit or loss is recognized.

The Company provides for depreciation on telephone plant over the
estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line
method, based upon rates prescribed by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) and the Kentucky Public Service Commission
(KPSC). The provisions for depreciation and amortization were
equivalent to composite annual rates of 5.9% and 6.5% for the
years 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Regulatory Accounting

The Company follows the accounting prescribed by the Uniform
System of Accounts of the FCC and the KPSC and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 , "Accounting for
the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." This accounting
recognizes the economic effects of rate regulation by recording
costs and a return on investment as such amounts are recovered
through rates authorized by regulatory authorities. The Company
annually reviews the continued applicability of SFAS No. 71 based
on the current regulatory and competitive environment.

31
Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized when earned. This is generally based on
usage of the Company's local exchange networks or facilities.
For other products and services, revenue is recognized when
products are delivered or services are rendered to customers.

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market
value.

Employee Benefit Plans

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions." The new standard requires that the expected costs of
postretirement benefits be charged to expense during the years
that the employees render service. The Company elected to adopt
this new accounting standard on the delayed recognition method
and commencing January 1, 1993, began amortizing the estimated
unrecorded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation over
twenty years.

The Company also adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits" effective January 1, 1993. SFAS No. 112
requires employers to accrue the future cost of benefits provided
to former or inactive employees and their dependents after
employment but before retirement. Previously, the cost of these
benefits was charged to expense as paid. The impact of this
change in accounting on the Company's results of operations was
immaterial.

Income Taxes

Investment tax credits were repealed by the Tax Reform Act of
1986 (the Act). Those credits claimed prior to the Act were
deferred and are being amortized over the lives of the properties
giving rise to the credits.

As further explained in Note 6, during the fourth quarter of
1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes", retroactive to January 1, 1992. SFAS No. 109 changed the
method by which companies account for income taxes. Among other
things, the Statement requires that deferred tax balances be
adjusted to reflect new tax rates when they are enacted into law.
The impact of this change in accounting on the Company's results
of operations was immaterial.

Financial Instruments

The fair values of financial instruments other than long-term
debt, closely approximate their carrying values. The estimated
fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 1993 and 1992, based
on either reference to quoted market prices or an option pricing
model, exceeded the carrying value by approximately $1.6 million
and $0.2 million, respectively.

Prior Year's Financial Statements

Reclassifications of prior year data have been made in the
financial statements to conform to the 1993 presentation.

32
2. Restructuring Costs

Results for 1993 include a one-time pretax restructuring charge
of $6.5 million related to the Company's re-engineering plan over
the next three years. The re-engineering plan will redesign and
streamline processes to improve customer-responsiveness and
product quality, reduce the time necessary to introduce new
products and services and further reduce costs. The re-
engineering plan includes $2.7 million to upgrade or replace
existing customer service and administrative systems and enhance
network software, $3.0 million for employee separation benefits
associated with workforce reductions and $0.8 million primarily
for the consolidation of facilities and operations and other
related costs.

3. Common Stock

The authorized common stock of the Company consists of 300,000
shares with a par value of $5 per share. All outstanding shares
of common stock are held by the Parent Company.

There were no shares of common stock held by or for the account
of the Company and no shares were reserved for officers and
employees, or for options, warrants, conversions or other rights.

At December 31, 1993, $20.9 million of reinvested earnings was
restricted as to the payment of cash dividends on common stock
under the most restrictive terms of the Company's indentures.

33
4. Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt outstanding, exclusive of current maturities, is
as follows:

December 31
1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Rural Electrification Administration

2%, due 2009 $ 2,192 $ 2,594

Federal Financing Bank

7.391% to 10.910%, through 2022 22,292 22,942

Total long-term debt $ 24,484 $ 25,536

The aggregate principal amount of bonds and debentures that may
be issued is subject to the restrictions and provisions of the
Company's indentures.

None of the securities shown above were held in sinking or other
special funds of the Company or pledged by the Company.

Maturities, installments and sinking fund requirements for the
five-year period from January 1, 1994 are summarized below (in
thousands of dollars):

1994 $ 935
1995 916
1996 1,334
1997 1,038
1998 1,083

Substantially all of the Company's telephone plant is subject to
the liens of the indentures under which the bonds listed above
were issued.

34
5. Notes Payable to Affiliates

The Company finances part of its construction program through the
use of interim short-term notes payable to affiliates, which are
generally refinanced at a later date by the issuance of long-term
debt or equity. During 1993 and 1992, the Company supplemented
its internal generation of cash with funds borrowed from GTE.
These arrangements require payment of interest based on GTE
Corporation's daily intercompany interest rate (which is based
primarily on the costs associated with the issuance of commercial
paper). In addition, a $2.3 billion line of credit is available
to the Company through shared lines with GTE and other
affiliates.

35
6. Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is as follows:

1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Current
Federal $ 5,142 $ 3,893
State and local 1,423 1,014
Total 6,565 4,907

Deferred
Federal (402) 247
State and local (206) 142
Total (608) 389

Amortization of deferred
investment tax credits (558) (631)

Total $ 5,399 $ 4,665

The components of deferred income tax expense (benefit) are as
follows:

1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Depreciation and amortization $ 3,211 $ (47)
Employee benefit obligations (2,025) (156)
Restructuring cost (2,506) --
Other-net 712 592

Total $ (608) $ 389

36
A reconciliation between the statutory Federal income tax rate
and the effective income tax rate is as follows:

1993 1992

Statutory Federal income tax rate 35.0% 34.0%
State and local income taxes, net of
Federal income tax benefits 5.5 5.6
Amortization of deferred investment
tax credits (3.9) (4.6)
Depreciation of telephone plant
construction costs previously
deducted for tax purposes - net 0.6 0.9
Rate differentials applied to
reversing temporary differences (0.9) (1.7)
Other - net 1.0 --

Effective income tax rate 37.3% 34.2%

As a result of implementing SFAS No. 109, the Company recorded
additional deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to
temporary differences which had not previously been recognized in
accordance with established rate-making practices. Since the
manner in which income taxes are treated for rate-making has not
changed, pursuant to SFAS No. 71, a corresponding regulatory
asset was also established. In addition, deferred income taxes
were adjusted and a regulatory liability established to give
effect to the current statutory Federal income tax rate and for
unamortized investment tax credits. The net unamortized
regulatory liability balances at December 31, 1993 and 1992
amounted to $2.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively. The
regulatory liabilities are reflected as other deferred credits in
the accompanying Balance Sheets. These amounts are being
amortized over the lives of the related depreciable assets
concurrent with recovery in rates and in conformance with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The assets and
liabilities established in accordance with SFAS No. 71 have been
increased for the tax effect of future revenue requirements.

The tax effects of all temporary differences that give rise to
the deferred tax liability and deferred tax asset at December 31
are as follows:

1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Depreciation and amortization $ 15,468 $ 11,146
Employee benefit obligations (1,548) (1,130)
Restructuring cost (2,506) --
Other - net 558 1,454
Total $ 11,972 $ 11,470

37
7. Employee Benefit Plans

The Company participates in the Parent Company's trusteed pension
plan (the Plan), which covers substantially all employees. The
benefits are based on an employee's years of service and average
earnings for the five highest consecutive calendar years
preceding retirement. The Company's policy is to fund pension
cost in accordance with applicable regulations. Total pension
(credits) costs for 1993 and 1992 were $(477,000) and $267,000,
respectively.

The net assets available for benefits are maintained for the
total Plan and amounted to $632.9 million. The Plan's net assets
available for benefits exceeded projected benefit obligations by
$433.6 million as computed under SFAS No. 87 "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions" as of December 31, 1993.

As described in Note 1, effective January 1, 1993, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions."

Substantially all of the Company's employees are covered under
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans. The
health care benefits paid under the plans are generally based on
comprehensive hospital, medical and surgical benefit provisions,
while the life insurance benefits are currently based on annual
earnings at the time of retirement. The Company funds amounts
for postretirement benefits as deemed appropriate from time to
time.

The postretirement benefit cost for 1993 includes the following
components (in thousands of dollars):

1993
Service cost-benefits earned
during the period $ 195
Interest cost on accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation 875
Amortization of transition obligation
and prior service cost 491
Postretirement benefit cost $ 1,561

During 1992, the cost of postretirement health care and life
insurance benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis was $365,000.

38
The following table sets forth the plans' funded status and the
accrued obligation as of December 31, 1993 (in thousands of
dollars):

1993
Accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation attributable to:
Retirees $ 7,129
Fully eligible active plan participants 323
Other active plan participants 1,771
Total accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation 9,223
Fair value of plan assets --
Excess of accumulated obligation over plan
assets 9,223
Unrecognized transition obligation (6,163)
Unrecognized net loss (873)
Accrued postretirement benefit obligation $ 2,187

The assumed discount rate used to measure the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5% at December 31, 1993.
The assumed health care cost trend rate in 1993 was 13% for pre-
65 participants and 9.5% for post-65 retirees, each rate
declining on a graduated basis to an ultimate rate in the year
2004 of 6%. A one percentage point increase in the assumed
health care cost trend rate for each future year would have
increased 1993 costs by $178,000 and the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 by
$677,000.

During 1993, the Company made certain changes to its
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for non-
union employees that are effective January 1, 1995. These
changes include, among others, newly established limits to the
Company's annual contribution to postretirement medical costs and
a revised sharing schedule based on a retiree's years of service.
The net effect of these changes reduced the accumulated benefit
obligation at December 31, 1993 by $4.0 million.

39
8. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company's anticipated construction costs for 1994 are
approximately $13.8 million, for which the Company had
substantial purchase commitments as of December 31, 1993.

The Company has noncancelable lease contracts covering certain
buildings, office space and equipment. The lease contracts
contain varying renewal options for terms up to 8 years.

Minimum rental commitments for noncancelable leases for periods
subsequent to December 31, 1993 are as follows (in thousands of
dollars):

1994 $ 30
1995 18
1996 11
1997 10
1998 10
Thereafter 31

Total minimum rental
commitments $ 110

The total amounts of rents charged to expense were $0.6 million
for 1993 and 1992.

9. Property, Plant and Equipment

Telephone plant and equipment consists of the following:

1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Land and buildings $ 7,275 $ 8,096
Plant in service 185,751 171,674
Plant under construction 9,013 1,690
Other 354 623
Total telephone plant 202,393 182,083

Accumulated depreciation (72,818) (67,685)

Net telephone plant $ 129,575 $ 114,398

40
10. Regulatory Matters

The Company is subject to regulation by the FCC for interstate
business and the KPSC for intrastate operations.

Intrastate Services

The Company provides long distance services within designated
geographic areas called Local Access and Transport Areas (LATAs).
The Company receives access revenues from the primary toll
carrier within the LATA.

Intrastate-interLATA network access service revenues are
recovered through access charges paid by interexchange carriers
for use of the Company's facilities in originating and
terminating intrastate toll messages between LATAs. The Company
records this revenue on a bill-and-keep basis.

On December 15, 1993, the KPSC approved the Company's request to
become a primary toll carrier under an Originating Responsibility
Plan, effective March 1, 1994. Under this type of arrangement,
the toll rates billed to end users for intraLATA toll calls
originating in the Company's service area will be retained by the
Company on a bill-and-keep basis. The Company, in turn, will pay
access charges to the carrier hauling and terminating the call
based on that carrier's approved access charge tariff. Likewise,
the Company will receive access charges for terminating any
intraLATA toll call that originates outside of its service area
based on its approved access charge tariff. The Company will
receive transitional support payments for any revenue loss
created by this change in compensation arrangement under the
terms of an industry agreement.

Interstate Services

For the provision of interstate services, the Company operates
under the terms of the FCC's price cap incentive plan. The
"price cap" mechanism serves to limit the rates a carrier may
charge, rather than just regulating the rate of return which may
be achieved. Under this approach, the maximum price that the
Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) may charge is increased or decreased
each year by a price index based upon inflation less a
predetermined productivity target. LECs may within certain
ranges price individual services above or below the overall cap.

As a safeguard under its new price cap regulatory plan, the FCC
has also adopted a productivity sharing feature. Because of this
feature, under the minimum productivity-gain option, the Company
must share equally with its ratepayers any realized interstate
returns above 12.25% up to 16.25%, and all returns higher than
16.25%, by temporarily lowering prospective prices. During 1994,
the FCC is scheduled to review the LEC price cap plan to
determine whether it should be continued or modified.

41
Other Rate Matters

On August 1, 1993, the KPSC approved the Company's request to
reduce its local service revenue by $2.1 million to bring the
Company's tariffed rates to the same rate levels as GTE South.
This rate reduction was required by the KPSC as a condition for
approval of the planned merger of the Company into GTE South
Incorporated.

Significant Customer

Revenues received from AT&T including access, billing and
collection and interexchange leased facilities during the years
1993 and 1992 under various arrangements amounted to $7.1 million
and $6.6 million, respectively.

12. Legal Entity Merger

On September 27, 1993 the Company filed an application to legally
merge into GTE South Incorporated, a subsidiary of GTE. The
merger of the Company into GTE South Incorporated will simplify
the corporate structure and will provide greater efficiency of
operations through consolidation of record keeping and control of
expenses. The new Company will have an enhanced market presence
both in the providing of competitive telecommunications services
and the procurement of capital. Pending regulatory approvals,
the Company expects the merger to be completed by July 1, 1994.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors of
Contel of North Carolina, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Contel of
North Carolina, Inc. (a North Carolina corporation), d/b/a GTE
North Carolina (the Company), as of December 31, 1993 and 1992,
and the related statements of income, reinvested earnings and
cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Contel of North Carolina, Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective
January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions. Also as discussed
in Note 1, effective January 1, 1992, the Company changed its
method of accounting for income taxes.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Accounting Policies

Contel of North Carolina, Inc., d/b/a GTE North Carolina (the
Company), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Contel Corporation (the
Parent Company). The Parent Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of GTE Corporation (GTE).

Transactions with Affiliates - Purchases

Certain affiliated companies supply construction and maintenance
materials, supplies and equipment to the Company. These
purchases amounted to approximately $3.3 million and $3.9 million
for the years 1993 and 1992, respectively. Such purchases are
recorded in the accounts of the Company at cost, including a
normal return realized by the affiliates.

The Company is also billed for data processing services and
equipment rentals, and receives management, consulting, research
and development and pension management services from other
affiliated companies. These charges amounted to $17.7 million
and $14.1 million for the years 1993 and 1992, respectively. The
amounts charged for these affiliated transactions are based on
management's best estimate of a proportional cost allocation
method.

Telephone Plant

Maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred.
Additions to, replacements and renewals of property are charged
to telephone plant accounts. Property retirements are charged in
total to the accumulated depreciation account. No adjustment to
depreciation is made at the time properties are retired or
otherwise disposed of, except in the case of significant sales of
property where profit or loss is recognized.

The Company provides for depreciation on telephone plant over the
estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line
method, based upon rates prescribed by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) and the North Carolina Public Utilities
Commission (NCPUC). The provisions for depreciation and
amortization were equivalent to composite annual rates of 6.1%
and 6.7% for the years 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Regulatory Accounting

The Company follows the accounting prescribed by the Uniform
System of Accounts of the FCC and the NCPUC and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71 , "Accounting for
the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." This accounting
recognizes the economic effects of rate regulation by recording
costs and a return on investment as such amounts are recovered
through rates authorized by regulatory authorities. The Company
annually reviews the continued applicability of SFAS No. 71 based
on the current regulatory and competitive environment.

54
Revenue Recognition

Revenues are recognized when earned. This is generally based on
usage of the Company's local exchange networks or facilities.
For other products and services, revenue is recognized when
products are delivered or services are rendered to customers.

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market
value. Cost of materials and supplies is determined by the
average cost method of inventory valuation.

Employee Benefit Plans

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions." The new standard requires that the expected costs of
postretirement benefits be charged to expense during the years
that the employees render service. The Company elected to adopt
this new accounting standard on the delayed recognition method
and commencing January 1, 1993, began amortizing the estimated
unrecorded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation over
twenty years.

The Company also adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits" effective January 1, 1993. SFAS No. 112
requires employers to accrue the future cost of benefits provided
to former or inactive employees and their dependents after
employment but before retirement. Previously, the cost of these
benefits was charged to expense as paid. The impact of this
change in accounting on the Company's results of operations was
immaterial.

Income Taxes

Investment tax credits were repealed by the Tax Reform Act of
1986 (the Act). Those credits claimed prior to the Act were
deferred and are being amortized over the lives of the properties
giving rise to the credits.

As further explained in Note 6, during the fourth quarter of
1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes", retroactive to January 1, 1992. SFAS No. 109 changed the
method by which companies account for income taxes. Among other
things, the Statement requires that deferred tax balances be
adjusted to reflect new tax rates when they are enacted into law.
The impact of this change in accounting on the Company's results
of operations was immaterial.

55
Financial Instruments

The fair values of financial instruments other than long-term
debt, closely approximate their carrying values. The estimated
fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 1993 and 1992, based
on either reference to quoted market prices or an option pricing
model, exceeded the carrying value by approximately $2.3 million
and $2.6 million, respectively.

Prior Year's Financial Statements

Reclassifications of prior year data have been made in the
financial statements to conform to the 1993 presentation.

2. Restructuring Costs

Results for 1993 include a one-time pretax restructuring charge
of $9.9 million related to the Company's re-engineering plan over
the next three years. The re-engineering plan will redesign and
streamline processes to improve customer-responsiveness and
product quality, reduce the time necessary to introduce new
products and services and further reduce costs. The re-
engineering plan includes $4.0 million to upgrade or replace
existing customer service and administrative systems and enhance
network software, $4.6 million for employee separation benefits
associated with workforce reductions and $1.3 million primarily
for the consolidation of facilities and operations and other
related costs.

3. Common Stock

The authorized common stock of the Company consists of 2,000,000
shares with a par value of $5 per share. All outstanding shares
of common stock are held by the Parent Company.

There were no shares of common stock held by or for the account
of the Company and no shares were reserved for officers and
employees, or for options, warrants, conversions or other rights.

At December 31, 1993, $16.1 million of reinvested earnings was
restricted as to the payment of cash dividends on common stock
under the most restrictive terms of the Company's indentures.

56
4. Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt outstanding, exclusive of current maturities, is
as follows:

December 31
1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Rural Electrification Administration

2%, due 1997 $ 981 $ 1,299

Rural Telephone Bank

7.5% to 9.5%, through 2011 17,083 17,173

Federal Financing Bank

8.686% to 12.201%, through 2014 7,786 7,908

First Mortgage Bonds

8.25% to 9.5%, through 2002 2,725 4,598
10% to 10.25%, due 1996 890 1,035
12.5%, due 1994 -- 7,500

Capitalized Leases -- 6

Total long-term debt $ 29,465 $ 39,519

The aggregate principal amount of bonds and debentures that may
be issued is subject to the restrictions and provisions of the
Company's indentures.

None of the securities shown above were held in sinking or other
special funds of the Company or pledged by the Company.

Maturities, installments and sinking fund requirements for the
five-year period from January 1, 1994 are summarized below (in
thousands of dollars):

1994 $ 10,084
1995 1,589
1996 2,053
1997 1,295
1998 488

Substantially all of the Company's telephone plant is subject to
the liens of the indentures under which the bonds listed above
were issued.

57
5. Notes Payable to Affiliates

The Company finances part of its construction program through the
use of interim short-term notes payable to affiliates, which are
generally refinanced at a later date by the issuance of long-term
debt or equity. During 1993 and 1992, the Company supplemented
its internal generation of cash with funds borrowed from GTE.
These arrangements require payment of interest based on GTE
Corporation's daily intercompany interest rate (which is based
primarily on the costs associated with the issuance of commercial
paper). In addition, a $2.3 billion line of credit is available
to the Company through shared lines with GTE and other
affiliates.

58
6. Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is as follows:

1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Current
Federal $ 7,636 $ 9,354
State and local 1,290 2,375
Total 8,926 11,729

Deferred
Federal (1,857) (1,796)
State and local 99 (374)
Total (1,758) (2,170)

Amortization of deferred
investment tax credits (712) (791)

Total $ 6,456 $ 8,768

The components of deferred income tax benefit are as follows:

1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Depreciation and amortization $ 3,026 $ (2,695)
Employee benefit obligations (2,185) 113
Restructuring cost (3,787) --
Other-net 1,188 412

Total $ (1,758) $ (2,170)

59
A reconciliation between the statutory Federal income tax rate
and the effective income tax rate is as follows:

1993 1992

Statutory Federal income tax rate 35.0% 34.0%
State and local income taxes, net of
Federal income tax benefits 5.0 5.3
Amortization of deferred investment
tax credits (4.0) (3.2)
Depreciation of telephone plant
construction costs previously
deducted for tax purposes - net 0.3 0.4
Rate differentials applied to
reversing temporary differences (1.4) (1.1)
Other - net 1.1 --

Effective income tax rate 36.0% 35.4%

As a result of implementing SFAS No. 109, the Company recorded
additional deferred income tax liabilities primarily related to
temporary differences which had not previously been recognized in
accordance with established rate-making practices. Since the
manner in which income taxes are treated for rate-making has not
changed, pursuant to SFAS No. 71, a corresponding regulatory
asset was also established. In addition, deferred income taxes
were adjusted and a regulatory liability established to give
effect to the current statutory Federal income tax rate and for
unamortized investment tax credits. The net unamortized
regulatory liability balances at December 31, 1993 and 1992
amounted to $5.9 million and $8.7 million, respectively. The
regulatory liabilities are reflected as other deferred credits in
the accompanying Balance Sheets. These amounts are being
amortized over the lives of the related depreciable assets
concurrent with recovery in rates and in conformance with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The assets and
liabilities established in accordance with SFAS No. 71 have been
increased for the tax effect of future revenue requirements.

The tax effects of all temporary differences that give rise to
the deferred tax liability and deferred tax asset at December 31
are as follows:

1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Depreciation and amortization $ 21,493 $ 14,998
Employee benefit obligations (1,262) (809)
Restructuring cost (3,787) --
Other - net 917 1,461

Total $ 17,361 $ 15,650

60
7. Employee Benefit Plans

The Company participates in the Parent Company's trusteed pension
plan (the Plan), which covers substantially all employees. The
benefits are based on an employee's years of service and average
earnings for the five highest consecutive calendar years
preceding retirement. The Company's policy is to fund pension
cost in accordance with applicable regulations. Total pension
(credits) costs for 1993 and 1992 were $(0.4) million and $0.4
million, respectively.

The net assets available for benefits are maintained for the
total Plan and amounted to $782.6 million. The Plan's net assets
available for benefits exceeded projected benefit obligations by
$534.7 million as computed under SFAS No. 87 "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions" as of December 31, 1993.

As described in Note 1, effective January 1, 1993, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions."

Substantially all of the Company's employees are covered under
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans. The
health care benefits paid under the plans are generally based on
comprehensive hospital, medical and surgical benefit provisions,
while the life insurance benefits are currently based on annual
earnings at the time of retirement. The Company funds amounts
for postretirement benefits as deemed appropriate from time to
time.

The postretirement benefit cost for 1993 includes the following
components (in thousands of dollars):

1993
Service cost-benefits earned
during the period $ 268
Interest cost on accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation 1,106
Actual return on plan assets (57)
Amortization of transition obligation
and prior service cost 763
Postretirement benefit cost $ 2,080

During 1992, the cost of postretirement health care and life
insurance benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis was $0.4 million.

61
The following table sets forth the plans' funded status and the
accrued obligation as of December 31, 1993 (in thousands of
dollars):

1993
Accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation attributable to:
Retirees $ 7,501
Fully eligible active plan participants 1,439
Other active plan participants 4,638
Total accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation 13,578
Fair value of plan assets 709
Excess of accumulated obligation over plan
assets 12,869
Unrecognized transition obligation (9,168)
Unrecognized net loss (1,620)
Accrued postretirement benefit obligation $ 2,081

The assumed discount rate used to measure the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5% at December 31, 1993.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.25%
for 1993. The assumed health care cost trend rate in 1993 was
13% for pre-65 participants and 9.5% for post-65 retirees, each
rate declining on a graduated basis to an ultimate rate in the
year 2004 of 6%. A one percentage point increase in the assumed
health care cost trend rate for each future year would have
increased 1993 costs by $0.2 million and the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 by $1.9
million.

During 1993, the Company made certain changes to its
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for non-
union employees that are effective January 1, 1995. These
changes include, among others, newly established limits to the
Company's annual contribution to postretirement medical costs and
a revised sharing schedule based on a retiree's years of service.
The net effect of these changes reduced the accumulated benefit
obligation at December 31, 1993 by $1.9 million.

62
8. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company's anticipated construction costs for 1994 are
approximately $21.1 million, for which the Company had
substantial purchase commitments as of December 31, 1993.

The Company has noncancelable lease contracts covering certain
buildings, office space and equipment. The lease contracts
contain varying renewal options for terms up to 97 years.

Minimum rental commitments for noncancelable leases for periods
subsequent to December 31, 1993 are as follows (in thousands of
dollars):

1994 $ 45
1995 44
1996 84
1997 84
1998 84
Thereafter 2,928

Total minimum rental
commitments $ 3,269

The total amounts of rents charged to expense were $1.2 million
and $1.5 million for the years 1993 and 1992, respectively.

9. Property, Plant and Equipment

Telephone plant and equipment, including amounts for leases which
have been capitalized, consists of the following:

1993 1992
(Thousands of Dollars)

Land and buildings $ 9,810 $ 8,911
Plant in service 213,694 207,806
Plant under construction 3,258 611
Other 515 786
Total telephone plant 227,277 218,114

Accumulated depreciation (91,536) (82,796)

Net telephone plant $ 135,741 $ 135,318

63
10. Regulatory Matters

The Company is subject to regulation by the FCC for interstate
business and the NCPUC for intrastate operations.

Intrastate Services

The Company provides long distance services within designated
geographic areas called Local Access and Transport Areas (LATAs).
The Company receives intrastate-intraLATA network access service
revenue through participation in an access charge based pool.
The Company remits intraLATA end user toll billings to the pool,
and bills the pool access charges.

Intrastate-interLATA network access service revenue is recovered
through access charges paid by interexchange carriers for use of
the Company's facilities in originating and terminating
intrastate toll messages between LATAs. The Company records this
revenue on a bill-and-keep basis.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company will implement and receive
intraLATA compensation through an Originating Responsibility Plan
(ORP). Under this plan, the toll rates billed to end users for
intraLATA toll calls originating in the Company's service area
will be retained by the Company. The Company, in turn, will pay
access charges to the carrier hauling and terminating the call
based on that carrier's approved access charge tariff. Likewise
the Company will receive access charges for terminating any
intraLATA toll call that originates outside of its service area
based on its approved access charge tariff. The Company will
record this revenue on a bill-and-keep basis and will receive
transitional support payments for any revenue loss created by
this change in compensation arrangement under the terms of an
industry agreement.

Interstate Services

For the provision of interstate services, the Company operates
under the terms of the FCC's price cap incentive plan. The
"price cap" mechanism serves to limit the rates a carrier may
charge, rather than just regulating the rate of return which may
be achieved. Under this approach, the maximum price that the
Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) may charge is increased or decreased
each year by a price index based upon inflation less a
predetermined productivity target. LECs may within certain
ranges price individual services above or below the overall cap.

As a safeguard under its new price cap regulatory plan, the FCC
has also adopted a productivity sharing feature. Because of this
feature, under the minimum productivity-gain option, the Company
must share equally with its ratepayers any realized interstate
return above 12.25% up to 16.25%, and all returns higher than
16.25%, by temporarily lowering prospective prices. During 1994,
the FCC is scheduled to review the LEC price cap plan to
determine whether it should be continued or modified.

64
Other Rate Matters

In 1994, the NCPUC approved the Company's request to reduce local
basic service rates by $4.6 million on an annual basis. The new
rates are effective June 1, 1994.

Significant Customer

Revenues received from AT&T including access, billing and
collection and interexchange leased facilities during the years
1993 and 1992 under various arrangements amounted to $16.2
million and $12.7 million, respectively.

65
11. Notes Receivable from Affiliate

During 1993 and 1992, the Company provided excess funds to GTE
Corporation. These funds were available on demand and treated as
cash investments. The investments earn interest based on GTE
Corporation's daily intercompany interest rate (which is based
primarily on the costs associated with issuing commercial paper)
and are reported by the Company as Notes receivable from
affiliate.

12. Supplemental Cash Flow Disclosures

13. Legal Entity Merger

On October 1, 1993 the Company filed an application to legally
merge into GTE South Incorporated, a subsidiary of GTE. The
merger of the Company into GTE South Incorporated will simplify
the corporate structure and will provide greater efficiency of
operations through consolidation of record keeping and control of
expenses. The new Company will have an enhanced market presence
both in the providing of competitive telecommunications services
and the procurement of capital. Pending regulatory approvals,
the Company expects the merger to be completed by July 1, 1994.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

(1) The condensed financial statements included herein have been
prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, in the opinion
of management of the Company, the condensed financial statements
include all adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring
accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial information
for such periods. These condensed financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes
thereto included in the Company's 1993 Financial Statements
included in this Form 8-K filing.

(2) On April 25, 1994, the North Carolina Utility Commission
(NCUC) approved the merger of the Company into GTE South
Incorporated effective on or after July 1, 1994. The merger of
the Company into GTE South Incorporated will simplify the
corporate structure and will provide greater efficiency of
operations through consolidation of record keeping and control of
expenses. The new Company will have enhanced market presence
both in the providing of competitive telecommunications services
and the procurement of capital. In addition, tariff revisions
were filed with the NCUC on February 25, 1994 to reduce revenue
by $6.6 million, effective June 1, 1994.

GTE SOUTH INCORPORATED AND CONTEL SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation

The pro forma condensed consolidating financial statements give
effect to the Merger as a "pooling of interests" and are based on
historical amounts. All material intercompany items have been
eliminated in the pro forma statements.

The pro forma balance sheets have been prepared as though the
Merger occurred as of the balance sheet date. The pro forma
income statements have been prepared as though the Merger
occurred as of the beginning of the period presented. The pro
forma results do not give effect to any synergies that might have
occurred had the Merger been consummated at the dates indicated,
nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results
or financial position.

Organizational and other costs to be incurred in connection with
the Merger are not expected to be material.

2. Acquisition and Disposition of Assets

On November 1, 1993, GTE South Incorporated (the "Company") in a
series of transactions with ALLTEL Corporation exchanged its
telephone plant in service, materials and supplies and customers
(representing 244,000 access lines) in the State of Georgia for
similar assets (including 38,000 access lines) in Illinois and
$446 million in cash (the ALLTEL transaction). This transaction
was accounted for as a sale and a gain was recognized.

On December 31, 1993, the Company sold its telephone plant in
service, materials and supplies and customers (representing
123,000 access lines) in the states of West Virginia and
Tennessee to Citizens Utilities Company for $291 million in cash
(the Citizens transaction). This transaction was accounted for
as a sale and a gain was recognized.

The proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down $402
million of debt and pay $281 million of dividends to GTE
Corporation (GTE), the Company's parent. The remainder was
advanced to GTE in the form of an interest bearing loan.

The accompanying pro forma condensed income statements include
the operating results of the properties sold through the date of
sale. For comparability, the table below includes adjustments to
remove the operating results of those properties and to include
the operating results of properties acquired, including interest,
as if the ALLTEL and Citizens transactions occurred as of the
beginning of each period presented. Net income in 1993 also
excludes after-tax gains of $25,999 related to the ALLTEL and
Citizens transactions.
