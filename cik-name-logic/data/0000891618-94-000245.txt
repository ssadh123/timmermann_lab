ITEM 2. DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On November 16, 1994, the company and L M Ericsson, a Swedish
telecommunications company, formed a joint venture for the development,
manufacture, and marketing of fiber-optic communications systems for telephone
access networks worldwide. The joint venture, called "Ericsson Raynet," has
taken over and is continuing the operations of the company's Raynet subsidiary,
and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Ericsson Raynet has been
organized as a partnership under Delaware law; Raynet will hold the company's
interest in the joint venture. Ericsson representatives will constitute a
majority of the Board of Managers of the joint venture.

In forming the joint venture, Raychem sold certain specified assets of its
Raynet subsidiary to Ericsson in exchange for $40 million. Ericsson
contributed the purchased assets to the joint venture, and Raynet contributed
substantially all of its remaining assets and liabilities to the joint venture.
Funding of the joint venture will initially be provided by the partners,
generally 51% by Ericsson and 49% by Raynet.

During the first five to eight years of operation, subject to various
conditions, substantially all of the profits of the joint venture up to $156
million will be allocated to Raynet; thereafter profits of the joint venture
will be shared 51/49 by Ericsson and Raynet, respectively. Ericsson's share of
the joint venture's losses will be capped at $25 million for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1995. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, up to $19.6
million of losses will be allocated to Ericsson and Raynet in a 51/49 ratio;
additional losses, if any, of up to $10 million will be allocated 100% to
Raynet; and additional losses, if any, will again be allocated to Ericsson and
Raynet in a 51/49 ratio.

BellSouth Enterprises Inc. (BSE) had financed a portion of the software
development work at Raynet and held a royalty interest in the software related
revenues of Raynet. With the creation of the joint venture, this royalty
payment was reconfigured. Raychem is required to pay BSE $10 million in 1994,
and to make two additional payments of $10 million each over the next two
calendar years. Raychem has agreed to make other royalty payments to BSE
contingent upon the revenues and earnings performance of the joint venture. At
such time as the joint venture achieves profitability, these royalty payments
could approximate 36% of Raychem's distributions from the joint venture.

Ericsson has a right to purchase Raynet's interest in the joint venture at a
fixed price for a limited period beginning November 16, 1996; and Ericsson and
Raynet have call and put rights, respectively, on Raynet's interest in the
joint venture exercisable at fair market value at any time after July 1, 1999.
If any of these options are exercised, Raychem has agreed to pay BSE a portion
of the purchase price received.

due on or before the Closing Date, and all Taxes due with respect to the
Returns referred to in clause (i) have been paid in full, (iii) all
deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a result of examinations by the
Internal Revenue Service or the appropriate state, local or foreign taxing
authority of the Returns referred to in clause (i) have been paid in full, (iv)
no issues that have been raised by the relevant taxing authority in connection
with the examination of any of the Returns referred to in clause (i) are

by or requested with respect to any Taxes of Raynet or its subsidiaries.

(b) No tax is required to be withheld pursuant to Section
1445 of the Code as a result of the transfers described in Section 2.3 hereof.

(c) As a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, neither EHU nor JV will be obligated to or will assume any
obligation from Raynet or its subsidiaries to make a payment to an individual
that would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those
terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code without regard to whether such
payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be
performed in the future.

<PAGE> 23
(d) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.15, there are no liens
or security interests on any of the assets of Raynet that arose in connection
with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Taxes.

3.16. Employee Benefit Plans and Arrangements. (a) All
domestic benefit plans, contracts or arrangements (regardless of whether they
are funded or unfunded) covering current employees or former employees of
Raynet and domestic employees of Raynet International, Inc. (the "Employees"),
including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), and plans of deferred compensation (the "Benefit Plans"),
are listed in Schedule 3.16(a). True and complete copies of all Benefit Plans,
including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and insurance contracts
forming a part of any Benefit Plans, and all amendments thereto have been
provided or made available to Ericsson.

(b) All employee benefit plans, other than "multiemployer
plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, covering
Employees (the "Plans"), to the extent subject to ERISA, are in material
compliance with ERISA. Each Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA ("Pension Plan") and which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has been amended to
comply with the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, or will be amended
prior to the end of the remedial amendment period, and has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is not
aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter. There is no material pending or threatened litigation
relating to the Plans. To the best of their respective knowledge, neither
Raychem, Raynet nor any Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction with respect to
any Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of
the date hereof, could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax
or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA.

(c) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA
has been or is expected to be incurred by Raychem, Raynet or any Subsidiary
with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan",
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly
maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is
considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section
414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). Raychem, Raynet and the Subsidiaries

17
<PAGE> 24
have not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with
respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA
(regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No
notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required
to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month
period ending on the date hereof; provided that the transactions pursuant to
this Agreement may result in a reportable event, which the parties agree will
be timely filed.

(d) All contributions required to be made under the terms of
any Benefit Plan have been timely made or have been reflected on the Raynet
Closing Balance Sheet. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan
of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not
waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA
and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither Raychem,
Raynet nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide,
security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA
Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

(e) Prior to the events contemplated by this Agreement, none 
of the Benefit Plans was a multiemployer plan.

(f) Neither Raynet nor Raynet International, Inc. has any
obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Benefit Plan, except
as set forth on Schedule 3.16. There are no restrictions on the rights of
Raychem or Raynet or the Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any such Benefit
Plan without incurring any liability thereunder. All liabilities for retiree
medical and life benefits provided to employees retiring on or before the
Closing Date will remain the responsibility of Raychem.

3.17. Intellectual Property. Schedule 3.17 lists all
patents, trademarks, trade names, product names, service marks, copyrights and
applications for any of the foregoing included in Intellectual Property Rights
owned, licensed or used by Raynet or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise used
in or relating to their respective businesses. Except as set forth in Schedule
3.17, none of such Intellectual Property Rights has been assigned, transferred
or licensed by Raynet or any of its subsidiaries to or from any third party,
and such Intellectual Property Rights are owned free and clear of all
Encumbrances. All such Intellectual Property Rights registered with or issued
by the United States Patent and Trademark Office or any appropriate office in
other ju-

18
<PAGE> 25
risdictions have been duly registered and issued and such registrations and
issued patents have been properly maintained and/or renewed in accordance with
all applicable laws, rules and regulations and all fees associated therewith
have been paid. Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 3.17 and except for
possible interference proceedings of which Raychem and Raynet have no
knowledge, the validity, enforceability and exclusive right of Raynet and its
subsidiaries to such Intellectual Property Rights have not been challenged by
others, nor is there any pending or threatened claim involving any of such
Intellectual Property Rights. No other Person is infringing or has infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property Rights of
Raynet or any of its subsidiaries. Raynet has no knowledge of any
infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Intellectual Property
Right of any Person which might occur as a result of the continued operation by
JV of the business of Raynet and its subsidiaries as now conducted. No aspect
of the Intellectual Property Rights of Raynet and its subsidiaries is subject
to any outstanding order, ruling, decree, injunction, judgment or stipulation
by or with any court, arbitrator or administrative agency, or any restriction
or arrangement affecting the free and unrestricted use by Raynet or any

connection with the ownership or operation of their businesses, (iv) there are
no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, demands, claims, hearings,
investigations or proceedings pending or threatened, against Raynet or any of
its subsidiaries relating to any violation, or alleged violation, of any
Environmental Law, (v) no reports have been filed, or are re-

relating to any suit, settlement, court order, administrative order, regulatory
requirement, judgment or claim asserted or arising under any Environmental Law.

3.19. Insurance. Through insurance policies procured by
Raychem, Raynet and its subsidiaries maintain insurance on their respective
properties, business and personnel in amounts and covering such risks as
prudent managers in similar businesses in similar circumstances would maintain,
and accurate summaries of all such insurance policies (the "Insurance
Policies") have been made available to EGE. Schedule 3.19 contains an accurate
list of all Insurance Policies.

3.20. Disclosure. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
schedules or other attachments hereto contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits a material fact necessary to make the statements
contained herein or therein not misleading. All financial projections and
forecasts prepared by Raychem and/or Raynet and delivered to EGE have been
prepared in good faith using assumptions believed by Raychem and Raynet to be
reasonable, and nothing has come to

20
<PAGE> 27
the attention of Raychem or Raynet to cause them to believe that such
assumptions are no longer reasonable.

3.21. Permits, Licenses, Etc. Raynet and its subsidiaries
possess all material Permits currently required for the operation of their

cause a revocation or suspension of any material Permit.

otherwise expressly provided herein:

(a) Each Party and its Representatives (i) will keep all

counsel to such Party shall consider necessary in order to comply with SEC
regulations regarding disclosure, publicly announce any material development
relating to any of the foregoing without such prior consent (such consent not

severally liable for and indemnify EHU and JV for all income and franchise
Taxes imposed on Raynet in respect of the period from July 1, 1994 to the
Closing Date. The obligations of the parties set forth in this Section 5.6

5.7. Reasonable Best Efforts in Good Faith to Consummate.
Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, Ericsson, EGE, EHU,
Raychem and Raynet each hereby covenants to the others that it shall use its
reasonable best efforts in good faith to take or cause to be taken as promptly
as practicable all action necessary or desirable on its part to permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
cooperate fully with the others to that end. Raychem and Raynet will use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents, waivers and clearances of all
third parties necessary or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any contract, commitment or
other

28
<PAGE> 35
agreement relating to the Included Assets (an "Assigned Contract") is by its
terms or by virtue of its subject matter not assignable, or if Raynet has not
been able to obtain prior to Closing the consent required to assign any
Assigned Contract, and such Assigned Contract is not a contract marked on
Schedule 3.3 as a contract that must have been assigned on or before the
Closing Date, Raychem and Raynet agree to use their reasonable efforts after
the Closing to convey to JV the benefits thereof, including, without
limitation, at the reasonable request of EHU and in such manner as EHU shall
reasonably specify (so long as permitted by law and not in violation of the
Assigned Contract in question), taking all such reasonable action (including
without limitation appointing JV attorney-in-fact for Raynet or subcontracting
with JV to effect a "pass-through" of the rights and obligations that will
remain with Raynet) and doing or causing to be done all such things as shall be
reasonably necessary or proper (i) to assure that the rights and obligations of
Raynet under such Assigned Contract shall be preserved for the benefit of JV,
and (ii) to facilitate receipt of the consideration to be received by Raynet in
and under any such Assigned Contract, which consideration Raynet shall hold for
the benefit of, and upon request of JV shall deliver to, JV. To the extent
that any of the Included Assets are not capable of being validly assigned or
transferred without the consent or waiver of the other party thereto or the
issuer thereof, or if such assignment or transfer would constitute a breach
thereof or a violation of any law, decree, order or governmental regulation,
this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment or transfer thereof.

5.8. Filings. Ericsson and Raychem have filed Notification
and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall use their respective best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from
the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division for additional
information or documentation. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly take all such action as may be necessary
under United States Federal, state and other laws applicable to or necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and will file
and, if appropriate, use their reasonable efforts to have declared effective or
approved all documents and notifications with all governmental or regulatory
authorities that it deems necessary or appropriate for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to promptly take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate
under the laws and directives of

29
<PAGE> 36
the European Union for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

5.9. Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including fees and disbursements of financial advisors, accountants and
attorneys) shall be paid (i) by Raychem, if such costs or expenses are incurred
by or on behalf of Raychem or Raynet (and such costs and expenses shall not be
considered Included Liabilities if incurred by Raynet), and (ii) by Ericsson,
EGE or EHU, if such costs or expenses are incurred by or on behalf of Ericsson,
EGE or EHU.

5.10. Stamp Taxes, Duties, etc. All sales, transfer, filing,
recordation and similar taxes and fees (including all real estate transfer
taxes and conveyance and recording fees, if any), and all stamp taxes,
registration taxes, duties or other charges arising from or associated with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by Raynet and shall not be
included in the Included Liabilities.

(a) Employment. EHU shall cause JV to employ
substantially all persons who, immediately prior to the Closing Date,
are (i) active employees of Raynet and domestic employees of Raynet

leave due to jury duty, vacation, or annual two-week national military
duty, and (iii) employees of Raychem on short-term disability,
long-term disability, maternity or paternity leaves or leaves under
the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("Inactive Employees").

Such employment shall be comparable employment and shall be
effective as of the Closing Date (with the exception of employees in
category (iii) above who will only be employed effective once they
return actively to work, at the same base compensation rate and with
generally similar responsibilities as applicable to such employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Employees of Raynet and its
subsidiaries who become em-

31
<PAGE> 38
ployees of JV are hereinafter referred to as "Transferred Employees."

Transferred Employees shall be entitled to participate in
certain employee benefit arrangements to the extent pro- vided in
subsections (b) through (g) below.

(b) The Raychem Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall no
longer be available to any Transferred Employees effective as of the
Closing Date.

(c) Active participation by Transferred Employees in the
Taxsaver Investment Plan shall cease effective December 31, 1994.
Accounts of such employees shall remain in the Taxsaver Investment
Plan and be treated in accordance with the terms of that Plan.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto
agree that Raychem shall process the regular payrolls and perform all
other related payroll maintenance and human resources information
system functions as JV's agent with respect to the Transferred
Employees through December 31, 1994. Raychem shall provide the
Transferred Employees with benefits under all employee welfare benefit
plans within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA substantially the
same as those provided to the Transferred Employees immediately prior
to the Closing for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending
on December 31, 1994. In addition, Raychem shall be responsible for
all obligations and liabilities relating to each Inactive Employee
until such employee returns to work and becomes a Transferred Employee
in accordance with Section 5.15.(a) The Joint Venture shall reimburse
Raychem for the costs associated with such benefits on the same terms
and conditions as currently in effect, subject to the additional terms
in Section 5.15(g).

(e) Transferred Employees will continue to participate in
the Raychem Pension Plan for the period from the Closing Date through
December 31, 1994. Effective as of January 1, 1995, EHU or Ericsson
shall cover Transferred Employees who participated in the Raychem
Pension Plan under a defined benefit plan sponsored by EHU or Ericsson
or its affiliates. (Such Transferred Employees are referred to
hereinafter as the "Retirement Plan Employees.") The plan covering
the Retirement Plan Employees (the "Transferee Pension Plan") shall
(A) provide a benefit equal to the "frozen" accrued benefit of the
Retirement Plan Employees under the Raychem Pension Plan (whether
vested or unve-

32
<PAGE> 39
sted) as of December 31, 1994 (the "Frozen Benefit") and satisfy all
legal obligations associated with such Frozen Benefit, (B) grant
Retirement Plan Employees vesting service credit for service with JV
for purposes of vesting in the Frozen Benefit, (C) recognize for
purposes of vesting and eligibility thereunder the service of the
Retirement Plan Employees which was recognized under the Raychem
Retirement Plan, (D) entitle Retirement Plan Employees to earn benefit
service credit under the Transferee Pension Plan from the date of
entry and (E) provide, upon the transfer of assets referred to below,
that the accrued benefits of the Retirement Plan Employees under the
Transferee Pension Plan shall in no event be less than their accrued
benefits under the Raychem Pension Plan as of the Closing Date. The
Joint Venture shall reimburse Raychem in respect of the continued
participation of the Retirement Plan Employees for the period from the
Closing Date through December 31, 1994 at the rate of 4.35% of base
compensation for such Retirement Plan Employees (the same rate
currently in effect).

Raychem shall cause to be transferred from the trust under the
Raychem Retirement Plan to the trust under the Transferee Pension Plan
assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents, the value of which
shall be equal to (x) the "accumulated benefit obligation" (as defined
in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) of the
Retirement Plan Employees under such Raychem Retirement Plan as of
December 31, 1994, calculated using the actuarial assumptions
recommended by two actuaries selected by Ericsson and Raychem,
respectively, and approved by Ericsson and Raychem prior to Closing or
(y) no more than the amount permitted to be transferred in accordance
with Section 414(1) of the Code. With respect to the Raychem
Retirement Plan, the excess, if any, of the amount described in clause
(x) of the preceding sentence over the amount described in clause (y)
therein, is referred to herein as the "Pension Shortfall Amount". On
the date of any transfer from the Raychem Retirement Plan to the
Transferee Pension Plan, Raychem shall pay to EHU the Pension
Shortfall Amount, if any, in cash or cash equivalents.

The amount to be transferred shall be equitably adjusted to
take into account (i) benefit payments made from the Raychem
Retirement Plan to the Retirement Plan Employees after the Closing
Date but prior to the date of transfer, and (ii) actual turnover
patterns for five years following the Closing Date.

33
<PAGE> 40
(f) Effective as of January 1, 1995, EHU or Ericsson
shall, or shall cause JV to, provide Transferred Employees with
benefit arrangements that are substantially equivalent to the benefit
arrangements provided from time to time to employees of EGE ("Ericsson
Benefit Plans"). Transferred Employees shall be given credit under
the Ericsson Benefit Plans for service with Raynet and Raychem (to the
extent recognized under the Raychem Benefits Plans) for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and waiting periods, but in no event for purposes
of benefits accruals under the Transferee Pension Plan.

(g) In providing the services and benefits referred to in
Section 5.15(d) and the coverage referred to in Section 5.15(e),
Raychem agrees to act in a reasonable manner consistent with its
practices with respect to Raynet employees prior to the Closing Date.
The JV shall reimburse Raychem for all reasonable costs incurred by it
in providing such benefits and coverage during the period from the
Closing Date through December 31, 1994, as such costs are agreed upon
by Ericsson and Raychem, and to indemnify Raychem against and hold it
harmless from any claims made by or on behalf of Transferred Employees
with respect to the period from the Closing Date through December 31,
1994.

38
<PAGE> 45
and agreements of the Parties herein shall survive the Closing without any

8.2. Indemnification by Raychem and Raynet. Raychem and
Raynet hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless
Ericsson, EGE, EHU and JV (and each of their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns) on an
after-tax basis from and against any and all losses, obligations, deficiencies,
liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation
the amount of any settlement entered into pursuant hereto and all reasonable
legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the investigation,

(collectively, "Damages") which any such indemnified party may sustain, suffer
or incur directly or indirectly and which result from, arise out of, are caused
by or relate to (a) the breach by Raychem or Raynet of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by it in this Agreement or in any
agreement or instrument executed and delivered by it pursuant hereto or (b) any
liability not included in the Included Liabilities (which indemnification shall

the generality of preceding sentence, Raychem and Raynet hereby jointly and
severally agree to indemnify and hold Ericsson, EGE, EHU and JV (and each of
their respective directors, officers and Affiliates and their respective
successors and permitted assigns) harmless from and against any and all
damages, losses, liabilities, actions, claims, costs and expenses (including,

monitoring, and reasonable attorney's fees) directly or indirectly based upon,
arising out of, resulting from or relating to (i) any violation on or prior to
the Closing of any Environmental Law by Raynet or its subsidiaries or their
predecessors or any of their employees, representatives, agents or any other
person or entity acting on behalf of Raynet (including, without limitation, any
failure to obtain or comply with any permit, license or other approval or
authorization under the provisions of any Environmental Law), (ii) any and all
liabilities, obligations or claims under any Environmental Law arising out of
or otherwise in respect of any act, omission, event, condition or circumstance
occurring or existing in connection with the ownership or operation of the
business of Raynet or its subsidiaries or the Properties on or prior to the
Closing (including, without limitation, liabilities, obligations or claims
relating to (x) investigation, removal, remediation, containment, cleanup or
abatement of the presence, release or threatened release of any Hazardous
Substance,

39
<PAGE> 46
whether on-site or off-site, and (y) any claim by any third party, including,
without limitation, alleged non-compliance, tort suits for personal or bodily
injury, natural resource or property damage or injunctive relief) and (iii) any
and all expenditures required to be incurred by JV (x) to enable JV to operate
the business of Raynet as conducted on the Closing Date in compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws and (y) to repair and restore all damage to any
building, land or property of JV or any third party arising out of or relating
to the removal, remediation, cleanup or abatement of the actual or threatened
presence or release of any Hazardous Substance existing on or prior to the
Closing in connection with the ownership or operations of Raynet or any of its
subsidiaries or the Properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
contained in Section 3.18, neither Raychem nor Raynet shall have any
responsibility for liabilities under Environmental Law that arise or are
incurred or exist only after the Closing Date or liabilities for the use of
Hazardous Substances after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Raychem nor Raynet shall have any duty to provide indemnification
hereunder to the extent that the Insurance Policies included in the Included
Assets cover the Damages claimed. JV shall use its best efforts to secure all
available relief under such Insurance Policies.

8.3. Indemnification by Ericsson, EGE and EHU. Ericsson, EGE
and EHU hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless
Raychem, Raynet and JV (and each of their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns) on an
after-tax basis from and against any and all Damages which any such indemnified
party may sustain, suffer or incur directly or indirectly and which result
from, arise out of, are caused by or relate to the breach by Ericsson, EGE or
EHU of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it in this
Agreement or in any agreement or instrument executed and delivered by it
pursuant hereto.

8.4. Claims. Any claim for indemnity under Sections 8.2, or
8.3 hereof shall be made by written notice from the indemnified party to the
indemnifying party specifying in reasonable detail the basis of the claim.
When an indemnified party seeking indemnification under Sections 8.2 or 8.3
receives notice of any Third Party Claims which is to be the basis for a claim
for indemnification hereunder, the indemnified party shall give written notice
within a reasonable period thereof to the indemnifying party reasonably
indicating (to the extent known) the nature of such claims and the basis
thereof. Any failure by the indemnified party to provide such notice shall not
affect the indemnifying

40
<PAGE> 47
party's obligations hereunder, except to the extent of any material liability
caused by such delay. Upon notice from the indemnified party, the
indemnifying party may, but shall not be required to, assume the defense of any
such Third Party Claim, including its compromise or settlement, and the
indemnifying party shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses thereof and
shall be fully responsible for the outcome thereof; provided, however, that the
indemnifying party may not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without
the indemnified party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). The indemnifying party shall give written notice to
the indemnified party as to its intention to assume the defense of any such
Third Party Claim within ten (10) business days after the date of receipt of
the indemnified party's notice in respect of such Third Party Claim. If an
indemnifying party does not, within ten (10) business days after the
indemnified party's notice is given, give written notice to the indemnified
party of its assumption of the defense of the Third Party Claim, the
indemnifying party shall be deemed to have waived its rights to control the
defense thereof. If the indemnified party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim because of the failure of the indemnifying party to do so in
accordance with this Section 8.5, the indemnifying party shall pay all
reasonable costs and expenses of such defense and shall be fully responsible
for the outcome thereof. The indemnifying party shall have no liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement thereof effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

8.5. Limitation of Liabilities. Neither Raychem or Raynet,
on the one hand, nor Ericsson, EGE or EHU, on the other hand, shall be
obligated to provide indemnification under Section 8.2(a) or 8.3, respectively,
unless the aggregate amount of all claims for which any party is liable under
Section 8.2(a) or 8.3, respectively, exceeds $250,000, in which case such party
shall be liable for all such amounts. In no event shall the liability of
Raychem and Raynet, on the one hand, or Ericsson, EGE and EHU, on the other
hand, under this Article 8 exceed $10,000,000.

Income or Capital Account Net Losses is allocated to a Partner, every item of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit entering into the computation of such
Capital Account Net Income or Capital Account Net Losses or arising from the

be credited or charged to such Partner; provided, however, that any gain
treated as ordinary income pursuant to Sections 1245 or 1250 of the Code, or

allocated to the Partners who were allocated the corresponding depreciation
deductions.

14
<PAGE> 20

ratably on a daily basis, unless the Partners agree on another method permitted
under the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations.

Account Net Losses.

(a) Capital Account Net Income equals the sum of U.S. GAAP
Net Income and Capital Account Adjustments and shall be allocated to the
Partners as follows:

(i) U.S. GAAP Net Income shall be allocated 99.375% to Raynet
and .625% to EHU until the cumulative amount of U.S. GAAP Net Income
allocated to Raynet pursuant to this Section 4.2(a)(i) equals from
time to time, the cumulative amount distributed to Raynet pursuant to
Section 5.1(b)(i), and thereafter in accordance with each Partner's
respective Percentage Interest; and

(ii) Capital Account Adjustments shall be allocated according
to each Partner's respective Percentage Interest.

(b) Capital Account Net Losses equals the sum of U.S. GAAP
Net Losses and Capital Account Adjustments and shall be allocated to the
Partners as follows, and in the following order:

(i) U.S. GAAP Net Losses shall be allocated 100% to EHU until
the amount allocated to EHU pursuant to this Section 4.2(b)(i) equals
51% of the Stub Period Loss, if

15
<PAGE> 21
any, but in no event shall the amount allocated to EHU pursuant to
this Section 4.2(b)(i) exceed 51% of the Maximum Agreed Loss;

(ii) With respect to the 1995 Fiscal Year, U.S. GAAP Net
Losses shall be allocated 100% to EHU until the amount allocated
pursuant to this Section 4.2(b)(ii) equals 51% of the amount
determined by subtracting the Stub Period Loss, if any, from the
Maximum Agreed Loss, and thereafter 100% to Raynet;

(iii) With respect to the 1996 Fiscal Year, U.S. GAAP Net
Losses shall be allocated (A) according to each Partner's respective
Percentage Interest until the amount allocated pursuant to this
Section 4.2(b)(iii) equals $19,607,843 (plus the sum of Restructuring
Costs and Third-Party Interest incurred during the 1996 Fiscal Year),
(B) thereafter 100% to Raynet until the amount allocated pursuant to
this Section 4.2(b)(iii) equals $29,607,843 (plus the sum of
Restructuring Costs and Third-Party Interest incurred during the 1996
Fiscal Year) (51% of the amount, if any, allocated pursuant to this
clause B is the "Incremental Loss for 1996"), and thereafter according
to each Partner's respective Percentage Interest;

(iv) After the 1996 Fiscal Year, U.S. GAAP Net Losses shall
be allocated in accordance with each Partner's respective Percentage
Interest; and

purposes but not for purposes of crediting or charging Capital Accounts,
depreciation or gain or loss realized by the Partnership with respect to any
property that was contributed to the Partnership or that was held by the
Partnership at a time when the Book Value of the Partnership Assets was
adjusted, in a manner consistent with Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g), for allocations pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof, shall be
allocated between the Partners in a manner which takes into account the
differences between the adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes to the
Partnership of its interest in such property and the Agreed Value of such
interest at the time of its contribution or revaluation. In making such
allocations the Partnership shall use the method permitted by the Code and
Treasury Regulations which has the effect of minimizing the differences, if
any, between (i) the Capital Account Net Income or Capital Account Net Losses
allocated to EHU and (ii) the income or losses allocated to EHU for federal
income tax purposes. In particular, (i) depreciation, amortization, and other
cost recovery deductions reflecting the excess of the tax basis of the
Contributed Assets over their Agreed Value at the date of the Closing shall be
allocated to Raynet; (ii) Raynet's share of gain or loss upon a taxable
disposition of any or all of the Contributed Assets shall reflect such excess
tax basis, adjusted to account for allocations of deductions pursuant to clause
(i); and (iii) corresponding treatment shall apply in

17
<PAGE> 23
respect of property acquired by the Partnership to the extent that the tax
basis of such property reflects, in whole or in part, such excess tax basis of
any Contributed Property.

4.3. Adjustment to Capital Accounts. Immediately before any
distribution pursuant to Section 10.2(c)(iii) hereof, the Partnership shall
revalue the Capital Accounts by allocating gain or loss for Capital Account
purposes as if the Partnership sold all of its assets for Fair Market Value.
Such gain or loss shall be included in Capital Account Net Income or Capital
Account Net Losses and shall be allocated in accordance with Section 4.2 of
this Agreement.

withheld and paid over shall be deemed to have been distributed to such Partner
from whom any such amounts have been withheld.

their respective mailing addresses.

7.4. Officers of the Partnership. (a) The officers of the
Partnership shall consist of the Chief Executive Officer and such other

ARTICLE VIII

TRANSFER OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

8.1. Restrictions on Transfer. Except as otherwise set forth
in this Article VIII, neither Partner may Transfer or subject to any
Encumbrance all or any part of its Partnership Interest, except with the prior
written consent of the other Partner or as otherwise permitted by the terms of
this Agreement,

32
<PAGE> 38
and any attempt so to Transfer or subject to any Encumbrance any Partnership
Interest shall be void.

8.2. Intercompany Transfers. Each of EHU and Raynet may
Transfer all (but not less than all) of its Partnership Interest provided that
(i) the transferee is a direct or indirect subsidiary of Ericsson or Raychem,
as the case may be, and at least 80 percent of the total outstanding voting
securities of such subsidiary is held directly or indirectly by Ericsson or
Raychem, as the case may be, (ii) the transferee agrees in writing to be bound
by the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as the transferor, and (iii)
the transfer would not result in a termination of the Partnership under Section
708 of the Code. In the event that such a transfer is proposed, the transferor
shall notify the other Partner of the identity of such transferee and provide
such other information concerning the proposed transfer as the other Partner
may reasonably request. In the event a transfer is prohibited because it would
cause a termination of the Partnership under Section 708 of the Code, the
Partner that proposed such transfer may make it in two stages at least 12
months, but not more than 13 months, apart so long as such transfer does not
cause a termination. No transfer of a Partnership Interest by either Partner
in accordance with this Section 8.2 shall release the transferring Partner from
any of its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, and it shall remain
jointly and severally liable for all obligations and liabilities of the
transferee hereunder. Any permitted transferee pursuant to this Section 8.2
shall have the same rights and obligations as the applicable transferor.

33
<PAGE> 39
8.3. Transfers to Unaffiliated Persons; Right of First
Refusal. After July 1, 1999, each Partner may Transfer all (but not less than
all) of its Partnership Interest in accordance with this Section 8.3. In the
event either Partner (the "Selling Partner") desires to Transfer its
Partnership Interest (the "Offered Partnership Interest") to a third party (the
"Third Party Offeree"), it shall first offer to sell the Offered Partnership
Interest to the other Partner (the "Remaining Partner"), at a price and upon
terms no less favorable to the Remaining Partner than those offered by such
Third Party Offeree, by giving written notice (the "Offer Notice") to the
Remaining Partner of its desire to Transfer the Offered Partnership Interest,
the identity of such Third Party Offeree and the material terms of the proposed
Transfer of the Offered Partnership Interest. Within 30 days after receipt of
the Offer Notice, the Remaining Partner shall notify the Selling Partner in
writing as to whether it accepts or rejects such offer. In the event that the
Remaining Partner accepts such offer, it or its designee shall consummate the
acquisition of the Offered Partnership Interest no later than 180 days after
notifying the Selling Partner of its acceptance thereof. In the event that the
Remaining Partner rejects such offer, the Selling Partner shall have the right
to Transfer the Offered Partnership Interest to such Third Party Offeree
pursuant to the terms set forth in the Offer Notice unless within 20 days after
receipt of the Offer Notice, the Remaining Partner notifies the Selling Partner
in writing that it is withholding its consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) to the Transfer of the Offered

34
<PAGE> 40
Partnership Interest to such Third Party Offeree. The withholding of consent
shall be deemed to be reasonable if, and only if, it is based upon a reasonable
assessment of the financial strength of the Third Party Offeree. If the Third
Party Offeree shall not have consummated the acquisition of the Offered
Partnership Interest within 180 days following the rejection of such offer by
the Remaining Partner, then the provisions of this Section 8.3 shall again
apply.

8.4. Call Options.

(a) Raynet hereby grants to EHU the irrevocable option (the
"First Call Option"), to purchase and acquire from Raynet (or any transferee of
Raynet), on the terms set forth herein, all (but not less than all) of Raynet's
Partnership Interest, at an aggregate purchase price equal to the sum of (a)
$139,331,500 and (b) 51% of the Target Amount less (c) 51% of any distributions
previously made to Raynet pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(i). EHU may exercise the
First Call Option at any time during the period beginning at the second
anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on the 21st day thereafter by giving
notice in writing to Raynet, which notice shall specify a purchase date not
more than 30 days after the date of such notice. Payment shall be made in two
installments: at least one-half on the purchase date and the remainder on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date. The amount of the second installment
shall accrue interest at the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street
Journal, or its equivalent.

(b) Raynet hereby grants to EHU the irrevocable option (the 
"Second Call Option") to purchase and acquire from Raynet

35
<PAGE> 41
(or any transferee of Raynet), on the terms set forth herein, all (but not less
than all) of Raynet's Partnership Interest, at an aggregate purchase price (the
"Option Price") determined as set forth in Section 8.6. The Second Call Option
may be exercised by EHU at any time after July 1, 1999 by written notice (which
shall be irrevocable) of such exercise to Raynet. The Option Price shall be
determined and the purchase shall occur as provided in Section 8.6.

8.5. Put Option. EHU hereby grants to Raynet the
irrevocable option (the "Put Option") to require EHU to purchase and acquire
from Raynet (or any transferee of Raynet), on the terms set forth herein, all
(but not less than all) of Raynet's Partnership Interest at the Option Price.
The Put Option may be exercised by Raynet at any time after July 1, 1999 by
written notice (which shall be irrevocable) of such exercise to EHU. The
Option Price shall be determined and the purchase shall occur as provided in
Section 8.6

8.6. Determination of Option Price. In the event of any
exercise by EHU of the Second Call Option or by Raynet of the Put Option, EHU
and Raynet will use their best efforts to agree upon a valuation for the total
equity of the Partnership. If EHU and Raynet do not agree on such valuation
following three meetings during the 60 days after notice of exercise has been
given, then the Chief Executive Officers of Ericsson and Raychem, or their
personal designates (who shall be senior corporate executives), shall meet on
at least three occasions during the next succeeding 30 day period to attempt to
reach an agreement as to such valuation, which shall be based on the principles

36
<PAGE> 42
outlined below. If agreement is not reached after the above 60 and 30 day
periods, then each Chief Executive Officer will present to the other a final
valuation signed by the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officers
will then appoint a mutually agreeable investment bank, commercial bank or
other appraiser of recognized international standing with experience in the
valuation of United States business enterprises, which will serve as the
appraiser (at the joint expense of EHU and Raynet). The appraiser will have a
60 day period to value the equity of the Partnership as of the date of notice
of exercise consistent with the principles outlined below and shall determine
which of the two final valuations is closest to the fair market value of the
Partnership in the judgment of the appraiser, and such party's final valuation
shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the Partnership. The Option
Price shall be the fair market value of the Partnership as so determined
multiplied by the Percentage Interest of Raynet plus any amount determined
pursuant to paragraph (c) below. The appraiser shall follow the following
principles in determining the value of the Partnership Interest being sold:

(a) The appraiser shall determine the valuation of 100% of 
the equity of the Partnership.

(b) Subject to (c) below, the purchasing partner shall pay an 
amount equal to the product arrived at by multiplying the value in 
(a) above times the percentage ownership of the selling partner;
i.e., no minority discount shall be taken.

(c) If, at the time of the valuation, the cumulative income 
of the Partnership has not reached the Target Amount,

37
<PAGE> 43
the appraiser shall determine the fair market value of the Target
Amount, based upon the probability that the income of the Partnership
will reach the Target Amount before the Target Date and applying an
appropriate discount rate, and the payment amount calculated pursuant
to (b) above shall be adjusted by adding 51% of the fair market value
of the Target Amount to the amount payable to Raynet.

(d) The business shall be valued taking into account the 
benefits of any services provided by, any commercial relationships
with, or any technology licensed between the business and either of
the partners. The services, products or technology in question shall
be regarded as being available on a continuing basis, beyond the
purchase of the selling partner's equity. In no event shall the
commercial terms and conditions, termination provisions or transfer
rights or restrictions related to the specific services, products or
technologies by and between the partners and the business (however
limited in duration) be deemed to diminish the value of the business
provided, however, that the partners may agree in writing during the
life of the business to exclude certain services from the valuation
process.

(e) The appraiser shall be granted complete access to the
books, records and personnel of the business, and to such additional
information as it reasonably requests.

(f) The closing shall be held within 60 days of the date of 
the appraiser's determination. The purchasing party may decide, at
its sole election, to pay the purchase price

38
<PAGE> 44
either at the closing or in five equal annual principal installments:

(i) the unpaid portion shall accrue interest at a
variable rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall
Street Journal from time to time;

(ii) prepayment may be made at any time without
penalty; and

(iii) the balance shall be paid in full at the end
of the fifth year.

(g) The parties will cooperate in structuring the purchase 
transaction so as to maximize any tax and financial benefits
to both parties.

considered to have occurred with respect to a Partner (the "Defaulting
Partner") if:

continues for five days after such Partner has been given written
notice thereof by the other Partner or by the Board of Managers;

(b) Such Partner fails to perform or violates any other
material term or condition of this Agreement (other than as set forth
in subsection (a) above) and such failure or violation continues for
20 days after such Partner has been given written notice thereof by
the other Partner or

39
<PAGE> 45
the Board of Managers; provided that nothing herein shall limit the

(ii) to terminate the Partnership as provided in Section 10.1
hereof, in which event the affairs of the Partnership shall be wound

(b) The election of a remedy specified under Section 9.2(a)
hereof shall be made by giving notice (a "Default Notice") to the Defaulting
Partner at any time that the Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
If an election pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) hereof is made to seek an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief and a final judgment
in such action is rendered denying such equitable remedy, then, the
Non-Defaulting Partner may elect to pursue the remedy specified in Section
9.2(a)(ii) hereof to the extent such remedy is available unless, prior to the
giving of such notice, the Defaulting Partner has cured the Event of Default in
question in full and no other Event of Default with respect to such Partner

40
<PAGE> 46
has occurred and is continuing or the final judgment denying equitable relief
specifically held that there was no Event of Default.

(c) The election of any remedy pursuant to this Section 9.2
shall not for any purpose be deemed to be a waiver of any other remedy
available under applicable law.

(d) The Defaulting Partner shall be liable to the Partnership
and to the Non-Defaulting Partner for any and all losses, claims, damages,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and
tax costs) suffered or incurred by the Partnership or the Non-Defaulting
Partner as a result of such Event of Default.

determined pursuant to Section 8.6 hereof.

(b) Upon the giving of a Bankruptcy Notice, a determination
of the Fair Market Value of the Partnership Interest of the bankrupt Partner as

provided in this Agreement, no Partner, acting alone, shall have any authority
to act for, or undertake to assume any obligations or responsibility on behalf

liable for any indebtedness or obligation of any other Partner incurred either
before or after the execution of this Agreement, except as to those joint
responsibilities, liabilities, debts or obligations incurred or assumed
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, no Partner shall be under any obligation, as a fiduciary or

transaction or to take or omit to take any action, regardless of the interests
of the Partnership or the other Partner in respect of such transaction or
action, and the Members may approve or disapprove any such proposed transaction
or action in their sole and absolute discretion.

11.2. Waiver of Partition. Except as may be otherwise
provided by law in connection with the winding up, liquidation and dissolution

their Affiliates shall operate the Partnership in such a way as to maximize
sales and to optimize the profit opportunities of the Partnership. Nothing
