The pro forma information for the twelve-month period ended December 31,

("Old KG&E") into an acquisition subsidiary of Western Resources, Inc.
(Merger) which continued the name "Kansas Gas and Electric Company", as if it
had occurred on January 1, 1992, and was derived by combining the historical
information of Old KG&E for the three-month period ended March 31, 1992, with
that of the Company for the nine-month period ended December 31, 1992. No
purchase accounting adjustments were made for the period prior to the Merger
in determining pro forma amounts because such adjustments would be immaterial.
