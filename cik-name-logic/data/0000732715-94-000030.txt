Item 5. Other Events

On November 28, 1994, Illinois Bell Telephone Company (the "Company")
announced through its parent, Ameritech Corporation, that it will
discontinue the application of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 71 ("SFAS No. 71"), "Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation." As a result, the Company will record in
the fourth quarter an extraordinary noncash charge of approximately
$732.8 million after taxes.

Under SFAS No. 71, the Company had accounted for the effects of
regulation by depreciating telecommunications plant using asset lives
prescribed by regulators and deferring certain costs and recognizing
certain liabilities ("regulatory assets and liabilities").

Criteria that give rise to the discontinuance of SFAS No. 71 include
(1) increasing competition which restricts the Company's ability to
establish prices to recover specific costs, and (2) a significant
change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from cost-
based regulation to another form of regulation. The Company has
periodically reviewed these criteria and, in light of recent changes
in its competitive and regulatory environments, concluded that
continued application of SFAS No. 71 was no long appropriate.

As a result of the discontinuation of applying SFAS No. 71 the Company
recognized a noncash, after-tax extraordinary charge of $732.8 million
by reducing the net carrying value of its telecommunications plant and
eliminated regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance sheet. 
The adjustment to telecommunications plant was about $1,154.9 million
and was recorded as an increase to the accumulated depreciation
balance. The discontinuation of applying SFAS No. 71 does not affect
the accounting and reporting followed by the Company to state and
federal regulators.

When adjusting its net telecommunications plant, the Company gave
effect to shorter, more economically realistic lives.

In addition to the SFAS No. 71 discontinuance, the Company announced
that it will reduce certain asset values, primarily for real estate
that it plans to sell or no longer use in the business. The reduction
of $40.1 million after taxes, reflects the disposition value of these
assets. Disposition of these assets will not have a material effect
on the revenues or expenses of the Company in the future.
