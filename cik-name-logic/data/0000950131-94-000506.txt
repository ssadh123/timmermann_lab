enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement of such
terms may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by the availability of
equitable remedies.

consent of any other party or any consent, license, approval or
authorization from, or registration or declaration with, any governmental
authority, bureau or agency in connection with the execution, delivery,

any mortgage, indenture, contract or other agreement to which the Company
is a party or by which the Company may be bound.

e. Litigation. No litigation or administrative proceeding of or

Contract:

property has not been released from the lien of such Secured Contract.

obligation of the Obligor thereunder and is enforceable in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

e. No Defenses. The Contract is not subject to any right of
rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of
usury, and the operation of any of the terms of the Contract or the
exercise of any right thereunder will not render the Contract unenforceable
in whole or in part or subject to any right of rescission, setoff,
counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, and no such right
of rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with
respect thereto.

f. Insurance Coverage. The Company has been named as an additional
insured party under any hazard insurance on the property described in the
Contract, to the extent required by the Company's 

3-2
<PAGE>

underwriting guidelines. If the property described in the Contract is
located in a special flood area designated by HUD, the property is covered
by a flood insurance policy of the nature and, if such Contract is an FHA-
Insured Contract, in the amount required by the FHA Regulations.

g. FHA Insurance. If the Contract is an FHA-Insured Contract, such
Contract was originated in compliance with FHA Regulations and is insured,
without set-off, surcharge or defense, by FHA Insurance. Following the
assignment of such FHA-Insured Contract to the Trustee, the Trustee on
behalf of the Trust will be entitled to the full benefits of the FHA
Insurance.

h. Lawful Assignment. The Contract was not originated in and is not
subject to the laws of any jurisdiction whose laws would make the transfer

to the Trust, and has transferred all its right, title and interest in such
Contracts, including all rights the Company may have against the
originating contractor-seller with respect to Contracts originated by a
contractor-seller rather than the Company, to the Trust. The blanket

and binding obligation of the Company enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms.

applicable to the Contract, including, without limitation, usury and truth
in lending laws and (if such Contract is an FHA-Insured Contract) the FHA
Regulations have been complied with, and the Company shall for at least the
period of this Agreement, maintain in its possession, available for the
Trustee's inspection, and shall deliver to the Trustee upon demand,
evidence of compliance with all such requirements.

subordinated in whole or in part or rescinded, and, if such Contract is a
Secured Contract, the real estate securing such Contract has not been
released from the lien of such Contract in whole or in part.

Contract are genuine and all parties to the Contract had full legal
capacity to execute the Contract.

<PAGE>

m. Good Title. The Company is the sole owner of the Contract and, if
such Contract is an FHA-Insured Contract, because the Trustee is a lender
approved by HUD to originate and purchase Title I loans under a valid Title
I contract of insurance, has the authority to sell, transfer and assign
such Contract to the Trust under the terms of this Agreement. There has
been no assignment, sale or hypothecation of the Contract by the Company
except the usual past hypothecation of the Contract in connection with the
Company's normal banking transactions in the conduct of its business, which
hypothecation terminates upon sale of the Contract to the Trust. The
Company has good and marketable title to the Contract, free and clear of
any encumbrance, equity, loan, pledge, charge, claim, lien or encumbrance
of any type and has full right to transfer the Contract to the Trust.

n. No Defaults. As of the Cutoff Date, there was no default, breach,
violation or event permitting acceleration existing under the Contract and
no event which, with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period,
would constitute such a default, breach, violation or event permitting
acceleration under such Contract (except payment delinquencies permitted by
clause (b) above). The Company has not waived any such default, breach,
violation or event permitting acceleration except payment delinquencies
permitted by clause (b) above.

o. Equal Installments. The Contract has a fixed Contract Interest
Rate and provides for level monthly payments which fully amortize the loan
over its term.

p. Enforceability. If the Contract is a Secured Contract, such
Contract contains customary and enforceable provisions so as to render the
rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the realization
against the collateral of the benefits of the lien provided thereby.

Contract has been delivered to the Trustee or its custodian on or before
the Closing Date.

r. Genuine Documents. All documents submitted are genuine, and all
other representations as to each Contract, including the List of Contracts
delivered to the Trustee, are true and correct. Any copies of documents
provided by the Company are accurate and complete (except that, with
respect to each Contract that was originated by a contractor-seller rather
than the Company, the Company makes such representation and warranty only

SECTION 5.01. Responsibility for Contract Administration.

The Servicer will have the sole obligation to manage, administer, service
and make collections on the Contracts and perform or cause to be performed all
contractual and customary undertakings of the holder of the Contracts to the
Obligor. The Trustee, at the request of a Servicing Officer, shall furnish the
Servicer with any powers of attorney or other documents necessary or appropriate
to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties
hereunder. The Company is hereby appointed the Servicer until such time as any
Service Transfer shall be effected under Article VII.

SECTION 5.02. Standard of Care.

In managing, administering, servicing and making collections on the
Contracts pursuant to this Agreement, the Servicer will exercise that degree of
skill and care required by FHA (in the case of FHA-Insured Contracts) and
otherwise consistent with the highest degree of skill and care that the Servicer
exercises with respect to similar contracts (including manufactured housing
contracts) serviced by the Servicer; provided, however, that such degree of
skill and care shall be at least as favorable as the degree of skill and care
generally applied by servicers of home improvement retail installment contracts
and promissory notes for institutional investors.

SECTION 5.03. Records.

The Servicer shall, during the period it is servicer hereunder, maintain
such books of account and other records as will enable the Trustee to determine
the status of each Contract.

SECTION 5.04. Inspection.

a. At all times during the term hereof, the Servicer shall afford the
Trustee and its authorized agents reasonable access during normal business hours
to the Servicer's records relating to the Contracts, which have not previously
been provided to the Trust, and will cause its personnel to assist in any
examination of such records by the Trustee. The examination referred to in this
Section will be conducted in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with
the Servicer's normal operations or customer or employee relations. Without
otherwise limiting the scope of the examination the Trustee may make, the
Trustee may, using generally accepted audit procedures, verify the status of
each Contract and review the Electronic Ledger and records relating thereto for
conformity to Monthly Reports prepared pursuant to Article VI and compliance
with the standards represented to exist as to each Contract in this Agreement.

5-1

<PAGE>

b. At all times during the term hereof, the Servicer shall keep available
a copy of the List of Contracts at its principal executive office for inspection
by Certificateholders.

c. A Certificateholder holding Certificates representing in the aggregate
at least 5% of the Fractional Interest in the Trust shall have the rights of
inspection afforded to the Trustee pursuant to this Section 5.04.

SECTION 5.05. Collection Account.

a. On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall establish the
Collection Account on behalf of the Trust with an Eligible Institution. The
Servicer shall pay into the Collection Account as promptly as practicable (not
later than the next Business Day) following receipt thereof all amounts received
with respect to the Contracts, including all proceeds of FHA Insurance claims
received by the Servicer, other than extension fees and assumption fees, which
fees shall be retained by the Servicer as compensation for servicing the
Contracts. The Trustee shall pay into the Collection Account as promptly as
practicable all proceeds of FHA Insurance claims with respect to FHA-Insured
Contracts received by the Trustee. All amounts paid into the Collection Account
under this Agreement shall be held in trust for the Trustee, the
Certificateholders and the Subordinated Certificateholder until payment of any
such amounts is authorized under this Agreement. Only the Trustee may withdraw
funds from the Collection Account.

b. If the Servicer so directs, the Eligible Institution maintaining the
Collection Account shall, in the name of the Trustee in its capacity as such,
invest the amounts in the Collection Account in Eligible Investments that mature
not later than one Business Day prior to the next succeeding Payment Date. Once
such funds are invested, such Eligible Institution shall not change the
investment of such funds. All income and gain from such investments shall be
added to the Collection Account and distributed on such Payment Date pursuant to
Section 8.05(b). Losses, if any, realized on amounts in the Collection Account
invested pursuant to this paragraph shall first be credited against
undistributed investment earnings on amounts in the Collection Account invested
pursuant to this paragraph, and shall thereafter be deemed to reduce the amount
on deposit in the Collection Account and otherwise available for distribution to
Certificateholders and the Subordinated Certificateholder pursuant to Section
8.01. The Company and the Trustee shall in no way be liable for losses on
amounts invested in accordance with the provisions hereof. Funds in the
Collection Account not so invested must be insured to the extent permitted by
law by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "Eligible Investments" are
any of the following:

(i) direct obligations of, and obligations fully guaranteed by, the
United States of America, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the
Federal National Mortgage Association, or any agency or instrumentality of
the United States of America the obligations of which are backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America;

5_2

<PAGE>

(ii) (A) demand and time deposits in, certificates of deposit of,
bankers' acceptances issued by, or federal funds sold by any depository
institution or trust company (including the Trustee or any Affiliate of the
Trustee, acting in its commercial capacity) incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America or any state thereof and subject to
supervision and examination by federal and/or state authorities, so long
as, at the time of such investment or contractual commitment providing for
such investment, the commercial paper or other short-term debt obligations
of such depository institution or trust company (or, in the case of a
depository institution which is the principal subsidiary of a holding
company, the commercial paper or other short-term debt obligations of such
holding company) are rated at least A-1 by Standard & Poor's and (B) any
other demand or time deposit or certificate of deposit which is fully
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;

(iii) shares of an investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, whose shares are registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 and have the highest credit rating then available from Standard &
Poor's, and whose only investments are in securities described in clauses
(i) and (ii) above;

(iv) repurchase obligations with respect to (A) any security described
in clause (i) above or (B) any other security issued or guaranteed by an
agency or instrumentality of the United States of America, in either case
entered into with a depository institution or trust company (acting as
principal) described in clause (ii)(A) above;

(v) securities bearing interest or sold at a discount issued by any
corporation incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or
any State thereof which have a credit rating of at least A from Standard &
Poor's at the time of such investment; provided, however, that securities
issued by any particular corporation will not be Eligible Investments to
the extent that investment therein will cause the then outstanding
principal amount of securities issued by such corporation and held as part
of the corpus of the Trust to exceed 10% of amounts held in the Collection
Account; and

(vi) commercial paper having a rating of at least A-1 from Standard &
Poor's at the time of such investment or pledge as security.

The Trustee may trade with itself or an Affiliate in the purchase or sale
of such Eligible Investments.

SECTION 5.06. Enforcement.

a. The Servicer shall, consistent with customary servicing procedures,
act with respect to the Contracts in such manner as will maximize the receipt of
principal and interest on such Contracts and liquidation proceeds with respect
to Liquidated Contracts. The Company shall pay all FHA Insurance premiums

5-3
<PAGE>

required by FHA Regulations in respect of FHA-Insured Contracts; if the Company
is no longer the Servicer and fails to pay such FHA Insurance premiums, the
successor Servicer shall pay such premiums and shall be entitled to
reimbursement therefor in accordance with Section 8.06. The Servicer shall
comply with FHA Regulations in servicing FHA-Insured Contracts so that the
related FHA Insurance remains in full force and effect, except for good-faith
disputes relating to FHA Regulations or such FHA Insurance.

b. In accordance with the standard of care specified in Paragraph 5.02,
the Servicer may, in its own name, if possible, or as agent for the Trust,
commence proceedings for the foreclosure of any subject real estate, and may
(with respect to an FHA-Insured Contract) submit a claim to FHA in lieu of
commencing foreclosure proceedings, or may take such other steps that in the
Servicer's reasonable judgment will maximize liquidation proceeds with respect
to the Contract, including, for example, the sale of the Contract to a third
party for foreclosure or enforcement and, in the case of any default on a
related prior mortgage loan, the advancing of funds to correct such default and
the advancing of funds to pay off a related prior mortgage loan, which advances
are liquidation expenses that will be reimbursed to the Servicer out of related
liquidation proceeds before the related Net Liquidation Proceeds are paid to
Certificateholders and the Subordinated Certificateholder. The Servicer shall
also deposit in the Collection Account any Net Liquidation Proceeds received in
connection with any Contract which became a Liquidated Contract in a prior Due
Period.

c. The Servicer may sue to enforce or collect upon Contracts, in its own
name, if possible, or as agent for the Trust. If the Servicer elects to
commence a legal proceeding to enforce a Contract, the act of commencement shall
be deemed to be an automatic assignment of the Contract to the Servicer for
purposes of collection only. If, however, in any enforcement suit or legal
proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce a Contract on the ground
that it is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the
Contract, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall, at the Servicer's expense,
take such steps as the Servicer deems necessary to enforce the Contract,
including bringing suit in its name or the names of the Certificateholders and
the Subordinated Certificateholder.

d. The Servicer may grant to the Obligor on any Contract any rebate,
refund or adjustment out of the Collection Account that the Servicer in good
faith believes is required because of prepayment in full of the Contract. The
Servicer will not permit any rescission or cancellation of any Contract.

e. The Servicer may enforce any due-on-sale clause in a Contract if such
enforcement is called for under its then current servicing policies for
obligations similar to the Contracts, provided that such enforcement is
permitted by applicable law and will not adversely affect any applicable
insurance policy. If an assumption of a Contract is permitted by the Servicer,
upon conveyance of the related property the Servicer shall use its best efforts
to obtain an assumption agreement in connection therewith.

5-4

<PAGE>

f. If, following the termination of the Trust pursuant to Section 12.04,
HUD demands reimbursement of an FHA Insurance claim paid on an FHA-Insured
Contract prior to the termination of the Trust, the Servicer agrees that it will
not seek to recover any such amount from the Trustee or the Certificateholders.

g. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Servicer shall not agree to the modification or waiver of any provision of a
Contract, if such modification or waiver would be treated as a taxable exchange
under Section 1001 of the Code or any proposed, temporary or final Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

SECTION 5.07. Trustee to Cooperate.

a. Upon payment in full on any Contract, the Servicer will notify the
Trustee and the Company (if the Company is not the Servicer) on the next
succeeding Payment Date by certification of a Servicing Officer (which
certification shall include a statement to the effect that all amounts received
in connection with such payments which are required to be deposited in the
Collection Account pursuant to Section 5.05 have been so deposited) and shall
request delivery of the Contract and Contract File to the Servicer. Upon
receipt of such delivery and request, the Trustee shall promptly release or
cause to be released such Contract and Contract File to the Servicer. Upon
receipt of such Contract and Contract File, each of the Company (if different
from the Servicer) and the Servicer is authorized to execute an instrument in
satisfaction of such Contract and to do such other acts and execute such other
documents as the Servicer deems necessary to discharge the Obligor thereunder
and eliminate any lien on the related real estate. The Servicer shall determine
when a Contract has been paid in full; to the extent that insufficient payments
are received on a Contract credited by the Servicer as prepaid or paid in full
and satisfied, the shortfall shall be paid by the Servicer out of its own funds
and deposited in the Collection Account.

b. If the Servicer elects to submit a claim to FHA under the FHA
Insurance in respect of an FHA-Insured Contract and payment is received from
FHA, the Servicer shall notify the Trustee and the Company (if the Company is
not the Servicer) on the next succeeding Payment Date by certification of a
Servicing Officer (which certification shall include a statement to the effect
that all amounts received in connection with such payments which are required to
be deposited in the Collection Account pursuant to Section 5.05 have been so
deposited) and shall request delivery of the Contract and Contract File to the
Servicer. Upon receipt of such delivery and request, the Trustee shall promptly
release or cause to be released such Contract and Contract File to the Servicer.

c. From time to time as appropriate for servicing, foreclosing, and
making a claim for FHA Insurance coverage in connection with an FHA-Insured
Contract, the Trustee shall, upon written request of a Servicing Officer and
delivery to the Trustee of a receipt signed by such Servicing Officer, cause the
original Contract and the related Contract File to be released to the Servicer
and shall execute such documents as the Servicer shall deem necessary to the
prosecution of any such 

5-5
<PAGE>

proceedings. Upon request of a Servicing Officer, the Trustee shall perform such
other acts as reasonably requested by the Servicer and otherwise cooperate with
the Servicer in enforcement of the Certificateholders' rights and remedies with
respect to Contracts.

d. The Servicer's receipt of a Contract and/or Contract File shall
obligate the Servicer to return the original Contract and the related Contract
File to the Trustee when its need by the Servicer has ceased unless the Contract
shall be liquidated or repurchased as described in Section 3.05 or 8.06.

SECTION 5.08. Costs and Expenses.

Except as provided in Section 8.05(b) for the reimbursement of Advances,
all costs and expenses incurred by the Servicer in carrying out its duties
hereunder (including payment of FHA Insurance premiums, payment of the Trustee's
fees pursuant to Section 11.06, fees and expenses of accountants and payments of
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of Contracts
(including enforcement of Contracts and foreclosures upon real estate securing
any such Contracts) and all other fees and expenses not expressly stated
hereunder to be for the account of the Trust) shall be paid by the Servicer and
the Servicer shall not be entitled to reimbursement hereunder, except that the
Servicer shall be reimbursed out of the liquidation proceeds of a Liquidated
Contract (including FHA Insurance proceeds) for customary out-of-pocket
liquidation expenses incurred by it. The Servicer shall not incur such
liquidation expenses unless it determines in its good faith business judgment
that incurring such expenses will increase the Net Liquidation Proceeds on the
related Contract. The Servicer's out-of-pocket liquidation expenses in
connection with the submission of a claim to FHA currently do not exceed $100
per Contract.

SECTION 5.09. Maintenance of Insurance.

The Servicer shall at all times keep in force a policy or policies of
insurance covering errors and omissions for failure to maintain insurance as
required by this Agreement, and a fidelity bond. Such policy or policies and
such fidelity bond shall be in such form and amount as is generally customary
among persons who service a portfolio of home improvement loans having an
aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or more, and which are generally
regarded as servicers acceptable to institutional investors. The Servicer shall
cause to be maintained with respect to any real property securing an FHA-Insured
Contract such hazard insurance and flood insurance as may be required by the FHA
Regulations, it being understood that at the Closing Date hazard insurance was
not required to be maintained under the FHA Regulations. The Servicer shall
cause to be maintained with respect to the real property securing a conventional
Contract hazard insurance (excluding flood insurance coverage) if such
conventional Contract is secured by a first priority mortgage, deed of trust or
security deed or the initial principal balance of such conventional Contract
exceeds $20,000.

SECTION 5.10 Merger or Consolidation of Servicer.

Any Person into which the Servicer may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party shall be the successor of
the Servicer hereunder, provided such Person shall be an Eligible Servicer,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. The
Servicer shall promptly notify Standard & Poor's in the event it is a party to
any merger, conversion or consolidation.

SECTION 7.02. Transfer.

a. If an Event of Termination has occurred and is continuing, either the
Trustee or Certificateholders with aggregate Fractional Interests representing
25% or more of the Trust, by notice in writing to the Servicer (and to the
Trustee if given by the Certificateholders) may terminate all (but not less than
all) of the Servicer's management, administrative, servicing and collection
functions (such termination being herein called a "Service Transfer"). On
receipt of such notice (or, if later, on a date designated therein), all
authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect
to the Contracts, the Contract Files or otherwise (except with respect to the
Collection Account, the transfer of which shall be governed by Section 7.06),
shall pass to and be vested in the Trustee pursuant to and under this Section
7.02; and, without limitation, the Trustee is authorized and empowered to
execute and deliver on behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise,
any and all documents and other instruments, and to do any and all acts or
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination. The Trustee shall cause all assignments of mortgages, deeds of
trust or security deeds securing Secured Contracts to be duly recorded. If the
Servicer was the lender of record for purposes of the FHA Insurance relating to
FHA-Insured Contracts, the Trustee shall notify HUD of such termination and
shall request that HUD transfer the FHA Insurance reserves allocable to such
Contracts to the successor Servicer; provided, however, that if the Trustee is
the successor Servicer, the Trustee shall request such transfer of reserves if
and to the extent it is legally able to do so, and the Trustee shall use its
best efforts to obtain any approvals that may be required for the Trustee to
receive such transfer of reserves. Each of the Company and the Servicer agrees
to cooperate with the Trustee in effecting the termination of the
responsibilities and rights of the Servicer hereunder, including, without
limitation, the transfer to the Trustee for administration by it of all cash
amounts which shall at the time be held by the Servicer for deposit, or have
been deposited by the Servicer, in the Collection Account, or for its own
account in connection with its services hereafter or thereafter received with
respect to the Contracts, and the transfer of all rights under FHA Insurance
relating to FHA-Insured Contracts. The Servicer shall transfer to the new
servicer (i) the Servicer's records relating to the Contracts in such electronic
form as the new servicer may reasonably request and (ii) any Contract Files in
the Servicer's possession.

SECTION 7.03. Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

On and after the time the Servicer receives a notice of termination
pursuant to Section 7.02, the Trustee shall be the successor in all respects to
the Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this Agreement and the
transactions set forth or provided for herein and shall be subject to all the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer
by the terms and provisions hereof, and the Servicer shall be relieved of such
responsibilities, duties and liabilities arising after such Service Transfer;
provided, however, that (i) the Trustee will not assume any obligations of the
Company pursuant to Section 3.05, and (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for
any acts or omissions of the Servicer occurring prior to such Service Transfer
or for any breach by the Servicer of any of its obligations contained herein 

7-2

<PAGE>

or in any related document or agreement. As compensation therefor, the Trustee
shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation out of the Monthly
Servicing Fee. Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may, if it shall be
unwilling so to act, or shall, if it is legally unable so to act, appoint, or
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, an Eligible Servicer as
the successor to the Servicer hereunder in the assumption of all or any part of
the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Servicer hereunder. Pending
appointment of a successor to the Servicer hereunder, unless the Trustee is
prohibited by law from so acting, the Trustee shall act in such capacity as
hereinabove provided. In connection with such appointment and assumption, the
Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
payments on Contracts as it and such successor shall agree; provided, however,
that no such monthly compensation shall, without the written consent of 100% of
the Certificateholders, exceed 1/12 of .75% of the Principal Balance. The
Trustee and such successor shall take such action, consistent with this
Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.

SECTION 7.04. Notification to Certificateholders and the Subordinated

Certificate Register.

Contracts after the effective date of the Service Transfer.

b. After the Service Transfer, the replaced Servicer shall have no
further obligations with respect to the management, administration, servicing or
collection of the Contracts and the new Servicer shall have all of such

receipt and in the same form in which received, any amounts (properly endorsed
where required for the new Servicer to collect them) received as payments upon

PAYMENTS
--------

SECTION 8.01. Monthly Payments.

a. Subject to the terms of this Article VIII, each holder of a
Certificate as of a Record Date shall be paid on the next succeeding Payment
Date by check mailed to such Certificateholder at the address for such
Certificateholder appearing on the Certificate Register (or, if such
Certificateholder holds Certificates with an aggregate initial Principal Balance
of at least $1,000,000 and so requests, by wire transfer pursuant to
instructions delivered to the Trustee at least 10 days prior to such Payment
Date), the sum equal to such Certificateholder's Fractional Interest of Monthly
Interest and Monthly Principal. The Cash Collateral Trustee, as the sole
Subordinated Certificateholder, shall be paid, not later than 2:00 P.M., New
York City time, on each Payment Date, by wire transfer pursuant to instructions
delivered to the Trustee at least 10 days prior to such Payment Date, an amount
equal to the difference between (i) Available Funds and (ii) the sum of the
amounts specified in Section 8.05(b)(1) - (5). Final payment of any Certificate
or the Subordinated Certificate shall be made only upon presentation of such
Certificate or the Subordinated Certificate at the office or agency of the
Paying Agent.

b. Each distribution with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate shall be
paid to the Depository, which shall credit the amount of such distribution to
the accounts of its Depository Participants in accordance with its normal
procedures. Each Depository Participant shall be responsible for disbursing
such distribution to the Certificate Owners that it represents and to each
indirect participating brokerage firm (a "brokerage firm" or "indirect
participating firm") for which it acts as agent. Each brokerage firm shall be
responsible for disbursing funds to the Certificate Owners that it represents.
All such credits and disbursements with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate are
to be made by the Depository and the Depository Participants in accordance with
the provisions of the Book-Entry Certificates. Neither the Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar nor the Company shall have any responsibility therefor
except as otherwise provided by applicable law. To the extent applicable and
not contrary to the rules of the Depository, the Trustee shall comply with the
provisions of the form of the Certificates as set forth in Exhibit A hereto.

c. The Trustee shall appoint an Eligible Institution to be the paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") and cause it to make the payments to the
Certificateholders required hereunder. The Trustee initially appoints its
corporate trust operations department, with an office at 180 East 5th Street,
Third Floor, St. Paul, Minnesota 55101, Attention: Corporate Trust Operations,
as such Paying Agent. The Trustee shall require the Paying Agent (if other than
the Trustee) to agree in writing that all amounts held by the Paying Agent for
payment hereunder will be held in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders and that it will notify the Trustee of any failure by the
Servicer to make funds available to the Paying Agent for the payment of amounts
due on the Certificates.

<PAGE>

SECTION 8.02. Advances.

a. Not later than one Business Day following the Determination Date, the
Servicer shall advance all Delinquent Payments for the immediately preceding Due
Period by depositing the aggregate amount of such Delinquent Payments in the
Collection Account; provided, however, that the Servicer shall be obligated to
advance Delinquent Payments only to the extent that the Servicer, in its sole
discretion, expects to be able to recover such advances from subsequent
collections, including Net Liquidation Proceeds and (in the case of FHA-Insured
Contracts) proceeds of FHA Insurance, on the related Contracts. If the Servicer
fails to advance all Delinquent Payments required under this Section 8.02, the
Trustee shall be obligated to advance such Delinquent Payments pursuant to
Section 11.16.

b. The Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of an Advance from
subsequent collections on the related Contract, including Net Liquidation
Proceeds and (in the case of FHA-Insured Contracts) proceeds of FHA Insurance,
in accordance with Section 8.05(b). If the Servicer determines in good faith
that any Advance has become an Uncollectible Advance, the Servicer will be
entitled to reimbursement of such Uncollectible Advance from the Collected
Amount and from the Cash Collateral Guaranty in accordance with Section 8.05(b).

SECTION 8.03. Cash Collateral Guaranty Coverage of Shortfalls.

If the Monthly Report as of any Determination Date indicates that (a) the
sum of (i) the Collected Amount plus (ii) any Advances that will be deposited in
the Collection Account by the Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, plus (iii)
the aggregate of the Repurchase Prices for Contracts to be repurchased by the
Company in respect of such Determination Date pursuant to Section 3.05, is less
than (b) the aggregate amount payable on the immediately following Payment Date
pursuant to Section 8.05(b)(1)-(5) (such difference being hereinafter referred
to as a "Shortfall"), then the Trustee shall, on the Business Day preceding such
Payment Date, make a demand under the Cash Collateral Guaranty in the full
amount of such Shortfall. The Trustee will pay into the Collection Account the
full amount received pursuant to such demand, which will be an amount equal to
the lesser of the Shortfall and the Available Cash Collateral Amount.

SECTION 8.04. Limited Guaranty.

a. If the Monthly Report as of any Determination Date indicates a
Shortfall and the Available Cash Collateral Amount equals zero (or an amount
less than the amount of such Shortfall), then, if the Company is the Servicer,
the Company shall pay into the Collection Account not later than one Business
Day after such Determination Date the lesser of (a) such Shortfall (or the
amount by which the Shortfall exceeds the Available Cash Collateral Amount), or
(b) the Guaranty Amount. If the Company is not the Servicer, the Servicer shall
deliver to the Company, no later than one Business Day after such Determination
Date, a written demand that the Company pay under the Limited Guaranty the
amount specified in the preceding sentence; upon receipt of such demand, the
Company 

8-2

<PAGE>

shall pay such amount into the Collection Account not later than two Business
Days before the related Payment Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the obligation of the Company under this Section shall not
terminate upon a Service Transfer pursuant to Article VII.

b. On any Payment Date the Company shall be obligated pursuant to the
Limited Guaranty only up to the Guaranty Amount. The "Guaranty Amount" shall
equal:

(i) $544,000 prior to the first Payment Date under this Agreement.

(ii) Thereafter, on any Payment Date, the lesser of (A) $544,000 minus
all payments made prior to such Payment Date pursuant to Section 8.04(a) or
(B) 1% of the aggregate principal balance of FHA-Insured Contracts
immediately prior to such Payment Date.

SECTION 8.05. Payments.

a. On each Determination Date the Servicer shall determine the following
amount of funds (the "Available Funds"): (i) the Collected Amount as of such
Determination Date; plus (ii) an amount equal to the sum of (1) the aggregate
amount of Advances that will be deposited in the Collection Account by the
Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, pursuant to Section 8.02 or 11.16, (2)
the amount to be deposited by the Trustee in the Collection Account pursuant to
a demand under the Cash Collateral Guaranty in accordance with Section 8.03, (3)
the amount to be deposited by the Company in the Collection Account pursuant to
the Limited Guaranty in accordance with Section 8.04, and (4) the aggregate of
the Repurchase Prices for Contracts to be repurchased by the Company in respect
of such Determination Date pursuant to Section 3.05.

b. On each Payment Date the Trustee shall apply the Available Funds (as
determined on the immediately preceding Determination Date) in the Collection
Account to make payment in the following order of priority:

1. to pay Monthly Interest to the Certificateholders;

2. to pay Monthly Principal to the Certificateholders;

3. to pay the Servicer the Monthly Servicing Fee or such other
compensation owed to the Servicer pursuant to Section 7.03;

4. to reimburse the Trustee or any successor Servicer for any
payments of FHA Insurance premiums in respect of FHA-Insured Contracts not
paid by the Company and for which the Trustee or such successor Servicer
has not been reimbursed by the Company;

5. to reimburse the Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, for prior
Advances that have been recovered and for any Uncollectible Advances; and

8-3

<PAGE>

6. to pay the remainder, if any, of the Available Funds to the
Subordinated Certificateholder for disposition in accordance with the Cash
Collateral Trust Agreement.

c. If the Trustee shall not have received the applicable Monthly Report
by any Payment Date, the Trustee shall distribute all funds then in the
Collection Account to Certificateholders as Monthly Interest and then Monthly
Principal, to the extent of such funds, on such Payment Date.

d. The Trustee hereby acknowledges the security interest of the Cash
Collateral Depositor as of the Closing Date created pursuant to the Loan
Agreement, dated as of March 1, 1994, among the Company, the Cash Collateral
Depositor and the Cash Collateral Trustee as the same may be amended from time
to time (the "Loan Agreement"), in and to all rights of the Company to receive
the Monthly Servicing Fee under this Agreement. The Trustee agrees that,
following receipt of written notice from the Cash Collateral Depositor that
under the terms of the Loan Agreement the Monthly Servicing Fee otherwise
payable to the Company, in its capacity as Servicer, should thereafter be paid
to the Cash Collateral Depositor, any payments that would otherwise be paid to
the Company under Section 8.05 shall instead be paid directly to the Cash
Collateral Depositor and the Trustee shall hold such amounts, prior to payment
thereof to the Cash Collateral Depositor, as agent and bailee of the Cash
Collateral Depositor, until the Cash Collateral Depositor shall have notified
the Trustee that the Cash Collateral Depositor is no longer entitled to such
payments pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement.

SECTION 8.06. Reassignment of Repurchased Contracts.

Upon receipt by the Trust by deposit in the Collection Account of the
Repurchase Price under Section 3.05, and upon receipt of a certificate of a
Servicing Officer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I, the Trustee shall
convey and assign to the Company all of the Certificateholders' and the
Subordinated Certificateholder's right, title and interest in the repurchased
Contract without recourse, representation or warranty, except as to the absence
of liens, charges or encumbrances created by or arising as a result of actions
of the Trustee. Upon such deposit of the Repurchase Price, the Servicer shall
be deemed to have released any claims to such Contract as a result of Advances
with respect to such Contract.

SECTION 8.07. Servicer's Repurchase Option.

a. The Trust created hereby and the respective obligations and
responsibilities of the Company, the Servicer and the Trustee created hereby
(other than the responsibility of the Trustee to make any final distributions to
Certificateholders as set forth below) shall terminate upon the earlier of (1)
the later of the final payment or other liquidation of the last Contract
remaining in the Trust or the Termination of the Trust pursuant to
Section 12.04, or (2) the purchase by the Servicer of all of the Contracts and
all property acquired in respect of any Contract remaining in the Trust at a
price equal to the greatest of:

8-4

<PAGE>

A. the sum of (x) 100% of the principal balance of each Contract
(other than any Contract as to which title to the underlying property has
been acquired and whose fair market value is included pursuant to clause
(y) below), together with accrued and unpaid interest on each such Contract
at the Pass-Through Rate, plus (y) the fair market value of such acquired
property (as determined by the Servicer as of the close of business on the
third Business Day next preceding the date upon which notice of any such
termination is furnished to Certificateholders pursuant to Section 12.04),

B. the aggregate fair market value (as determined by the Servicer as
of the close of business on such third Business Day) of all of the assets
of the Trust, and

C. the remaining Principal Balance as of the close of business on
such third Business Day;

b. The purchase by the Servicer of all of the Contracts pursuant to
Section 8.07(a)(2) above shall be at the option of the Servicer, but shall be
conditioned upon (1) the Principal Balance, at the time of any such purchase,
aggregating less than 10% of the Initial Principal Balance, and (2) the Servicer
having provided the Trustee and the Depository (if any) with at least 30 days'
written notice. If such option is exercised, the Servicer shall provide to the
Trustee the certification required by Section 12.04, and the Trustee shall
promptly sign such certification and release to the Servicer the Contract Files
pertaining to the Contracts being repurchased.

ARTICLE IX

THE CERTIFICATES AND THE SUBORDINATED CERTIFICATE
-------------------------------------------------

SECTION 9.01. The Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate.

The Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate shall be substantially in
the forms set forth in Exhibits A and H, respectively, and shall, on original
issue, be executed by manual or facsimile signature of the Company by any one of
its President, Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer or other authorized
officers and authenticated by the Trustee to or upon the order of the Company
upon receipt. The Certificates shall be evidenced by (i) one or more
Certificates representing $134,096,000 initial aggregate principal balance,
beneficial ownership of such Certificates to be held through Book-Entry
Certificates in minimum dollar denominations of $1,000 and integral dollar
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) a single Certificate
representing $835.87 in initial principal balance. The Subordinated Certificate
shall be issuable in the form of a single certificate.

The Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate shall be authenticated by
manual signature on behalf of the Trustee by a duly authorized Responsible
Officer or authorized signatory. Certificates or the Subordinated Certificate
bearing the signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers
of the Trustee shall bind the Trustee, notwithstanding that such individuals or
any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and
delivery of such Certificate or the Subordinated Certificate or did not hold
such offices at the date of such Certificates or the Subordinated Certificate.
No Certificate or Subordinated Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit
under this Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, unless such Certificate or
Subordinated Certificate has been authenticated by manual signature in
accordance with this Section, and such signature upon any Certificate or the
Subordinated Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence,
that such Certificate or the Subordinated Certificate has been duly
authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Certificates and the Subordinated
Certificate shall be dated the date of their authentication, except for those
Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate authenticated on the Closing Date,
which shall be dated the Closing Date.

SECTION 9.02. Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Certificates and
the Subordinated Certificate.

a. The Trustee shall keep at the office or agency to be maintained in
accordance with Section 12.02 a "Certificate Register" in which the Trustee
shall provide for the registration of Certificates and the Subordinated
Certificate and of transfers and exchanges of Certificates and the Subordinated
Certificate as herein provided. The Trustee initially appoints itself to be the
"Certificate Registrar" and transfer agent for the purpose of registering
Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate and transfers and exchanges of
Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate as provided herein. The Trustee
will give prompt written notice to 

9-1

<PAGE>

Certificateholders, the Subordinated Certificateholder and the Servicer of any
change in the Certificate Registrar.

b. (1) No transfer of a Certificate by, on behalf of or with plan assets
of any employee benefit plan, trust or account that is subject to ERISA, or
that is described in Section 4975(e)(i) of the Code (each, a "Plan") will
be registered unless the transferee, at its expense, delivers to the
Trustee, the Servicer and the Company an opinion of counsel (satisfactory
to the Trustee, the Servicer and the Company) that the purchase and holding
of a Certificate by, on behalf of, or with Plan assets of such Plan is
permissible under applicable law, will not result in the assets of the
Trust being deemed to be Plan assets and subject to the prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and will not subject the
Trustee, the Trust, the Company or the Servicer to any obligation or
liability in addition to those undertaken in this Agreement. Unless such
opinion is delivered, each person acquiring a Certificate will be deemed to
represent to the Trustee, the Company and the Servicer that such person is
neither a Plan, nor acting on behalf of a Plan, nor purchasing with Plan
assets of any Plan.

(2) No transfer of the Subordinated Certificate shall be made by the
Subordinated Certificateholder or any other Person, except to a successor
Cash Collateral Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Cash Collateral Trust
Agreement.

c. At the option of a Certificateholder, Certificates may be exchanged
for other Certificates of authorized denominations of a like aggregate original
denomination, upon surrender of such Certificates to be exchanged at such
office. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Trustee
shall execute and deliver the Certificates which the Certificateholder making
the exchange is entitled to receive. Every Certificate presented or surrendered
for transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed by, or shall be accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the holder thereof or his or her
attorney duly authorized in writing.

d. Except as provided in paragraph (e) below the Book-Entry Certificates
shall at all times remain registered in the name of the Depository or its
nominee and at all times: (i) registration of the Certificates may not be
transferred by the Trustee except to another Depository; (ii) the Depository
shall maintain book-entry records with respect to the Certificate Owners and
with respect to ownership and transfers of such Certificates; (iii) ownership
and transfers of registration of the Certificates on the books of the Depository
shall be governed by applicable rules established by the Depository; (iv) the
Depository may collect its usual and customary fees, charges and expenses from
its Depository Participants; (v) the Trustee shall deal with the Depository,
Depository Participants and indirect participating firms as representatives of
the Certificate Owners of the Certificates for purposes of exercising the rights
of Holders under this Agreement, and requests and directions for and votes of
such representatives shall not be deemed to be 

9-2

<PAGE>

inconsistent if they are made with respect to different Certificate Owners; and
(vi) the Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon
information furnished by the Depository with respect to its Depository
Participants and furnished by the Depository Participants with respect to
indirect participating firms and persons shown on the books of such indirect
participating firms as direct or indirect Certificate Owners.

All transfers by Certificate Owners of Book-Entry Certificates shall be
made in accordance with the procedures established by the Depository Participant
or brokerage firm representing such Certificateholder. Each Depository
Participant shall only transfer Book-Entry Certificates of Certificate Owners it
represents or of brokerage firms for which it acts as agent in accordance with
the Depository's normal procedures.

e. If (x)(i) the Company or the Depository advises the Trustee in writing
that the Depository is no longer willing or able properly to discharge its
responsibilities as Depository, and (ii) the Trustee or the Company is unable to
locate a qualified successor, or (y) the Company at its sole option advises the
Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate the book-entry system through the
Depository, the Trustee shall notify all Certificate Owners, through the
Depository, of the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of
definitive, fully registered Certificates (the "Definitive Certificates") to
Certificate Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Trustee of the
Certificates by the Depository, accompanied by registration instructions from
the Depository for registration, the Trustee shall issue the Definitive
Certificates. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay
in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive
Certificates all references herein to obligations imposed upon or to be
performed by the Depository shall be deemed to be imposed upon and performed by
the Trustee, to the extent applicable with respect to such Definitive
Certificates and the Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive
Certificates as Certificateholders hereunder.

f. On or prior to the Closing Date, there shall be delivered to the
Depository one Certificate, in registered form, registered in the name of the
Depository's nominee, Cede & Co., the total face amount of which represents
$134,096,000. Such Certificate shall bear the following legend:

"Unless this Certificate is presented by an authorized representative of
The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to the Trustee or
its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate
issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as
requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to
Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized
representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR
OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner
hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein."

<PAGE>

SECTION 9.03. No Charge; Disposition of Void Certificates or Subordinated
Certificate.

No service charge shall be made to a Certificateholder or the Subordinated
Certificateholder for any transfer or exchange of Certificates or the
Subordinated Certificate, but the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates or the Subordinated
Certificate. All Certificates or the Subordinated Certificate surrendered for
transfer and exchange shall be disposed of in a manner approved by the Trustee.

SECTION 9.04. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates or
Subordinated Certificate.

If (a) any mutilated Certificate or Subordinated Certificate is surrendered
to the Certificate Registrar, or the Certificate Registrar receives evidence to
its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate or
Subordinated Certificate, and (b) there is delivered to the Certificate
Registrar and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by each
to save it harmless, then in the absence of notice to the Certificate Registrar
or the Trustee that such Certificate or Subordinated Certificate has been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Trustee shall execute and deliver, in
exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificate or Subordinated Certificate, a new Certificate or Subordinated
Certificate of like tenor and original denomination. Upon the issuance of any
new Certificate or Subordinated Certificate under this Section 9.04, the Trustee
may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
expenses connected therewith. Any duplicate Certificate or Subordinated
Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 9.04 shall constitute complete and
indefeasible evidence of ownership of the Percentage Interest, as if originally
issued, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate or
Subordinated Certificate shall be found at any time.

SECTION 9.05. Persons Deemed Owners.

Prior to due presentation of a Certificate or Subordinated Certificate for
registration of transfer, the Servicer, the Company, the Trustee, the Paying
Agent and the Certificate Registrar may treat the person in whose name any
Certificate or the Subordinated Certificate is registered as the owner of such
Certificate or Subordinated Certificate for the purpose of receiving remittances
pursuant to Section 8.01 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the
Servicer, the Company, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Paying Agent
or any agent of the Servicer, the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the
Certificate Registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

9-4

<PAGE>

SECTION 9.06. Access to List of Certificateholders' Names and Addresses.

The Certificate Registrar will furnish to the Trustee and the Servicer,
within five days after receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a request
therefor from the Trustee in writing, a list, in such form as the Trustee may
reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the Certificateholders as of
the most recent Record Date. If Holders of Certificates evidencing, as to any
Class, Percentage Interests representing 25% or more (hereinafter referred to as
"Applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee, and such application states that
the Applicants desire to communicate with other Certificateholders with respect
to their rights under this Agreement or under the Certificates and is
accompanied by a copy of the communication which such Applicants propose to
transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of
such application, afford such Applicants access during normal business hours to
the most recent list of Certificateholders held by the Trustee. If such list is
as of a date more than 90 days prior to the date of receipt of such Applicants'
request, the Trustee shall promptly request from the Certificate Registrar a
current list as provided above, and shall afford such Applicants access to such
list promptly upon receipt. Every Certificateholder, by receiving and holding a
Certificate, agrees with the Certificate Registrar and the Trustee that none of
the Company, the Certificate Registrar or the Trustee shall be held accountable
by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and
addresses of the Certificateholders hereunder, regardless of the source from
which such information was derived.

SECTION 9.07. Authenticating Agents.

The Trustee may appoint one or more Authenticating Agents with power to act
on its behalf and subject to its direction in the execution and delivery of the
Certificates or the Subordinated Certificate. For all purposes of this
Agreement, the execution and delivery of Certificates or the Subordinated
Certificate by the Authenticating Agent pursuant to this Section shall be deemed
to be the execution and delivery of Certificates or the Subordinated Certificate
"by the Trustee."

by the Company of, any such Contract.

SECTION 10.05. Operation of Indemnities.

Indemnification under this Article shall include, without limitation,
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation. If the

THE TRUSTEE
-----------

SECTION 11.01. Duties of Trustee.

The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination and after
the curing of all Events of Termination which may have occurred, undertakes to
perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this
Agreement. If an Event of Termination has occurred (which has not been cured),
the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this
Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a
prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his
own affairs.

The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates, statements,
opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished to the
Trustee which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, shall examine them to determine whether they
conform as to form to the requirements of this Agreement.

Subject to Section 11.03, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed
to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own misconduct; provided, however, that:

a. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination, and after the
curing of all such Events of Termination which may have occurred, the duties and
obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions
of this Agreement, the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of
such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the
Trustee and, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee
may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of
the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to
the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement;

b. The Trustee shall not be liable for an error of judgment made in good
faith by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that
the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

c. The Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect to any action
taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with
the direction of the Certificateholders with aggregate Fractional Interests
representing 25% or more of the Trust relating to the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising
any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Agreement;

11-1
<PAGE>

d. The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any event referred
to in Section 7.01 unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate
Trust Office obtains actual knowledge of such event or the Trustee receives
written notice of such event from the Servicer or the Certificateholders with
aggregate Fractional Interests representing 25% or more of the Trust; and

e. The Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from taking any action in reliance on the advice of the Servicer in all matters
with respect to FHA Insurance. The Trustee shall not be liable for any actions
taken by the Servicer with respect to FHA Insurance, including but not limited
to the maintenance of such insurance and the submission of claims to FHA.

None of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall in any event
require the Trustee to perform, or be responsible for the manner of performance
of, any of the obligations of the Company or the Servicer under this Agreement,
except during such time, if any, as the Trustee shall be the successor to, and
be vested with the rights, duties, powers and privileges of, the Servicer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Trustee shall not be required
to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its
rights or powers, if there is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment
of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not
reasonably assured to it.

SECTION 11.02. Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.01:

a. The Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining
from acting upon any resolution, Officer's Certificate, certificate of a
Servicing Officer, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond or
other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties;

b. The Trustee may consult with counsel and any opinion of any counsel
for the Company or the Servicer shall be full and complete authorization and
protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with such Opinion of Counsel;

c. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights
or powers vested in it by this Agreement, or to institute, conduct or defend any
litigation hereunder or in relation hereto, at the request, order or direction
of any of the Certificateholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement,
unless such Certificateholders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable
security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred therein or thereby; provided, however, that nothing contained herein
shall relieve the Trustee of the obligations, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Termination (which has not been cured), to exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it by this Agreement, and 

11-2
<PAGE>

to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent man
would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs;

d. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination and after the
curing of all Events of Termination which may have occurred, the Trustee shall
not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any
resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
request, consent, order, approval, bond or other paper or document, unless
requested in writing so to do by Certificateholders with aggregate Fractional
Interests representing 25% or more of the Trust; provided, however, that if the
payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or
liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is,
in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the
security afforded to it by the terms of this Agreement, the Trustee may require
reasonable indemnity against such cost, expense or liability as a condition to
so proceeding. The reasonable expense of every such examination shall be paid
by the Servicer or, if paid by the Trustee, shall be reimbursed by the Servicer
upon demand; and

e. The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or
perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or
attorneys or a custodian and shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of
such agents, attorneys or custodians if appointed by it with due care hereunder.

SECTION 11.03. Trustee Not Liable for Certificates, the Subordinated
Certificate or Contracts.

The Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the recitals
contained herein, in the Certificates or in the Subordinated Certificate (other
than the Trustee's execution thereof). The Trustee makes no representations as
to the validity or sufficiency of this Agreement, of the Certificates or of the
Subordinated Certificate (other than its execution thereof) or of any Contract,
Contract File or related document. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the
use or application by the Servicer or the Company of funds paid to the Company
in consideration of conveyance of the Contracts to the Trust by the Company or
deposited in or withdrawn from the Collection Account by the Servicer.

SECTION 11.04. Trustee May Own Certificates.

The Trustee in its individual or other capacity may become the owner or
pledgee of Certificates representing less than all the beneficial interest in
the Trust with the same rights as it would have if it were not Trustee.

SECTION 11.05. Rights of Certificateholders to Direct Trustee and to Waive
Events of Termination.

Certificateholders with aggregate Fractional Interests representing 25% or
more of the Trust shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of

11-3
<PAGE>

conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising
any trust or power conferred on the Trustee; provided, however, that, subject to
Section 11.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such
direction if the Trustee being advised by counsel determines that the action so
directed may not lawfully be taken, or if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a
Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceedings
so directed would be illegal or involve it in personal liability or be unduly
prejudicial to the rights of Certificateholders not parties to such direction;
and provided further that nothing in this Agreement shall impair the right of
the Trustee to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not
inconsistent with such direction by the Certificateholders. Certificateholders
with aggregate Fractional Interests representing 51% or more of the Trust may on
behalf of Certificateholders waive any past Event of Termination hereunder and
its consequences, except a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof
which under Section 12.08 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of
all Certificateholders, and upon any such waiver, such Event of Termination
shall cease to exist and shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of
this Agreement; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Event
of Termination or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 11.06. The Servicer to Pay Trustee's Fees and Expenses.

The Servicer agrees:

a. to pay to the Trustee reasonable compensation for all services
rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any
provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express
trust);

b. except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the
Trustee, to the extent requested by the Trustee, for all reasonable
expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in
accordance with any provision of this Agreement (including the reasonable
compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel),
except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to
its negligence or bad faith; and

c. to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any
loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its
part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration
of this trust and its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of
defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the
exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.

The covenants in this Section 11.06 shall be for the benefit of the Trustee
in its capacities as Trustee, Paying Agent and Certificate Registrar hereunder,
and shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

11-4
<PAGE>

SECTION 11.07. Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.

The Trustee hereunder shall at all times be a financial institution
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or
any State, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and a
Title I approved lender pursuant to FHA Regulations, whose long-term debt (or,
in the case of First Trust National Association, its parent company) is rated
BBB or higher by Standard & Poor's, and shall have a combined capital and
surplus of at least $50,000,000 or shall be a member of a bank holding system
the aggregate combined capital and surplus of which is $50,000,000, provided
that the Trustee's separate capital and surplus shall at all times be at least
the amount required by Section 310(a)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended. If such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually,
pursuant to law or to the requirements of a supervising or examining authority,
then for the purposes of this Section 11.07, the combined capital and surplus of
such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth
in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time the
Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 11.07, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the
effect specified in Section 11.08.

SECTION 11.08. Resignation or Removal of Trustee.

The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts hereby
created by giving written notice thereof to the Servicer and the Company. Upon
receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a
successor Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to each of the Servicer and the Company and one
copy to the successor Trustee. If no successor Trustee shall have been so
appointed and shall have accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving of
such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with
the provisions of Section 11.07 and shall fail to resign after written request
therefor by the Company, or if at any time the Trustee shall be legally unable
to act, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the
Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take
charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose
of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the Company may remove the
Trustee. If the Company shall have removed the Trustee under the authority of
the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall promptly appoint a
successor Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the
successor trustee.

Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 11.08 shall not become
effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as provided
in Section 11.09.

11-5
<PAGE>

SECTION 11.09. Successor Trustee.

Any successor Trustee appointed as provided in Section 11.08 shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Servicer, the Company and to its predecessor
Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the
resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee shall become effective and
such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its
predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee. The
predecessor Trustee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the successor
Trustee the Contracts and the Contract Files and any related documents and
statements held by it hereunder; and, if the Contracts are then held by a
custodian pursuant to a custodial agreement, the predecessor Trustee and the
custodian shall amend such custodial agreement to make the successor Trustee the
successor to the predecessor Trustee thereunder; and the Servicer, the Company
and the predecessor Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do
such other things as may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting
and confirming in the successor Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and
obligations. If the predecessor Trustee is then the lender of record for
purposes of FHA Insurance (due to an Event of Termination), the predecessor
Trustee shall submit a report to FHA describing the transfer of the FHA-Insured
Contracts without recourse, in such form as is then required under FHA
Regulations to cause HUD to transfer to the successor Trustee the FHA insurance
reserves applicable to the FHA-Insured Contracts.

No successor Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section
11.09 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be
eligible under the provisions of Section 11.07.

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee as provided in this
Section 11.09, the Servicer shall cause notice of the succession of such Trustee
hereunder to be mailed to Standard & Poor's and to each Certificateholder and
the Subordinated Certificateholder at their addresses as shown in the
Certificate Register. If the Servicer fails to mail such notice within ten days
after acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee, the successor Trustee
shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Servicer.

SECTION 11.10. Merger or Consolidation of Trustee.

Any Person into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to
the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the
Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be eligible under the provisions
of Section 11.07, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding. The Trustee shall promptly notify Standard & Poor's in the
event it is a party to any merger, conversion or consolidation.

11-6
<PAGE>

SECTION 11.11. Tax Returns.

Upon the Servicer's request, the Trustee will furnish the Servicer with all
such information as the Servicer may reasonably require in connection with
preparing all tax returns of the Trust and the Trustee shall execute such
returns.

SECTION 11.12. Obligor Claims.

In connection with any offset defenses, or affirmative claims for recovery,
asserted in legal actions brought by Obligors under one or more Contracts based
upon provisions therein complying with, or upon other rights or remedies arising
from, any legal requirements applicable to the Contracts, including, without
limitation, the Federal Trade Commission's Trade Regulation Rule Concerning
Preservation of Consumers' Claims and Defenses (16 C.F.R. (S) 433) as amended
from time to time:

a. The Trustee is not, and shall not be deemed to be, either in any
individual capacity, as trustee hereunder or otherwise, a creditor, or a
joint venturer with or an Affiliate of, or acting in concert or cooperation
with, any seller of home improvements, in the arrangement, origination or
making of Contracts. The Trustee is the holder of the Contracts only as
trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders, and not as a principal or in
any individual or personal capacity;

b. The Trustee shall not be personally liable for or obligated to pay
Obligors any affirmative claims asserted thereby, or responsible to
Certificateholders for any offset defense amounts applied against Contract
payments, pursuant to such legal actions;

c. The Trustee will pay, solely from available Trust monies,
affirmative claims for recovery by Obligors only pursuant to final judicial
orders or judgments, or judicially approved settlement agreements,
resulting from such legal actions;

d. The Trustee will comply with judicial orders and judgments which
require its actions or cooperation in connection with Obligors' legal
actions to recover affirmative claims against Certificateholders and the
Subordinated Certificateholder.

e. The Trustee will cooperate with and assist Certificateholders and
the Subordinated Certificateholder in their defense of legal actions by
Obligors to recover affirmative claims if such cooperation and assistance
is not contrary to the interests of the Trustee as a party to such legal
actions and if the Trustee is satisfactorily indemnified for all liability,
costs and expenses arising therefrom; and

11-7
<PAGE>

f. The Company hereby agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend
the Trustee, Certificateholders and the Subordinated Certificateholder from
and against any and all liability, loss, costs and expenses of the Trustee,
Certificateholders and the Subordinated Certificateholder resulting from
any affirmative claims for recovery asserted or collected by Obligors under
the Contracts. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
obligation of the Company under this Section 11.12(f) shall not terminate
upon a Service Transfer pursuant to Article VII.

SECTION 11.13. Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.

Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, at any time, for the purpose
of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction having authority over the
Trust, the Contracts or the Obligors, the Company and Trustee acting jointly
shall have the power and shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint
one or more Persons approved by the Trustee to act as co-trustee or co-trustees,
jointly with the Trustee, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or
any part of the Trust, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity,
such title to the Trust, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other
provisions of this Section 11.13, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and
trusts as the Company and the Trustee may consider necessary or desirable. If
the Company shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days after the
receipt by it of a request to do so, or in case an Event of Termination shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee alone shall have the power to make
such appointment. No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be required
to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 11.07
hereunder and no notice to Certificateholders of the appointment of co-
trustee(s) or separate trustee(s) shall be required under Section 11.09 hereof.

In the case of any appointment of a co-trustee or separate trustee pursuant
to this Section 11.13 all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or
imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or
performed by the Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, except
to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act
or acts are to be performed (whether as Trustee hereunder or as successor to the
Servicer hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform
such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations
(including the holding of title to the Trust or any portion thereof in any such
jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate
trustee at the direction of the Trustee.

Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be deemed
to have been given to each of the then co-trustees and separate trustees, as
effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any co-
trustee or separate trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of
this Article XI. Each co-trustee and separate trustee, upon its acceptance of
the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in
its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately, as
may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement,
specifically including every provision of this 

11-8
<PAGE>

Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording
protection to, the Trustee. Every such instrument shall be filed with the
Trustee.

Any co-trustee or separate trustee may, at any time, constitute the
Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority, to the
extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this
Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any co-trustee or separate trustee
shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates,
properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the
Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or
successor trustee.

SECTION 11.14. Certain Matters Relating to FHA Insurance.

a. In the event the Company and the successor Servicer, if any, shall
fail to pay all FHA Insurance premiums with respect to the FHA-Insured Contracts
required by FHA Regulations, the Trustee shall pay such FHA Insurance premiums
and shall be entitled to reimbursement for such amounts pursuant to Section
8.06.

b. If, following the termination of the Trust pursuant to Section 12.04,
HUD demands reimbursement from the Trustee of an FHA Insurance claim paid on an
FHA-Insured Contract prior to the termination of the Trust, the Trustee agrees
that it will not seek to recover any such amount from any Person other than the
Company or successor Servicer.

SECTION 11.15. Trustee and First Bank System, Inc.

In the event the Trustee ceases to be a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of
First Bank System, Inc., the Trustee shall promptly notify Standard & Poor's.

SECTION 11.16 Trustee Advances.

a. If the Servicer fails to deposit into the Collection Account Advances
as required by Section 8.02, then the Trustee shall, subject to the provisions
of paragraph (b) below, from its own funds, deposit into the Collection Account
the amount not so deposited by the Servicer on or before the Business Day
preceding the related Payment Date (a "Trustee Advance").

b. The Trustee shall not be required to make any Trustee Advance (i) if
and to the extent that it determines in good faith that the funds, if advanced,
would not be recoverable by it from subsequent collections, including Net
Liquidation Proceeds, or (in the case of FHA-Insured Contracts) from FHA
Insurance, or (ii) if the Trustee is prohibited by law from making any such
Trustee Advance, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel.

c. The Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement of a Trustee Advance
from subsequent collections on the related Contract, including Net Liquidation
Proceeds and (in the case of FHA-Insured Contracts) proceeds of FHA Insurance,
in accordance with Section 8.06(b). If the Trustee determines in good faith
that any 

11-9

<PAGE>

Trustee Advance has become an Uncollectible Advance, the Trustee will be
entitled to reimbursement of such Uncollectible Advance from the Collected
Amount and from the Cash Collateral Guaranty in accordance with Section 8.05(b).

ARTICLE XII

MISCELLANEOUS
-------------

SECTION 12.01. Servicer Not to Resign.

The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except upon determination that the performance of its duties
hereunder is no longer permissible under applicable law. Any such determination
permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of
Counsel for the Servicer to such effect delivered to the Trustee. No such
resignation shall become effective until the Trustee or a successor servicer
shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the Servicer in
accordance with Section 7.03.

SECTION 12.02. Company Not to Engage in Certain Transactions with Respect
to the Trust.

The Company shall not:

a. Provide credit to any Certificateholder for the purpose of
enabling such Certificateholder to purchase Certificates;

b. Purchase any Certificates in an agency or trustee capacity; or

c. Loan any money to the Trust.

SECTION 12.03. Maintenance of Office or Agency.

The Trustee will maintain in Minneapolis or St. Paul, Minnesota, an office
or agency where Certificates or the Subordinated Certificate may be surrendered
for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or
upon the Trustee in respect of the Certificates, the Subordinated Certificate
and this Agreement may be served. On the date hereof the Trustee's office for
such purposes is located at 180 East 5th Street, Third Floor, St. Paul,
Minnesota 55101. The Trustee will give prompt written notice to
Certificateholders and the Subordinated Certificateholder of any change in the
location of the Certificate Register or any such office or agency.

SECTION 12.04. Termination.

a. This Agreement shall terminate (after distribution of all Monthly
Principal and Monthly Interest due to Certificateholders pursuant to Sections
8.01 and 8.06) on the earlier of (a) the Payment Date on which the Principal
Balance is reduced to zero; or (b) the Payment Date on which the Servicer
repurchases the Contracts pursuant to Section 8.08; provided, that in no event
shall the trust created hereby continue beyond the expiration of 21 years from
the death of the last survivor of the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, the
late Ambassador of the United States to the Court of St. James, living on the
date hereof, and provided,

12-1

<PAGE>

further, that the Servicer's and the Company's representations and warranties
and indemnities by the Company and the Servicer shall survive termination.

b. Notice of any termination, specifying the Final Payment Date (which
shall be a date that would otherwise be a Payment Date) upon which all
Certificateholders or the Subordinated Certificateholder may surrender their
Certificates or the Subordinated Certificate to the Servicer for payment of the
final distribution and cancellation, shall be given promptly by the Trustee
(upon direction by the Servicer ten days prior to the date such notice is to be
mailed) by letter to Standard & Poor's and to Certificateholders and the
Subordinated Certificateholder mailed no later than the fifth Business Day of
the month of the Final Payment Date specifying (1) the Final Payment Date upon
which final payment on the Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate will be
made upon presentation and surrender of Certificates and the Subordinated
Certificate at the office or agency of the Servicer therein designated; (2) the
amount of any such final payment; and (3) that the Record Date otherwise
applicable to such Payment Date is not applicable, payments being made only upon
presentation and surrender of the Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate
at the office or agency of the Servicer therein specified. The Trustee shall
give such notice to the Certificate Registrar at the time such notice is given
to the Certificateholders and the Subordinated Certificateholder. In the event
such notice is given in connection with the Servicer's election to purchase the
Contracts, the Servicer shall deposit in the Certificate Account on the Final
Payment Date in immediately available funds an amount equal to the above-
described purchase price and upon such deposit Certificateholders and the
Subordinated Certificateholder will be entitled to the amount of such purchase
price but not amounts in excess thereof, all as provided herein. Upon
certification to the Trustee by a Servicing Officer, following such final
deposit the Trustee shall promptly release to the Servicer the Contract Files
for the remaining Contracts, and the Trustee shall execute all assignments,
endorsements and other instruments necessary to effectuate such transfer.

c. Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the Trustee shall
cause to be distributed to Certificateholders and the Subordinated
Certificateholder on the Final Payment Date in proportion to their respective
Percentage Interests, (1) as to the Certificates, to the extent of Available
Funds, an amount equal to Monthly Interest and Monthly Principal and (2) as to
the Subordinated Certificates, the amount which remains on deposit in the
Collection Account (other than amounts retained to meet claims) after
application pursuant to the preceding clause (1). The distribution on the Final
Payment Date pursuant to this Section 12.04 shall be in lieu of the distribution
otherwise required to be made on such Payment Date in respect of the
Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate.

d. In the event that all of the Certificateholders and the Subordinated
Certificateholder do not surrender their Certificates and the Subordinated
Certificate for cancellation within three months after the time specified in the
above-mentioned written notice, the Company shall give a second written notice
to the remaining Certificateholders and the Subordinated Certificateholder to
surrender their Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate for cancellation
and 

12-2
<PAGE>

receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If within three months
after the second notice all the Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate
shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Company shall transfer to
itself all amounts remaining on deposit in the Collection Account, to hold in
trust for Certificateholders and the Subordinated Certificateholder who have not
surrendered their Certificates or the Subordinated Certificate, as the case may
be, for cancellation, together with the final record list of Certificateholders
and the Subordinated Certificateholder, and the Company shall take appropriate
steps, or may appoint an agent to take appropriate steps, to contact the
remaining Certificateholders concerning surrender of their Certificates and to
contact the Subordinated Certificateholder concerning its surrender of its
Subordinated Certificate, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds
and other assets which remain in trust hereunder.

SECTION 12.05. Acts of Certificateholders and the Subordinated
Certificateholder.

a. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, whenever
Certificateholder approval, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver,
or other action is required hereunder, such approval, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action shall be deemed to have been given or
taken on behalf of, and shall be binding upon, all Certificateholders if agreed
to by Certificateholders with aggregate Fractional Interests representing 51% or
more of the Trust.

b. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other action provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by
Certificateholders or the Subordinated Certificateholder may be embodied in and
evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by
such Certificateholders or the Subordinated Certificateholder in person or by
agent duly appointed in writing; and except as herein otherwise expressly
provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments
are delivered to the Trustee and, where required, to the Servicer. Proof of
execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall
be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement and (subject to Section 11.01)
conclusive in favor of the Trustee, the Servicer and the Company if made in the
manner provided in this Section.

c. The fact and date of the execution by any Certificateholder or the
Subordinated Certificateholder of any such instrument or writing may be proved
in any reasonable manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

d. The ownership of Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate shall
be proved by the Certificate Register.

e. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other act by a Certificateholder or the Subordinated Certificateholder shall
bind every holder of every Certificate or the Subordinated Certificate, as
applicable, issued 

12-3

<PAGE>

upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu
thereof, in respect of anything done, or omitted to be done by the Trustee, the
Servicer or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such
action is made upon such Certificates or Subordinated Certificate.

f. The Trustee may require such additional proof of any matter referred
to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.

SECTION 12.06. Calculations.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all interest rate and basis
point calculations under this Agreement will be made on the basis of a 360-day
year and twelve 30-day months and will be carried out to at least three decimal
places.

SECTION 12.07. Assignment or Delegation by Company.

Except as specifically authorized hereunder, and except for its obligations
as Servicer which are dealt with under Article V and Article VII, the Company
may not convey and assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations hereunder
absent the prior written consent of Certificateholders with aggregate Fractional
Interests representing 66-2/3% or more of the Trust, and any attempt to do so
without such consent shall be void.

SECTION 12.08. Amendment.

a. This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Company, the
Servicer and the Trustee, without the consent of any of the Certificateholders
or the Subordinated Certificateholder, to correct manifest error, to cure any
ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provisions herein or therein which may
be inconsistent with any other provisions herein or therein, as the case may be;
provided, however, that such action shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion of
Counsel for the Company, adversely affect in any material respect the interests
of any Certificateholder.

b. This Agreement may also be amended by agreement of the Trustee and the
Company at any time without the consent of the Certificateholders or the
Subordinated Certificateholder to effect the transfer of FHA Insurance reserves
to another entity in compliance with revisions to FHA Regulations, or to change

provided that prior to any such amendment Standard & Poor's has confirmed in
writing that the rating of the Certificates will not be lowered or withdrawn
following such amendment.

c. This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Servicer,
the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of Certificateholders with
aggregate Fractional Interests representing 66-2/3% or more of the Trust, for
the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating
any of the provisions of this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights
of the

Certificateholders and any Event of Termination may be waived by
Certificateholders with aggregate Fractional Interests representing 100% of the
Trust; provided, however, that no such amendment or waiver shall (a) reduce in
any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, collections of payments on the
Contracts or distributions which are required to be made on any Certificate, or
(b) reduce the aforesaid percentage required to consent to any such amendment,
without the consent of the holders of all Certificates then outstanding or
(c) cause any tax to be imposed on the Trust. This Agreement may not be amended
without the consent of the Subordinated Certificateholder, for the purpose of
adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the
provisions of this Agreement which would modify in any manner the rights of the
Subordinated Certificateholder.

d. This Agreement shall not be amended under this Section without the
consent of 100% of Certificateholders and the Subordinated Certificateholder if
such amendment would result in the disqualification of the Trust as a Grantor
Trust under the Code.

e. Promptly after the execution of any amendment or consent pursuant to
this Section 12.08, the Trustee shall furnish written notification of the
substance of such amendment to Standard & Poor's and each Certificateholder and
the Subordinated Certificateholder.

f. It shall not be necessary for the consent of Certificateholders under
this Section 12.08 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but
it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. The
manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization of the
execution thereof by Certificateholders shall be subject to such reasonable
requirements as the Trustee may prescribe.

g. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such
amendment which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under
this Agreement or otherwise.

h. In connection with any amendment pursuant to this Section, the Trustee
shall be entitled to receive an Opinion of Counsel to the Servicer to the effect
that such amendment is authorized or permitted by the Agreement.

i. Upon the execution of any amendment or consent pursuant to this
Section 12.08, this Agreement shall be modified in accordance therewith, and
such amendment or consent shall form a part of this Agreement for all purposes,
and every Certificateholder or the Subordinated Certificateholder hereunder
shall be bound thereby.

THIS CERTIFICATE DOES NOT REPRESENT AN OBLIGATION OF OR AN INTEREST IN

SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT.

THE PRINCIPAL REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS PAYABLE IN INSTALLMENTS,
AS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND IN THE AGREEMENT. ACCORDINGLY, THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL
AMOUNT OF THE TRUST MAY BE LESS THAN THAT SET FORTH ABOVE. ANYONE ACQUIRING
THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ASCERTAIN THE CURRENT UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNT REPRESENTED

This certifies that ___________________________________________________ is
the registered owner of the undivided Fractional Interest represented by the
original principal amount set forth above in Home Improvement Loan Trust 1994-A
(the "Trust"), which includes among its assets a pool of home improvement
installment sales contracts and promissory notes (including, without limitation,
all related mortgages, deeds of trust and security deeds (in the case of Secured
Contracts) and any and all rights to receive payments which are due pursuant
thereto on or after March 1, 1994), the Cash Collateral Guaranty and the Limited
Guaranty. The Trust has been created pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing
Agreement (the "Agreement"), dated as of 

A-1
<PAGE>

March 1, 1994, between Green Tree Financial Corporation, as Seller and Servicer
(the "Company"), and First Trust National Association, as Trustee of the Trust
(the "Trustee"). This Certificate is one of the Certificates described in the
Agreement and is issued pursuant and subject to the Agreement. By acceptance of
this Certificate the holder assents to and becomes bound by the Agreement. To
the extent not defined herein, all capitalized terms have the meanings assigned
to such terms in the Agreement.

The Agreement contemplates, subject to its terms, payment on the fifteenth
day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day)
(the "Payment Date") of each calendar month commencing April 15, 1994, so long
as the Agreement has not been terminated, by check (or, if such
Certificateholder holds Certificates with an aggregate Initial Principal Balance
of at least $1,000,000 and so desires, by wire transfer pursuant to instructions
delivered to the Trustee at least 10 days prior to such Payment Date) from funds
drawn from the Collection Account to the registered Certificateholder at the
address appearing on the Certificate Register as of the Business Day immediately
preceding such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Certificateholder's
Fractional Interest of Monthly Principal and Monthly Interest. The final
scheduled Payment Date of this Certificate is March 15, 2014 or the next
succeeding Business Day if such March 15 is not a Business Day.

The Certificateholder, by its acceptance of this Certificate, agrees that
it will look solely to the funds in the Collection Account, the Cash Collateral
Guaranty and the Limited Guaranty of the Company, to the extent available for
distribution to the Certificateholder as provided in the Agreement for payment
hereunder and that the Trustee in its individual capacity is not personally
liable to the Certificateholder for any amounts payable under this Certificate
or the Agreement or, except as expressly provided in the Agreement, subject to
any liability under the Agreement. By acceptance of this Certificate, the
Certificateholder agrees to disclosure of his, her or its name and address to
other Certificateholders under the conditions specified in the Agreement.

No transfer of a Certificate by, on behalf of or with plan assets of any
employee benefit plan, trust or account that is subject to the Employment
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or that is
described in Section 4975(e)(i) of the Code (each, a "Plan") will be registered
unless the transferee, at its expense, delivers to the Trustee, the Servicer and
the Company an opinion of counsel (satisfactory to the Trustee, the Servicer and
the Company) that the purchase and holding of a Certificate by, on behalf of, or
with Plan assets of such Plan is permissible under applicable law, will not
result in the assets of the Trust being deemed to be Plan assets and subject to
the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and will not subject
the Trustee, the Trust, the Company or the Servicer to any obligation or
liability in addition to those undertaken in this Agreement. Unless such
opinion is delivered, each person acquiring this Certificate will be deemed to
represent to the Trustee, the Company and the Servicer that such person is
neither a Plan, nor acting on behalf of a Plan, nor purchasing with Plan assets
of any Plan.

This Certificate does not purport to summarize the Agreement and reference
is made to the Agreement for information with respect to the interests, rights,

amendments thereto will be provided to any Certificateholder free of charge upon
a written request to the Trustee.

As provided in the Agreement and subject to the limitations set forth
therein, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the Certificate
Register of the Certificate Registrar upon surrender of this Certificate for
registration of transfer at the office or agency maintained by the Trustee in
Minneapolis or St. Paul, Minnesota, accompanied by a written instrument of

FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY

The opinion of Dorsey & Whitney shall be to the effect that (capitalized
terms have the meanings set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement):

1. Green Tree is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota, with corporate power to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, the Cash Collateral Trust Agreement, the
Loan Agreement, the Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate. Green Tree
is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the performance of its duties under the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, the Certificates
and the Subordinated Certificate would require such qualification.

2. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, the
Cash Collateral Trust Agreement, and the Loan Agreement have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action, duly executed and delivered by
Green Tree, and constitute the valid and binding obligations of Green Tree
enforceable in accordance with their terms. The Certificates and the
Subordinate Certificate have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action and, when duly and validly executed by the Trustee in accordance with the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, will be validly issued and outstanding and
entitled to the benefits of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Merrill Lynch
is now the registered owner of the Certificates and, assuming that Merrill Lynch
purchased the Certificates for value in good faith and without notice of any
adverse claim, Merrill Lynch has acquired all the rights of Green Tree in the
Certificates free of any adverse claim.

3. No consent, approval, authorization or order of any state or federal
court or governmental agency or body is required to be obtained by Green Tree
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, the Cash Collateral Trust
Agreement, and the Loan Agreement except such as may be required under blue sky
laws under any jurisdiction in connection with the offering of the Certificates
by Merrill Lynch pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.

4. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement is not required to be qualified
under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as now in effect, and neither the Trust
nor the Cash Collateral Trust is required to be registered as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

5. Neither the transfer of the Contracts to the Trustee and the right to
demand payments under the Cash Collateral Guaranty by the Trustee acting on
behalf of the Trust, nor the assignment of Green Tree's lien on the related real
estate 

D-1
<PAGE>

which is the subject of a home improvement loan, nor the issuance or sale of the
Certificates and the Subordinated Certificate, nor the execution and delivery of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, the Cash
Collateral Trust Agreement or the Loan Agreement, nor the consummation of any
other of the transactions contemplated in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
the Cash Collateral Trust Agreement, or the Underwriting Agreement, or the
consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, the Cash Collateral Trust Agreement or the Underwriting
Agreement, nor the fulfillment of the terms of the Certificates, the
Subordinated Certificate, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Cash
Collateral Trust Agreement or the Underwriting Agreement by Green Tree will
conflict with, or result in a breach, violation or acceleration of, or
constitute a default under, any term or provision of the Restated Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of Green Tree or of any indenture or other agreement or
instrument known to us to which Green Tree is a party or by which it is bound,
or result in a violation of, or contravene the terms of any statute, order or
regulation, applicable to Green Tree, of any court, regulatory body,
administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over it.

6. There are no actions or proceedings pending or, to the best of our
knowledge, actions, proceedings or investigations pending or overtly threatened
against Green Tree before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal
(A) asserting the invalidity of the Underwriting Agreement, the Cash Collateral
Trust Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificates, the
Subordinated Certificate, the hazard or flood insurance policies applicable to
any Contracts or the Errors and Omissions Protection Policy, (B) seeking to
prevent the issuance of the Certificates or the Subordinated Certificate or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting
Agreement, the Cash Collateral Trust Agreement, or the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, (C) which is likely materially and adversely to affect the
performance by Green Tree of its obligations under, or the validity or
enforceability of, the Underwriting Agreement, the Cash Collateral Trust
Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Certificates or the
Subordinated Certificate or (D) seeking adversely to affect the federal income
tax attributes of the Certificates or the Subordinated Certificate described in
the Prospectus under the heading "Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences."

7. Green Tree is duly registered as a finance company in each state in
which Contracts were originated, to the extent such registration is required by
applicable law.

8. The transfer of the Contracts to the Trust in accordance with Section
2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement would not be avoidable as a
preferential transfer under Section 547 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (11
U.S.C. (S) 547), as in effect on the date hereof, in the event that Green Tree
became a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code. [Same for C.C.
Depositor]

D-1

<PAGE>

9. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement Green Tree has
transferred to the Trustee acting on behalf of the Trust all of Green Tree's
right, title and interest in the Contracts, free and clear of any and all other
assignments, encumbrances, options, rights, claims, liens or security interests
(except tax or possessory liens) that may affect the right of the Trustee in and
to such Contracts, and has delivered the Contract Files to the Trustee or its
custodian. No filing or other action, other than the filing of a financing
statement on Form UCC-1 with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota
identifying the Contracts as collateral and naming Green Tree as debtor and the
Trust as secured party, and the filing of continuation statements as required by
Section 4.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, is necessary to perfect as
against third parties the assignment of the Contracts by Green Tree to the
Trust. We have separately provided you with our opinion concerning whether such
assignment could be recharacterized as a pledge rather than a sale in the event
Green Tree became a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code. However, in
the event such assignment were characterized as a pledge securing a loan from
the Certificateholders to Green Tree, it is our opinion that the Trustee would
be deemed to have a valid and perfected first priority security interest in the
Contracts and the proceeds thereof (including the Excess Cashflow), which
security interest would be prior to any other security interest that may be
perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of
Minnesota and over any "lien creditor" (as defined in Minn. Stat. (S)336.9-
301(3)) who becomes such after the Closing Date, except that a subsequent
purchaser of any Contract who gives new value and takes possession thereof in
the ordinary course of his business would have priority over the Trustee's
security interest in such Contract, if such purchaser acts without knowledge
that such Contract was subject to a security interest. We have assumed for the
purposes of this opinion that during the term of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement the Trustee, or its custodian, shall maintain possession of the
Contract Files for the purpose of perfecting the assignment to the Trustee of
the Contracts. We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of any
individual Contract or the existence of any claims, rights or other matters in
favor of any Obligor or the owner of any financed home improvement. 

10. For federal income tax purposes, the Trust created pursuant to the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement will be treated as a grantor trust under Subpart
E, Part I, of Subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") and not as an association taxable as a corporation under the Code, and
under Section 671 of the Code, each Certificateholder will be treated as the
owner of an undivided pro rata interest in each of the Contracts in the Trust.

11. The transfer of the Contracts and the proceeds thereof by Green Tree
to the Trustee on the date hereof pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement would not be avoidable as fraudulent transfers under the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act as in effect in Minnesota on the date hereof (Minn.
Stat. (S)(S) 513.41 through 513.51), nor, should Green Tree become a debtor
under the United States Bankruptcy Code, as fraudulent transfers under Section
548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. (S) 548) as in effect on the
date hereof.

D-3
<PAGE>

12. The provisions of the Cash Collateral Trust Agreement, if complied
with, and the UCC-1 Financing Statement in the form attached as an exhibit to
such opinion, are effective to create a valid and perfected first priority
security interest in favor of the Trust in the Cash Collateral Account to secure
the Cash Collateral Guaranty.

Trustee, as the senior secured party as its interest appears herein, and the
Cash Collateral Depositor, as the subordinate secured party as its interest
appears herein, a Cash Collateral Account which shall be either a segregated
trust account established in the trust department of an Eligible Institution and
shall be entitled "Cash Collateral Account of First Bank National Association,
as Cash Collateral Trustee, subject to a first security interest of First Trust
National Association, as Trustee of Home Improvement Loan Trust 1994-A, and a

shall designate such Eligible Institution to hold the Cash Collateral Account as
the Cash Collateral Depositor may direct, until all obligations owing to the
Cash Collateral Depositor pursuant to the Loan Agreement shall have been finally
paid and satisfied, and thereafter the Cash Collateral Beneficiary may direct
the Cash Collateral Trustee in such designation. Subject to the terms hereof,
the Cash Collateral Trustee shall possess all right, title and interest in and
to all funds deposited from time to time in the Cash Collateral Account.
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cash Collateral Trustee shall not
withdraw any funds from, or otherwise deal with or exercise control over any
funds on deposit in, the Cash Collateral Account except as provided in this
Agreement. The interest of the Cash Collateral Depositor in the Cash Collateral
Account shall be subordinated to the interest of the Trustee, on behalf of the
Certificateholders, as provided herein. The interest of the Cash Collateral
Beneficiary in the Cash Collateral Account shall be subordinate to the interest
of the Trustee, on behalf of the Certificateholders, and the Cash Collateral
Depositor, as provided herein. The Cash Collateral Beneficiary has, as of the
Closing Date, assigned its right, title and interest in the Subordinated
Certificate to the Cash Collateral Trustee and has caused the Subordinated
Certificate to be registered in the name of the Cash Collateral Trustee in
accordance with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

(b) Maintenance of the Cash Collateral Account. If at any time the
Cash Collateral Account ceases to be held at an Eligible Institution, the Cash
Collateral Trustee, upon written notice from the Trustee, shall, within one
Business Day (or such longer period, not to exceed 30 calendar days, as to which
Standard & Poor's may consent) after receipt of such notice, establish a new
Cash Collateral Account meeting the conditions specified in Section 4(a) above,
and shall transfer any cash and/or investments in the Cash Collateral Account to
such new Cash Collateral Account. The Cash Collateral Trustee shall consult with
the Cash Collateral Depositor and the Trustee prior to transferring the Cash
Collateral Account pursuant to this Section 4(b).

(c) Deposits to and Withdrawals from the Cash Collateral Account.

transferred to the Cash Collateral Depositor the Cash Collateral Account
Surplus, if any, to the extent any amounts are payable to the Cash
Collateral Depositor on such Payment Date pursuant to Section 3, 4, 5 or 19
of the Loan Agreement, and the lien of the Trustee on such amounts so
transferred shall be automatically released. The Cash Collateral Depositor
shall furnish the Cash Collateral Trustee and the Seller and the Servicer
with written notice, at least 2 Business Days prior to each Payment Date,
of the amounts so payable to the Cash Collateral Depositor on such Payment
Date, separately identifying each such amount.

(iv) Not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Payment

to the Cash Collateral Beneficiary the remaining Cash Collateral Account

Section 4(c)(ii) hereof and to the Cash Collateral Depositor pursuant to
Section 4(c)(iii) hereof have been made, and the lien of the Trustee and
the Cash Collateral Depositor on such amounts so transferred shall be
automatically released.

Funds on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account shall be invested by the Person
with whom the Cash Collateral Account is established in the name of the Trustee,

Investments. Subject to the following provisions of this Section 4(d), any such
investments shall be made at the written direction of the Cash Collateral
Depositor until all obligations owing to the Cash Collateral Depositor pursuant
to the Loan Agreement shall have been finally paid and satisfied, and thereafter
shall be made at the written direction of the Cash Collateral Beneficiary. Upon
any such investment, the Person directing such investment shall cause the
Eligible Institution holding the Cash Collateral Account to (i) make an
appropriate notation of the Trustee's and the Cash Collateral Depositor's
security interests in such Cash Collateral Account Eligible Investment by book
entry or otherwise and (ii) send the Trustee and the Cash Collateral Depositor a
written confirmation of such security interests. Funds on deposit in the Cash
Collateral Account on the Closing Date and thereafter shall be so invested in
such Eligible Investments that will mature so that such funds and the proceeds
thereof will be available for withdrawal on the Business Day preceding the
following Payment Date. The proceeds of any such Eligible Investments shall be
so invested in such investments that will mature so that such funds will be
available for withdrawal on the Business Day prior to the Payment Date
immediately following the date of such investment. Any written directions
referred to in the second sentence of this Section 4(d) shall specify the
particular investment to be made and shall certify that such investment is an
Eligible Investment and is permitted to be made under this Agreement and the
Loan Agreement. Investments may be made on any date (provided such investments
satisfy the maturity requirements set forth above), only after giving effect to
deposits to and withdrawals from the Cash Collateral Account on such date. Not
later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Payment Date, all interest and
earnings (net of losses and investment expenses, if any) accrued since the
previous Payment Date (or since the Closing Date in the case of the first
Payment Date) on funds on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account shall be
withdrawn by the Cash Collateral Trustee and shall be transferred to (i) the
Cash Collateral Depositor, to the extent any amounts are payable to the Cash
Collateral Depositor on such Payment Date pursuant to Section 3, 4, 5 or 19 of
the Loan Agreement, and (ii) thereafter, to the Cash Collateral Beneficiary, and
the Trustee and, in the case of any such amounts so transferred to the Cash
Collateral Beneficiary, the Cash Collateral Depositor shall have no lien on any
amounts so transferred. For purposes of determining the Available Cash
Collateral Amount hereunder, all such investment earnings shall be deemed not to
be available or on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account. Realized losses, if
any, on amounts invested in Eligible Investments shall be charged against
undistributed investment earnings on amounts invested pursuant to this Section
4(d).

The Cash Collateral Depositor shall provide to the Cash Collateral
Trustee, on the date hereof and on or prior to each March 1 hereafter, an
incumbency certificate or the equivalent with respect to each officer of the
Cash Collateral Depositor that is authorized to provide instructions relating to
investment of funds on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account. At such time as
the Cash Collateral Beneficiary is entitled to direct the investment of funds on
deposit in the Cash Collateral Account, the Cash Collateral Beneficiary shall
provide to the 

-8-
<PAGE>

Cash Collateral Trustee, from time to time, an incumbency certificate or the
equivalent with respect to each officer of the Cash Collateral Beneficiary that
is authorized to provide instructions relating to such investment.

5. Security Interest. In order to secure the right of the Trustee
to receive payments on the Cash Collateral Guaranty and, on a subordinate basis,
in order to secure the right of the Cash Collateral Depositor to receive
payments from the Cash Collateral Account as provided herein, the Cash
Collateral Trustee hereby grants a security interest of first priority in favor
of the Trustee, and a security interest of second priority in favor of the Cash
Collateral Depositor, in the Cash Collateral Account, the Initial Cash
Collateral Amount and all other amounts deposited from time to time in the Cash
Collateral Account and all the proceeds of the foregoing, including, but not by
way of limitation, all proceeds of the conversion thereof, voluntary or
involuntary, into cash or other liquid property, all cash proceeds, accounts,
accounts receivable, notes, drafts, acceptances, chattel paper, checks, deposit
accounts, insurance proceeds, condemnation awards, rights to payment of any and
every kind, and other forms of obligations and receivables, instruments and
other property which at any time constitute all or part or are included in the
proceeds of any of the foregoing; provided that the Trustee shall have no lien
or security interest in any interest and earnings on funds deposited in the Cash
Collateral Account. The Cash Collateral Trustee shall, at the expense of the
Servicer, take such action as is directed in writing by the Trustee or the Cash
Collateral Depositor to maintain such party's security interest as a perfected
security interest until termination of the Cash Collateral Trust pursuant to
Section 6 hereof. The Cash Collateral Depositor hereby subordinates its security
interest to that of the Trustee as provided herein. Subject to the provisions
of the Loan Agreement, the Cash Collateral Depositor agrees not to exercise any
rights as the subordinated secured party on behalf of itself unless and until
the Certificates are paid in full, it being understood that this shall not limit
the right of the Cash Collateral Depositor to receive payments in respect of the
Cash Collateral Account Surplus, if any, and interest and earnings on amounts on
deposit in the Cash Collateral Account.

All amounts or property credited to the Cash Collateral Account shall
be subject to the liens of the Trustee and the Cash Collateral Depositor herein
described until released or withdrawn from the Cash Collateral Account.

If at any time the Cash Collateral Account is maintained with the Cash
Collateral Depositor, to the extent perfection of the Trustee's security
interest in Cash Collateral Account Eligible Investments requires possession,
the Cash Collateral Depositor hereby agrees to maintain such possession as
collateral agent on behalf of the Trustee, as the senior secured party, and on
behalf of itself, as the subordinate secured party.

6. Termination of Cash Collateral Trust; Release of Funds. Upon the
earlier to occur of (i) March 15, 2014 (or, if such day is not a Business Day,
the 

-9-

<PAGE>

immediately succeeding Business Day) and (ii) the Business Day immediately
succeeding the date on which the Cash Collateral Trustee receives written notice
from the Trustee that the Trust has been terminated pursuant to Section 12.04 of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Cash Collateral Trustee, after the
payment of all amounts payable from the Cash Collateral Account as provided
herein, shall, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, withdraw from the
Cash Collateral Account all amounts on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account
and pay such amounts to (i) the Cash Collateral Depositor, to the extent any
amounts are payable to the Cash Collateral Depositor pursuant to Section 3, 4, 5
or 19 of the Loan Agreement, and (ii) thereafter, to the Cash Collateral
Beneficiary. Upon such payment, the Cash Collateral Trust shall terminate. The
Servicer hereby agrees to promptly notify the Cash Collateral Trustee as to the
termination of the Trust.

7. Letter of Credit and Other Credit Enhancement.

(a) At any time after the first Payment Date on which the funds in the
Cash Collateral Account equal or exceed the Requisite Amount, the Cash
Collateral Beneficiary may obtain the release of all or a portion of the cash on
deposit in the Cash Collateral Account, by delivering to the Cash Collateral
Trustee (i) a Letter of Credit that satisfies the conditions set forth in
Section 7(c) hereof or (ii) any other form of credit enhancement that satisfies
the conditions of Section 7(d) hereof. Section 7(b) hereof shall be operative
only after a Letter of Credit that satisfies the conditions of Section 7(c)
hereof has been delivered to the Cash Collateral Trustee. Any such cash so
released from the Cash Collateral Account will be paid to (i) the Cash
Collateral Depositor, to the extent any amounts are payable to the Cash
Collateral Depositor pursuant to Section 3, 4, 5 or 19 of the Loan Agreement,
and (ii) thereafter, to the Cash Collateral Beneficiary. Upon the issuance of
any such Letter of Credit or other form of credit enhancement, the provisions of
this Agreement relating to the deposit and disposition of moneys hereunder shall
be amended accordingly.

(b) If the expiration date of a Letter of Credit is to occur before
the termination of the Trust pursuant to Section 12.04 of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, and, on or before the tenth Business Day prior to such
expiration, the Cash Collateral Beneficiary shall not have delivered to the Cash
Collateral Trustee a replacement Letter of Credit that satisfies the conditions
set forth in Section 7(c) hereof, the Cash Collateral Trustee shall, prior to
11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the fifth Business Day prior to such
expiration date, draw under such Letter of Credit the amount (the "Final Draw
Amount") available thereunder, and deposit the Final Draw Amount in the Cash
Collateral Account. If, on or before such fifth Business Day, the Cash
Collateral Beneficiary obtains on behalf of and delivers to the Cash Collateral
Trustee a replacement Letter of Credit that satisfies the conditions of Section
7(c) hereof, then the Cash Collateral Trustee shall replace the related Letter
of Credit with such replacement Letter of Credit.

-10-
<PAGE>

The Cash Collateral Trustee shall, when required pursuant to the terms
of a Letter of Credit, deliver the existing Letter of Credit to the related
issuing bank upon extension of the expiration date thereof in accordance with
its terms in exchange for the extended or amended Letter of Credit.

(c) Any initial or replacement Letter of Credit delivered to the Cash
Collateral Trustee shall satisfy the following conditions:

(i) it shall be issued by a Qualified Bank or confirmed by a Qualified
Bank;

(ii) it and the related agreement that provides for the issuance of
such Letter of Credit shall be in such form and substance as is acceptable
to the Cash Collateral Trustee and the Trustee, and shall require the
Qualified Bank to give the Cash Collateral Trustee and the Cash Collateral
Beneficiary prompt notice if at any time it shall fail to be a Qualified
Bank and its short-term debt is rated below A-1 by Standard & Poor's;

(iii) it shall be accompanied by an unqualified Opinion of Counsel
or Opinions of Counsel stating that the Letter of Credit is enforceable;
and

(iv) Standard & Poor's shall have advised the Trustee in writing that
the release of such cash from the Cash Collateral Account and the delivery
of such Letter of Credit shall not cause the rating on the Certificates to
be lowered or withdrawn.

The cost of obtaining and maintaining any initial or replacement
Letter of Credit shall be borne solely by the Cash Collateral Beneficiary and
solely from payments to be made to the Cash Collateral Trustee as the holder of
the Subordinated Certificate. If the Cash Collateral Trustee receives notice
that the institution issuing such Letter of Credit is no longer a Qualified Bank
and that its short-term debt is rated below A-1 by Standard & Poor's, the Cash
Collateral Trustee shall immediately notify the Trustee. On the 30th day
following such notice (or the next Business Day thereafter, if such day is not a
Business Day), the Cash Collateral Trustee shall draw under the Letter of Credit
the full amount available under such Letter of Credit and deposit the proceeds
thereof in the Cash Collateral Account, unless prior to such date the Cash
Collateral Beneficiary shall have delivered to the Cash Collateral Trustee a
replacement or confirming Letter of Credit issued by a Qualified Bank.

(d) Any other form of credit enhancement delivered to the Cash
Collateral Trustee shall satisfy the following conditions:

-11-
<PAGE>

(i) it and the related agreement that provides for the alternate form
of credit enhancement shall be in such form and substance as is acceptable
to the Cash Collateral Trustee and the Trustee;

(ii) it shall be accompanied by an unqualified Opinion of Counsel or
Opinions of Counsel stating that such alternate form of credit enhancement
is enforceable; and

(iii) Standard & Poor's shall have advised the Trustee in writing
that the release of such cash from the Cash Collateral Account and delivery
of such alternate form of credit enhancement shall not cause the rating on
the Certificates to be lowered or withdrawn.

The cost of obtaining and maintaining any such alternate form of
credit enhancement shall be borne solely by the Cash Collateral Beneficiary and
solely from payments to be made to the Cash Collateral Trustee as the holder of
the Subordinated Certificate.

-12-
<PAGE>

advice or opinion of counsel delivered to it shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted
by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or opinion of

the costs, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, attorneys'
fees) which might be incurred therein or thereby.

taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be

(i) The Cash Collateral Trustee, in its individual capacity, may own,
hold and dispose of Certificates. The Cash Collateral Trustee may lend money

affiliates thereof.

(j) Except as expressly provided herein, the Cash Collateral Trustee

Agreement or any related document. The Cash Collateral Trustee shall at no time
have any responsibility or liability for the existence or validity of any

not be responsible or liable for any losses incurred in the Cash Collateral
Account.

Whether expressly so provided herein or in the Loan Agreement or the
Cash Collateral Guaranty, every provision of this Agreement, the Loan Agreement
and the Cash Collateral Guaranty relating to the conduct or affecting the
liability of, or affording protection to, the Cash Collateral Trustee shall be
subject to the provisions of this Section 8.

9. Resignation of Cash Collateral Trustee. The Cash Collateral
Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts hereby created

Trustee) by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall

Collateral Trustee. The Servicer shall notify Standard & Poor's of any such
resignation.

10. Amendment of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Seller and
the Servicer agree not to consent to any amendment to the Pooling and Servicing

CASH COLLATERAL GUARANTY

April 7, 1994

First Trust National Association,
as Trustee
180 East Fifth Street
Second Floor
St. Paul, Minnesota 55101

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned, the Cash Collateral Trust 1994-A (the "Cash
Collateral Trust"), hereby guarantees payments of amounts due on the Contracts
to the extent specified in Section 8.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
dated as of March 1, 1994 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), between Green
Tree Financial Corporation, as Seller and Servicer, and First Trust National
Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and the undersigned hereby irrevocably
authorizes you, as Trustee under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, to demand
from time to time pursuant to and as provided in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, in reliance upon a Monthly Report of the Servicer, from and after the
date hereof to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Payment Date (as defined
below) occurring in March 2014 (or such time as this Cash Collateral Guaranty
shall earlier terminate by its terms), a maximum aggregate amount up to but not
exceeding the Available Cash Collateral Amount (as defined below) on the date of
any demand, available against the following document (a "Demand Certificate")
delivered to or presented by facsimile transmission or tested telex in the
manner set forth below:

A Demand Certificate in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto signed
by one who states therein that he is your duly authorized officer and dated
the date such Demand Certificate is presented hereunder, with all blanks
appropriately filled in.

Only one demand may be made hereunder with respect to any Payment
Date; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to preclude you
from making a second demand with respect to any Payment Date to correct any
error in any prior demand with respect to such Payment Date.

A-1

<PAGE>

Demands made hereunder may be made by either: (i) delivery of original
documentation to us at First Bank National Association, 601 Second Avenue South,
Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402 (Attention: Corporate Trust), or (ii) presentation
of facsimile documentation (fax no. (___) __________); or to us at such other
offices or number as we shall designate in writing from time to time. A copy of
such Demand Certificate shall contemporaneously be sent to the Cash Collateral
Depositor. Such facsimile documentation shall be followed by original
documentation as soon as reasonably practicable.

For purposes of this Cash Collateral Guaranty, "Available Cash
Collateral Amount" means:

1. $6,973,030 on the first Payment Date, and

2. with respect to any Payment Date thereafter, the Available Cash
Collateral Amount shall equal the lesser of:

(A) the amount on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account (exclusive 
of earnings and income from the investment of funds therein) as of such
date; and

(B) the Requisite Amount as of such date.

For purposes of this Cash Collateral Guaranty, "Payment Date" means
the 15th day of each calendar month, or if the 15th day shall not be a Business
Day, the next succeeding Business Day, commencing on April 15, 1994.

Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the
meaning set forth in the Cash Collateral Trust Agreement, dated as of March 1,
1994 (the "Cash Collateral Trust Agreement"), among The Daiwa Bank, Limited, as
cash collateral depositor, the Cash Collateral Trustee, Green Tree Financial
Corporation, as seller and servicer (the "Servicer"), and Green Tree Finance
Corp.-Two, as cash collateral beneficiary (the "Cash Collateral Beneficiary").

This Cash Collateral Guaranty sets forth in full the terms of our
undertaking, and except as specifically set forth herein such undertaking shall
not in any way be modified or amended by reference to any other document
whatsoever.

This Cash Collateral Guaranty is neither transferable nor assignable
except to a successor Trustee, in whole but not in part, in its capacity as
successor trustee under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Such transfer and
assignment shall be effective upon receipt by us of a copy of the instrument
effecting such transfer and assignment signed by the transferor and by the
transferee in the form of Exhibit B hereto (which shall be conclusive evidence
of such transfer and assignment), and, in such case, the transferee instead of
the transferor shall, without 

A-2

<PAGE>

the necessity of further action, be entitled to all the benefits of and rights
under this Cash Collateral Guaranty in the transferor's place, provided that, in
such case, the certificate presented hereunder shall be a certificate of the
transferee and shall be signed by one who states therein that he is a duly
authorized officer of the transferee. A copy of each such transfer and
assignment shall be sent to the Cash Collateral Depositor.

The duties and obligations of the Cash Collateral Trustee under this
Cash Collateral Guaranty shall continue only so long as it is acting on behalf
of the Cash Collateral Trust under the Cash Collateral Trust Agreement, and such
duties and obligations shall terminate upon the resignation or removal of the
Cash Collateral Trustee under the Cash Collateral Trust Agreement and shall be
vested in the successor Cash Collateral Trustee appointed under the Cash
Collateral Trust Agreement.

THIS CASH COLLATERAL GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES
OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

Communications with respect to this Cash Collateral Guaranty shall be
addressed to us at First Bank National Association, 601 Second Avenue South,
Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402 , as Cash Collateral Trustee (Attention: Corporate
Trust), or such other address as shall be designated in writing by us to you
specifically referring to this Cash Collateral Guaranty.

Our obligations under this Cash Collateral Guaranty are irrevocable,
absolute and unconditional (to the extent of the Available Cash Collateral
Amount and except as expressly provided herein), and neither the failure of you
or any successor Trustee, in its capacity as successor trustee under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, or the Servicer or any successor Servicer under the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, to perform any covenant or obligation in our
favor (or otherwise), nor the commencement of any bankruptcy, debtor or other
insolvency proceeding by or against you or any successor Trustee, in its
capacity as successor trustee under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or the
Servicer or any successor Servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
shall in any way affect or limit our unconditional obligations under this Cash
Collateral Guaranty. None of the Cash Collateral Trustee, the Cash Collateral
Depositor, the Seller, the Servicer or the Cash Collateral Beneficiary shall
have any personal liability to pay amounts demanded hereunder, such amounts
demanded to be paid solely from funds available in the Cash Collateral Account.

We agree to pay the amount demanded by any Demand Certificate, if
presented as required by and otherwise in compliance with all the terms of this
Cash Collateral Guaranty, such payment to be made in immediately available funds
prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the related Payment Date, which is
on the 

A-3

<PAGE>

Business Day immediately succeeding the Business Day on which such Demand
Certificate was presented or was deemed presented as provided in the following
sentence. If a Demand Certificate is presented as required by and otherwise in
compliance with all the terms of this Cash Collateral Guaranty on a day other
than a Business Day or is presented after 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on a
Business Day, such Demand Certificate shall be deemed to have been presented on
the next succeeding Business Day for all purposes hereof. Upon the earlier of
(i) the receipt by us of written notice in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto
stating that the Cash Collateral Trust Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
its terms (which notice shall be conclusive evidence thereof), signed by you or
a successor Trustee, in its capacity as successor trustee under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, as appropriate, and (ii) 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on
March 15, 2014, or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding
Business Day, this Cash Collateral Guaranty shall automatically terminate.

<PAGE>

It is expressly understood and agreed by the Trustee that this Cash
