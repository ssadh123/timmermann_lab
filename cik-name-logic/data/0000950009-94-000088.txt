FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
---------------------

SOUTHFIELD, Mich., July 14, 1994 -- Chrysler Financial Corporation
(CFC) today reported 1994 second quarter net earnings of $44 million,
compared to net earnings of $44 million in the second quarter of 1993.
John P. Tierney, Chairman of CFC, said the 1994 second quarter
earnings reflect the positive impact of the company's larger automotive
financing portfolio and reduced credit losses. Those factors were offset
by reduced retail automotive margins.
CFC's net earnings for the first six months of 1994 were $91 million,
compared to earnings of $81 million, before the effect of accounting
changes, for the first six months of 1993. 
At June 30, 1994, CFC was managing $30.2 billion in receivables, up
$2.9 billion from a year ago. The increase in receivables managed was
caused by a higher volume of automotive financing. The company's total
assets at June 30, 1994, were $15 billion, consistent with levels at June 30,
1993.
Chrysler Credit, CFC's automotive finance operation, was managing
$27.1 billion in receivables at June 30, 1994, compared to $23.7 billion a
year ago.
During the second quarter of 1994, retail automotive financing volume
was 149,000 new passenger cars, trucks and minivans, representing 24
percent of Chrysler's U.S. retail deliveries, compared to 137,000 vehicles,
or 23 percent in the second quarter of 1993. 
In the second quarter of 1994, Chrysler Credit also financed at
wholesale 421,000 vehicles representing 75 percent of Chrysler's U.S.
factory shipments, compared to 396,000 vehicles or 75 percent in the second
quarter of 1993.

CFC's nonautomotive operations, consisting of Chrysler Capital, a
commercial leasing and lending unit, and Chrysler First Business Credit, a
small business loan operation, were managing $3.1 billion in receivables at
June 30, 1994. A year ago, the company's nonautomotive operations were
managing $3.6 billion in receivables.
Chrysler Insurance, an automotive-related insurance operation, had
direct insurance premiums written of $87 million during the first six
months of 1994, compared to $75 million for the same period a year ago.
In 1994 second quarter capital markets activity, CFC received net
proceeds of $1.8 billion from the sale of U.S. automotive receivables and
sold $540 million of medium term notes. At the end of the second quarter,
CFC had commercial paper outstanding of $3.1 billion compared to $1.6
billion a year ago.
All four major credit ratings agencies increased ratings on the U.S.
senior debt of Chrysler Financial during the second quarter. Duff & Phelps
on June 1 raised the ratings to A- from BBB+; Moody's Investor Service on
May 19 to A3 from Baa2; Fitch Investors Service on May 12 to A- from BBB;
and Standard & Poors on April 19 to BBB+ from BBB. 
On May 23, 1994, CFC successfully put in place new U.S. and Canadian
bank support facilities which replaced existing facilities scheduled to
expire in 1995. These new facilities remove the collateral requirements,
permit dividends, provide for other less restrictive financial covenants,
result in requested reductions in the total commitments, and reduce both
borrowing rates and commitment fees.
These support facilities consist of $5.2 billion of revolving credit
agreements which expire in May 1998 and $1.7 billion of receivable sale
agreements. As of June 30, 1994, none of these facilities had been
utilized.

credit losses. Included in "Investment and other income" are gains before
expected credit losses totaling $41 million and $69 million for the six months
ended June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The provision for credit losses

Credit Facilities

During the second quarter, the Company replaced its existing revolving
credit and receivable sale agreements which were originally scheduled to
expire in 1995. The new agreements provide for lower total commitments,
reductions in borrowing rates and commitment fees and less restrictive
financial covenants, including the relaxation of dividend restrictions and
the removal of security interests in the Company's U.S. assets.

The Company's credit facilities consist of $4.6 billion of U.S. and $.6
billion of Canadian credit facilities which expire in May 1998. The
Company's automotive receivable sale agreements consist of a $1.5 billion
U.S. agreement (of which $.5 billion expires in May 1995, and $1.0 billion
expires in May 1998) and a $.2 billion Canadian agreement (of which $.1
billion expires in May 1995, and $.1 billion expires in May 1998). As of
June 30, 1994 no amounts were outstanding under the Company's revolving
credit or receivable sale agreements.
<PAGE>
Chrysler Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries

Note 3 - Debt (Continued)

In addition, up to $750 million of the total commitment under Chrysler's
revolving credit agreement can be made available to the Company. As of
June 30, 1994, no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement.

The Company has contractual debt maturities of $4.1 billion during the
remainder of 1994 (including $3.1 billion of short-term notes), and $.6
billion in 1995.

Note 4 - Accounting Changes

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities." This new accounting standard specifies the
accounting and reporting requirements for changes in the fair values of
investments with readily determinable fair values. 

At June 30, 1994, the Company had investments in securities with an aggregate
carrying value of $354 million, consisting primarily of commercial paper,
governmental securities and corporate debt. Of these securities, $323 million
were categorized as available-for-sale, and $31 million were categorized as
held-to-maturity. The adjustment of available-for-sale securities to market
value at January 1, 1994 resulted in a $6 million increase to Shareholder's
Investment.

Other Postretirement Benefits

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," ("OPEB") which
requires the accrual of such benefits during the years the employees provide
services. The adoption of SFAS No. 106 resulted in an after-tax charge of
$29 million in 1993, which represented the immediate recognition of the OPEB
transition obligation of $45 million, partially offset by $16 million of
estimated tax benefits. Implementation of SFAS No. 106 did not increase the
Company's cash expenditures for postretirement benefits. Recognition of
on-going expenses under OPEB will not materially affect the Company's results
of operations.

Postemployment Benefits

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." This accounting standard requires the
accrual of benefits provided to former or inactive employees after employment
but prior to retirement. The adoption of this accounting standard resulted in
the recognition of an after-tax charge of $1 million in 1993. Adoption of SFAS
No. 112 has not materially increased the annual expense recognized for these
benefits, and there is no cash impact. Previously reported results for the six
months ended June 30, 1993 have been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS
No. 112, effective January 1, 1993.

Impairment of a Loan

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," which amends SFAS No. 5,
"Accounting for Contingencies", by requiring creditors to evaluate the
collectibility of both contractual interest and principal of receivables when
evaluating the need for a loss accrual. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No.
114 on or before January 1, 1995. The Company has not yet determined the
effect of this new pronouncement on its results of operations and financial
position.

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler
Financial Corporation (a subsidiary of Chrysler Corporation) and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of net earnings and cash flows for the three-months
and six-months ended June 30, 1994 and 1993. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures
to financial data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial
and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for
them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

We have previously audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards, the consolidated balance sheet of Chrysler Financial Corporation
and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of net earnings and cash flows for the year then ended
(not presented herein); and in our report dated January 18, 1994, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our
opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 is fairly presented, in all material
respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been
derived.
