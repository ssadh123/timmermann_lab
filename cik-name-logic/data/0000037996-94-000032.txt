Item 5. Other Events.

Foreign Currency Exposures
- --------------------------
Ford has operations in over 30 countries and sells vehicles
in over 200 markets. These businesses frequently have foreign
currency exposures when they buy, sell, and finance in currencies
other than their local currencies. Ford's primary foreign
currency exposures, in terms of revenue and income, are in the
German Mark, Japanese Yen, Italian Lira, and French Franc. The
effect of changes in exchange rates on income depends largely on
the relationship between revenues and costs incurred in the local
currency versus other currencies. Historically, the effect of
changes in exchange rates on income generally has been small
relative to other factors that also affect income (such as unit
sales).

Ford and many of its subsidiaries enter into agreements to
manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
These agreements primarily hedge debt, firm commitments involving
vehicles and production parts, subsidiary dividends, and net
investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in
foreign currencies. Agreements to manage these exposures include
foreign currency forward contracts, currency swaps, and foreign
currency options. The result of these agreements is to reduce
the effect of exchange rate changes, both favorable and
unfavorable, on income.

Interest Rate Exposures
- -----------------------
Included in Automotive long-term debt at December 31, 1993
were obligations of $6,568 million with fixed interest rates and
$516 million with variable interest rates (generally based on
LIBOR or other short-term rates). Included in Financial
Services' long-term debt at December 31, 1993 were obligations of
$40,717 million with fixed interest rates and $7,183 million with
variable interest rates (generally based on LIBOR or other short-
term rates).

Ford and many of its subsidiaries have entered into
agreements to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates,
which include primarily interest-rate swap agreements and futures
contracts. These agreements decreased the overall weighted-
average interest rate on Automotive long-term debt to 8.7%,
compared with 9.0% excluding these agreements, and effectively
increased the obligations subject to variable interest rates to
$593 million at December 31, 1993. In the case of Financial
Services' long-term debt, these agreements decreased the overall
weighted-average interest rate to 6.6%, compared with 7.2%
excluding these agreements, and effectively decreased the
obligations subject to variable interest rates to $5,858 million
at December 31, 1993. The result of these agreements is to
reduce the effect of interest rate changes, both favorable and
unfavorable, on income. The maturities of these agreements do
not differ materially from the maturities of the related
obligations.
