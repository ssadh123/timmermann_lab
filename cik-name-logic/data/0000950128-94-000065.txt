WESTINGHOUSE COMPLETES $520 MILLION PREFERRED STOCK PLACEMENT

PITTSBURGH, March 29 -- Westinghouse Electric Corporation today announced
that it has issued approximately $520 million of preferred equity securities 
in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A. 

Called PEPS, or Participating Equity Preferred Stock, the new issue is 
mandatorily convertible into common stock on June 1, 1997. A total of 36 
million depositary shares were sold. Each depositary share represents one-
tenth of a share of the company's Series C Conversion Preferred Stock. 

"The successful completion of this placement represents an important 
milestone in our continuing debt reduction program and in rebuilding our 
financial strength, which is especially important in our projects and 
international businesses," said Mike Jordan, chairman and chief executive 
officer. "It will also allow us to pursue strategic growth initiatives, 
similar to the recently announced Norden Systems acquisition." 

The PEPS were priced at $14.44 per depositary share. The depositary 
shares carry an annual dividend of $1.30, equivalent to 9 percent, until 
conversion into common stock. 

Each depositary share will convert automatically into one share of 
common stock on June 1, 1997, subject to earlier conversion at the option of 
the holder or prior redemption by the company on May 30, 1997. If the average 
price of the common stock, determined as of the second trading day preceding 
the redemption notice date, is higher than $13.125, the company expects to 
redeem the depositary shares. Upon such redemption, each shareholder will 
receive a fraction of a share of common stock equal to $13.125 divided by the 
price of the common stock, but in no event less than 0.885 common shares per 
depositary share. 

"Each depositary share was priced at a 10 percent premium to the 
underlying common stock price on March 22, 1994; in dollar terms, this premium 
was equal to $1.32 per depositary share," said Fred Reynolds, executive vice 
president and chief financial officer. "In return for this premium, the 
dividend was set at a higher rate than would have been the case had the issue 
been sold at a price equal to the common stock." 

"We are pleased with the enthusiastic reception that greeted our 
placement," noted Mr. Jordan. "This demonstrates the market's confidence in 
Westinghouse." 

The issue was lead-managed by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, and co-
managed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman Brothers.
