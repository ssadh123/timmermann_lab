RIGHTS AGREEMENT
----------------

Agreement, dated as of July 14, 1994 between Circus Circus Enterprises,
Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), and First Chicago Trust Company of
New York, a New York corporation, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").

RECITALS
--------

The Board of Directors of the Company has authorized and declared a
dividend of one right (a "Right") for each Common Share (as defined in Section
1.6) of the Company outstanding at the close of business on August 15, 1994 (the
"Record Date") and has authorized the issuance of one Right with respect to each
Common Share that shall become outstanding between the Record Date and the
earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date and the Final Expiration
Date (as such terms are defined in Sections 3.1 and 7.1), each Right initially
representing the right to purchase one Common Share.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:

Section 1. Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Rights Agreement,
------------------- 
the following terms have the meanings indicated:

1.1 "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person (as such term is
hereinafter defined) who or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates
(as such terms are hereinafter defined) of such Person, shall be the Beneficial
Owner (as such term is hereinafter defined) of 10% or more of the Common Shares
of the Company then outstanding but shall not include the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any
Subsidiary of the Company or any entity holding shares of capital stock of the
Company for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, in its capacity as an
agent or trustee for any such plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person
shall become an "Acquiring Person" as the result of an acquisition of Common
Shares by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares outstanding,
increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially owned by such Person
to 10% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if a Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of
the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding solely by reason of share
purchases by the Company and shall, after such share purchases by the Company,
become the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares of the Company, then
such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person." Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.1, has become such inadvertently,
and such Person divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of Common
Shares so that such Person would no longer be an Acquiring Person, as defined
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.1, then such Person shall
not be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" at any time for any purposes of this
Agreement.

1.2 "Affiliate" and "Associate" shall have the respective meanings
ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations, as in
effect on the date of this Rights Agreement, under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

1.3 A Person shall be deemed the "Beneficial Owner" of and shall be
deemed to "beneficially own" any securities:

1
<PAGE>

(i) which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or
Associates beneficially owns, directly or indirectly (as determined pursuant
to Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act as
in effect on the date of this Agreement);

(ii) which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or
Associates, directly or indirectly, has (A) the right to acquire (whether
such right is exercisable immediately, or only after the passage of time,
compliance with regulatory requirements, fulfillment of a condition or
otherwise) pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether
or not in writing (other than customary agreements with and between
underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide public
offering of securities), or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange
rights, rights (other than the Rights), warrants or options, or otherwise;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of,
or to beneficially own, (1) securities tendered pursuant to a tender or
exchange offer made by or on behalf of such Person or any of such Person's
Affiliates or Associates until such tendered securities are accepted for
purchase or exchange or (2) securities which such Person or any of such
Person's Affiliates or Associates may acquire, does or do acquire or may be
deemed to have the right to acquire, pursuant to any merger or other
acquisition agreement between the Company and such Person (or one or more of
his Affiliates or Associates) if such agreement has been approved by the
Board of Directors of the Company prior to such Person's becoming an
Acquiring Person; or (B) the right to vote pursuant to any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, or to beneficially
own, any security under this clause (B) if the agreement, arrangement or
understanding to vote such security (1) arises solely from a revocable proxy
or consent given to such Person in response to a public proxy or consent
solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable rules
and regulations of the Exchange Act and (2) is not also then reportable on
Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor report);
or

(iii) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any
other Person (or any Affiliate or Associate thereof) with which such Person
or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates has any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (other than customary agreements with and
between underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide
public offering of securities), whether or not in writing, for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, voting (except pursuant to a revocable proxy as described
in the proviso to Section 1.3(ii)(B)) or disposing of any securities of the
Company.

1.4 "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or
a day on which banking institutions in the State of Nevada are authorized or
obligated by law or executive order to close.

1.5 "close of business" on any given date shall mean 5:00 p.m., Pacific
time, on such date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such date is not a Business Day
it shall mean 5:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the next succeeding Business Day.

2
<PAGE>

1.6 "Common Shares" when used with reference to the Company shall mean
the shares of common stock, par value $.01 2/3 per share, of the Company.
"Common Shares" when used with reference to any Person other than the Company
shall mean the capital stock with the greatest voting power, or the equity
securities or other equity interest having power to control or direct the
management, of such other Person or, if such Person is a Subsidiary of another
Person, the Person or Persons which ultimately control such first-mentioned
Person, and which has issued and outstanding such capital stock, equity
securities or equity interest.

1.7 "Continuing Director" shall mean (i) any member of the Board of
Directors of the Company, while such Person is a member of the Board, who is not
an Acquiring Person, or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person, or an
employee, director, representative, nominee or designee of any Acquiring Person
or of any such Affiliate or Associate, and was a member of the Board prior to
the time that any Person becomes an Acquiring Person or (ii) any Person (during
such period in which such Person is a member of the Board) who, after the time
that any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, becomes a member of the Board and
who is not an Acquiring Person, or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring
Person, or an employee, director, representative, nominee or designee of an
Acquiring Person or of any such Affiliate or Associate, if such Person's
nomination for election or election to the Board is recommended or approved by a
majority of the Continuing Directors.

1.8 "Person" shall mean any individual, partnership, joint venture,
limited liability company, firm, corporation, unincorporated association, trust
or other entity, and shall include any successor (by merger or otherwise) of
such entity.

1.9 "Shares Acquisition Date" shall mean the first date of public
announcement (which, for purposes of this definition, shall include, without
limitation, the filing of a report pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
or pursuant to a comparable successor statute) by the Company or an Acquiring
Person that an Acquiring Person has become such or that discloses information
which reveals the existence of an Acquiring Person.

1.10 "Subsidiary" of any Person shall mean any corporation or other
entity of which a majority of the voting power of the voting equity securities
or equity interests is owned, of record or beneficially, directly or indirectly,
by such Person.

1.11 A "Trigger Event" shall be deemed to have occurred upon any Person
becoming an Acquiring Person.

Section 2. Appointment of Rights Agent. The Company hereby appoints
--------------------------- 
the Rights Agent to act as agent for the Company and the holders of the Rights
(who, in accordance with Section 3, shall prior to the Distribution Date also be
the holders of the Common Shares) in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof, and the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The Company may
from time to time appoint such co-Rights Agents as it may deem necessary or
desirable. In the event the Company appoints one or more co-Rights Agents, the
respective duties of the Rights Agent and any co-Rights Agent shall be as the
Company shall determine. Contemporaneously with such appointment, if any, the
Company shall notify the Rights Agent thereof.

Section 3. Issuance of Right Certificates.
------------------------------ 

3.1 Rights Evidenced by Share Certificates. Until the earlier of (i)
-------------------------------------- 
the tenth day after the Shares Acquisition Date or (ii) the tenth day after the
date of the commencement of, or first public announcement of the intent of any
Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee
benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any entity
holding shares of capital stock of the Company for or pursuant to the terms of
any such plan, in its capacity as an agent or trustee for any such plan) to
commence, a tender or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in
any Person becoming the Beneficial Owner of Common Shares aggregating 10% or
more of the then outstanding Common Shares of the Company (the earlier of (i)
and (ii) being herein referred to as the "Distribution Date," whether or not
either such date occurs prior to the Record Date), (x) the Rights (unless
earlier expired, redeemed or terminated) will be evidenced (subject to the
provisions of Section 3.2) by the certificates for Common Shares registered in
the names of the holders thereof (which certificates for Common Shares shall
also be deemed to be Right Certificates) and not by separate certificates, and
(y) the Rights (and the right to receive certificates therefor) will be
transferable only in connection with the transfer of the underlying Common
Shares. As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent
will send, by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common
Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, at the address of
such holder shown on the records of the Company, a certificate for Rights, in
substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto (a "Right Certificate"), evidencing
one Right for each Common Share so held. As of the Distribution Date, the
Rights will be evidenced solely by such Right Certificates.

3.2 Summary of Rights. On the Record Date or as soon as practicable
----------------- 
thereafter, the Company will send or cause to be sent a copy of a Summary of
Rights to Purchase Common Shares, in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B (the "Summary of Rights"), by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to
each record holder of Common Shares as of the close of business on the Record
Date at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company. With
respect to certificates for

4
<PAGE>

Common Shares outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date, until
the Distribution Date (or the earlier Redemption Date or Final Expiration Date),
the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates for Common Shares registered
in the names of the holders thereof, whether with or without a copy of the
Summary of Rights, and the registered holders of the Common Shares shall also be
registered holders of the associated Rights. Until the Distribution Date (or
the earlier Redemption Date or Final Expiration Date), the surrender for
transfer of any certificate for Common Shares outstanding at the close of
business on the Record Date, with or without a copy of the Summary of Rights
attached thereto, shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated
with the Common Shares represented thereby.

3.3 New Certificates After Record Date. Certificates for Common Shares
---------------------------------- 
which become outstanding (whether upon issuance out of authorized but unissued
Common Shares, issuance out of treasury or transfer or exchange of outstanding
Common Shares) after the Record Date but prior to the earliest of the
Distribution Date, the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date, shall be
deemed also to be certificates for Rights, and shall have impressed, printed,
stamped, written or otherwise affixed onto them the following legend:

This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain
Rights as set forth in a Rights Agreement between Circus Circus Enterprises,
Inc. and First Chicago Trust Company of New York, dated as of July 14, 1994
(the "Rights Agreement"), the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein
by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive
offices of Circus Circus Enterprises, Inc. Under certain circumstances, as
set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced by separate
certificates and will no longer be evidenced by this certificate. Circus
Circus Enterprises, Inc. will mail to the holder of this certificate a copy
of the Rights Agreement without charge after receipt of a written request
therefor. As described in the Rights Agreement, Rights which are held by or
have been held by Acquiring Persons or Associates or Affiliates thereof (as
defined in the Rights Agreement) shall become null and void.

With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing legend, until the
Distribution Date (or the earlier Redemption Date or Final Expiration Date), the
Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificates shall
be evidenced by such certificates, whether with or without a copy of the Summary
of Rights, and the surrender for transfer of any such certificates (with or
without a copy of the Summary of Rights) shall also constitute the transfer of
the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby. In the event
that the Company purchases or acquires any Common Shares after the Record Date
but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such Common
Shares shall be deemed cancelled and retired so that the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the Common Shares which are no
longer outstanding.

Section 4. Form of Right Certificates. The Right Certificates (and the
-------------------------- 
forms of election to purchase shares, certification and assignment to be printed
on the reverse thereof) shall be substantially the same as Exhibit A hereto and
may have such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries
or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are
not inconsistent with the provisions of this Rights Agreement, or as may be
required to comply with any applicable law or with any rule or regulation made
pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange or trading
system on which the Rights may from time to time be listed or quoted, or to
conform to usage. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Right
Certificates, whenever issued, shall be dated as of the Record Date, and shall
show the date of countersignature by the Rights Agent,

5
<PAGE>

and on their face shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase such number of
Common Shares as shall be set forth therein at the price per share set forth
therein (the "Purchase Price"), but the number and kind of such shares and the
Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein.

Section 5. Countersignature and Registration. The Right Certificates
--------------------------------- 
shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board of
Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, President or any Vice President, either
manually or by facsimile signature, and shall have affixed thereto the Company's
seal or a facsimile thereof which shall be attested by the Secretary or any
Assistant Secretary of the Company, either manually or by facsimile signature.
The Right Certificates shall be manually countersigned by an authorized
signatory of the Rights Agent, but it shall not be necessary for the same
signatory to countersign all of the Right Certificates hereunder. No Right
Certificate shall be valid for any purpose unless so countersigned. In case any
officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Right Certificates shall
cease to be such officer of the Company before countersignature by the Rights
Agent and issuance and delivery by the Company, such Right Certificates,
nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent, and issued and delivered
by the Company with the same force and effect as though the person who signed
such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and
any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any person who,
at the actual date of the execution of such Right Certificate, shall be a proper
officer of the Company to sign such Right Certificate, although at the date of
the execution of this Rights Agreement any such person was not such an officer.

Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or cause to
be kept, at one of its offices in New York, books for registration and transfer
of the Right Certificates issued hereunder. Such books shall show the names and
addresses of the respective holders of the Right Certificates, the number of
Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right Certificates, the number of
the Right Certificates and the date of each of the Right Certificates.

Section 6. Transfer, Split Up, Combination and Exchange of Right
-----------------------------------------------------
Certificates; Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Right Certificates. Subject
- --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
to the provisions of Section 11.1.2 and Section 14, at any time after the close
of business on the Distribution Date, and at or prior to the close of business
on the earlier of the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date, any Right
Certificate or Right Certificates (other than Right Certificates representing
Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 11.1.2 or that have been
exchanged pursuant to Section 27) may be transferred, split up or combined or
exchanged for another Right Certificate or Right Certificates, entitling the
registered holder to purchase a like number of Common Shares as the Right
Certificate or Right Certificates surrendered then entitled such holder to
purchase. Any registered holder desiring to transfer, split up or combine or
exchange any Right Certificate shall make such request in writing delivered to
the Rights Agent, and shall surrender, together with any required form of
assignment and certificate duly completed, the Right Certificate or Right
Certificates to be transferred, split up or combined or exchanged at the office
of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose. Neither the Rights Agent nor
the Company shall be obligated to take any action whatsoever with respect to the
transfer of any such surrendered Right Certificate or Right Certificates until
the registered holder shall have completed and signed the certificate contained
in the form of assignment on the reverse side of such Right Certificate or Right
Certificates and shall have provided such additional evidence of the identity of
the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates
thereof as the Company shall reasonably request. Thereupon the Rights Agent
shall countersign and deliver to the person entitled thereto a Right Certificate
or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested. The Company may
require payment from the holders of Right Certificates of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
transfer, split up or combination or exchange of such Right Certificates.

6
<PAGE>

Upon receipt by the Company and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right
Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or
security reasonably satisfactory to them, and, at the Company's request,
reimbursement to the Company and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses
incidental thereto, and upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of
the Right Certificate if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new
Right Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for countersignature and
delivery to the registered owner in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost,
stolen, destroyed or mutilated.

Section 7. Exercise of Rights; Purchase Price; Expiration Date of
------------------------------------------------------
Rights.
- ------ 

7.1 Exercise of Rights. Subject to Section 11.1.3, the registered
------------------ 
holder of any Right Certificate may exercise the Rights evidenced thereby
(except as otherwise provided herein) in whole or in part at any time after the
Distribution Date upon surrender of the Right Certificate, with the form of
election to purchase and certification on the reverse side thereof duly
executed, to the Rights Agent at the office of the Rights Agent designated for
such purpose, together with payment of the Purchase Price for each Common Share
as to which the Rights are exercised, at or prior to the earliest of (i) the
close of business on August 15, 2004 (the "Final Expiration Date"), (ii) the
time at which the Rights are redeemed as provided in Section 23 (the "Redemption
Date"), (iii) the closing of any merger or other acquisition transaction
involving the Company pursuant to an agreement of the type described in Section
1.3(ii)(A)(2), at which time the Rights are deemed terminated, or (iv) the time
at which the Rights are exchanged as provided in Section 27.

7.2 Purchase Price. The Purchase Price for each Common Share pursuant
-------------- 
to the exercise of a Right shall initially be $125, shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as provided in Sections 11, 13 and 26 and shall be
payable in lawful money of the United States of America in accordance with
paragraph 7.3.

7.3 Payment Procedures. Upon receipt of a Right Certificate
------------------ 
representing exercisable Rights, with the form of election to purchase and
certification duly executed, accompanied by payment of the Purchase Price for
the shares to be purchased and an amount equal to any applicable transfer tax
required to be paid by the holder of such Right Certificate in accordance with
Section 9, by certified or cashier's check or money order payable to the order
of the Company, the Rights Agent shall thereupon promptly (i) requisition from
any transfer agent of the Common Shares (or make available, if the Rights Agent
is the transfer agent) certificates for the number of Common Shares to be
purchased and the Company hereby irrevocably authorizes its transfer agent to
comply with all such requests, (ii) when appropriate, requisition from the
Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional
shares in accordance with Section 14, (iii) promptly after receipt of such
certificates, cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the
registered holder of such Right Certificate, registered in such name or names as
may be designated by such holder and (iv) when appropriate, after receipt,
promptly deliver such cash to or upon the order of the registered holder of such
Right Certificate. In the event that the Company is obligated to issue other
securities of the Company, pay cash and/or distribute other property pursuant to
Section 11.1.3, the Company will make all arrangements necessary so that such
other securities, cash and/or other property are available for distribution by
the Rights Agent, if and when appropriate.

7.4 Partial Exercise. In case the registered holder of any Right
---------------- 
Certificate shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new
Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining
unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent and delivered to the registered
holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, subject to
the provisions of Section 14.

7
<PAGE>

7.5 Full Information Concerning Ownership. Notwithstanding anything in
------------------------------------- 
this Rights Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company
shall be obligated to undertake any action with respect to a registered holder
upon the occurrence of any purported exercise as set forth in this Section 7
unless the certificate contained in the form of election to purchase set forth
on the reverse side of the Right Certificate surrendered for such exercise shall
have been duly completed and signed by the registered holder thereof and the
Company shall have been provided with such additional evidence of the identity
of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates
thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.

Section 8. Cancellation and Destruction of Right Certificates. All
-------------------------------------------------- 
Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of exercise, transfer, split up,
combination or exchange shall, if surrendered to the Company or to any of its
agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in cancelled form,
or, if surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be cancelled by it, and no Right
Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by
any of the provisions of this Rights Agreement. The Company shall deliver to
the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so
cancel and retire, any other Right Certificate acquired by the Company otherwise
than upon the exercise thereof. The Rights Agent shall deliver all cancelled
Right Certificates to the Company, or shall, at the written request of the
Company, destroy such cancelled Right Certificates, and in such case shall
deliver a certificate of destruction thereof to the Company.

Section 9. Reservation and Availability of Common Shares. The Company
--------------------------------------------- 
covenants and agrees that it will cause to be reserved and kept available out of
its authorized and unissued Common Shares, or any authorized and issued Common
Shares held in its treasury, the number of Common Shares that will be sufficient
to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights.

So long as the Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of Rights may be
listed on any national securities exchange or traded in the over-the-counter
market and quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
Automated Quotation System ("NASDAQ"), the Company shall use its best efforts to
cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, all shares
reserved for such issuance to be listed on such exchange or so traded in such
over-the-counter market, upon official notice of issuance upon such exercise.

The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as
may be necessary to ensure that all Common Shares delivered upon exercise of
Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such shares
(subject to payment of the Purchase Price), be duly and validly authorized and
issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares.

The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and
payable any and all Federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be
payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of
any Common Shares upon the exercise of Rights. The Company shall not, however,
be required to pay any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of any
transfer or delivery of Right Certificates to a person other than, or the
issuance or delivery of certificates for the Common Shares in a name other than
that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate evidencing Rights
surrendered for exercise or to issue or deliver any certificates for Common
Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder upon the exercise of
any Rights until any such tax shall have been paid (any such tax being payable
by the holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it
has been established to the Company's satisfaction that no such tax is due.

Section 10. Common Shares Record Date. Each person in whose name any
------------------------- 
certificate for Common Shares is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for
all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Common Shares
represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which
the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of
the Purchase Price (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the
Common Shares transfer books of the Company are closed, such person shall be
deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate
shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the Common Shares
transfer books of the Company are open.

Section 11. Adjustment of Purchase Price, Number of Shares or Number of
-----------------------------------------------------------
Rights. The Purchase Price, the number of shares covered by each Right and the
- ------ 
number of Rights outstanding are subject to adjustment from time to time as
provided in this Section 11.

11.1 Post Execution Events.
--------------------- 

11.1.1 Corporate Dividends, Reclassifications, Etc. In the event the
------------------------------------------- 
Company shall at any time after the date of this Rights Agreement (A) declare a
dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, (B) subdivide the
outstanding Common Shares, (C) combine the outstanding Common Shares into a
smaller number of shares or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a
reclassification of the Common Shares (including any such reclassification in
connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing
or surviving corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11.1,
the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or
of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, and
the number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date, shall be
proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such
time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of
capital stock which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such
date and at a time when the Common Shares transfer books of the Company were
open, he would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by
virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification. If an
event occurs which would require an adjustment under both Section 11.1.1 and
Section 11.1.2, the adjustment provided for in this Section 11.1.1 shall be in
addition to, and shall be made prior to, the adjustment required pursuant to,
Section 11.1.2.

11.1.2 Acquiring Person Events; Triggering Events. Subject to Section
------------------------------------------ 
27 of this Agreement, in the event

(A) any Acquiring Person or any Associate or Affiliate of any
Acquiring Person, at any time after the date of this Rights Agreement,
directly or indirectly, shall merge into the Company or otherwise combine
with the Company and the Company shall be the continuing or surviving
corporation of such merger or combination and the Common Shares of the
Company shall remain outstanding and not changed into or exchanged for stock
or other securities of any other Person or the Company or cash or any other
property, or

(B) that a Trigger Event occurs,

then, promptly following the occurrence of each such event listed in this
Section 11.1.2, proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a Right,
except as provided below, shall thereafter have a right to receive, upon
exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of this Rights Agreement, such
number of Common Shares as shall equal the result obtained by (x) multiplying
the then-current Purchase Price by

9
<PAGE>

the then-number of Common Shares for which a Right is then exercisable and (y)
dividing that product by 50% of the current per share market price of the Common
Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11.4) on the first of the date of the
occurrence of, or the date of the first public announcement of, one of the
events listed above in this Section 11.1.2 (the "Adjustment Shares"); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if the transaction that would otherwise give rise to the foregoing
adjustment is also subject to the provisions of Section 13, then only the
provisions of Section 13 shall apply and no adjustment shall be made pursuant to
this Section 11.1.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of
either of the events listed above in this Section 11.1.2, any Rights that are or
were acquired or beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person or any Associate or
Affiliate of the Acquiring Person shall become void and any holder (whether or
not such holder is an Acquiring Person or an Associate or Affiliate of an
Acquiring Person) of such Rights shall thereafter have no right to exercise such
Rights under any provision of this Rights Agreement or otherwise. The Company
shall not enter into any transaction of the type described in this Section
11.1.2 if at the time of such transaction there are any rights, warrants,
instruments or securities outstanding or any arrangements which, as a result of
the consummation of such transaction, would eliminate or substantially diminish
the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights. Any Right Certificate
issued pursuant to Section 3 or Section 22 that represents Rights beneficially
owned by: (1) an Acquiring Person or any Associate or Affiliate thereof, (2) a
transferee of an Acquiring Person (or of any such Associate or Affiliate) who
becomes a transferee after the Acquiring Person becomes such, or (3) a
transferee of an Acquiring Person (or of any such Associate or Affiliate) who
becomes a transferee prior to or concurrently with the Acquiring Person becoming
such and receives such Rights pursuant to either (A) a transfer (whether or not
for consideration) from the Acquiring Person to holders of equity interests in
such Acquiring Person or to any Person with whom the Acquiring Person has any
continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the transferred
Rights or (B) a transfer which the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding which has as a
primary purpose or effect avoidance of this Section 11.1.2 and any Right
Certificate issued pursuant to Section 6, 7.4 or 22 or this Section 11 upon
transfer, exchange, replacement or adjustment of any other Right Certificate
referred to in this sentence, shall contain the following legend (PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Rights Agent shall not be responsible for affixing such legend
unless it has actual knowledge as to the foregoing circumstances or the Company
has notified the Rights Agent in writing thereof):

The Rights represented by this Right Certificate are held or have been
held by a Person who is or was an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or an
Associate of an Acquiring Person or a nominee thereof. This Right
Certificate and the Rights represented hereby have become null and void
as specified in Section 11.1.2 of the Rights Agreement.

The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to insure that the
provisions of this Section 11.1.2 are complied with, but shall have no liability
to any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result of its failure
to make any determinations with respect to any Acquiring Person or its
Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder.

11.1.3 Insufficient Shares. In the event that upon the occurrence of
------------------- 
one or more of the events listed in Section 11.1.2 above there shall not be
sufficient Common Shares authorized but unissued, or held by the Company as
treasury shares, to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with
the foregoing Section 11.1.2, the Company shall take all such action as may be
necessary to authorize additional Common Shares for issuance upon exercise of
the Rights, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Company determines that it is unable
to cause the authorization of a sufficient number of additional Common Shares,
then, in the event the Rights become exercisable, the Company, with respect to
each Right and to the extent necessary and permitted by applicable law and any
agreements or instruments in

10
<PAGE>

effect on the date hereof to which it is a party, shall: (A) determine the
excess of (1) the value of the Adjustment Shares issuable upon the exercise of a
Right (the "Current Value"), over (2) the Purchase Price (such excess, the
"Spread") and (B) with respect to each Right, make adequate provision to
substitute for the Adjustment Shares, upon payment of the applicable Purchase
Price, (1) cash, (2) a reduction in the Purchase Price, (3) Common Shares or
other equity securities of the Company (including, without limitation, shares,
or units of shares, of preferred stock which the Board of Directors of the
Company has deemed to have the same value as Common Shares) (each such share of
preferred stock constituting a "common stock equivalent")), (4) debt securities
of the Company, (5) other assets or (6) any combination of the foregoing having
an aggregate value equal to the Current Value, where such aggregate value has
been determined by the Board of Directors of the Company based upon the advice
of a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board of
Directors of the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Company shall not have
made adequate provision to deliver value pursuant to clause (B) above within
thirty (30) days following the first occurrence of one of the events listed in
Section 11.1.2 above, then the Company shall be obligated to deliver, upon the
surrender for exercise of a Right and without requiring payment of the Purchase
Price, Common Shares (to the extent available) and then, if necessary, cash,
which in the aggregate are equal to the Spread. If the Board of Directors of
the Company shall determine in good faith that it is unlikely that sufficient
additional Common Shares could be authorized for issuance upon exercise in full
of the Rights, the thirty (30) day period set forth above may be extended and
re-extended to the extent necessary, but not more than ninety (90) days
following the first occurrence of one of the events listed in Section 11.1.2
above, in order that the Company may seek stockholder approval for the
authorization of such additional shares (such period as may be extended, the
"Substitution Period"). To the extent that the Company determines that some
action need be taken pursuant to the first and/or second sentences of this
Section 11.1.3, the Company (x) shall provide that such action shall apply
uniformly to all outstanding Rights, and (y) may suspend the exercisability of
the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period in order to seek any
authorization of additional shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of
distribution to be made pursuant to such first sentence and to determine the
value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a
public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been
temporarily suspended as well as a public announcement at such time as the
suspension is no longer in effect. For purposes of this Section 11.1.3, the
value of a Common Share shall be the current per share market price (as
determined pursuant to Section 11.4) on the date of the first occurrence of one
of the events listed in Section 11.1.2 above and the value of any "common stock
equivalent" shall be deemed to have the same value as the Common Shares on such
date.

11.2 Dilutive Rights Offering. In case the Company shall fix a record
------------------------ 
date for the issuance of rights or warrants to all holders of Common Shares
entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 calendar days after such record
date) to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares (or securities convertible into
Common Shares) at a price per Common Share (or having a conversion price per
Common Share, if a security convertible into Common Shares) less than the
current per share market price of the Common Shares (as defined in Section 11.4)
on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date
shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately
prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of
Common Shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of Common
Shares to be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the
convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such current market
price and the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Shares
outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional Common Shares to
be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible
securities so to be offered are initially convertible). In case such
subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be
in a form other than cash, the value of such

11
<PAGE>

consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with
the Rights Agent. Common Shares owned by or held for the account of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose
of any such computation. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever
such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights or warrants are
not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price
which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.

11.3 Distributions. In case the Company shall fix a record date for
------------- 
the making of a distribution to all holders of the Common Shares (including any
such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the
Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of
indebtedness, securities or assets (other than a regular periodic cash dividend
at a rate not in excess of 125% of the rate of the last regular periodic cash
dividend theretofore paid or, in case regular periodic cash dividends have not
theretofore been paid, at a rate not in excess of 50% of the average net income
per share of the Company for the four quarters ended immediately prior to the
payment of such dividend, or a dividend payable in Common Shares (which
dividends, for purposes of this Agreement, shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 11.1.1(A) hereof)) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those
referred to in Section 11.2), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such
record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect
immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the current per share market price of the Common Shares (as defined in
Section 11.4) on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall
be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent) of the portion of the
assets, securities or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed or of such
subscription rights or warrants applicable to one Common Share and the
denominator of which shall be such current per share market price of the Common
Shares. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date
is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase
Price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in
effect if such record date had not been fixed.

11.4 Current Per Share Market Value. For the purpose of any
------------------------------ 
computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of the Common Shares
on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per
share of such Common Shares for the thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days (as
such term is hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that in the event that the current per share market price of the Common
Shares is determined during any period following the announcement by the issuer
of such Common Shares of (i) a dividend or distribution on such Common Shares
payable in such Common Shares or securities convertible into such Common Shares
or (ii) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such Common Shares,
and prior to the expiration of thirty (30) Trading Days after the ex-dividend
date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision,
combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the "current per
share market price" shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the current
market price per Common Share equivalent. The closing price for each day shall
be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on
such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in
either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting
system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York
Stock Exchange or, if the Common Shares are not listed or admitted to trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated
transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal
national securities exchange on which the Common Shares are listed or admitted
to trading or, if the Common Shares are not listed or admitted to trading on any
national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the
average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as
reported by NASDAQ

12
<PAGE>

or such other system then in use, or, if on any such date the Common Shares are
not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked
prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Common
Shares selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. If on any such date
no such market maker is making a market in the Common Shares, the fair value of
the Common Shares on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be used. The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day
on which the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Shares
are listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if
the Common Shares are not listed or admitted to trading on any national
securities exchange, a Business Day. If the Common Shares are not publicly held
or not so listed or traded, "current per share market price" shall mean the fair
value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Company or, if at the time of such determination there is an Acquiring Person,
by a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office, or if there are no
Continuing Directors, by a nationally recognized investment banking firm
selected by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be described in a
statement filed with the Rights Agent.

11.5 Insignificant Changes. No adjustment in the Purchase Price shall
--------------------- 
be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at
least 1% in such price. Any adjustments which by reason of this Section 11.5
are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in
any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made
to the nearest cent or to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share as the case may
be.

11.6 Shares Other Than Common Shares. If as a result of an adjustment
------------------------------- 
made pursuant to Section 11.1, the holder of any right thereafter exercised
shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company
other than Common Shares, thereafter the number of such other shares so
receivable upon exercise of any Right shall be subject to adjustment from time
to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the
provisions with respect to the Common Shares contained in Sections 11.1 through
11.3, inclusive, and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10 and 13 with respect to
the Common Shares shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.

11.7 Rights Issued Prior to Adjustment. All Rights originally issued
--------------------------------- 
by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder
shall evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number
of Common Shares purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the
Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

11.8 Effect of Adjustments. Unless the Company shall have exercised
--------------------- 
its election as provided in Section 11.9, upon each adjustment of the Purchase
Price as a result of the calculations made in Sections 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3, each
Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall
thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that
number of shares (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth) obtained by (i)
multiplying (x) the number of shares covered by a Right immediately prior to
this adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such
adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by
the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase
Price.

11.9 Adjustment in Number of Rights. The Company may elect on or after
------------------------------ 
the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price to adjust the number of Rights,
in substitution for any adjustment in the number of Common Shares issuable upon
the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment
of the number of Rights shall be exercised for the number of Common Shares for
which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right
held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become
that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest

13
<PAGE>

ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately
prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect
immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a
public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating
the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the
adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date on which the Purchase
Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have
been issued, shall be at least ten (10) days later than the date of the public
announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of
the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11.9, the Company shall, as
promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right
Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to
Section 14, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a
result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be
distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the
Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and
upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right Certificates
evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such
adjustment. Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed
and countersigned in the manner provided for herein (and may bear, at the option
of the Company, the adjusted Purchase Price) and shall be registered in the
names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date
specified in the public announcement.

11.10 Right Certificates Unchanged. Irrespective of any adjustment or
---------------------------- 
change in the Purchase Price or the number of Common Shares issuable upon the
exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued
may continue to express the Purchase Price per share and the number of shares
which were expressed in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.

11.11 Par Value Limitations. Before taking any action that would cause
--------------------- 
an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then par value, if any, of
the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take
any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in
order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and
nonassessable Common Shares at such adjusted Purchase Price.

11.12 Deferred Issuance. In any case in which this Section 11 shall
----------------- 
require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a
record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the
occurrence of such event the issuing to the holder of any Right exercised after
such record date the Common Shares and other capital stock or securities of the
Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the Common Shares
and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such
exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or
other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such
additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.

11.12 Reduction in Purchase Price. Anything in this Section 11 to the
--------------------------- 
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make such reductions
in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by
this Section 11, as and to the extent that it in its sole discretion shall
determine to be advisable in order that any consolidation or subdivision of the
Common Shares, issuance wholly for cash of any of the Common Shares at less than
the current market price, issuance wholly for cash of Common Shares or
securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Common
Shares, stock dividends or issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to
hereinabove in this Section 11, hereafter made by the Company to holders of its
Common Shares shall not be taxable to such stockholders.

14
<PAGE>

Section 12. Certificate of Adjusted Purchase Price or Number of Shares.
----------------------------------------------------------
Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Sections 11 and 13, the Company
shall (a) promptly prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, and a
brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) promptly file
with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Shares a copy
of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a
Right Certificate in accordance with Section 25. The Rights Agent shall be
fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment therein
contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any such adjustment
unless and until it shall have received such certificate.

Section 13. Consolidation, Merger or Sale or Transfer of Assets or
------------------------------------------------------
Earning Power.
- ------------- 

13.1 General. In the event that, following the Shares Acquisition
------- 
Date, directly or indirectly, (A) the Company shall consolidate with, or merge
with and into, any other Person and the Company shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation, (B) any Person shall consolidate with the Company, or
merge with and into the Company and the Company shall be the continuing or
surviving corporation of such merger and, in connection with such merger, all or
part of the Common Shares shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other
securities of any other Person or cash or any other property, or (C) the Company
shall sell, exchange, mortgage or otherwise transfer (or one or more of its
Subsidiaries shall sell or otherwise transfer), in one or more transactions
(other than any sale, exchange, mortgage or other transfer in connection with a
financing of the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries that is approved by
at least a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office), assets or
earning power aggregating more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person or Persons,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that (i) each
holder of a Right (except as otherwise provided herein) shall thereafter have
the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current Purchase
Price in accordance with the terms of this Rights Agreement, such number of
Common Shares of such other Person (including the Company as successor thereto
or as the surviving corporation) as shall be equal to the result obtained by (x)
multiplying the then-current Purchase Price by the then-number of Common Shares
for which a Right is then exercisable (without taking into account any
adjustment previously made pursuant to Section 11.1.2) and (y) dividing that
product by 50% of the current per share market price of the Common Shares of
such other Person (determined pursuant to Section 11.4) on the date of
consummation of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer; (ii) the issuer of
such Common Shares shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue
of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, all the obligations and duties
of the Company pursuant to this Rights Agreement; (iii) the term "Company" shall
thereafter be deemed to refer to such issuer; and (iv) such issuer shall take
such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient
number of its Common Shares in accordance with Section 9) in connection with
such consummation as may be necessary to assure that the provisions hereof shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to its
Common Shares thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights. The
Company shall not enter into any transaction of the kind referred to in this
Section 13 if at the time of such transaction there are any rights, warrants,
instruments or securities outstanding or any agreements or arrangements which,
as a result of the consummation of such transaction, would eliminate or
substantially diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights. The
Company shall not consummate any such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer
unless prior thereto the Company and such issuer shall have executed and
delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement so providing. The
provisions of this Section 13 shall similarly apply to successive mergers or
consolidations or sales or other transfers.

15
<PAGE>

13.2 Approved Acquisitions. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
--------------------- 
to the contrary, in the event of any merger or other acquisition transaction
involving the Company pursuant to a merger or other acquisition agreement
between the Company and any Person (or one or more of his Affiliates or
Associates) which agreement has been approved by the Board of Directors of the
Company prior to any Person becoming an Acquiring Person, this Rights Agreement
and the rights of holders of Rights hereunder shall be terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1.

Section 14. Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares.
--------------------------------------- 

14.1 Cash in Lieu of Fractional Rights. The Company shall not be
--------------------------------- 
required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Right Certificates which
evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be
paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which
such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable an amount in cash equal to
the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the
purposes of this Section 14.1, the current market value of a whole Right shall
be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the
date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The
closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case
no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked
prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated
transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to
trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the Rights are not listed or
admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal
consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on
the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or
admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on
any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted,
the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market,
as reported by NASDAQ or such other system then in use or, if on any such date
the Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing
bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market
in the Rights selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. If on any such
date no such market maker is making a market in the Rights, the fair value of
the Rights on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
the Company shall be used.

14.2 Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be
--------------------------------- 
required to issue fractions of shares upon exercise of the Rights or to
distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares. In lieu of fractional
shares, the Company may pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at
the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to
the same fraction of the current market value of one Common Share. For purposes
of this Section 14.2, the current market value of a Common Share shall be the
closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence
of Section 11.4) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such
exercise.

14.3 Waiver of Right to Receive Fractional Rights or Shares. The
------------------------------------------------------ 
holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Rights expressly waives his right to
receive any fractional Rights or any fractional shares upon exercise of a Right.

Section 15. Rights of Action. All rights of action in respect of this
---------------- 
Rights Agreement, except the rights of action given to the Rights Agent under
Section 18, are vested in the respective registered holders of the Right
Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of the
Common Shares); and any registered holder of any Right Certificate (or, prior to
the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), without the consent of the Rights
Agent or of the holder of any other Right Certificate (or, prior to the
Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), may, in his own behalf and for his own
benefit, enforce this Rights Agreement, and may institute and maintain any suit,
action or

16
<PAGE>

proceeding against the Company to enforce this Rights Agreement, or otherwise
enforce or act in respect of his right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such
Right Certificate in the manner provided in such Right Certificate and in this
Rights Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to
the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of
Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Rights
Agreement and shall be entitled to specific performance of the obligations
under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of, the
obligations of any Person (including, without limitation, the Company) subject
to this Rights Agreement.

Section 16. Agreement of Right Holders. Every holder of a Right by
-------------------------- 
accepting the same consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent and
with every other holder of a Right that:

(a) prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferable
only in connection with the transfer of the Common Shares;

(b) as of and after the Distribution Date, the Right Certificates are
transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at
the office of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, duly endorsed or
accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer with all required certifications
completed; and

(c) the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the person in
whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the
associated Common Shares certificate) is registered as the absolute owner
thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of
ownership or writing on the Right Certificates or the associated Common Shares
certificate made by anyone other than the Company or the Rights Agent) for all
purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary.

Section 17. Right Certificate Holder Not Deemed a Stockholder. No
------------------------------------------------- 
holder, as such, of any Right Certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive
dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of the Common Shares or any
other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the
exercise of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything contained herein
or in any Right Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Right
Certificate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any
right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to
stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any
corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting
stockholders (except as provided in Section 24), or to receive dividends or
subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by such
Right Certificate shall have been exercised in accordance with the provisions
hereof.

Section 18. Concerning the Rights Agent. The Company agrees to pay to
--------------------------- 
the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it
hereunder in accordance with a fee schedule to be mutually agreed upon and, from
time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel
fees and other disbursements incurred in the administration and execution of
this Rights Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder.
The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it
harmless against, any loss, liability, or expense, incurred without negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent, for anything
done or omitted by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and
administration of this Rights Agreement, including the costs and expenses of
defending against any claim of liability in the premises.

17
<PAGE>

The Rights Agent shall be protected and shall incur no liability for or
in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with its
administration of this Rights Agreement in reliance upon any Right Certificate
or certificate for the Common Shares or for other securities of the Company,
instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit,
letter, notice, instruction, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or
other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed
and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper person or persons.

Section 19. Merger or Consolidation or Change of Name of Rights Agent.
--------------------------------------------------------- 
Any corporation into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be
merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from
any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights
Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust or
stock transfer business of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, shall
be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the
parties hereto, PROVIDED that such corporation would be eligible for appointment
as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 21. In case at the
time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this
Rights Agreement, any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned
but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the
countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right
Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right
Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may
countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights
Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such
Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates
and in this Rights Agreement.

In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed and at
such time any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not
delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name
and deliver Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of
the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may
countersign such Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed
name; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force
provided in the Right Certificates and in this Rights Agreement.

Section 20. Duties of Rights Agent. The Rights Agent undertakes the
---------------------- 
duties and obligations imposed by this Rights Agreement upon the following terms
and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Right
Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:

20.1 Legal Counsel. The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel
------------- 
selected by it (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and the opinion of
such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the
Rights Agent as to any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in
accordance with such opinion.

20.2 Certificates as to Facts or Matters. Whenever in the performance
----------------------------------- 
of its duties under this Rights Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it
necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the
Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter
(unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may
be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by
any one of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer,
the President, the Chief Financial Officer, any Vice President, the Treasurer,
the Secretary or any Assistant Treasurer or Assistant Secretary of the Company
and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full
authorization to the Rights Agent for any

18
<PAGE>

action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Rights
Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.

20.3 Standard of Care. The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder only
---------------- 
for its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

20.4 Reliance on Rights Agreement and Right Certificates. The Rights
--------------------------------------------------- 
Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or
recitals contained in this Rights Agreement or in the Right Certificates (except
as to its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all
such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the
Company only.

20.5 No Responsibility as to Certain Matters. The Rights Agent shall
--------------------------------------- 
not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Rights
Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof
by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right
Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible
for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this
Rights Agreement or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for
any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming
void pursuant to Section 11.1.2) or any adjustment required under the provisions
of Sections 3, 11, 13, 23 or 27 or responsible for the manner, method or amount
of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would
require any such adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights
evidenced by Right Certificates after actual notice of any such adjustment); nor
shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty
as to the authorization or reservation of any Common Shares to be issued
pursuant to this Rights Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to whether any
Common Shares will, when so issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid
and nonassessable.

20.6 Further Assurance by Company. The Company agrees that it will
---------------------------- 
perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed,
acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and
assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying
out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Rights
Agreement.

20.7 Authorized Company Officers. The Rights Agent is hereby
--------------------------- 
authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance
of its duties hereunder from any one of the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer, any
Vice President, the Treasurer, the Secretary or any Assistant Treasurer or
Assistant Secretary of the Company, and to apply to such officers for advice or
instructions in connection with its duties under this Rights Agreement, and it
shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered to be taken by it in good
faith in accordance with instructions of any such officer or for any delay in
acting while waiting for these instructions. Any application by the Rights
Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights
Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the
Rights Agent with respect to its duties or obligations under this Rights
Agreement and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or
omitted. The Rights Agent shall not be liable to the Company for any action
taken or omitted in accordance with a proposal included in any such application
on or after the date specified therein (which date shall not be less than three
business days after the date any such officer actually receives such
application, unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to an
earlier date) unless, prior to taking of any such action (or the effective date
in the case of omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written
instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken
or omitted.

19
<PAGE>

20.8 Freedom to Trade in Company Securities. The Rights Agent and any
-------------------------------------- 
stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or
deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Company or become
pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be
interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as
fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement.
Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity
for the Company or for any other legal entity.

20.9 Reliance on Attorneys and Agents. The Rights Agent may execute
-------------------------------- 
and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty
hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights
Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, omission, default,
neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the
Company resulting from any such act, omission, default, neglect or misconduct,
PROVIDED that reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued
employment thereof.

20.10 Rights Holders List. At any time and from time to time after the
------------------- 
Distribution Date, upon the request of the Company, the Rights Agent shall
promptly deliver to the Company a list, as of the most recent practicable date
(or as of such earlier date as may be specified by the Company), of the holders
of record of Rights.

Section 21. Change of Rights Agent. The Rights Agent or any successor
---------------------- 
Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Rights
Agreement upon thirty (30) days' notice in writing mailed to the Company and to
each transfer agent of the Common Shares by registered or certified mail. The
Company shall promptly notify the holders of the Right Certificates by first-
class mail of any such resignation. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or
any successor Rights Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice in writing (or such
shorter time period as may be required by any gaming authority), mailed to the
Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer
agent of the Common Shares by registered or certified mail, and to the holders
of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. If the Rights Agent shall resign
or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the resigning,
removed, or incapacitated Rights Agent shall remit to the Company, or to any
successor Rights Agent designated by the Company, all books, records, funds,
certificates or other documents or instruments of any kind then in its
possession which were acquired by such resigning, removed or incapacitated
Rights Agent in connection with its services as Rights Agent hereunder, and
shall thereafter be discharged from all duties and obligations hereunder.
Following notice of such removal, resignation or incapacity, the Company shall
appoint a successor to such Rights Agent. If the Company shall fail to make
such appointment within a period of thirty (30) days after giving notice of such
removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or
incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a
Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for
inspection by the Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate
may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new
Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or
by such a court, shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the
laws of the United States or of the State of New York (or any other state of the
United States so long as such corporation is authorized to do business as a
banking institution in the State of New York) in good standing, having a
principal office in the State of New York, which is authorized under such laws
to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to
supervision or examination by Federal or state authority and which has at the
time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at
least $10 million. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be
vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had
been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the
predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights
Agent any property at the time held by it

20
<PAGE>

hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or
deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such
appointment the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the
predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Shares, and mail
a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates.
Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any
defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or
removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as
the case may be.

Section 22. Issuance of New Right Certificates. Notwithstanding any of
---------------------------------- 
the provisions of this Rights Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the
Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in
such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment
or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or
other securities or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in
accordance with the provisions of this Rights Agreement. In addition, in
connection with the issuance or sale of Common Shares following the Distribution
Date and prior to the redemption or expiration of the Rights, the Company (a)
shall, with respect to Common Shares so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise
of stock options or under any employee plan or arrangement, granted or awarded
as of the Distribution Date, or upon exercise, conversion or exchange of
securities hereinafter issued by the Company, and (b) may, in any other case, if
deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company, issue
Right Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection
with such issuance or sale; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) no such Right
Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, the Company shall be
advised by counsel that such issuance would create a significant risk of
material adverse tax consequences to the Company or the Person to whom such
Right Certificate would be issued, (ii) no such Right Certificate shall be
issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall otherwise have
been made in lieu of the issuance thereof and (iii) at the time of a
determination by the Board of Directors to cause the Company to issue a Right
Certificate under clause (b) above, there must be Continuing Directors then in
office and any such determination shall require the approval of at least a
majority of such Continuing Directors.

Section 23. Redemption.
---------- 

23.1 Right to Redeem. The Board of Directors of the Company may, at
--------------- 
its option, at any time prior to the close of business on the Shares Acquisition
Date, redeem all but not less than all of the then outstanding Rights at a
redemption price of $.01 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar transaction occurring after
the date hereof (such redemption price being hereinafter referred to as the
"Redemption Price"). Anything contained in this Rights Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Rights shall not be exercisable following a
transaction or event described in Section 11.1.2 prior to the expiration of the
Company's right of redemption under this Section 23.1. The redemption of the
Rights by the Board of Directors of the Company may be made effective at such
time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its
sole discretion may establish.

23.2 Redemption Procedures. Immediately upon the action of the Board
--------------------- 
of Directors of the Company ordering the redemption of the Rights, and without
any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will
terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to
receive the Redemption Price. Within ten (10) days after the action of the
Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights, the Company shall
give, or cause the Rights Agent to give, notice of such redemption to the
holders of the then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice to all such
holders at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the
Rights Agent or, prior to the

21
<PAGE>

Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common
Shares. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be
deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice
of redemption will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price
will be made. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Associates may
redeem, acquire or purchase for value any Rights at any time in any manner other
than that specifically set forth in this Section 23 or in Section 27, and other
than in connection with the purchase of Common Shares prior to the Distribution
Date.

Section 24. Notice of Certain Events. In case the Company shall
------------------------ 
propose (a) to pay any dividend payable in stock of any class to the holders of
Common Shares or to make any other distribution to the holders of Common Shares
(other than a regular periodic cash dividend at a rate not in excess of 125% of
the rate of the last regular periodic cash dividend theretofore paid or, in case
regular periodic cash dividends have not theretofore been paid, at a rate not in
excess of 50% of the average net income per share of the Company for the four
quarters ended immediately prior to the payment of such dividends, or a stock
dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Common
Shares) or (b) to offer to the holders of Common Shares rights or warrants to
subscribe for or to purchase any additional Common Shares or shares of stock of
any class or any other securities, rights or options, or (c) to effect any
reclassification of its Common Shares (other than a reclassification involving
only the subdivision of Common Shares), or (d) to effect any consolidation or
merger into or with, or to effect any sale or other transfer (or to permit one
or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or other transfer), in one or
more transactions (other than any sale, exchange, mortgage or other transfer in
connection with a financing of the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries
that is approved by at least a majority of the Continuing Directors then in
office), of more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to, any other Person (other than pursuant to a
merger or other acquisition agreement of the type described in Section 1.3(b)),
or (e) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company,
then, in each such case, the Company shall give to the Rights Agent and to each
holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 25, a notice of such
proposed action, which shall specify the record date for the purposes of such
stock dividend, distribution of rights or warrants, or the date on which such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up is to take place and the date of participation
therein by the holders of the Common Shares, if any such date is to be fixed,
and such notice shall be so given in the case of any action covered by clause
(a) or (b) above at least ten (10) days prior to the record date for determining
holders of the Common Shares for purposes of such action, and in the case of any
such other action, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the taking of
such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of the
Common Shares, whichever shall be the earlier.

In case any event set forth in Section 11.1.2 of this Rights Agreement
shall occur, then, in any such case, the Company shall as soon as practicable
thereafter give to the Rights Agent and to each holder of a Right Certificate,
in accordance with Section 25, a notice of the occurrence of such event, which
notice shall describe the event and the consequences of the event to holders of
Rights under Section 11.1.2.

Notwithstanding anything in this Rights Agreement to the contrary, prior
to the Distribution Date a filing by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission shall constitute sufficient notice to the holders of
securities of the Company, including the Rights, for purposes of this Rights
Agreement and no other notice need be given.

Section 26. Supplements and Amendments. Prior to the Distribution Date
-------------------------- 
and subject to the last sentence of this Section 26, the Company and the Rights
Agent shall, if the Company so directs, supplement or amend any provision of
this Rights Agreement without the approval of any holders of certificates
representing Common Shares. From and after the Distribution Date and subject to
the last sentence of this Section 26, the Company and the Rights Agent may from
time to time supplement or amend this Rights Agreement without the approval of
any holders of Right Certificates (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or
supplement any provision contained herein which may be defective or inconsistent
with any other provisions herein, (ii) to shorten or lengthen any time period
hereunder (which shortening or lengthening, following the Shares Acquisition
Date, shall be effective only if there are Continuing Directors and shall
require the approval of at least a majority of such Continuing Directors) or
(iii) so long as the interests of the holders of the Right Certificates (other
than an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person)
are not adversely affected thereby, to make any other changes or provisions in
regard to matters or questions arising hereunder which the Company and the
Rights Agent may deem necessary or desirable, including but not limited to
extending the Final

23
<PAGE>

Expiration Date. Upon the delivery of a certificate from an appropriate officer
of the Company which states that the proposed supplement or amendment is in
compliance with the terms of this Section 26, the Rights Agent shall execute
such supplement or amendment. Prior to the Distribution Date, the interests of
the holders of Rights shall be deemed coincident with the interests of the
holders of Common Shares. Without limiting the foregoing, at any time prior to
such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, the Company and the Rights
Agent may amend this Agreement to change the thresholds set forth in Sections
1.1 and 3.1 to not less than the greater of (i) any percentage greater than the
largest percentage of the outstanding Common Shares then known by the Company to
be beneficially owned by any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any
such plan) and (ii) 10%.

Section 27. Exchange.
-------- 

27.1 Exchange of Common Shares for Rights. The Board of Directors of
------------------------------------ 
the Company may, at its option, at any time after the occurrence of a Trigger
Event, exchange Common Shares for all or part of the then outstanding and
exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void
pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.1.2) by exchanging that number of
Common Shares having an aggregate value equal to the Spread (with such value
being based on the current per share market price (as determined pursuant to
Section 11.4) on the date of the occurrence of a Trigger Event) per Right,
appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar
transaction occurring after the date hereof (such amount per Right being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Consideration"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such
exchange at any time after any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any such Subsidiary, or
any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan),
together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the
Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding and (ii)
the Board shall not be empowered to effect an exchange for more than that number
of Rights for which there are sufficient Common Shares authorized but unissued,
or held by the Company as treasury shares, to permit the exchange for Rights.

27.2 Exchange Procedures. Immediately upon the action of the Board of
------------------- 
Directors of the Company ordering the exchange for any Rights pursuant to
Section 27.1 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to
exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder
of such Rights shall be to receive that number of Common Shares equal to the
number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange
Consideration. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such
exchange; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give, or any defect in, such
notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. The Company promptly
shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at
their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent.
Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given,
whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange
will state the method by which the exchange of the Common Shares for Rights will
be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights
which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based
on the number of Rights (other than the Rights which have become void pursuant
to the provisions of Section 11.1.2) held by each holder of Rights.

27.3 No Fractional Shares Upon Exchange. The Company shall not be
---------------------------------- 
required to issue fractions of Common Shares or to distribute certificates which
evidence fractional Common Shares. In lieu of such fractional Common Shares,
the Company shall pay to the registered holders of the Right

24
<PAGE>

Certificates, with regard to which such fractional Common Shares would otherwise
be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market
value of a whole Common Share. For the purposes of this Section 27.3, the
current market value of a whole Common Share shall be the current per share
market value (as determined pursuant to Section 11.4) for the Trading Day
immediately prior to the date of exchange pursuant to this Section 27.

Section 28. Successors. All the covenants and provisions of this
---------- 
Rights Agreement by or for the benefit of the Company or the Rights Agent shall
bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns
hereunder.

Section 29. Benefits of this Rights Agreement. Nothing in this Rights
--------------------------------- 
Agreement shall be construed to give to any person or corporation other than the
Company, the Rights Agent and the registered holders of the Right Certificates
(and, prior to the Distribution Date, the Common Shares) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under this Rights Agreement; but this Rights Agreement
shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Company, the Rights Agent and
the registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution
Date, the Common Shares).

Section 30. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or
------------

SUMMARY OF RIGHTS TO PURCHASE
COMMON SHARES

On July 14, 1994 the Board of Directors of Circus Circus Enterprises,
Inc. (the "Company") declared a dividend of one Right for each share of common
stock, $.01^ par value (the "Common Shares"), of the Company outstanding at the
close of business on August 15, 1994 (the "Record Date"). As long as the Rights
are attached to the Common Shares, the Company will issue one Right with each
new Common Share so that all such shares will have attached Rights. Each Right
entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one Common Share at
a price of $125 per share, subject to adjustment (the "Purchase Price"). The
description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement (the
"Rights Agreement") between the Company and First Chicago Trust Company of New
York, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").

Until the earlier to occur of (i) ten (10) days following a public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an
"Acquiring Person") has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial
ownership of 10% or more of the Common Shares or (ii) ten (10) days following
the commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or
exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial
ownership by a person or group of 10% or more of the Common Shares (the earlier
of (i) and (ii) being called the "Distribution Date," whether or not either such
date occurs prior to the Record Date), the Rights will be evidenced, with
respect to any of the Common Share certificates outstanding as of the Record
Date, by such Common Share certificate, with or without a copy of this Summary
of Rights attached thereto.

The Rights Agreement provides that until the Distribution Date, the
Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares. Until the
Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), new
Common Share certificates issued after the close of business on the Record Date
upon transfer or new issuance of the Common Shares will contain a notation
incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date
(or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer
of any certificates for Common Shares, with or without a copy of this Summary of
Rights attached thereto, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights
associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate. As soon as
practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing
the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the
Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such
separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.

The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The
Rights will expire on August 15, 2004, subject to the Company's right to extend
such date (the "Final Expiration Date"), unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by
the Company or terminated.

The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Common Shares or other
securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to
adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock
dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Common
Shares, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Common Shares of certain rights or
warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares or convertible securities at
less than the current market price of the Common Shares or (iii) upon the
distribution to holders of the Common Shares of evidences of indebtedness,
securities or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends at a rate not in
excess of 125% of the rate of the last regular periodic cash dividend
theretofore paid or, in case regular periodic cash dividends have not
theretofore been paid, at a rate not in excess of 50% of the average net income

B-1
<PAGE>

per share of the Company for the four quarters ended immediately prior to the
payment of such dividend, or dividends payable in Common Shares (which dividends
will be subject to the adjustment described in clause (i) above)) or of
subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).

In the event that a Person becomes an Acquiring Person or if the
Company were the surviving corporation in a merger with an Acquiring Person or
any affiliate or associate of an Acquiring Person and the Common Shares were not
changed or exchanged, each holder of a Right, other than Rights that are or were
acquired or beneficially owned by the 10% stockholder (which Rights will
thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise
that number of Common Shares having a market value of two times the then current
Purchase Price of the Right. In the event that, following the first date of
public announcement that a Person or group has become an Acquiring Person, the
Company were acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or
more than 50% of its assets or earning power were sold, proper provision shall
be made so that each holder of a Right shall thereafter have the right to
receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current Purchase Price of the
Right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at
the time of such transaction would have a market value of two times the then
current Purchase Price of the Right.

At any time after a Person becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to
the acquisition by such Acquiring Person of 50% or more of the outstanding
Common Shares, the Board of Directors may cause the Company to acquire the
Rights (other than Rights owned by an Acquiring Person which have become void),
in whole or in part, in exchange for that number of Common Shares having an
aggregate value equal to the Spread (the excess of the value of the Common
Shares issuable upon exercise of a Right after a Person becomes an Acquiring
Person over the Purchase Price) per Right (subject to adjustment).

No adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative
adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. No
fractional shares will be issued and in lieu thereof, a payment in cash will be
made based on the market price of the Common Shares on the last trading date
prior to the date of exercise.

The Rights may be redeemed in whole, but not in part, at a price of
$.01 per Right (the "Redemption Price") by the Board of Directors at any time
prior to the close of business on the first date of public announcement that a
Person or group has become an Acquiring Person. Immediately upon the action of
the Board of Directors of the Company electing to redeem the Rights, the Company
shall make an announcement thereof, and upon such election, the right to
exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights
will be to receive the Redemption Price.

Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no
rights as a stockholder of the Company beyond those as an existing stockholder,
including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.

Any of the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by the
Board of Directors of the Company prior to the Distribution Date. After the
Distribution Date, the Company and the Rights Agent may amend or supplement the
Rights Agreement without the approval of any holders of Right Certificates to
cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision contained therein
which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions therein, to
shorten or lengthen any time period under the Rights Agreement (so long as,
under certain circumstances, a majority of Continuing Directors (as defined
below) approve such shortening or lengthening), or so long as the interests of
the holders of Right Certificates (other than an Acquiring Person or an
affiliate or associate of an Acquiring Person) are not adversely affected
thereby, to make any other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising
thereunder which the Company and the Rights Agent may deem necessary or
desirable, including but not

B-2
<PAGE>

limited to extending the Final Expiration Date. The Company may at any time
prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person amend the Rights
Agreement to change the thresholds described above to not less than the greater
of (i) any percentage greater than the largest percentage of the outstanding
Common Shares then known by the Company to be beneficially owned by any person
or group of affiliated or associated persons and (ii) 10%.

The term "Continuing Directors" means any member of the Board of
Directors of the Company who was a member of the Board prior to the time that
any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, and any person who is subsequently
elected to the Board if such person is recommended or approved by a majority of
the Continuing Directors. Continuing Directors do not include an Acquiring
Person, or an affiliate or associate of an Acquiring Person, or any
representative of the foregoing.

A copy of the Rights Agreement has been filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as an Exhibit to a Registration Statement on Form 8-A. A
copy of the Rights Agreement is available free of charge from the Company. This
summary description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

[Circus Circus Enterprises, Inc. Letterhead]

August 15, 1994

To Our Stockholders:

On July 14, 1994, the Board of Directors of Circus Circus Enterprises,
Inc. adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan that is intended to protect your
interests in the event you and Circus Circus Enterprises, Inc. are confronted
with coercive takeover tactics.

The Plan provides for a dividend distribution of Rights to purchase
shares of Circus Circus Common Stock. Under certain circumstances, the Rights
could become exercisable to purchase Circus Circus Common Stock, or securities
of an acquiring entity, at one-half market value. The Rights may be exercised
only if certain events occur. You are now the owner of one Right for each share
of Circus Circus Common Stock you own. The Plan has been adopted in order to
strengthen the ability of the Board to protect your interests.

We are attaching a summary description that outlines the principal
features of the Plan, and we urge you to read the summary carefully. This
letter reviews our reasons for issuing the Rights.

NO ACTION BY STOCKHOLDERS IS REQUIRED OR PERMITTED AT THIS TIME, AND NO
MONEY SHOULD BE SENT TO CIRCUS CIRCUS. THE RIGHTS WILL AUTOMATICALLY ATTACH TO
THE COMMON SHARES YOU HOLD AND WILL TRADE WITH THEM. SEPARATE RIGHTS
CERTIFICATES WILL BE SENT TO STOCKHOLDERS ONLY IF A PERSON OR GROUP ACQUIRES 10%
OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OR MAKES A TENDER OFFER FOR
10% OR MORE OF THE COMMON STOCK. CIRCUS CIRCUS COMMON STOCK CERTIFICATES ISSUED
AFTER AUGUST 15, 1994 WILL CONTAIN A REFERENCE TO THE RIGHTS PLAN, BUT THERE IS
NO NEED TO SEND IN YOUR CERTIFICATES TO HAVE THIS REFERENCE ADDED.

The Rights are designed to protect stockholders in the event of an
unsolicited attempt to acquire the Company, including through an accumulation of
Common Stock in the open market, a partial, two-tier or inadequate tender offer
that does not treat all stockholders equally and other abusive takeover tactics
which the Board of Directors believes are not in the best interests of
stockholders. These tactics unfairly pressure stockholders, squeeze them out of
their investment without giving them any real choice and deprive them of the
full value of their Common Stock. We consider these Rights to be a valuable
means of protecting both your right to retain your equity investment in the
Company and the full value of that investment, while not foreclosing a fair
acquisition bid for the Company.

The Rights are not intended to prevent a takeover of Circus Circus and
will not do so. They are designed to deal with the possibility of unilateral
actions by hostile acquirors that could deprive the Board of Directors and
stockholders of Circus Circus of their ability to determine the Company's
destiny and obtain the highest price for their Common Stock.
<PAGE>

Adoption of the Plan should not by itself affect any prospective
acquiror who is willing to negotiate with the Company's Board of Directors. The
Plan certainly will not interfere with a merger or other business combination
transaction approved by the Board of Directors.

The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not affect
reported earnings per share and is not taxable to the Company or to you.
Stockholders may, under certain circumstances, recognize taxable income if the
Rights become exercisable.

Our overriding objective is to continue building value for Circus Circus
stockholders, and we feel that the Plan will assist in that effort.

Sincerely,

Clyde Turner
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

SUMMARY OF RIGHTS TO PURCHASE
COMMON SHARES

On July 14, 1994 the Board of Directors of Circus Circus Enterprises,
Inc. (the "Company") declared a dividend of one Right for each share of common
stock, $.01 2/3 par value (the "Common Shares"), of the Company outstanding at
the close of business on August 15, 1994 (the "Record Date"). As long as the
Rights are attached to the Common Shares, the Company will issue one Right with
each new Common Share so that all such shares will have attached Rights. Each
Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one Common
Share at a price of $125 per share, subject to adjustment (the "Purchase
Price"). The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights
Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") between the Company and First Chicago Trust
Company of New York, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").

Until the earlier to occur of (i) ten (10) days following a public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an
"Acquiring Person") has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial
ownership of 10% or more of the Common Shares or (ii) ten (10) days following
the commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or
exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial
ownership by a person or group of 10% or more of the Common Shares (the earlier
of (i) and (ii) being called the "Distribution Date," whether or not either such
date occurs prior to the Record Date), the Rights will be evidenced, with
respect to any of the Common Share certificates outstanding as of the Record
Date, by such Common Share certificate, with or without a copy of this Summary
of Rights attached thereto.

The Rights Agreement provides that until the Distribution Date, the
Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares. Until the
Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), new
Common Share certificates issued after the close of business on the Record Date
upon transfer or new issuance of the Common Shares will contain a notation
incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date
(or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer
of any certificates for Common Shares, with or without a copy of this Summary of
Rights attached thereto, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights
associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate. As soon as
practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing
the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the
Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such
separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.

The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights
will expire on August 15, 2004, subject to the Company's right to extend such
date (the "Final Expiration Date"), unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the
Company or terminated.

The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Common Shares or other
securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to
adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock
dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Common
Shares, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Common Shares of certain rights or
warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares or convertible securities at
less than the current market price of the Common Shares or (iii) upon the
distribution to holders of the Common Shares of evidences of indebtedness,
securities or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends at a rate not in
excess of 125% of the rate of the last regular periodic cash dividend
theretofore paid or, in case regular periodic cash dividends have not
theretofore been paid, at a rate not in excess of 50% of the average net income
per share of the Company for the four quarters ended immediately prior to the
payment of such dividend,

<PAGE>

or dividends payable in Common Shares (which dividends will be subject to the
adjustment described in clause (i) above)) or of subscription rights or warrants
(other than those referred to above).

In the event that a Person becomes an Acquiring Person or if the Company
were the surviving corporation in a merger with an Acquiring Person or any
affiliate or associate of an Acquiring Person and the Common Shares were not
changed or exchanged, each holder of a Right, other than Rights that are or were
acquired or beneficially owned by the 10% stockholder (which Rights will
thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise
that number of Common Shares having a market value of two times the then current
Purchase Price of the Right. In the event that, following the first date of
public announcement that a Person or group has become an Acquiring Person, the
Company were acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or
more than 50% of its assets or earning power were sold, proper provision shall
be made so that each holder of a Right shall thereafter have the right to
receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current Purchase Price of the
Right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at
the time of such transaction would have a market value of two times the then
current Purchase Price of the Right.

At any time after a Person becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the
acquisition by such Acquiring Person of 50% or more of the outstanding Common
Shares, the Board of Directors may cause the Company to acquire the Rights
(other than Rights owned by an Acquiring Person which have become void), in
whole or in part, in exchange for that number of Common Shares having an
aggregate value equal to the Spread (the excess of the value of the Common
Shares issuable upon exercise of a Right after a Person becomes an Acquiring
Person over the Purchase Price) per Right (subject to adjustment).

No adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative
adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. No
fractional shares will be issued and in lieu thereof, a payment in cash will be
made based on the market price of the Common Shares on the last trading date
prior to the date of exercise.

The Rights may be redeemed in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01
per Right (the "Redemption Price") by the Board of Directors at any time prior
to the close of business on the first date of public announcement that a Person
or group has become an Acquiring Person. Immediately upon the action of the
Board of Directors of the Company electing to redeem the Rights, the Company
shall make an announcement thereof, and upon such election, the right to
exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights
will be to receive the Redemption Price.

Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no
rights as a stockholder of the Company beyond those as an existing stockholder,
including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.

Any of the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by the
Board of Directors of the Company prior to the Distribution Date. After the
Distribution Date, the Company and the Rights Agent may amend or supplement the
Rights Agreement without the approval of any holders of Right Certificates to
cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision contained therein
which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions therein, to
shorten or lengthen any time period under the Rights Agreement (so long as,
under certain circumstances, a majority of Continuing Directors (as defined
below) approve such shortening or lengthening), or so long as the interests of
the holders of Right Certificates (other than an Acquiring Person or an
affiliate or associate of an Acquiring Person) are not adversely affected
thereby, to make any other provisions in regard to matters or questions

2
<PAGE>

arising thereunder which the Company and the Rights Agent may deem necessary or
desirable, including but not limited to extending the Final Expiration Date.
The Company may at any time prior to such time as any Person becomes an
Acquiring Person amend the Rights Agreement to change the thresholds described
above to not less than the greater of (i) any percentage greater than the
largest percentage of the outstanding Common Shares then known by the Company to
be beneficially owned by any person or group of affiliated or associated persons
and (ii) 10%.

The term "Continuing Directors" means any member of the Board of
Directors of the Company who was a member of the Board prior to the time that
any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, and any person who is subsequently
