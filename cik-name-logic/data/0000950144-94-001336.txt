(2) At the effective time of the merger of American Bancshares, Inc. ("ABI")

issued and outstanding at the ABI Effective Time, with certain
exceptions, will be converted into 2.4445 shares of Regions Common
Stock.

(3) At the effective time of the merger of BNR Bancshares, Inc. ("BNR") into

Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) $79.70 by
(ii) the average of the daily closing sale prices of Regions Common
Stock on the Nasdaq National Market (as reported by The Wall Street
Journal or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source chosen
by Regions) for the 20 consecutive full trading days in which such
shares are traded on the Nasdaq National

Market ending at the close of trading on the fifth trading day preceding
the BNR Effective Time, subject to minimum and maximum exchange ratios
of 2.214 and 3.065.

(4) At the effective time of the merger of First Community Bancshares, Inc.
("First Community") into Regions (the "First Community Effective Time"),
each share of First Community common stock issued and outstanding at the
First Community Effective Time, with certain exceptions, will be
converted into .95 shares of Regions Common Stock.

(5) At the effective time of the merger of Union Bank & Trust Company
("Union") with Regions (the "Union Effective Time"), each share of Union
common stock issued and outstanding at the Union Effective Time will be
converted into that number of shares of Regions Common Stock equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (i) $16.53 by (ii) the average of the
daily closing sales prices of Regions Common Stock on the Nasdaq
National Market (as reported by The Wall Street Journal or, if not
reported thereby, another authoritative source chosen by Regions) for
the 10 consecutive full trading days in which such shares are traded on
the Nasdaq National Market ending at the close of trading on the fifth
trading day preceding the Union Effective Time.

If the Recently Completed Acquisitions and all of the Pending 
Acquisitions had been consummated on March 31, 1994, based on March 31, 1994 
pro forma financial information, Regions' total consolidated assets would have 
increased by approximately $1.3 billion to approximately $11.7 billion; its 
total consolidated deposits would have increased by approximately $1.2 billion 
to approximately $9.9 billion; and its total consolidated stockholders' equity
would have increased by approximately $38 million to approximately $916
million.

Consummation of the Pending Acquisitions is subject to the
approval of certain regulatory agencies and of the stockholders of the
institutions to be acquired and to the effectiveness of the registration
statements filed or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Moreover, the closing of each transaction is subject to various contractual
conditions precedent. No assurance can be given that the conditions precedent
to consummating the Pending Acquisitions will be satisfied in a manner that
will result in the consummation of all of the Pending Acquisitions.

In connection with the acquisitions of ABI and Union, Regions has
announced that it may purchase, in the open market, an equivalent number of 
some or all of the shares of Regions Common Stock to be issued in such 
transactions. As a result of the ABI and Union transactions, Regions 
anticipates that it may purchase in the open market as much as approximately 
$126 million of Regions Common Stock. The timing and amount of such possible 
purchases will be determined based on Regions Common Stock price, capital 
needs, and other factors. As of July 15, 1994, Regions had purchased
approximately $24.7 million of Regions Common Stock pursuant to this repurchase
program.

Regions continually evaluates business combination opportunities
and frequently conducts due diligence activities in connection with possible
business combinations. As a result, business combination discussions and, in
some cases, negotiations frequently take place, and future business
combinations involving cash, debt, or equity securities can be expected. Any
future business combination or series of business combinations that Regions
might undertake may be material, in terms of assets acquired or liabilities
assumed, to Regions'

- 4 -
<PAGE> 5

financial condition. Recent business combinations in the banking industry
typically have involved the payment of a premium over book and market values.
This practice could result in dilution of book value and net income per share
for the acquirer.

Included as an exhibit to this Current Report, and incorporated
herein by reference, is certain unaudited pro forma financial information of
Regions as of March 31, 1994, prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X, 
giving effect to the above-discussed acquisitions.

(a) Upon consummation of the merger with BNR, each share of BNR common stock 
will be converted into 2.3791 shares of Regions Common Stock, assuming a 
$33.50 per share market price of Regions Common Stock. The BNR transaction 
will be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests, therefore the effect upon
stockholders' equity will be to increase Regions stockholders' equity by 
the total equity of BNR. The unaudited pro forma financial statements have 
been prepared assuming that Regions will issue approximately 776,105 
(2.3791 x 326,218) shares of Regions Common Stock to the stockholders of

issuance of the shares.

(b) Upon consummation of the merger with Guaranty, each share of Guaranty
common stock was converted into 1.09375 shares of Regions Common Stock. 
The Guaranty transaction was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests,

forma financial statements have been prepared assuming that Regions issued 
828,850 (1.09375 x 757,805) shares of Regions Common Stock to the

(c) Upon consummation of the merger with First Community, each share of First
Community common stock will be converted into .95 shares of Regions Common 
Stock. The First Community transaction will be accounted for as a 
pooling-of-interests, therefore the effect upon stockholders' equity will

Community. The unaudited pro forma financial statements have been prepared 
assuming that Regions will issue approximately 664,914 (.95 x 699,909) 
shares of Regions Common Stock to the stockholders of First Community. A 
reclassification from common stock to surplus results from the issuance of
