FOR RELEASE:

April 26, 1994

MK RAIL CORPORATION OFFERS 6 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

BOISE, IDAHO -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation's wholly owned
subsidiary - MK Rail Corporation - announced today the initial
public offering of 6 million shares of common stock to be sold at
$16.00 per share. The stock's trading symbol is MKRL and is
traded on the NASDAQ.
The offering, managed by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated
and CS First Boston Corporation, consists of 6 million shares and
grants underwriters an option to purchase an additional 900,000
shares of common stock to cover over-allotments. When the
offering is completed, Morrison Knudsen Corporation will own
11,149,000 shares of MK Rail common stock, or approximately 65
percent of the total outstanding shares, assuming the over-
allotment option is not exercised.
Proceeds of the offering will be used to retire debt and
for general corporate purposes. MK announced in February that MK
Rail had filed a registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for the initial public offering.
MK Rail remanufactures locomotives, manufactures new high
technology locomotives, designs, manufactures and distributes
locomotive component parts, and provides locomotive fleet
maintenance services to the railroad industry. The company
provides its products and services to freight and passenger
railroads, including every Class I railroad in North America,
many metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and
Amtrak. The company offers a full range of locomotive services
and currently serves customers in 37 countries around the world.
MK Rail operates 12 manufacturing and distribution
facilities in the United States, as well as facilities in
Argentina and Australia and employs 2,357 people.
Morrison Knudsen chairman, president and chief executive
officer, William J. Agee, will also serve as chairman of the
board and chief executive officer of MK Rail. Michael J. Farrell,
president and chief executive officer of MK's Pittsburgh-based
Motor Coils Manufacturing Company, has been named president and
chief operating officer of MK Rail and Thomas J. Smith, former
president of MK's Rail Systems Group, has been named chairman and
CEO of MK Rail's Latin American operations.
A copy of the prospectus relating to the common stock
offering may be obtained from Morgan Stanley & Company, Inc.,
1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10020.
Morrison Knudsen Corporation (MRN-NYSE) serves the
international transportation, construction, mining,
