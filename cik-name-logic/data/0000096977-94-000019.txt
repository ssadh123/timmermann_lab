FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - NOVEMBER 2, 1994

Pacific Telecom, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTCM) announced that it has received a
proposal from its parent company, PacifiCorp Holdings, Inc., under which
PacifiCorp Holdings would acquire the 13 percent minority interest of
Pacific Telecom for $28 per share in cash. PacifiCorp Holdings, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of PacifiCorp (NYSE:PPW), currently owns the
remaining 87 percent of the outstanding common stock of Pacific Telecom.

Under the terms of the proposal, a newly formed, wholly-owned
subsidiary of PacifiCorp Holdings would merge into Pacific Telecom and the
holders of the approximately 5.3 million shares of common stock of Pacific
Telecom not held by PacifiCorp Holdings would receive cash in the amount of
$28.00 in exchange for each share of Pacific Telecom common stock. As a
result of the merger, Pacific Telecom would become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of PacifiCorp Holdings.

C.E. Robinson, Pacific Telecom's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and
President said, "I will recommend that the Pacific Telecom Board of
Directors form a special committee to review the proposed merger and to
respond to the offer. The special committee, once formed, will consider
retaining independent counsel, and engaging an investment banking firm to
assist in its analysis and to act as its financial advisor in determining
the fairness of the offer price."
