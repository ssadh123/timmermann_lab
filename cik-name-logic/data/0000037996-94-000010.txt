3. Sale of First Nationwide Bank
-----------------------------
On April 14, 1994, an agreement was entered into between First Nationwide
Bank, a Federal Savings Bank (the "Bank") and First Madison Bank, FSB
("First Madison") for the sale of substantially all of the Bank's assets
to, and the assumption of substantially all of the Bank's liabilities
by, First Madison. The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of First 
Nationwide Financial Corporation ("FNFC"), which in turn is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Ford. The transaction, which is subject to federal
regulatory approvals, is expected to be completed in about six months.

The company recognized in First Quarter 1994 earnings a pre-tax loss of $475
million and an after-tax loss of $440 million related to the disposition
of FNFC, reflecting the non-recovery of goodwill and reserves for
estimated losses on assets to be retained or repurchased by FNFC.
These assets will be liquidated over time as market conditions permit. 
The tax effect of this transaction takes into account differences between
the book and tax basis of certain assets for which deferred taxes were
not required to be provided under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The Company's
income statement includes the results of operations of FNFC through 
March 31, 1994. The net assets of FNFC at March 31, 1994, are included
in the balance sheet under Financial Services - Other Assets. Historically,
FNFC (including the Bank) has not had a significant effect
on Ford's operating results.

4. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
------------------------------------
Effective January 1, 1994, the company adopted SFAS No. 115, "Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". Accordingly, the
purchases and sales of trading securities are included in cash flows
from operating activities. Financial statements for the prior period were 
not restated.
