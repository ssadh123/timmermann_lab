purposes of the foregoing proviso, the consolidated operating cash flow and
consolidated fixed charges of any such Person shall be determined on the same
basis as such items are determined for the Company. For purposes of each pro
---
forma determination of the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio in

to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive
Notes, the temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for definitive Notes upon
surrender of the temporary Notes at the office or agency of the Company to be
maintained as provided in Section 702, without charge to the Holder. Upon
surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Company shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one

appointment of a Registrar and of the location, and any change in the location,
of the Register, and the Trustee shall have the right to inspect the Register at
all reasonable times, to obtain copies of the Register and to rely upon a
certificate executed on behalf of the Registrar by an officer thereof as to the
names and addresses of the Holders of the Notes and the initial principal
amounts and numbers of such Notes.

30
<PAGE>

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note at the office
or agency of the Company to be maintained as provided in Section 702, the
Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the
name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes of any
authorized denominations of a like initial aggregate principal amount and Stated
Maturity.

At the option of the Holder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of
any authorized denominations of a like initial aggregate principal amount and
Stated Maturity upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at such office or
agency. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Notes which the
Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of
Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Company evidencing the same debt and
entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Notes surrendered upon
such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed,
or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Trustee duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized
in writing.

No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of
transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Company may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, other than
exchanges pursuant to Section 205, 605, 711 or 906 not involving any transfer.

The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer
of or exchange any Note during a period beginning at the opening of business 15
days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Notes selected
for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing or
(ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Note so selected for redemption
except, in the case of any Note to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not
to be redeemed.

SECTION 207. Holder Lists. The Trustee shall preserve in as current
------------ 
a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the
names and addresses of Holders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the
Company shall furnish to the Trustee at least five Business Days prior to each
semi-annual Interest Payment Date and at such other times as the Trustee may

31
<PAGE>

request in writing a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may
require of the names and addresses of Holders. The Trustee and the Registrar
may rely on the accuracy of such list as the same may be amended from time to
time.

SECTION 208. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes. If (i) any
------------------------------------------ 
mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee or (ii) the Trustee receives
evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note and
there is delivered to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required
by the Trustee to hold the Company and the Trustee harmless, then the Company
shall execute and upon a Company Request the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Note, a new Note of the same tenor, initial principal amount and Stated
Maturity, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding; provided, however,
-------- ------- 
that if any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall have become or
shall be about to become due and payable, instead of issuing a new Note, the
Company may pay such Note without surrender thereof, except that any mutilated
Note shall be surrendered.

Upon the issuance of any new Note under this Section 208, the Company
may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected
therewith.

Every new Note issued pursuant to this Section 208 in lieu of any
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original,
additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and
shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section 208 are exclusive and shall preclude
(to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

SECTION 209. Payment of Principal and Interest; Principal and
------------------------------------------------
Interest Rights Preserved. Interest on any Note which is payable, and is paid
- - ------------------------- 
or for which payment is duly provided for pursuant to Paragraph 2 of the Notes,
on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Note
(or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the
Regular Record Date for such interest.

Any interest on any Note which is payable, but is not paid or for
which payment is not duly provided for on any

32
<PAGE>

Interest Payment Date, is herein called "Defaulted Interest." Defaulted
Interest on any Note shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the
relevant Regular Record Date by virtue then of having been such Holder, and such
Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, as follows:

The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the
Persons in whose names the Notes (or their respective Predecessor Notes)
are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the
payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following
manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the amount of Defaulted
Interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date of the proposed
payment (which payment date shall not be less than 25 or more than 30 days
following the date of delivery of such notice to the Trustee), and at the
same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money
equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such
Defaulted Interest, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as provided in
this clause. Thereupon, the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for
the payment of such Defaulted Interest in respect of Notes which shall be
not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the
proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee
of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify
the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense
of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such
Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to all
Holders in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 107. Notice of
the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest on the Notes and the
Special Record Date therefor having been so given, such Defaulted Interest
on the Notes shall be paid by the Trustee from the funds deposited therefor
to the Persons in whose names such Notes (or their respective Predecessor
Notes) are registered in the Register at the close of business on such
Special Record Date, on the date for payment of such Defaulted Interest
specified in the Notice.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Note
delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange
for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and
unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Note.

SECTION 210. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment for
--------------------- 
registration of transfer of any Note, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of
the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Note is
registered as the

33
<PAGE>

owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of and
interest on such Note (subject to Section 209) and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Note be overdue, and none of the Company, the
Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice
to the contrary.

SECTION 211. Cancellation. All Notes surrendered to the Trustee for
------------ 
payment, registration of transfer or exchange (including Notes surrendered to
any Person other than the Trustee which shall be delivered to the Trustee) shall
be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to
the Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously authenticated and delivered
hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all
Notes so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Notes shall
be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes cancelled as provided
in this Section 211, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. Subject
to the record retention requirements under the Exchange Act, the Trustee may
destroy cancelled Notes pursuant to a Company Request and furnish a certificate
of such destruction to the Company, unless the Company shall direct by a Company
Order that cancelled Notes be returned to the Company.

SECTION 212. Computation of Interest. Interest on the Notes shall be
----------------------- 
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

SECTION 213. CUSIP Number. The Company in issuing the Notes may use
------------ 
a "CUSIP" number and if so the Trustee shall use the CUSIP number in notices of
redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders, provided that any such
-------- 
notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness or
accuracy of the CUSIP number printed in the notice or on the Notes and that
reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the
Notes. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP
number.

ARTICLE THREE

SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE; DEFEASANCE

SECTION 301. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture; Defeasance.
--------------------------------------------------- 
(a) The Company, at any time, may terminate its obligations under this
Indenture by delivering all Outstanding Notes to the Trustee for cancellation
and paying all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; provided, however,
-------- ------- 
that the obligations of the Company under Sections 303, 304, 305 and 507,
together with the definitions in Article One necessary for the interpretation of
such Sections, shall survive.

34
<PAGE>

(b) At the Company's option, (i) the Company will be Discharged on
the 123rd day after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in paragraphs
(c) and (d) below or (ii) the Company need not comply with those covenants set
forth in Sections 704, 705, 706, 707, 708, 709, 710, 711 and 716 and the
provisions of Sections 401(3) (but only to the extent that Section 401(3)
relates to such enumerated provisions), 801(a)(4) and 801(a)(5) at any time
after the applicable conditions set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) below have
been satisfied.

(c) In order to exercise either option in paragraph (b) above,

(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or a
trustee satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee, in trust, specifically
pledged as security for and dedicated solely to the benefit of the Holders
(A) money, (B) U.S. Government Obligations which, through the payment of
interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms, will
provide money or (C) a combination of money and U.S. Government
Obligations, in an amount sufficient (without consideration of any
reinvestment of interest on such funds) in the opinion (with respect to (B)
and (C)) of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
expressed in an Accountants' Certificate delivered to the Trustee to pay
and discharge all the principal of and interest on the Notes not later than
one day before the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms
of the Notes;

(2) the Company must deliver to the Trustee:

(i) irrevocable instructions to apply such money or the proceeds
of such U.S. Government Obligations to the payment of principal of and
interest on the Notes at maturity or redemption, as the case may be;

(ii) an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent provided in Sections 301(c) and
301(d) have been complied with;

(iii) an Officers' Certificate certifying as to whether the
Notes are then listed on the New York Stock Exchange;

(iv) if the Notes are then listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion
of Counsel to the effect that the Company's exercise of its option
under this Section would not cause the Notes to be delisted;

35
<PAGE>

(v) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the deposit and
related defeasance would not cause the Holders of the Notes to
recognize income, gain, or loss for federal income tax purposes and
that the Holders will be subject to federal income tax on the same
amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if the deposit and related defeasance had not occurred and,
in the case of a Discharge pursuant to paragraph (b)(i) above,
accompanied by a revenue or private letter ruling to such effect
received from or published by the Internal Revenue Service; and

(vi) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (A) the trust
funds will not be subject to any rights of holders of Senior
Indebtedness, including, without limitation, those rights arising
under Article Ten of this Indenture; (B) in the case of a Discharge
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) above and subject to customary exclusions
and exceptions reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, (1) the Company
has authorization to establish an irrevocable trust in favor of the
Trustee for the benefit of the Holders under applicable law and the
action in establishing the irrevocable trust has been duly and
properly authorized by the Company and such authorization has not been
revoked, (2) the Trustee is an Independent trustee with respect to the
irrevocable trust, (3) a valid trust is created at the time of such
irrevocable deposit and (4) the Holders will have the sole beneficial
ownership interest under applicable law in the money so deposited in
such trust; and (C) if a court of competent jurisdiction were to rule
under any Bankruptcy Laws that the trust funds remained property of
the Company, (1) the Trustee will hold, for the benefit of the
Holders, a valid and first priority perfected security interest in
such trust funds that, after the expiration of any applicable
preference period (as specified in such opinion), is not avoidable
under the Bankruptcy Laws of any jurisdiction, (2) the Holders will be
entitled to receive adequate protection of their interests in such
trust funds under 11 U.S.C. (S)(S) 361, 362, 363 and 364 and (3) no
property, rights in property or other interests granted to the Trustee
for the benefit of the Holders or to the Holders in exchange for or
with respect to any of such trust funds will be subject to any prior
rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness, including, without
limitation, those rights arising under Article Ten of this Indenture;

For the limited purpose of the Opinion of Counsel referred to in this
paragraph (c)(2)(vi), such opinion

36
<PAGE>

may contain (1) either (A) an assumption that the conclusions
contained in a letter by a nationally recognized appraisal firm that
(i) the value of the trust assets is reasonably equivalent to the
amount of Notes then Outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, as of the date of the deposit and (ii) the Discharge or
defeasance pursuant to paragraph (b) above of the principal amount of
the Notes then Outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
as of the date of the transfer, is fair consideration for the transfer
of the trust assets to the trust, are accurate, provided that such
-------- 
letter is also addressed and delivered to the Trustee, or (B) an
assumption that the conclusions contained in a customary valuation
letter by a nationally recognized appraisal firm, dated as of the date
of the deposit and taking into account such deposit, or, at counsel's
option, a customary alternative certificate reasonably acceptable to
the Trustee, to the effect that the Company, as a result of the
transfer, will not (i) be insolvent (either because its financial
condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than all of its
assets, at a fair valuation, or because the present fair saleable
value of its assets will be less than the amount required to pay its
probable liability on its debts as they become absolute and matured),
(ii) have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is
or will be engaged or (iii) have incurred or planned to incur debts
beyond its ability to pay as such debts mature, are accurate, provided
--------
that (x) such valuation letter is also addressed and delivered to the
Trustee and (y) the Company delivers to the Trustee a letter by a
nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that the value of
the trust assets is reasonably equivalent to the amount of the Notes
then Outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as of the
date of the deposit; or (2) a representation that (A) the Notes are
the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company,
and the Company's payment obligations are not avoidable under any
Bankruptcy Laws, and (B) the trust funds are not subject to recapture
by or on behalf of the Company under any Bankruptcy Laws;

(3) no Default or Event of Default (including as a result of such
deposit) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit
and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute
a default under, any other instrument to which the Company is a party or by
which it is bound, as evidenced to the Trustee in an Officers' Certificate
delivered to the Trustee concurrently with such deposit;

37
<PAGE>

(4) the Company shall have paid or duly provided for payment of all
sums payable by the Company under this Indenture and the Notes; and

(5) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that the Company's exercise of its option under this
provision will not result in the Company, the Trustee or the trust to be
required to register as an "investment company" under the Investment
Company Act.

(d) It is the intention of the parties hereto that a valid trust for
the benefit of the Holders be created at the time that the Company makes the
deposit pursuant to this Section 301. Solely as protection for the Holders in
the event that a court of competent jurisdiction were to determine in the future
either that (i) such trust had not been validly created or (ii) such trust is
not enforceable, the Company, at the time the Company makes such deposit, will
take any and all acts necessary to create and perfect, in favor of the Holders,
a first-priority security interest in the money so deposited and shall take any
other action and execute and deliver any other documents that may reasonably be
requested by the Trustee to effectuate such security interest, and shall do all
of the above at such appropriate time so that such security interest shall
attach to the deposit at the time such deposit is made.

SECTION 302. Application of Trust Money. All money and U.S.
-------------------------- 
Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee or such other trustee pursuant
to Section 301 shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee or such other
trustee, in accordance with the provisions of the Notes and this Indenture, to
the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company
acting as its own Paying Agent),as the Trustee or such other trustee may
determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and interest for
whose payments such money and U.S. Government Obligations have been deposited
with the Trustee or such other trustee. All such money and U.S. Government
Obligations shall be segregated and held in a separate trust. Money, U.S.
Government Obligations and proceeds thereof so held in trust, to the extent
allocated for the payment of the Notes, shall not be subject to the provisions
of Article Ten (other than, in the case of a defeasance pursuant to Section
301(b)(ii), Section 1001).

SECTION 303. Repayment to the Company. Subject to Section 302, the
------------------------ 
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Company upon request any
excess money or U.S. Government Obligations held by them at any time and
thereupon shall be relieved from all liability with respect to such money. The
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money
held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for
two years; provided, however,
-------- ------- 

38
<PAGE>

that the Company shall, if requested by the Trustee or such Paying Agent, give
the Trustee or such Paying Agent satisfactory indemnification against any and
all liability which may be incurred by it by reason of such payment; and
provided, further, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent before being required
- - -------- ------- 
to make any payment shall at the expense of the Company cause to be published
once in a newspaper of general circulation in The City of New York and mail to
each Holder entitled to such money notice that such money remains unclaimed and
that, after a date specified therein, which shall be at least 30 days from the
date of such publication or mailing, any unclaimed balance of such money then
remaining will be repaid to the Company. After payment to the Company, Holders
entitled to such money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors
unless an applicable law designates another Person.

SECTION 304. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable
------------- 
to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 302
by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any
court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting
such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes
shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to
Section 301 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply
all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 302;
provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment of interest on or
- - -------- ------- 
principal of any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the
Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to
receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the
Trustee or Paying Agent.

SECTION 305. Indemnity. The Company shall indemnify the Trustee and
--------- 
hold it harmless against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed
against the money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee
under this Article Three or any interest or other income derived therefrom.

note, debenture or other instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness of the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, whether such Indebtedness now exists or
shall be created hereafter, and such Indebtedness shall have been
accelerated (or shall have matured); provided that the principal amount of
-------- 
Indebtedness with respect to which any such default or defaults and
acceleration (or maturity) has occurred and is continuing, together with
the principal amount of all other Indebtedness with respect to which such a
default or defaults and acceleration (or maturity) has occurred and is
continuing, aggregates $5,000,000 or more;

(5) The Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to or
within the meaning of Title 11 of the United States Code or any similar
federal or state law for the relief of debtors or affecting creditors'
rights (collectively, "Bankruptcy Law"):

(i) commences a voluntary case or any other action or
proceeding,

(ii) consents by answer or otherwise to the commencement against
it of an involuntary case or any other action or proceeding,

(v) generally is unable to pay its debts as the same become due;

40
<PAGE>

(6) A court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under
any Bankruptcy Law or under any law affecting creditors' rights that is
similar to a Bankruptcy Law that:

(i) is for relief against the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries in an involuntary case in bankruptcy or any other action
or proceeding for any other relief,

(ii) appoints a Custodian of the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries or for all or substantially all of the

or termination ceases to remain in effect;

(7) one or more judgments or orders shall have been rendered against
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in an aggregate amount in
excess of $5,000,000 and shall not have been discharged and either (x) an

than 90 days of the casino business of any casino hotel owned, leased, or
operated directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than any voluntary relinquishment of a Gaming License if such
relinquishment is, in the judgment of the Company, both desirable in the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the holders).

A Default under clause (3) is not an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding
Notes provide written notification to the Company (and the Trustee, in the case
of Holders giving notice) of the Default and the Company does not cure the
Default within 60 days after receipt of the notice. Any notice of Default must
specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a
"Notice of Default." Such notice

41
<PAGE>

shall be given by the Trustee if so requested by Holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes.

SECTION 402. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If
-------------------------------------------------- 
an Event of Default occurs and is continuing (other than an Event of Default as
defined in clauses (5) and (6) of Section 401), then and in every such case the
Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Notes may declare the principal of, and all accrued but unpaid
interest on, all the Notes to be due and payable by a notice, in writing, to the
Company (and the Trustee in the case of a notice given by Holders) and upon any
such declaration such principal and accrued interest shall become due and
payable immediately. In case an Event of Default as defined in clauses (5) and
(6) of Section 401 occurs, the principal of and interest on the Notes shall
become immediately due and payable without any declaration or act on the part of
the Holders or the Trustee.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration because an Event of
Default as defined in clause (4) of Section 401 has occurred, and is continuing,
such declaration and its consequences shall be automatically rescinded and
annulled if (x) in the case of Indebtedness that has been accelerated, the
holders of such Indebtedness shall have rescinded the declaration of
acceleration and the consequences thereof within 10 days of such declaration or,
in the case of Indebtedness that has matured, such Indebtedness has been
discharged in full within 10 days following maturity, (y) the Company shall have
delivered an Officers' Certificate certifying such rescission or discharge to
the Trustee and (z) no other Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing.

At any time after the Notes have been accelerated and before a
judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee
as hereinafter in this Article Four provided, the Holders of not less than a
majority in principal amount of the Notes Outstanding, by notice to the Company
and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such acceleration and its consequences
if:

(1) there has been paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue installments of interest on all Notes,

(B) the principal of any Notes which have become due otherwise
than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the
rate borne by the Notes,

42
<PAGE>

(C) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful,
interest upon overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by
the Notes, and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee and its agents and counsel;

(2) all Defaults and Events of Default, other than the non-payment of
the principal of and interest on the Notes that have become due solely by
such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 413;

(3) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or order of a
court of competent jurisdiction; and

(4) in the event of a cure or waiver of a Default or Event of Default
under clause (4) of Section 401, the Trustee shall have received an
Officers' Certificate of the Company and an Opinion of Counsel that the
default giving rise to such Default or Event of Default has been cured or
waived.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

SECTION 403. Collection Suits by Trustee. If an Event of Default
--------------------------- 
specified in clause (1) or (2) of Section 401 occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust
against the Company or any other obligor on the Notes for the whole amount of
principal and accrued interest remaining unpaid, together with, to the extent
that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue principal and
interest on overdue installments of interest, in each case at the rate per annum
--- -----
borne by the Notes and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the
costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in
its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Holders by such appropriate judicial and non-judicial proceedings as the Trustee
shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for
the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture, the
Notes or in any other agreement or instrument or in aid of the exercise of any
power granted herein or therein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

43
<PAGE>

SECTION 404. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. (a) In the case of
-------------------------------- 
the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes or to the
Property of the Company or of such other obligor, the Trustee (irrespective of
whether the principal of the Notes shall then be due and payable as therein
expressed or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company or such other
obligor for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and
empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,

(1) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal and
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Notes (including post-petition
interest) and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or
advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim
for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such
judicial proceeding, and

(2) to collect and receive any monies or other Property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar
official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to
make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall
consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the
Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other
amounts due the Trustee under Section 507.

(b) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee
to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan
of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or
the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect
of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding, except that the Trustee may
vote on behalf of the Holders for the appointment of a trustee in bankruptcy
without soliciting or canvassing any Holder for consent or approval.

SECTION 405. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Notes.
------------------------------------------------------ 
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Notes may be
prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the
Notes or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such
proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its

44
<PAGE>

own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall,
after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the
ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes in respect of which such judgment
has been recovered.

SECTION 406. Application of Money Collected. Any money collected by
------------------------------ 
the Trustee pursuant to this Article Four shall be applied in the following
order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the
distribution of such money on account of principal or interest, upon
presentation of the Notes and the notation thereon of the payment if only
partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

First: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section
507;

Second: To holders of Senior Indebtedness to the extent required by
Article Ten;

Third: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon the
Notes for principal and interest, in respect of which or for the benefit of
which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or
priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such
Notes for principal and interest, respectively; and

Fourth: To the Company or any other obligor on the Notes, as their
interests may appear or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

The Trustee may set a record date and payment date for any payment to
Holders pursuant to this Section.

SECTION 407. Limitation on Suits. No Holder shall have any right to
------------------- 
institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture,
or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy
hereunder, unless

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of
a continuing Event of Default,

(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Notes have made written request to the Trustee to institute
proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee
hereunder,

(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable
indemnity against the losses, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in
compliance with such request,

45
<PAGE>

(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request
and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding, and

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been
given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of not less
than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes,

it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders shall have any
right in any manner by virtue of, or by availing itself of, any provision of
this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders,
or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders
or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein
provided and for the ratable benefit of all the Holders.

SECTION 408. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal and

expressed in such Note and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such
payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such
Holder.

SECTION 409. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or
---------------------------------- 
any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under
this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any
reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or the Holder after
exhaustion of all rights to appeal, then and in every such case the Company, the
Trustee and the Holders shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding,
be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and
thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue
as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

SECTION 410. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. No right or remedy
------------------------------ 
herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended
to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall,
to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other
right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or
employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

SECTION 411. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of
---------------------------- 
the Trustee or of any Holder of any Note to exercise any right or remedy
accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or

<PAGE>

any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy
given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be
exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the
Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.

SECTION 412. Control by Holders. The Holders of not less than a
------------------ 
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes shall have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Trustee, provided that
-------- 

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or
with this Indenture;

(2) the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such
direction if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that the
action so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good
faith shall, by a Trust Officer or Trust Officers, determine that the
proceedings so directed would involve it in personal liability or be unduly
prejudicial to the Holders not taking part in such direction; and

(3) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

SECTION 413. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of not less than a
----------------------- 
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may on behalf of the
Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default hereunder and its consequences,
except a Default

(1) in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Note; or

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article
Six cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each
Outstanding Note affected;

provided, however, that no default in the payment of any amount due to the
- - -------- ------- 
Trustee under Section 507 or any other provision hereof may be waived by the
Holders without the Trustee's written consent.

Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event
of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every
purpose of this Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

47
<PAGE>

SECTION 414. Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Indenture
--------------------- 
agree, and each Holder of any Note by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to
have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the
enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against
the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the
filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of
such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit,
having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by
such party litigant, but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any
suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by one or more Holders
holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding
Notes, or to any suit instituted by any Holder pursuant to Section 408.

of the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes.

SECTION 505. May Hold Notes. The Trustee, any Paying Agent, any
-------------- 
Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other

SECTION 509. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. (a)

(e) If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 508, any Holder may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and
the appointment of a successor Trustee.

(f) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of
acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, the

the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee to replace the successor
Trustee appointed by the Company may be appointed by an Act of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes delivered to the Company
and the retiring Trustee. If, within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns
or is removed, no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Company
or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner provided in Section 510,
the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of at least 10% in aggregate
principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes may petition any court of

successor Trustee. Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring
Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further
act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts
and duties of the retiring Trustee. On request of the Company or the successor
Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and
deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights,
powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee. The retiring Trustee shall promptly
assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money
held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject to the Lien, if any, provided
for in Section 507. Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company
shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in
and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts.

No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time
of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under
this Article Five and under the TIA.

Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this
Section 510, the Company's obligations under Section 507 hereof shall continue
for the benefit of the retiring Trustee in connection with its rights and duties
hereunder prior to such replacement.

- - -------- 
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,

corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust
business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder,
provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this
Article Five, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Notes shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor
Trustee by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee
may adopt such authentication and deliver the Notes so authenticated with the
same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Notes.

(a) The Trustee is subject to TIA (S) 311(a), excluding any creditor
relationship listed in TIA (S) 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been

herein or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions
arising under this Indenture or the Notes which shall not be inconsistent
with the provisions of this Indenture or the Notes;

(5) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of
certificated Notes; or

<PAGE>

not make any change that adversely affects the legal rights of any Holder
hereunder or under the Notes.

SECTION 602. With Consent. Subject to Section 408, the Company, when
------------ 
duly authorized by resolution of its Board of Directors, and the Trustee may
amend this Indenture or the Notes with the written consent of the Holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 602, without the
consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver, including a waiver
pursuant to Section 413, may not:

(1) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment;

(2) reduce the rate of or change the time for or the manner of,
payment of interest, including Defaulted Interest, on any Note;

or redemption of any Note;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the

(6) make any change in Section 408, 413 or this Section 602.

It shall not be necessary under this Section 602 for the consent of
the Holders to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement
or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance
thereof.

An amendment under Section 601 or 602 may not make any change that
adversely affects the rights under Article Ten of any holder of an issue of
Senior Indebtedness unless the holders of such issue pursuant to its terms
consent to the change or the change is otherwise permissible.

After an amendment under this Section 602 becomes effective, the
Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing the amendment.

<PAGE>

SECTION 603. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. Every amendment to

a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Note or
portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note,
even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such
Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his Note or portion of
a Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date on
which the Trustee receives an Officers' Certificate from the Company certifying
that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have consented to
such amendment or waiver. An amendment or waiver becomes effective upon receipt
by the Trustee of such Officers' Certificate and the written consents from the
Holders of the requisite percentage in principal amount of Notes.

(b) The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date
for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment
or waiver. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the second and third
sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 604, those Persons who were Holders at
such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons,
shall be entitled to consent to such amendment or waiver or to revoke any
consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders
after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more
than 120 days after such record date.

(c) After an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind
every Holder.

SECTION 605. Notation on or Exchange of Notes; Effect of Supplemental
--------------------------------------------------------
Indenture. If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of the
- - --------- 
Notes, the Trustee may require the Holders to deliver the Notes to the Trustee.
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Notes concerning such
changed terms and return them to the Holders and the Trustee may place an
appropriate notation on any Note thereafter authenticated. Alternatively, if
the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Notes
shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate new Notes that reflect such
changed terms.

Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article
Six, this Indenture and, to the extent applicable, the Notes, shall be modified
thereby, and every Holder of any Note authenticated and delivered hereunder,
whether before or

58

after the execution of such supplemental indenture, shall be bound by this
Indenture, as so amended, modified or supplemented.

SECTION 606. Trustee Protected. The Trustee shall sign all
----------------- 
supplemental indentures, except that the Trustee need not sign any supplemental
indenture that adversely affects its rights. In signing or refusing to sign
such amendment or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to
receive and, subject to Section 501, shall be fully protected in relying upon,
an Officers' Certificate of the Company and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive
evidence that such amendment or supplemental indenture is authorized or
permitted by this Indenture, that it is not inconsistent herewith, that all
conditions precedent to the execution thereof have been met, that it will be
valid and binding upon the Company in accordance with its terms and that, after
the execution thereof, the Company will not be in Default and no Event of
Default will have occurred and be continuing.

maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency

designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in
-------- ------- 
any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency
in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York where Notes may be surrendered
for presentation for payment, for registration of transfer or exchange and where
notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Notes and this
Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the

of any such other office or agency.

SECTION 703. Money for Note Payments to be Held in Trust. If the
------------------------------------------- 
Company (or any other obligor on the Notes) or any Affiliate of the Company (or
any such other obligor) shall at any time act as the Company's Paying Agent, it
will, on or before each due date of the principal of or interest on any of the
Notes, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal or interest so becoming due until
such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein
provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to
act.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents, it will,
prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on any Notes, appoint a
lead Paying Agent and deposit with such lead Paying Agent a sum sufficient to
pay the principal or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for
the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal or interest, and (unless
such lead Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the
Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

The Company will cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to
execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent will
agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 703, that such
Paying Agent will:

(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of or
interest on the Notes in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed
of as herein provided;

(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any
other obligor upon the Notes including the Company) in the making of any
payment in respect of principal or interest; and

(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the
written request of the Trustee, forthwith

60
<PAGE>

pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.

For the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture pursuant to Article Three or for any other purpose, the Company may at
any time pay, or by a Company Request direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the
Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent,
respectively. Such sums are to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as
those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent. Upon
any such payment, the Company and any such Paying Agent shall be released from
all further liability with respect to such money.

SECTION 714. Continued Existence and Rights. Subject to Article
------------------------------ 
Eight, the Company will, and the Company will cause each of its Restricted
Subsidiaries and Significant Subsidiaries to, do or cause to be done all things
necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence as a
corporation and its rights and franchises; provided, however, that nothing in
-------- ------- 
this Section 714 shall prevent the loss of the corporate existence of any such
Subsidiary or any such right or franchise if such loss is, in the judgment of
the Company both desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and not disadvantageous in any material respect
to the Holders.

SECTION 715. Maintenance of Properties and Other Matters. The
------------------------------------------- 
Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain its
Properties in good working order and condition and make all necessary repairs,
renewals and replacements; provided, however, that, subject to Article Eight,
-------- ------- 
nothing in this Section 715 shall prevent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
from discontinuing the operation and maintenance of any of its Properties, if
such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Company or the Subsidiary, as the
case may be, both desirable in the conduct of its respective business and not
disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

The Company will insure and keep insured, and will cause each
Subsidiary to insure and keep insured, with financially sound and reputable
insurers, so much of their respective Properties and in such amounts as is
usually and customarily insured by companies engaged in a similar business with
respect to Properties of a similar character against loss by fire and the
extended coverage perils. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will
maintain a system of self insurance in lieu of or in combination with the
foregoing, provided that deductibles under the insurance policy or policies of
-------- 
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be considered to be self insurance as
long as such deductibles accord with financially sound and approved practices of
companies owning or operating Properties of a similar character and maintaining
similar insurance coverage. The Trustee shall not be required to see that such
insurance is effected or maintained.

The Company will keep, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to
keep, proper books and records of accounts in which full and correct entries
will be made of all its business transactions in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The Company shall cause the books and records
of accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be examined, either on a
consolidated or on an individual basis, by one or more firms of independent
public accountants not less frequently than annually. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its

71
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries to, prepare its financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

The Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply
with all Legal Requirements and to obtain any licenses, permits, franchises or
other governmental authorizations necessary to the ownership or operation of its
Properties or to the conduct of its business including, without limitation, all
Gaming Licenses.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions in this Section 715, failure
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with such provisions shall
not be deemed to be a breach of such provisions to the extent that such failure
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

SECTION 716. Taxes and Claims. The Company will, and will cause each
---------------- 
of its Subsidiaries to, pay (or, if appropriate, withhold and pay over) prior 
to delinquency:

(1) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed
upon it or its Property (or that it is required to withhold and pay over)
and

(2) all claims or demands of materialmen, mechanics, carriers,
warehousemen, landlords and other like Persons which if unpaid might result
in the creation of a Lien upon its Properties;

provided, however, that the foregoing need not be paid while being contested in
- - -------- ------- 
good faith (and by appropriate proceedings in the opinion of the Company's
independent counsel in any case involving more than $500,000) if (1) adequate
provision for the foregoing has been made and (2) the failure to make such
payments is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders.

SECTION 717. Waiver of Stay, Extension and Usury Laws. The Company
---------------------------------------- 
covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any
time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit
or advantage of, and will actively resist any attempts to claim the benefit of,
any stay or extension law or any usury or other law that would prohibit or
forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of or
interest on the Notes as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any
time hereafter in force, or that may affect the covenants or the performance of
this Indenture; and (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) the Company
hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants
that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein
granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and

72
<PAGE>

permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

SECTION 718. Investment Company Act. The Company shall not, and the
---------------------- 
Company shall not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, become an investment
company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act as such statute and the
regulations thereunder and any successor statute or regulations thereto may from
time to time be in effect, unless the Company or such Subsidiary is exempted

"investment company."

<PAGE>

Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, of additional Indebtedness (and
treating any Indebtedness not previously an obligation of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries incurred in connection with or as a result of such
transaction as having been incurred at the time of such transaction), the
Company (if it is the continuing corporation) or such other entity could
incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to Section 705(a).

(b) In connection with any consolidation, merger, transfer or lease
contemplated by this provision, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be

such transfer is made, shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may
exercise every right and power of the Company under this Indenture with the same
effect as if such successor corporation had been named as the Company herein.
When a successor corporation assumes all of the obligations of the Company under
the Notes and this Indenture pursuant to this Article Eight, the applicable
predecessor corporation shall be released from the obligations so assumed.

ARTICLE NINE

REDEMPTION

SECTION 901. Notices to Trustee. If the Company desires to redeem
------------------ 
Notes in whole or in part in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof, it
shall notify the Trustee in writing of the Redemption Date and the principal
amount of Notes to be so redeemed.

If the Company desires to credit Notes it has not previously delivered
to the Trustee for cancellation against the principal amount of Notes to be
redeemed, it shall so notify the Trustee and it shall deliver the Notes with the
notice.

Except as provided below, the Company shall give each notice provided
for in this Section 901 by a Company Order at

74
<PAGE>

least 45 days before the Redemption Date (except for the notice provided in the
event of a Change of Control pursuant to Section 711 or unless a shorter notice
period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee).

SECTION 902. Selection of Notes to Be Redeemed. If less than all of
--------------------------------- 
the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed
pro rata or by lot or by any other means that the Trustee determines to be fair
- - --- ---- 
and appropriate. The Trustee shall make the selection from the Notes
Outstanding and not previously called for redemption. Notes in denominations of
$1,000 may be redeemed only in whole. The Trustee may select for redemption
portions (equal to $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal
amount of Notes that have denominations larger than $1,000. Provisions of this
Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption in whole also apply to Notes
called for redemption in part.

SECTION 903. Notice of Redemption. At least 30 days but not more
-------------------- 
than 60 days before a Redemption Date, the Company shall give notice of
redemption, mailed by first-class mail, to each Holder whose Notes are to be
redeemed at such Holders' last address as it appears upon the Register.

The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date;

(2) the Redemption Price;

(3) the name and address of the Paying Agent;

(4) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the
Paying Agent to collect the Redemption Price;

(5) that, unless the Company defaults in making the redemption
payment, interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue on and
after the Redemption Date and the only remaining right of the Holders is to
receive payment of the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to
the Redemption Date, upon surrender to the Trustee of the Notes;

(6) if any Note is being redeemed in part, the portion of the
principal amount (in integral multiples of $1,000) of such Note to be
redeemed and that, on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such
Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount equal to the unredeemed
Portion thereof will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof;

75
<PAGE>

(7) the provision of the Notes or this Indenture pursuant to which
Notes are being redeemed; and

(8) the CUSIP number, if any, relating to the Notes to be redeemed.

Pursuant to a Company Request, the Trustee shall give the notice of
redemption in the Company's name and at the Company's expense.

SECTION 904. Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of
------------------------------ 
redemption is given, Notes called for redemption become due and payable on the
Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price. Upon surrender to the Paying
Agent, such Notes shall be paid at the Redemption Price plus accrued interest to
the Redemption Date.

SECTION 905. Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to the Redemption
--------------------------- 
Date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay
the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on all Notes to be redeemed on the
Redemption Date other than Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on
the Redemption Date that have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for
cancellation.

SECTION 906. Notes Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a Note that
---------------------- 
is redeemed in part, the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder a new Note
equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Note surrendered.

SECTION 907. Redemption Pursuant to Gaming Jurisdiction Law. (a)
---------------------------------------------- 
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article Nine, if the New Jersey
Commission does not waive the requirement that a Holder or beneficial owner of
Notes must be licensed or found qualified or suitable to hold or own the Notes
under the New Jersey Act, and if such Holder or such beneficial owner does not
become so licensed or is not found qualified or suitable within any time period
specified by the New Jersey Commission or the New Jersey Act, or if the Nevada
Commission finds a Holder or beneficial owner to be unsuitable under the Nevada
Act or regulations of the Nevada Commission, or if any other Gaming Authority
requires that Holders or beneficial owners of Notes be licensed or found
qualified or suitable and such Gaming Authority fails to waive such requirement
or any beneficial owner or Holder of Notes does not become so licensed or is not
found qualified or suitable within the applicable time period, the Company shall
have the right, at its option, (i) to require such Holder or beneficial owner to
dispose of all or a portion of such Holder's or beneficial owner's Notes within
120 days after receipt of notice by such Holder or beneficial owner of such
finding by the New Jersey Commission, the Nevada Commission or such other Gaming
Authority, as the case may be (or

76
<PAGE>

such different period as may be prescribed by the New Jersey Commission or the
Nevada Commission or such other Gaming Authority), or (ii) to call for
redemption the Notes of such Holder or beneficial owner, on not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days' notice (or such different period as may be prescribed by the
applicable Gaming Authority).

(b) If such Holder or beneficial owner, having been given the
opportunity by the Company to dispose of such Holder's or beneficial owner's
Notes, shall have failed to do so within the prescribed time period, the Company
shall have the right to redeem such Holder's or beneficial owner's Notes on five
days' notice.

(c) On any redemption of Notes pursuant to this Section 907, the
Redemption Price shall be without premium and the lower of (i) the price at
which such Holder or beneficial owner acquired the Notes, together with (if
permitted by the New Jersey Act or the Nevada Act or other applicable Gaming
Jurisdiction Law, or by the orders of the New Jersey Commission or the Nevada
Commission or other relevant Gaming Authority, as the case may be) accrued
interest to the Redemption Date, and (ii) the lowest closing sale price of the
Notes between the date of the notice given by the New Jersey Commission or the
Nevada Commission or such other Gaming Authority and the date 10 days after such
date, unless a Redemption Price or other payment, remuneration or related terms
or restrictions are required by the New Jersey Commission or the Nevada
Commission or such other Gaming Authority, as the case may be, in which event
such price, terms and restrictions shall be the Redemption Price and terms of
redemption. Each Holder and beneficial owner by accepting a Note agrees to the
provisions of this Section 907 and of Paragraph 7 of the Notes and agrees to
inform the Company upon request made pursuant to this Section 907 of the price
at which such Holder or beneficial owner acquired such Holder's or beneficial
owner's Notes.

(d) Any redemption notice given by the Company under this Section 907
shall also be provided to the Trustee at the same time and shall state (i) that
the Notes are being called for redemption as a result of the Holder's or
beneficial owner's status under the New Jersey Act or with the New Jersey
Commission, or under the Nevada Act or with the Nevada Commission, or under
another Gaming Jurisdiction Law or with the relevant Gaming Authority, as the
case may be, (ii) whether accrued interest is payable to the Holder under the
New Jersey Act or the Nevada Act or such other Gaming Jurisdiction Law and, if
so, the information required by paragraph (5) of Section 903 hereof and (iii)
the information required by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (7) and (8) of
Section 903.

77
<PAGE>

(e) The Trustee shall have no duty to verify a Holder's or beneficial
owner's status under the New Jersey Act or Nevada Act or any other applicable
Gaming Jurisdiction Law or to verify the price at which a Holder or beneficial
owner acquired Notes.

ARTICLE TEN

SUBORDINATION

SECTION 1001. Agreement to Subordinate. The Company agrees, and each
------------------------ 
Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes
is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in
this Article Ten, to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness and
that the subordination is for the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness,
and authorizes and directs the Trustee to take such action as may be necessary
or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination as provided in
this Article Ten and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all
such purposes.

This Article Ten shall remain in full force and effect as long as any
Senior Indebtedness is outstanding.

SECTION 1002. Liquidation; Dissolution; Bankruptcy. Upon any payment
------------------------------------ 
or distribution, whether of cash, securities or other Property, to creditors of
the Company in a liquidation (total or partial), reorganization or dissolution
of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or in a bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, receivership, assignment for the benefit of
creditors, marshalling of assets or similar proceeding relating to the Company
or its Property:

(1) holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive
payment in full, in cash or cash equivalents, of such Senior Indebtedness
before Holders shall be entitled to receive any payment of principal of, or
interest on, or any other distribution with respect to, the Notes; and

(2) until all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in cash or cash
equivalents as provided in Section 1002(1), any distribution to which
Holders would be entitled but for this Article Ten shall be made to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear;

in each case except that Holders may receive securities that are subordinated to
Senior Indebtedness to at least the same extent and pursuant to the same or more
stringent terms as are the Notes.

78
<PAGE>

Upon any distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this
Section 1002, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any
order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which such bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, receivership, assignment for the benefit of
creditors, marshalling of assets or similar proceeding is pending for the
purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such
distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the amount thereof or payable
thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts
pertinent thereto or to this Section 1002, and the Trustee and the Holders shall
be entitled to rely upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or
other such Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders for
the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such
distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the amount thereof or payable
thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts
pertinent thereto or to this Section 1002. The Trustee shall be entitled to
rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself
to be a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness, as the case may be,
to establish that such notice has been given by a Representative or a holder of
Senior Indebtedness, as the case may be. In the event that the Trustee
determines, in good faith, that further evidence is required with respect to the
right of any Person, as a holder of Senior Indebtedness, to participate in any
payment or distribution pursuant to this Section 1002, the Trustee may request
such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as
to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, as to the extent to
which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and
as to other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Section
1002, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment
to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to
receive such payment.

SECTION 1003. Default on Senior Indebtedness. No direct or indirect
------------------------------ 
payment by or on behalf of the Company of principal of or interest on the Notes,
whether pursuant to the terms of the Notes or upon acceleration or otherwise,
shall be made if at the time of such payment there exists a default in the
payment of all or any portion of principal of or interest on Designated Senior
Indebtedness pursuant to which the maturity of such Designated Senior
Indebtedness may be accelerated (and the Trustee has received written notice
thereof) and such default shall not have been cured or waived or the benefits of
this sentence waived by or on behalf of the holders of such Designated Senior
Indebtedness (and the Trustee has received written notice thereof). In
addition, during the continuance of any other event of default with respect to
Designated Senior Indebtedness pursuant to which the maturity of such Designated
Senior

79
<PAGE>

Indebtedness may be accelerated, upon the occurrence of (a) receipt by the
Trustee of written notice from the Representative with respect to, or from the
holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of, such Designated
Senior Indebtedness then outstanding or (b) if such event of default results
from the acceleration of the Notes, such acceleration, no such payment may be
made by the Company upon or in respect of the Notes for a period (a "Payment
Blockage Period") commencing on the earlier of the date of receipt of such
notice by the Trustee or the date of such acceleration and ending 179 days
thereafter (unless such Payment Blockage Period shall be terminated by written
notice to the Trustee from such Representative or such holders). Not more than
one Payment Blockage Period may be commenced with respect to the Notes during
any period of 360 consecutive days; in no event will a Payment Blockage Period
extend beyond 179 days from the date the payment on the Notes was due; and there
must be 180 days in any 360 day period in which no Payment Blockage Period is in
effect. For all purposes of this Section 1003, no default or event of default
which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Payment
Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Indebtedness initiating
such Payment Blockage Period shall be, or be made, the basis for the
commencement of a subsequent Payment Blockage Period by the Representative or
requisite holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness whether or not within a
period of 360 consecutive days unless such default or event of default shall
have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days.

SECTION 1004. When Distribution Must Be Paid Over. In the event that
----------------------------------- 
the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee on account of the principal of
or interest on the Notes at a time when such payment is prohibited by Section
1002 or 1003, such payment shall be held by the Trustee, in trust for the
benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and delivered to, the holders of
Senior Indebtedness (pro rata as to each of such holders on the basis of the
--- ---- 
respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by them) or their
Representatives, as their respective interests may appear, for application to
the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid to the extent necessary
to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full in accordance with its terms, after
giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of
Senior Indebtedness.

If a distribution is made to Holders that because of this Article Ten
should not have been made to them, the Holders who receive the distribution
shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness and pay it over to
them as their interests may appear.

SECTION 1005. Notice by the Company. The Company shall promptly
--------------------- 
notify the Trustee and any Paying Agent by an

80
<PAGE>

appropriate Officers' Certificate of the Company delivered to a Trust Officer
and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Company that would cause a
payment of principal of or interest on the Notes to violate this Article Ten,
but failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of the Notes
to the Senior Indebtedness provided in this Article Ten.

SECTION 1006. Subrogation. After all Senior Indebtedness is paid in
----------- 
cash or cash equivalents in full and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders
shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive
distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness to the extent that distributions
otherwise payable to Holders have been applied to payment of Senior
Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article Ten to holders of Senior
Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between
the Company and the Holders, a payment by the Company on Senior Indebtedness.

SECTION 1007. Relative Rights. This Article Ten defines the relative
--------------- 
rights of Holders and holders of Senior Indebtedness. Nothing in this Indenture
shall:

(1) impair, as between the Company and the Holders, the obligation of
the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and
interest on the Notes in accordance with their terms;

(2) affect the relative rights of Holders and creditors of the
Company other than such creditors as are holders of Senior Indebtedness;

(3) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available
remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of
holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions otherwise payable
to Holders; or

(4) create or imply the existence of any commitment on the part of
the holders of Senior Indebtedness to extend credit to the Company, other
than as set forth in the terms governing such Senior Indebtedness.

SECTION 1008. Subordination May Not Be Impaired by the Company. No
------------------------------------------------ 
right of any present or future holder of Senior Indebtedness to enforce the
subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes shall be impaired by
any act or failure to act by the Company or anyone in custody of its assets or
property or by its failure to comply with this Indenture.

SECTION 1009. Distribution or Notice to Representatives. Whenever a
----------------------------------------- 
distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Indebtedness,
the distribution

81
<PAGE>

may be made and the notice given to their Representatives, if any.

SECTION 1010. Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent. The Trustee or any
---------------------------------- 
Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Notes unless, in the case of
the Trustee, a Trust Officer or, in the case of a Paying Agent other than the
Trustee, an officer of such Paying Agent, shall have received, at least three
Business Days prior to the date such payments are due and payable, written
notice of facts that would cause a payment of principal of or interest on the
Notes to violate this Article Ten. Only the Company or a Representative with
respect to or holders of at least a majority in principal amount of an issue of
Designated Senior Indebtedness may give such notice. Nothing contained in this
Section 1010 shall limit the right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness to
recover payments as contemplated by Section 1004.

The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior
Indebtedness with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any
Agent may do the same with like rights.

SECTION 1011. Trustee Entitled to Assume Payments Not Prohibited in
-----------------------------------------------------
Absence of Notice. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Article Ten or
- - ----------------- 
any other provision of this Indenture, unless a Trust Officer has received a
written notice pursuant to Section 1010, the Trustee shall not at any time be
charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the
making of any payment to or by the Trustee.

SECTION 1012. Application by Trustee of Monies Deposited With It.
-------------------------------------------------- 
Nothing contained in this Article Ten or elsewhere in this Indenture, or in the
Notes, shall (i) affect the obligation of the Company to make, or prevent the
Company from making, at any time except as specified in Section 1002 or 1003 to
the extent provided therein, payments at any time with respect to the Notes,
(ii) prevent the application by the Trustee or any Paying Agent of any monies
held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of the Holders
of Notes as to which notice of redemption shall have been mailed or published,
to the payment of or on account of the principal of or interest on the Notes if,
at the time of such mailing or publishing, such payment would not have been
prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Article Ten or (iii) prevent the
application by the Trustee or any Paying Agent of any monies deposited with it
hereunder to the payment of or on account of the Notes if, at the time of such
deposit, such payment would not have been prohibited by the foregoing provisions
of this Article Ten and, if such monies have been deposited by the Company, the
Trustee shall not have received with respect to such monies the written notice
provided for in Section 1010.

SECTION 1013. Trustee's Compensation Not Prejudiced.
------------------------------------- 

82
<PAGE>

Nothing in this Article Ten shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the
Trustee pursuant to Section 507.

SECTION 1014. Officers' Certificate. If there occurs an event
--------------------- 
referred to in Section 1002, the Company shall promptly give to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate (on which the Trustee may conclusively rely) identifying
all holders of Senior Indebtedness and the principal amount of Senior
Indebtedness then outstanding held by each such holder and stating the reasons
why such Officers' Certificate is being delivered to the Trustee.

SECTION 1015. Certain Payments. Nothing in this Article Ten shall
---------------- 
prevent or delay (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from or in
purchasing or redeeming any of the Notes pursuant to any Legal Requirement
relating to the Company's gaming business or (ii) the receipt by the Holders of
payments of principal of and interest on the Notes as provided in Section 302.

SECTION 1016. Names of Representatives. The Company shall, upon
------------------------ 
request of the Trustee, provide to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting
forth the name and address of each Representative of all outstanding Senior
Indebtedness.

SECTION 1017. No Fiduciary Duty Created to Holders of Senior
----------------------------------------------
Indebtedness. With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the Trustee
- - ------------ 
undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations
as are specifically set forth in this Article Ten, and no implied covenants or
obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be read
into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe
any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and, subject to the
provisions of Article Five, the Trustee shall not be liable to any holder of
Senior Indebtedness if it shall mistakenly pay over or deliver to Holders, the
Company or any other Person, monies or assets to which any holder of Senior
Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Ten or otherwise.

name this Note is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date
for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of
which shall be given to Holders not less than 15 days prior to such Special
Record Date. The Holder must surrender this Note to a Paying Agent to collect
principal payments. The Company will pay principal, premium, if any, and
interest in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal
tender for payment of public and private debts. However, the Company may pay
principal, premium, if any, and interest by check payable in such money. The
Company may mail an interest check to a Holder's registered address. If a
payment date is a Legal Holiday at a place of payment, payment may be made at
that place on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday, and no
interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

3. Paying Agent and Registrar. American Bank National Association
-------------------------- 
(the "Trustee") will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change
any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. The Company may act
in any such capacity.

4. Indenture. The Company has issued the Notes under an indenture
--------- 
dated as of October 1, 1994 (the "Indenture") among the Company and the Trustee.
The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part
of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C.
(S)(S) 77aaa-bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture. The Notes are
subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and such
Act for a statement of such terms. The Notes are unsecured senior subordinated
obligations of the Company limited to $180,000,000 in aggregate principal
amount. Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

5. Denominations, Transfer, Exchange. The Notes are in registered
--------------------------------- 
form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof.
The transfer of Notes may be registered and Notes may be exchanged as provided
in the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and
fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not
exchange or register the transfer of any Note or portion of a Note selected for
redemption. Also, it need not exchange or register the transfer of any Notes
for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.

6. Optional Redemption. The Notes may not be redeemed prior to
------------------- 
October 1, 1999. On or after such date, the Notes may be redeemed at the
election of the Company in whole at any time or in part from time to time at the
Redemption Prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount) set forth below
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, if redeemed
during the 12-month period beginning October 1 of the years indicated below:

such Holder's last address, as it appears on the Register. Notes in
denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole
multiples of $1,000. On and after the Redemption Date interest ceases to accrue
on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed, selection of the Notes
will be made by the Trustee, pro rata or by lot or by any other means that the
--- ---- 
Trustee determines to be fair and appropriate.

7. Redemption Pursuant to Gaming Jurisdiction Law. The Company is
---------------------------------------------- 
subject to the New Jersey Casino Control Act (the "New Jersey Act") and the
Nevada Gaming Control Act (the "Nevada Act") and may become subject to
applicable gaming laws, statutes, ordinances, codes, regulations, constitutional
provisions, rule, orders, directives or other enforcement requirements in other
jurisdictions in which it from time to time operates (any such jurisdiction,
including New Jersey and Nevada, a "Gaming Jurisdiction" and any such provision,
including the New Jersey Act and the Nevada Act, a "Gaming Jurisdiction Law").
If the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (the "New Jersey Commission") does
not waive the requirement that a Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes must be
licensed or found qualified or suitable to hold or own the Notes under the New
Jersey Act, and if such Holder or such beneficial owner does not become so
licensed or is not found qualified or suitable within any time period specified
by the New Jersey Commission or the New Jersey Act, or if the Nevada Gaming
Commission (the "Nevada Commission") finds a Holder or beneficial owner to be
unsuitable under the Nevada Act or regulations of the Nevada Commission, or if
any other gaming authority of any other Gaming Jurisdiction (a "Gaming
Authority") requires that Holders or beneficial owners of the Notes be licensed
or found qualified or suitable and such Gaming Authority fails to waive such
requirement or such Holder or beneficial owner does not become so licensed or is
not found qualified or suitable within the applicable time period, the Company
shall have the right, at its option, (i) to require such Holder or beneficial
owner to dispose of all or a portion of such Holder's or beneficial owner's
Notes within 120 days after receipt of notice by such Holder or beneficial owner
of such finding by the New Jersey Commission or the Nevada Commission or such
other Gaming Authority, as the case may be (or such different period as may be
prescribed by the New Jersey Commission or the Nevada Commission or such other
Gaming Authority), or (ii) to call for redemption the Notes of such Holder or
beneficial owner, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice (or such
different period as may be prescribed by the applicable Gaming Authority). If
such Holder or beneficial owner, having been given the opportunity by the
Company to dispose of such Holder's or beneficial owner's Notes, shall have
failed to do so within the prescribed time period, the Company shall have the
right to redeem such Holder's or beneficial owner's Notes on five days' notice.
On any redemption of Notes pursuant to this provision, the Redemption Price
shall be without premium and the lower of (i) the price at which such Holder or
beneficial owner acquired the Notes, together with (if permitted by the New
Jersey Act or the Nevada Act or other applicable Gaming Jurisdiction Law, or by

A-5
<PAGE>

the orders of the New Jersey Commission or the Nevada Commission or the relevant
Gaming Authority, as the case may be) accrued interest to the Redemption Date,
and (ii) the lowest closing sale price of the Notes between the date of the
notice given by the New Jersey Commission or the Nevada Commission or such other
Gaming Authority and the date 10 days after such date, unless a Redemption Price
or other payment, remuneration or related terms or restrictions are required by
the New Jersey Commission or the Nevada Commission or such other Gaming
Authority, as the case may be, in which event such price, terms and restrictions
shall be the Redemption Price and terms of redemption. Each Holder and
beneficial owner by accepting this Note agrees to the provisions set forth in
this Paragraph and in the Indenture and agrees to inform the Company upon
request of the price at which such Holder or beneficial owner acquired this
Note.

8. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Note may be
--------------------- 
treated as its owner for all purposes.

9. Amendments and Waivers. Subject to certain exceptions, the
---------------------- 
Indenture or the Notes may be amended with the consent of the Holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes. Without the
consent of any Holder, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended to cure any
ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for assumption of the Company's
obligations to Holders, to provide for uncertificated Notes or to make any
change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder.

10. Defaults and Remedies. An Event of Default, as defined in the
--------------------- 
Indenture, is: (i) default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Notes;
(ii) default in payment of principal of, or premium on, the Notes; (iii) failure
by the Company for 60 days after notice to comply with any of its other
agreements or covenants in the Indenture or the Notes; (iv) default under any
mortgage, indenture or other instrument under which there may be secured or
evidenced any other Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries and such Indebtedness shall have been accelerated (or shall have
matured), provided that the principal amount of all such Indebtedness with
-------- 
respect to which such events of default have occurred and are continuing
aggregates $5,000,000 or more; (v) judgments in an aggregate amount in excess of
$5,000,000 have been rendered against the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and
either an enforcement proceeding shall have been commenced by any creditor upon
any judgment or there shall be a period of 90 consecutive days during which a
stay of enforcement of any such judgment shall not be in effect; (vi) certain
events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization; and (vii) any revocation,
suspension or loss (with certain exceptions) of any Gaming License which results
in the cessation or suspension of operation for a period of more than 90 days of
the casino business of any casino hotel owned,

A-6
<PAGE>

leased or operated directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or
the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes
may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, except that in the
case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization, all Outstanding Notes shall become due and payable
immediately without further action or notice. In the event of a declaration of
acceleration because an Event of Default as defined in clause (iv) above has
occurred, and is continuing, such declaration and its consequences shall be
automatically rescinded and annulled if (a) in the case of Indebtedness that has
been accelerated, the holders of such Indebtedness shall have rescinded the
declaration of acceleration and the consequences thereof within 10 days of such
declaration or, in the case of Indebtedness that has matured, such Indebtedness
has been discharged in full within 10 days following maturity, (b) the Company
shall have delivered a notice of such rescission or discharge to the Trustee and
(c) no other Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Holders
may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.
The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the
Indenture or the Notes. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its
exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of
any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if
it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Company must
furnish annual compliance certificates to the Trustee.

11. Discharge or Defeasance Prior to Redemption or Maturity. Subject
------------------------------------------------------- 
to certain conditions, including delivery of an Opinion of Counsel regarding
certain tax matters, if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S.
Government Obligations sufficient to pay principal of, premium, if applicable,
and accrued interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, the Company will be
Discharged (to the extent provided in the Indenture) from the Notes and the
Indenture or the Company need not comply with certain terms of the Indenture.

12. Restrictive Covenants. The Indenture imposes certain limitations
--------------------- 
on the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, among other things, pay
dividends, create or incur Indebtedness, create Liens, merge or consolidate with
any other Person or sell, lease or otherwise transfer any of their properties or
assets.

13. Successor Corporation. When a successor Person or other entity
--------------------- 
assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Notes and the
Indenture, the predecessor Person will be released from those obligations.

A-7
<PAGE>

14. Trustee Dealings with Company. The Trustee, in its individual or
----------------------------- 
any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform
services for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and may
otherwise deal with the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as if it were
not the Trustee.

15. No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer, employee or
-------------------------- 
stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any
obligations of the Company under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim
based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.
Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The
waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.

16. Unclaimed Money. If money for the payment of principal of or
--------------- 
interest on any Note remains unclaimed for two years after the date on which
such payment shall have come due, the Trustee or Paying Agent will pay the money
back to the Company at the Company's written request. After that, Holders
entitled to this money must look to the Company for payment, unless applicable
law designates another Person.

17. Discharge Upon Redemption or Maturity. Subject to the terms of
------------------------------------- 
the Indenture, the Indenture will be discharged and cancelled upon the payment
of all Notes.

18. Authentication. This Note shall not be valid until authenticated
-------------- 
by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.
