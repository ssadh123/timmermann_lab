New York, New York
July 19, 1994

To the Representatives
named in Schedule I
hereto of the Underwriters
named in Schedule II hereto

Dear Sirs:

First of America Bank Corporation, a Michigan corporation
(the "Company"), proposes to sell to the underwriters named in
Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting
as representatives (the "Representatives"), the principal amount
of its securities identified in Schedule I hereto (the
"Securities"), to be issued under an indenture dated as of
November 1, 1991, between the Company and Continental Bank, as
trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a First Supplemental
Indenture dated as of July 1, 1994 (such indenture, as
supplemented, the "Indenture"). If the firm or firms listed in
Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in
Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and
"Representatives", as used herein, each shall be deemed to refer
to such firm or firms.

The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") registration statements on Form S-3
(Nos. 33-42226 and 33-49813) relating to the Securities, and the
offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"),
and has filed such amendments thereto as shall have been required
to the date hereof. Such registration statements as amended have
been declared effective by the Commission, and the Indenture has
been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended
(the "1939 Act"). Such registration statements and the
prospectuses relating to the sale of Securities by the Company
constituting a part thereof, including all documents incorporated
therein by reference, as from time to time amended or
supplemented pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "1934 Act"), the 1933 Act or otherwise, are referred
to herein as the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus",
respectively.

SECTION 1. Representations and Warranties.

(a) The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter
as follows:

(i) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus, at
the time the Registration Statement became effective, at the
date of the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form

date") and as of the date hereof, complied, and complies, in
all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "1933 Act
Regulations") and the 1939 Act. The Registration Statement,
at the time it became effective, at the 10-K filing date and
as of the date hereof, did not, and does not, contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading. The Prospectus,
at the time the Registration Statement became effective, at
the 10-K filing date and as of the date hereof, did not, and
does not, include an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were or are made, not misleading; provided,
however, that the representations and warranties in this
subsection shall not apply to statements in or omissions
from the Registration Statement or Prospectus made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished
to the Company in writing by any Underwriter through you
expressly for use in the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus or to that part of the Registration Statement
which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and
Qualification under the 1939 Act (Form T-1) of the Trustee.

(ii) The documents incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the time
they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission,

requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations
of the Commission under the 1934 Act (the "1934 Act
Regulations"), and, when read together with the other
information in the Prospectus, at the time the Registration
Statement and any amendments thereto became or become
effective and at the 10-K filing date will not contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were or are made, not
misleading.

(iii) The independent auditors who examined or audited
the consolidated financial statements and supporting
schedules incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement are independent public accountants as required by
the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations.

duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is required, whether by reason of the
ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of business,
except where the failure to so qualify or be in good
standing would not have a material adverse effect on the
condition, financial or otherwise, or the earnings, business
affairs or business prospects of the Company and its
subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

(vii) Each subsidiary of the Company which is a

existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and

limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights or by general equity
principles, and will be entitled to the benefits of the
applicable Indenture; and the Indenture conforms in all
material respects to all statements relating thereto

(a) Immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company will prepare a supplement to the
Prospectus (the "Prospectus Supplement") setting forth the
principal amount of Securities covered thereby, the terms of
such Securities not otherwise specified in the Prospectus,
the names of the Underwriters participating in the offering
and the principal amount of Securities which each severally
has agreed to purchase, the names of the Underwriters acting
as co-managers in connection with the offering, the price at
which the Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters
from the Company, the initial public offering price, the
selling concession and reallowance, if any, and such other
information as you and the Company deem appropriate in
connection with the offering of the Securities. The Company
will promptly transmit copies of the Prospectus Supplement
to the Commission for filing pursuant to Rule 424 of the
1933 Act Regulations and will furnish to the Underwriters
named therein as many copies of the Prospectus and such
Prospectus Supplement as you shall reasonably request.

(b) The Company will notify you immediately, and
confirm the notice in writing, (i) of the effectiveness of
any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement,

filing of any supplement to the Prospectus or any document
to be filed pursuant to the 1934 Act, (iii) of the receipt
of any comments from the Commission, (iv) of any request by
the Commission for any amendment to the Registration
Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus
or for additional information, and (v) of the issuance by
the Commission of any stop order suspending the

will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of
any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain
the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.

(c) The Company will give you notice of its intention
to file or prepare any amendment to the Registration
Statement (including any post-effective amendment) or any
amendment or supplement to the Prospectus, whether pursuant
to the 1934 Act, the 1933 Act or otherwise, and will furnish
you with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other
document proposed to be filed a reasonable amount of time
prior to such proposed filing and will not file any such

amendment or supplement or other document or use any such
prospectus to which you or your counsel shall object.

(d) The Company will deliver to you a conformed copy
of the Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto
for each of the Underwriters.

(e) If at any time when the Prospectus is required by
the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the
Securities any event shall occur or condition exist as a
result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of your
counsel or counsel for the Company, to further amend or
supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will
not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of circumstances
existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser or if it
shall be necessary, in the opinion of either such counsel,
at any such time to amend or supplement the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the
requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations,
the Company will promptly prepare and file with the
Commission such amendment or supplement, whether by filing
documents pursuant to the 1934 Act or otherwise, as may be
necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission to
make the Registration Statement comply with such
requirements.

(f) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with
you, to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under
the applicable securities laws of such states and other
jurisdictions of the United States as you may designate; and
will file such statements and reports as may be required by
the laws of such jurisdictions to continue such
qualification in effect for as long as may be required for
the distribution of the Securities. The Company will
promptly advise you of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of the Securities for sale in any such state
or jurisdiction or the initiating or threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose.

(g) The Company will make generally available to its
security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than
90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an
earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of
Rule 158 of the 1933 Act Regulations) covering a twelve
month period beginning not later than the first day of the
Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date"
(as defined in said Rule 158) of the Registration Statement.

(h) The Company, during the period when the Prospectus
is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, will file

promptly all documents required to be filed with the
Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 14 of the 1934 Act.

(i) Until the business day following the Closing Date,
the Company will not, without the consent of the
Representatives, offer or sell, or announce the offering of,
any debt securities covered by the Registration Statement or
by any other registration statement filed under the Act.

5. Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters. The
obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall
be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties
on the part of the Company contained herein as of the date
hereof, as of the date of the effectiveness of any amendment to
the Registration Statement filed prior to the Closing Date

commonly termed a "watch list" for possible downgrading, or

that would cause you to believe that the Prospectus,

(xv) The information in the Prospectus under
"Description of Securities", "Certain Provisions
of the Company's Articles of Incorporation and By-
Laws" and, in the Prospectus Supplement under
"Description of the Notes", to the extent that
such information constitutes matters of law,
summaries of legal matters, documents or
proceedings, or legal conclusions, has been
reviewed by them and is correct in all material
respects.

(xvi) To the best of their knowledge and
information, there are no contracts, indentures,
mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases or other
instruments required to be described or referred
to in the Registration Statement or to be filed as
exhibits thereto other than those described or
referred to therein or filed or incorporated by
reference as exhibits thereto; the descriptions
thereof or references thereto are correct, and no
default exists in the due performance or
observance of any material obligation, agreement,
covenant or condition contained in any contract,
indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease
or other instrument so described, referred to, or
filed or incorporated by reference.

(xvii) To the best of their knowledge and
information, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Indenture by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated herein and therein will not conflict
with or constitute a breach of, or default under,
or result in the creation or imposition of any
lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or
assets of the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries pursuant to, any contract, indenture,
mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other
instrument to which the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which it
or any of them may be bound, or to which any of
the property or assets of the Company or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries is subject, nor will
such action result in any violation of the
provisions of the charter or by-laws of the
Company or any applicable law, administrative
regulation or administrative or court order or
decree.

(2) The favorable opinion, dated as of Closing
Date, of Brown & Wood, counsel for the Underwriters,
with respect to the matters set forth in (i), (v) to
(ix), inclusive, (xi) and (xii), of subsection (b)(1)
of this Section. 

(3) In giving their opinions required by
subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2), respectively, of this
Section, Howard & Howard Attorneys, P.C. and Brown &
Wood shall each additionally state that nothing has
come to their attention that would lead them to believe
that the Registration Statement (except for financial
statements and schedules and other financial data
included or incorporated by reference therein as to
which such counsel need make no statement) at the time
it became effective, or if an amendment to the
Registration Statement has been filed by the Company
with the Commission subsequent to the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement, then at the time of the
most recent such filing, and as of the date hereof,
contained an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or that the Prospectus, as amended or
supplemented at the date hereof and at the Closing
Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of
material fact or omitted or omits to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were
or are made, not misleading. 

(4) In giving their opinions required by
subsection (b)(1) and (b)(2), respectively, of this
Section, Howard & Howard Attorneys, P.C. may rely as to
matters of New York law upon the opinion of Brown &
Wood and Brown & Wood may rely as to matters of
Michigan law upon the opinion of Howard & Howard
Attorneys, P.C.

(c) At the Closing Date there shall not have been,
since the date hereof or since the respective dates as of
which information is given in the Registration Statement,
any material adverse change in the condition, financial or
otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business
prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as
one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary
course of business, and you shall have received a
certificate of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or
the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and
of the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company,
dated as of such Closing Date, to the effect that (i) there
has been no such material adverse change, (ii) the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Section 1 hereof are true and correct with the same force
and effect as though expressly made at and as of such
Closing Date, (iii) the Company has complied with all
agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be
complied with or satisfied at or prior to such Closing Date,
and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings
for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the
Commission.

(d) At the time of the execution of this Agreement and
at the Closing Date, you shall have received from KPMG Peat
Marwick a letter dated such date, in form and substance
satisfactory to you, to the effect that (i) they are
independent certified public accountants with respect to the
Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the 1933
Act and the 1933 Act Regulations; (ii) in their opinion the
consolidated financial statements and supporting schedules
audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in
the Registration Statement comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the
1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations with respect to
registration statement on Form S-3 and the 1934 Act and the
1934 Act Regulations; (iii) based upon limited procedures
set forth in detail in such letter, nothing has come to
their attention which causes them to believe that (A) the
unaudited consolidated financial statements and supporting
schedules of the Company and its subsidiaries incorporated
by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus do
not comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act and the
1934 Act Regulations or are not fairly presented in

conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the
audited financial statements incorporated by reference in
the Registration Statement, (B) at a specified date not more
than five days prior to the date of such letter, there has
been any change in the capital stock of the Company or any
increase in the consolidated long term debt of the Company
and its subsidiaries or any decrease in the total assets of
the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case as compared
with the amounts shown in the most recent consolidated
balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement or, during the period from a specified date not
more than five days prior to the date of such letter, there
were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding
period in the preceding year, in net interest income, net
interest income after provision for possible loan loss, non-
interest income, net income or net income applicable to
common stock of the Company and its subsidiaries as compared
with the corresponding period in the preceding year except
in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus disclose have
occurred or may occur; and (iv) in addition to the
examination referred to in their opinions and the limited
procedures referred to in clause (iii) above, they have
carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting
an audit, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and
financial information which are included or incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and
which are specified by you and have found such amounts,
percentages and financial information to be in agreement
with the relevant accounting, financial and other records of
the Company and its subsidiaries identified in such letter.

(e) At the Closing Date, counsel for the Underwriters
shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions
as they may require for the purpose of enabling them to pass
upon the issuance and sale of the Securities as herein
contemplated and related proceedings, or in order to
evidence the accuracy and completeness of any of the
representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of
the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken
by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of
the Securities as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory
in form and substance to you and counsel for the
Underwriters.

If any condition specified in this Section shall not have
been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this
Agreement may be terminated by you by notice to the Company at
any time at or prior to the Closing Date, and such termination
shall be without liability of any party to any other party except
as provided in Section 4 hereof.

6. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale
of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because
any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in
Section 5 hereof is not satisfied or because of any refusal,
inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any
agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than
by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company
will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them
in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the
Securities.

7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each
person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either
the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act against any and all losses, claims,
damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of
them may become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other
Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration
of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment
thereof, or in the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) the
Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that
any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is
based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission (a) made therein in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the
Representatives specifically for use in connection with the
preparation thereof or (b) made or omitted from the Statement of
Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee on Form T-1, and
(ii) such indemnity with respect to the Prospectus shall not
inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person
controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any
such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Securities
which are the subject thereof if such Underwriter did not send a
copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented) to such person, excluding documents incorporated
therein by reference at or prior to the confirmation of the sale
of such Securities in any case where such delivery is required by
the Act and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact
contained in the Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus as

amended or supplemented. This indemnity agreement will be in
addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. 

(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers
who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who
controls the Company within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or
the 1934 Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from
the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to
written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the
Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the
Representatives specifically for use in the preparation of the
documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity
agreement will be in addition to any liability which any
Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that
the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page
and under the heading "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement
constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on
behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in the documents
referred to in the foregoing indemnity, and you, as the
Representatives, confirm that such statements are correct. 

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under
this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify
the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof;
but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not
relieve it from any liability which it may have to any
indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case
any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it
notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and,
to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to
the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid
notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party;
provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and
the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there
may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified
parties which are different from or additional to those available
to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall
have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal
defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such
action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon
receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and
approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying
party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this
Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof
unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate
counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in

accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it
being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not
be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel,
approved by the Representatives in the case of subparagraph (a),
representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who
are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall
not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party
to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after
notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying
party has authorized the employment of counsel for the
indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and
except that if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability
shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such
clause (i) or (iii). 

(d) To provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in
paragraph (a) of this Section 7 is due in accordance with its
terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable
from the Company on the grounds of policy or otherwise, the
Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate
losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the
Underwriters may be subject in such proportion so that the
Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the
percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the sum of
such discount and the purchase price of the Securities specified
in Schedule I hereto and the Company is responsible for the
balance; provided, however, that (y) in no case shall any
Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among
underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be
responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount
applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter
hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section ll(f) of the
1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who
was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For
purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an
Underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act shall have the
same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person
who controls the Company within the meaning of either the 1933
Act or the 1934 Act, each officer of the Company who shall have
signed the Registration Statement and each director of the
Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the
Company, subject in each case to clause (y) of this paragraph
(d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after
receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or
proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for
contribution may be made against another party or parties under
this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom
contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such
party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom

contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they
may have hereunder or otherwise than under this paragraph (d). 

8. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more
Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the
Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or
Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall
constitute a default in the performance of its or their
obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters
shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the
respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth
opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate
amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the
remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting
Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase;
provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of
Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters
agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate
amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the
remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but
shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the
Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not
purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate
without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the
Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set
forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for
such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives
shall determine in order that the required changes in the
Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other
documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its
liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting
Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 

9. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive
Delivery and Payment. All representations, warranties and
agreements contained in this Agreement or contained in
certificates of executive officers of the Company submitted
pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and
effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the
Company, and shall survive delivery of any Securities to the
Underwriters and payment therefor to the Company.

10. Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be
terminated by you immediately upon notice to the Company, at any
time at or prior to the Closing Date (i) if there shall have
been, since the date hereof or since the respective dates as of
which information is given in the Registration Statement, any
material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise,
or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the
Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise,
whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or
(ii) if there shall have occurred any material adverse change in

the financial markets in the United States or any outbreak or
escalation of hostilities or other national or international
calamity or crisis the effect of which is such as to make it, in
your reasonable judgment after consultation with the Company,
impracticable to market the Securities or to enforce contracts
for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in the Common
Stock of the Company shall have been suspended by the Commission
or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on
either the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange
shall have been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for
trading shall have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for
securities shall have been required, by either of said Exchanges
or by order of the Commission or any other governmental
authority, or if a banking moratorium shall have been declared by
Federal, New York or Michigan authorities, or (iv) if the rating
assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating
organization to any debt securities or preferred stock of the
Company as of the date hereof shall have been lowered since the
date hereof or if any such rating organization shall have
publicly announced that it has placed any debt securities or
preferred stock of the Company on what is commonly termed a
"watch list" for possible downgrading. In the event of any such
termination, (x) the covenants set forth in Section 3 with
respect to any offering of Securities shall remain in effect so
long as any Underwriter owns any such Securities purchased from
the Company pursuant to this Agreement and (y) the covenant set
forth in Section 3(g), the provisions of Section 6, the indemnity
agreement and contribution provisions set forth in Section 7 and
the provisions of Sections 9 and 13 shall remain in effect.

11. Notices. All notices and other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of
telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be directed
to Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., 245 Park Avenue, New York, New York
10167, Attention: Chief Legal Officer; notices to the Company
shall be directed to it at 211 South Rose Street, Kalamazoo,
Michigan 49007, Attention: Thomas W. Lambert, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer.

12. Parties. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the Underwriters and the Company, and their
respective successors. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this
Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person,
firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and thereto
and their respective successors and the controlling persons and
officers and directors referred to in Sections 6 and 7 and their
heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any
provision herein contained. This Agreement and all conditions
and provisions hereof are intended to be for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the parties and their respective successors
and said controlling persons and officers and directors and their
heirs and legal representatives, and for the benefit of no other

person, firm or corporation. No purchaser of Securities from any
Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of
such purchase.

13. Governing Law. This Agreement and each Terms Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be
performed in said State.

If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding of
our agreement, please sign and return to us the enclosed
duplicate hereof, whereupon this letter and your acceptance shall
represent a binding agreement among the Company and the several
Underwriters. 

Very truly yours,

FIRST OF AMERICA BANK CORPORATION

7-3/4% SUBORDINATED NOTE DUE JULY 15, 2004

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the
Company (herein called the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in
one or more series under the Subordinated Indenture dated as of
November 1, 1991 as supplemented by the First Supplemental
Indenture dated as of July 1, 1994 (collectively herein called
the "Indenture"), between the Company and Continental Bank, as
Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any
successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and
all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for
a statement of the respective rights thereunder of the Company,
the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, and of the terms upon
which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. 
This Note is one of the series designated by its title on the
face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to
$200,000,000. 

The indebtedness evidenced by the Notes is, to the extent
and in the manner provided in the Indenture, subordinate and
subject in right of payment to the prior payments in full of the
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest and Additional
Amounts on all Senior Indebtedness as defined in the Indenture,
whether now or hereafter outstanding, and this Note is issued and
subject to such provisions, and each Holder of this Note, by
accepting the same, agrees, expressly for the benefit of the
present and future Holders of the Senior Indebtedness, to and
shall be bound by such provisions, and authorizes the Trustee in
his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate
to effectuate such subordination as provided in the Indenture and
appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for such purpose. 

This Note is not subject to redemption prior to maturity. 

If an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) with
respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal
of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and
with the effect provided in the Indenture. 

The Indenture does not provide for any right of acceleration
of the payment of the principal of a series of Notes upon a
default in the payment of principal or interest or a default in
the performance of any covenant or agreement in the Notes of a
particular series or in the Indenture. Upon occurrence of
nonpayment of interest or principal, the Holder of a Note (or the
Trustee under the Indenture on behalf of the Holders of all of
the series of Notes) may, subject to certain limitations and

conditions, seek to enforce payment of such interest or
principal. 

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the
rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
Holders of the Notes of each series to be affected under the
Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, as defined
in the Indenture, of each series affected thereby. The Indenture
also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified
percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of each
series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all
Notes of each series, to waive compliance by the Company with
certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults
under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or
waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding
upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of
any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in
exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of
such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. 

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of the
Note or the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the
Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place, and
rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. 

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note may be
registered on the Security Register, upon surrender of this Note
for registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Trustee located in the City of Chicago, Illinois or at such
office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Register
duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of
this series of authorized denominations and for the same
aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated
transferee or transferees. 

Notes of this series are issuable only in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral
multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to
certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this series are
exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of
this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested
by the Holder surrendering the same. 

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange of Notes of this series, but the Company may

require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge payable in connection herewith. 

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company
or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is
registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not
this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor
any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 

Notes of this series shall rank pari passu with Securities
heretofore or hereafter issued under the Indenture.

All terms used in this Note which are defined in the
Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture.
