Item 5. Other Events.

On January 26, 1994 ADVANTA Corp. announced record earnings
for both the fourth quarter and full year 1993. For the quarter,
ADVANTA reported earnings per share of $.56 and net income of
$23.0 million, increases of 30% and 55%, respectively, over 
fourth quarter 1992. For the full year, earnings per share 
totalled $1.95 before extraordinary item and net income 
before extraordinary item was $77.9 million, increasing 41% 
and 62%, respectively, over 1992. At December 31, 1993, the 
Company's portfolio of managed receivables increased by $1.5 
billion or 42% compared to December 31, 1992. Total managed 
credit card receivables expanded by $575 million in the fourth 
quarter, bringing the outstandings to $3.9 billion at year-end 
1993, up 47% for the year. Fourth quarter earnings per share 
incorporate an 18% increase in the number of common shares outstanding
versus the fourth quarter last year. Earnings per share for all
periods reflect the October 15, 1993 three-for-two stock split.

Highlights for the fourth quarter include the following items:

Continued strong receivable growth with each business
segment growing its average total managed receivables in
excess of 30% year-over-year. Average managed credit
card receivables for the quarter were up 47% from the
comparable year-ago period and 16% from the September
quarter;

The managed credit card charge-off rate fell to 2.9%
in the quarter from 4.2% in the year-earlier period
and 3.2 % in the September quarter. The consolidated
managed charge-off rate declined from 3.2% in the
year-earlier period to 2.7% in the quarter, the same
as the September quarter;

The 30 plus day delinquency rate on managed credit cards
declined to 2.4% at December 31, down from 3.7% in the 
year-ago quarter and 2.8% in the September quarter;

The managed net interest margin rose to 7.64% from
7.32% in the year-earlier period and compares to 8.05% 
in the September quarter;

Off-balance sheet reserves for mortgage servicing were
increased to reflect recent loan loss and prepayment
experience;

the comparable year-ago period and 4.11% in the third quarter;

Return on equity of 27.6% for the quarter and 27.5% for the
