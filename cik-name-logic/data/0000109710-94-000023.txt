On May 13, 1994, Registrant acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
of Blaw-Knox Construction Equipment Corporation ("Blaw-Knox"). On May 27,
1994, Registrant filed a Current Report on Form 8-K which described this
acquisition. At the time of filing this Form 8-K, it was impracticable to
file the financial statements and pro forma financial information required
by Item 7. Registrant is now filing this Form 8-KA in order to file these
financial statements and pro forma financial information.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS

The following financial statements and pro forma financial information are
hereby filed as a part of this report:

(1) Attached on pages 3 to 18 are combined audited financial statements
of Blaw-Knox for the year ended December 31, 1993 and unaudited
combined financial statements for the first quarters ended March 31,
1994 and 1993.

(2) Attached on page 19 is a pro forma balance sheet which combines the
balance sheet of Blaw-Knox with the consolidated balance sheet of 
Registrant at March 31, 1994. In this presentation, the consolidated
balance sheet of Registrant reflects the sale by the Registrant of 
9,174,194 shares of stock of Clark Automotive Products Corporation 
which was completed on May 13, 1994. Pro forma financial information
reflecting the impacts of this sale was included in a Form 8-K filed
by Registrant on May 27, 1994.

(3) A description of pro forma adjustments is included on page 20. 
Certain additional adjustments may be made in the final purchase
price allocation of Blaw-Knox, however, these are not expected to be
material in relation to the pro forma information presented herein.
Additionally, goodwill will be different than the amount reflected since
net assets as of the acquisition date are different than at 
March 31, 1994.

(4) Pro forma income statements combining the results of Registrant and
Blaw-Knox for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the quarter ended
March 31, 1994, along with a description of pro forma adjustments,
are included on pages 21 and 22, respectively. The income statements
of Registrant included in this pro forma presentation reflect the
operations of Clark Automotive Products Corporation as a discontinued
operation. Since the business of Blaw-Knox is seasonal, the results
for the quarter ended March 31, 1994 are not necessarily indicative
of the results for the full year 1994. 

SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934,
the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by
the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Report of Independent Accountants

Stockholders and Board of Directors
Clark Equipment Company
South Bend, Indiana 

In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheet and the related
combined statements of operations and of cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Blaw-Knox
Construction Equipment Group (see Note 1) as of December 31, 1993, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audit of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

As discussed in the Notes to the Combined Financial Statements, effective
January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits by adopting FAS No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than
Pensions."

BLAW-KNOX CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT GROUP

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Description of Reporting Entity:
Blaw-Knox Construction Equipment Group, hereinafter referred to as
the Company or Blaw-Knox, includes the operations of Blaw-Knox
Construction Equipment Corporation, Inc., a direct wholly-owned
subsidiary of White Consolidated Industries, Inc. (WCI) located in
Mattoon, Illinois and Blaw-Knox Construction Equipment Limited, an
indirect wholly-owned United States (U.S.) branch operation of
WCI, located in Rochester, United Kingdom. WCI is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Electrolux A.B. of Sweden (Electrolux) as a result
of the stock acquisition of WCI by Electrolux in March 1986.

The Company is engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of
asphalt paving equipment.

On May 13, 1994, Clark Equipment Company completed the acquisition
of the common stock of Blaw-Knox Construction Equipment
Corporation, Inc. and certain assets and liabilities of Blaw-Knox
Construction Equipment Limited. The combined purchase price was
approximately $144 million, subject to an adjustment based upon
the ending net equity of the acquired operations as of the closing
date.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Basis of Combination - The financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
U.S.. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. All allocable costs of the business have been
reflected in the combined financial statements of the Company.

Quarterly Financial Data - The accompanying combined financial
data as of March 31, 1994 and for the three months ended March 31,
1993 and March 31, 1994, are unaudited; however, in the opinion of
the Company, this data reflects all adjustments, consisting only
of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
the respective periods. Due to the seasonal nature of the
Company's business, the results of operations for the three months
ended March 31, 1993 and 1994 are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for a full year period.

Accounting principles followed in preparing the financial
statements are as follows:

Currency Translation - The financial statements of operations
outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollar
equivalents in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation" (FAS No. 52). 

Foreign currency impacts included in "other expense (income), net"
within the Statement of Operations are negligible.

Revenue Recognition - The Company's policy is to recognize revenue
at the time of shipment.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Cash and Cash Flows - The Company's cash balances are maintained at
minimal levels in connection with WCI's consolidated treasury
management. Cash flows from operating activities were reduced by cash
paid for interest of $644,000 in 1993. Blaw-Knox's operations are
included in the consolidated U.S. tax return of WCI and taxes payable
are recorded as a component of the Parent company investment account. 
Furthermore, as a result of recent operating losses in the U.K., no
income taxes have been paid relative to the U.K. operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The Company estimates the fair
value of all financial instruments where the face value differs from
the fair value based upon quoted amounts or the use of current rates
available for similar financial instruments. As of December 31, 1993,
the fair value of all financial instruments approximated the book
values reflected within the financial statements.

Inventories - Domestic inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Inventories owned
by the U.K. branch are valued on the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method. Inventory valued on LIFO approximated 76% and 75% of total
inventories at December 31, 1993 and March 31, 1994, respectively. 
Inventory balances consist of the following:
Amounts in thousands
December 31, March 31,
1993 1994
(unaudited)
Raw materials $ 4,318 $ 4,180
Work in process and finished goods 22,444 23,744
Valuation allowances (1,265) (1,200)
Inventories at current 25,497 26,724
Excess of current cost over LIFO cost (3,791) (3,791)

Total inventories $ 21,706 $ 22,933

Properties - Properties are carried at cost. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. 
Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized. 
Properties are generally depreciated using the straight-line method
of depreciation. Depreciable lives for major property captions
range as follows:

Land improvements 10-40 years
Machinery and equipment 3-20 years
Buildings and improvements 10-40 years

In conjunction with the March 1986 acquisition of WCI by
Electrolux, the Company's properties at that date were adjusted to
their fair values in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations" (APB No.16). The
resulting increase in properties, as determined by WCI management,
has been pushed down to the Company and is reflected in these
financial statements.

Properties at December 31, 1993 consist of the following:

Amounts in thousands
December 31, 
1993 

Land $ 1,421
Land improvements 3,286
Buildings 6,051
Machinery and equipment 21,048

Total 31,806
Accumulated depreciation (20,491)

Property, plant and equipment, net $ 11,315

Goodwill - The goodwill reflected by the Company for all
periods presented represents a push-down of a portion of the
total goodwill related to the stock acquisition of WCI and
its subsidiaries by Electrolux in March 1986. The goodwill
pushed down to the Company, all of which was assigned to the
U.S. operations, had an original value of $132.4 million. 
This allocation was determined by WCI management based upon
the estimated fair value of the Company at the time of the
acquisition, reduced by the net fair value of the other
identifiable acquired assets and liabilities of the Company. 
Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a
period of 40 years. Goodwill at December 31, 1993, is net of
accumulated amortization of $25.6 million.

Costs and Expenses - Provisions are made currently for the
estimated future costs that will be incurred under product
warranties presently in force.

For years prior to 1993, the cost of health care and life
insurance postretirement benefit costs were charged against
income in the year benefits were provided. Effective
January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of FAS
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other than Pensions." This Statement was adopted on an
immediate recognition basis giving full effect to the net of
tax Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO) of
$2.8 million at the time of adoption. The impact of this
adoption has been reflected in the 1993 financial statements
as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. 
Upon adoption of this Statement, the costs of providing such
benefits are accrued as earned. Annual expense represents a
combination of the service and interest cost provisions of
the annual accrual, the amortization of actuarial gains and
losses and prior service cost, along with the actual benefits
provided for active employees. The Company is self-insured
with respect to health care and life insurance benefits,
subject to a formula driven aggregate stop loss limitation
which approximated $4 million in 1993.

Income Taxes - The operations of the Company are included in
the consolidated U.S. tax return of WCI. U.S. income taxes
are determined on a separate entity basis and taxes payable
are recorded as a component of the Parent company investment
account. The U.K. operations are also taxed in the U.K.,
however, from a U.S. tax perspective credits are allowed for
any income taxes paid in the U.K..

BLAW-KNOX CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT GROUP

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company accounts for income taxes under FAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes", which requires use of the
liability method to account for deferred income taxes. Under
FAS No. 109, deferred taxes are provided on the temporary
differences between the financial reporting and income tax
bases of the Company's assets and liabilities using enacted
tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary
differences reverse.

New Pronouncements - In November 1992, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued FAS No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits". This pronouncement
established accounting and reporting for the estimated cost
of benefits provided by an employer to former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement. Generally,
the Company has accounted for such benefits on an accrual
basis. The Company was required to adopt the provisions of
FAS No. 112 in the first quarter of 1994. The impact of
adoption did not materially effect the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

Company's foreign operations in recent years are available
and have been used to offset earnings in the U.S.. In periods
of future profitability, foreign taxes will also be assessed
in the U.K., subject to available operating loss
carryforwards, with offsetting credits available in the U.S.
to the degree foreign taxes are paid.

6. Debt Obligations:

As a normal part of its business, the U.K. operation routinely
enters into note and other financing arrangements with U.K. banks
to satisfy working capital and operating needs. The outstanding
borrowings reflected at December 31, 1993 relate to a bank
overdraft facility with Barclays Bank plc (Barclays) under which
the U.K. may borrow up to ten million Pounds (approximately $14.8
million at the December 31, 1993 exchange rate). The borrowings
are fully guaranteed by Electrolux and are subject to interest at a
rate of 2% over Barclays borrowing rate ("base rate"). This
favorable rate is influenced by the guarantee of Electrolux.

The Company's non-bargaining U.S. employees participate in a
WCI sponsored non-contributory defined benefit pension plan
(Salaried Plan). The Salaried Plan provides retirees with
monthly benefits determined based upon years of credited
service and final average compensation. Normal retirement is
age 65, with various early retirement options available. For
purposes of these financial statements, the Salaried Plan is
being accounted for as a multi-employer plan consistent with
the guidance in FAS No. 87. Annual pension expense incurred
by the Company relative to this plan for the year ended
December 31, 1993 was $244,000. The non-bargaining U.S.
employees also participate in a WCI sponsored defined
contribution 401(k) plan. Expense related to this plan was
$127,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993.

The Company's U.K. employees are covered by a contributory
defined benefit pension plan. Annual pension expense related
to the plan approximated $211,000 for the year ended December
31, 1993. This plan is not required to report to
governmental agencies pursuant to ERISA, and does not
otherwise determine the actuarial value of accumulated
benefits or net assets available for benefits. 

8. Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits

The Company provides certain health care and life insurance
benefits for retired hourly employees covered under the Basic
Union Agreement between the Company and the United Auto
Workers of America Union, Local 916 (Hourly Plan). The
coverage is provided on a non-contributory basis for retirees
age 65 and older, with Company contributions subject to an
annual cap for employees retiring prior to 1993. The annual
cap is not applicable to employees who retired in 1993. 

Prior to January 1, 1993, the postretirement benefit costs of
this plan were charged to expense in the year benefits were
provided. Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its
method of accounting for such benefits and adopted the
provisions of FAS No. 106. In adopting this Statement, the
Company recorded the entire amount of the APBO of $3.7
million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. The APBO represents the present value of
estimated future benefits payable to current and future
retirees of the Company under the plan. A deferred tax asset
was recognized with respect to the APBO in the amount of $1.5
million at the time of adoption reducing the cumulative
effect of the accounting change for the Hourly Plan to $2.2
million.

The Company does not fund its postretirement benefit plan. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the APBO to
the liability for such costs recognized in the Company's
balance sheet as of December 31, 1993, for the Hourly Plan:

In measuring the projected APBO as of December 31, 1993,
medical inflation trend rates were assumed to be initially
9.5%, trending downward to 5.5% by 2002. The weighted
average discount rate used in the valuation was 7.6%. If the
health care cost trend were to be increased by 1%, the APBO
would increase by approximately $410,000 and the annual
postretirement benefit expense would increase by
approximately $68,000.

Net periodic postretirement benefit expense for the year
ended December 31, 1993, was comprised of the following
components:
Amounts in thousands
December 31, 
1993
Service cost $ 166
Interest cost on APBO 309

Net periodic postretirement benefit expense $ 475

The Company's non-bargaining U.S. employees participate in a
WCI sponsored postretirement benefit plan (Salaried Plan). 
Coverage for salaried retirees is provided on a contributory
basis with the Company picking up all amounts in excess of
the contributions for retirees prior to April 1987. For
retirees after April 1987, Company contributions are limited
to a percentage of the total cost of the plan and/or annual
caps, with retirees being fully responsible for any
additional costs of coverage. The accounting for this WCI
sponsored plan is similar to that of the Hourly Plan above in
that prior to 1993 the costs associated with the Salaried
Plan were accounted for in the year in which benefits were
provided. The provisions of FAS No. 106 were adopted
effective January 1, 1993. 

For purposes of these financial statements, the Salaried Plan
is being accounted for as a multi-employer plan consistent
with the guidance in FAS No. 106. In adopting this Statement
effective January 1, 1993, the Company recorded the entire
amount of the APBO of $914,000, net of a deferred tax benefit
of $366,000, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. Annual postretirement benefit expense incurred by
the Company relative to this plan for the year ended December
31, 1993 was $185,000.

9. Business Segment Information:

The Company operates in one industry segment. It's business

From a geographic perspective, all products are sourced from
either the U.S. or U.K.. A breakdown of the Company's sales,
operating income and identifiable assets by geographic
segment is as follows:

Amounts in thousands

1993
Sales:
U.S. $ 74,372
U.K. 15,089

There was no single dealer or customer from which at least
10% of total revenue was derived during 1993. Export sales
of U.S. manufactured products and parts sold to customers and
dealers located outside the U.S. were $7.9 million in 1993. 
Sales to the U.S. government were insignificant in 1993.

10. Concentration of Credit Risk:

Substantially all of the Company's sales and receivables are
to Company authorized dealers throughout the world. To help
the Company ensure it collects on its accounts receivable,
the Company perfects a security interest in and generally
finances all machinery sold to its dealers. Dealers are
required to remit payment within 30 days of selling the
equipment to the retail customer, regardless of whether the
invoice is due under the original terms of sale. 
Additionally, for sales of equipment to dealers and
customers outside the U.S. and U.K., letters of credit are
generally obtained.

11. Parent Company Investment:

Parent company investment, as presented on the balance
sheet, represents the net of WCI's contributed capital, the
retained earnings of the Company and net advances made
between the Company and WCI. A reconciliation of such
investment as of December 31, 1993, is as follows:

No interest is included in these financial statements
relative to the advances to and from WCI as reflected in
Parent company investment.

12. Contingencies:

The Company is self-insured with respect to workers'
compensation claims, subject to a per occurrence stop loss
limit of $500,000 for all policy years except 1988 in which
the limitation was $1 million per occurrence. As of
December 31, 1993, there were 83 outstanding workers'
compensation claims with recorded accruals of $289,000. It
is the Company's policy to estimate and accrue losses for
known and incurred but not reported workers' compensation
claims.

The Company has been named as a defendant in various product
liability claims. At December 31, 1993, there was one such
claim outstanding for which the Company had recorded an
accrual of $185,000. This accrual relates only to accidents
occurring prior to April 1, 1987. The Company was self-
insured during this period, subject to per occurrence and
aggregate stop loss limitations. For periods subsequent to
April 1, 1987, the Company is fully insured through a
captive insurance subsidiary of WCI under which the Company
incurred insurance premiums of $344,000 in 1993. 
The Company is also subject to various legal proceedings in
the normal conduct of its business. In the opinion of
management, adequate provision for such matters has been
made through either insurance coverage or accruals, or the
ultimate costs will not materially affect the combined
financial position and results of operations of the Company.
