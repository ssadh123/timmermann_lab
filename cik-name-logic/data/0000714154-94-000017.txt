COMPAQ THIRD QUARTER SALES RISE
63 PERCENT TO RECORD $2.84 BILLION

Net Income Up 88 Percent

HOUSTON, October 19, 1994 -- Compaq Computer Corporation

(NYSE:CPQ) today announced record sales of $2.84 billion for the

third quarter ended September 30, 1994, a 63 percent increase over

the $1.75 billion reported in the same period of 1993.

Earnings per share rose 79 percent to $.75 compared with

$.42 last year. Net income was up 88 percent to $201 million

versus the third quarter of 1993.

Sales growth continued to be strong throughout all of the

Company's five geographical regions. North America sales grew 57

percent, Europe grew 50 percent and Japan, Latin America and Asia-

Pacific sales grew at a combined rate of 122 percent.

"Compaq continues to deliver excellent worldwide sales

growth," said Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and chief executive

officer, Compaq Computer Corporation. "In this challenging and

competitive environment we are particularly pleased with our

sales growth, market share gains, and strong net income growth.

Third quarter gross margin declined to 23 percent as we

anticipated. This level is consistent with our financial model

and reflects the business outlook for the remainder of the year and 1995.

While the PC industry remains volatile, we will continue to make the

financial and operational investments necessary to increase our marketshare

and at the same time strive for strong financial performance," said

Pfeiffer.

Third Quarter Highlights

The Company began production at its facilities in

Jaguarinua, Brazil, and Shenzhen, China, during the quarter.

A new class of database servers was also announced,

including new Pentium models, further increasing Compaq's

leadership position in the server marketplace. These new Compaq

ProLiant servers are the first to provide customers with a

tested, proven and optimized database platform.

The Company introduced its new family of Presario

multimedia consumer PCs. The new Presario models incorporate

cable-ready television, high-quality speakerphone, fax machine,

CD-ROM sound systems and a Personal Message Center in the easiest-

to-use Compaq PCs ever produced.

The next generation family of Contura 400 value-oriented

full-function notebooks was announced, rounding out a completely

refreshed Compaq portable PC offering during the year. Entering

the fourth quarter, Compaq's readily-available notebook lineup

now includes the advanced Compaq LTE Elite with the unique built-

in AC adapter, the Compaq Contura 400 with tilted keyboard and

wrist rest, and the ultra-portable Compaq Contura Aero that

weighs less than four pounds.
