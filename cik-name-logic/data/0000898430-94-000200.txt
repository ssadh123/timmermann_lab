ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS. 

(B) PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION. 

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
give effect to the acquisition on January 31, 1994 (the "Acquisition") of
certain assets of the United States Franchise and Distribution Division (the
"F&D Division") of ComputerLand Corporation ("ComputerLand") by Merisel, Inc.
("Merisel") through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Merisel FAB, Inc. ("Merisel
FAB"). The Acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements also assume the
purchase by ComputerLand of 1,103,144 shares of Merisel common stock (the
"ComputerLand Shares"), which will occur if and when a registration statement
covering the resale of such shares is declared effective by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. It is presently anticipated that such a registration
statement will be filed by Merisel in March 1994. The pro forma condensed
combined statement of income for the year ended December 31, 1993 illustrates
the potential impact on the historical results of operations assuming that the
Acquisition and issuance of the ComputerLand Shares occurred as of January 1,
1993. The pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 1993
has been prepared assuming that the Acquisition and issuance of the
ComputerLand Shares occurred as of December 31, 1993. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have
been prepared based upon the historical financial statements of Merisel for the
year ended December 31, 1993 and the statement of revenues and operating
expenses of the F&D Division for the year ended September 30, 1993. Such
statements may not be indicative of the results that would have occurred if the
acquisition and issuance of common shares had been consummated on the indicated
dates, or of the operating results that may be achieved in the future.

Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements

1. GENERAL

Acquisition Agreement and Services Agreement

The foregoing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
illustrate the effect of the acquisition (the "Acquisition") by Merisel, Inc.
(the "Company"), through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Merisel FAB, Inc. ("Merisel
FAB"), of certain assets (the "Assets") of the United States Franchise and
Distribution Division (the "F&D Division") of ComputerLand Corporation
("ComputerLand") pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase
Agreement") dated January 31, 1994 among ComputerLand, Merisel FAB and the
Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Merisel FAB paid
approximately $80 million in cash for the Assets at the closing of the
Acquisition. In addition, the Purchase Agreement provides for a payment by
Merisel FAB in 1996 of up to $30 million based upon the growth in the Company's
and Merisel FAB's sales of designated vendor products to specified customers
over the two-year period ending January 31, 1996; such additional contingent
amount is not reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements.

The F&D Division (and now Merisel FAB) is a distributor of computer systems
and related products from the leading micro-computer manufacturers to a network
comprised of two customer groups: "ComputerLand" franchisees with whom it acts
as a franchisor by licensing the "ComputerLand" name and provides both product
supply and various support services, and "Datago" affiliates, which are
independent dealers and value-added resellers that purchase products from
Merisel FAB on a cost-plus basis, but do not license the "ComputerLand" name.

In connection with its purchase of the F&D Division, Merisel FAB purchased
substantially all of the F&D Division's franchise and third-party reseller
agreements as well as substantially all of the rights in the United States to
ComputerLand's trademarks, tradenames, service marks, copyrights, patents and
logos. Merisel FAB did not purchase the order fulfillment systems, warehouse or
inventory used by the F&D Division; such assets were retained by ComputerLand.
The Company eventually intends to integrate these functions into its facilities
and systems.

For an interim two-year period, Merisel FAB and ComputerLand have entered
into a Distribution and Services Agreement dated as of January 31, 1994 (the
"Services Agreement") pursuant to which resellers will place product orders with
Merisel FAB through the order placement system operated by ComputerLand.
ComputerLand will continue to purchase and warehouse vendor products and fulfill
reseller orders for substantially all of the products offered by Merisel FAB.
Merisel FAB will purchase such products from ComputerLand and will pay
ComputerLand a service fee for performing these functions, which approximates
the historical allocated cost of such services.

Under the Services Agreement, Merisel FAB has received $20 million in
extended credit terms on its product purchases from ComputerLand. ComputerLand
has agreed to use this amount to purchase 1,103,144 shares of the Company's
common stock at a per share price of $18.13, if and when a registration
statement covering the resale of such shares is declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. It is presently anticipated that such a
registration statement will be filed by the Company in March 1994.

Historical Financial Information

Prior to its acquisition, the F&D Division was not an incorporated entity
and separate historical financial statements were not prepared; accordingly, no
such financial statements are readily available. The historical information
included herein was obtained from the F&D Division's statement of revenues and
operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 1993. Such statement
presents the revenues, direct expenses and general and administrative expenses
allocated from ComputerLand to the F&D Division. Selling, general and
administrative expenses include allocated expenses of $27,340,000, representing
costs of the distribution centers and general corporate functions and
administrative personnel. The expenses have been allocated to the F&D Division
based upon such factors as the ratio of the F&D Division's shipments to the
total shipments by ComputerLand and
4
<PAGE>

ComputerLand management's estimate of the time spent by shared employees of
ComputerLand on work related to the F&D Division. Interest income, interest
expense and income taxes were not allocated.

The statement of revenues and operating expenses, which includes
ComputerLand's allocated expenses, may not necessarily reflect the results of
operations that would have been obtained had the F&D Division been operated as a
separate, stand-alone entity for the period presented and may not be indicative
of future revenues and operating expenses of Merisel FAB.

2. PRO FORMA BALANCE SHEET ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION

The initial purchase price for the F&D Division consisted of approximately
$80 million in cash and $2 million in direct expenses. The purchase was funded
substantially by borrowings under a $65 million note to a bank due in January
1995 and a separate $16 million short-term note which was subsequently repaid in
February 1994 from the $20 million of extended credit terms granted to Merisel
FAB for product purchases from ComputerLand (the "ComputerLand Payable"). For
purposes of the pro forma balance sheet presentation, the ComputerLand Payable
is assumed to be outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Approximately
$950,000 in fees were incurred in connection with obtaining the notes payable to
the bank.

Under the purchase method of accounting, an allocation of the purchase price
to the Merisel FAB assets and liabilities is required to reflect fair values.
An allocation of the purchase price has not yet been performed; however, the
following sets forth certain preliminary allocations (all amounts in thousands):

</TABLE>

3. PRO FORMA BALANCE SHEET ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO SALE OF COMPUTERLAND SHARES

The Company will issue to ComputerLand 1,103,144 shares of Merisel common
stock in exchange for the cancellation of the ComputerLand Payable. The
purchase of the ComputerLand Shares will occur if and when a registration
statement covering the resale of such shares is declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. As it is the Company's intent to file a
registration statement in March 1994 covering the resale of the ComputerLand
Shares, the exchange has been reflected in the foregoing unaudited pro forma
condensed balance sheet.
