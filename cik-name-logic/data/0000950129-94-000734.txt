ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

(a) On September 30, 1994, KCI Therapeutic Services, Inc.
("KCTS"), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Registrant,
sold certain of its assets (collectively, the "Assets") used exclusively by
KCTS' Medical Services Division (the "Medical Services Division") to MEDIQ/PRN
Life Support Services-I, Inc. ("Buyer"), a Delaware corporation and indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of MEDIQ Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
("MEDIQ"), pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset
Purchase Agreement") dated August 23, 1994 by and among Registrant, KCTS,
MEDIQ, Buyer and PRN Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of MEDIQ. The Assets consisted of those assets of KCTS used
exclusively by the Medical Services Division in its business of offering for
rent to hospitals and other health care providers a variety of movable critical
care and life support equipment in categories described in Schedule 1.1.1
attached to the Asset Purchase Agreement and selling disposable medical care
products to hospitals and other health care providers for use in conjunction
with such equipment. The aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for
the Assets was $84,092,664, consisting of cash in the amount of $65,300,000 and
promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $18,792,664. The
Purchase Price may be subject to a post-closing adjustment to be based upon the
Net Asset Value (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) of the inventory sold by
KCTS to Buyer. The Purchase Price was determined pursuant to negotiations
between the parties and Registrant believes the Purchase Price represents the
fair market value of the Assets.

1. On September 30, 1994, KCI Therapeutic Services, Inc. ("KCTS"),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, sold certain assets
(the "Assets") used exclusively by KCTS' Medical Services 
Division (the "Medical Services Division") to MEDIQ/PRN Life 
Support Services-I, Inc. ("Buyer") under an Asset Purchase 
Agreement. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated 
by the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Buyer acquired the Assets 
and assumed certain liabilites of the Medical Services
Division. The sales price was approximately $84,093. In
conjunction with the sale, KCTS and its affiliates agreed not to
rent or distribute certain critical care and life support
equipment for up to a period of 5 years.

Gross proceeds included a cash payment of approximately $65,300
and promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of 
$18,792. Currently, the net proceeds of the sale for accounting
purposes are estimated to be approximately $72,817, as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Cash 65,300
Note receivable (Exhibit 99.5) 4,361
Notes receivable (Exhibits 99.1,
99.3 and 99.4) 3,183
Note receivable (Exhibit 99.2) 2,308
------
75,152

Fees and commissions (2,335)
------

Net proceeds 72,817
======
</TABLE>

The discounting of the various notes receivable for accounting
purposes are described below:

Note receivable (Exhibit 99.5): $5,836, interest
payable at 0%, due in 10 equal monthly installments
beginning 90 days from closing. Discounted at 11% with a
20% valuation allowance.

Notes receivable (Exhibits 99.1, 99.3 and 99.4): 
$10,000, interest payable quarterly at 10% after an 18
month grace period, principal due 5 years from closing.
Discounted at 17% with a 50% valuation allowance.

Note receivable (Exhibit 99.2): $2,957, interest
payable at 8%, interest and principal due in equal
installments beginning 90 days after closing with final
payment due 1 year from closing. Discounted at 12% with
a 20% valuation allowance. 

In addition, the Asset Purchase Agreement includes a post-closing
adjustment which may result in a reimbursement to the Buyer for a
portion of the purchase price. The adjustment occurs if actual
inventory, or equipment levels are found to be lower than
specified levels. Interest accrues at the rate of 8% on any 
required payment. KCTS anticipates that no liability will result 
from this post-closing adjustment calculation.

2. The pro forma condensed divested balance sheet gives effect to the
following pro forma adjustments:

(a) To record additional allowance required to bring reserve
balance to 25% of receivables retained. The absence of a 
sales force which could be used to facilitate the collection 
process necessitates this adjustment.

(b) To record the discounted value of notes receivable received
as partial consideration for the Assets acquired from the
Medical Services Division.

(c) To record the write-off of the remaining book value of
goodwill and other intangible assets related to KCTS'
original acquisition of the Medical Services Division.

(d) To record estimated liabilities for direct costs related to
the disposition of the Assets of the Medical Services
Division including legal, accounting, severance, and
reorganization costs.

(e) Represents the effect on income taxes resulting from the
disposition of the Assets of the Medical Services Division,
including the adjustments described above.

(f) Cash received in connection with the sale of $65,300 was
used to reduce Company debt.

(g) After-tax loss which would have been recognized from the
sale of the Assets of the Medical Services Division as if
the transaction had been consummated on June 30, 1994.
<PAGE> 8
3. The pro forma condensed divested statements of earnings for the
year ended December 31, 1993, and and the six months ended June
30, 1994 excluded certain historical items such as cumulative
effect of changes in accounting principle, extraordinary items,
and minority interests. In addition, certain reclassifications
of rental and selling, general and administrative expenses
related to 1993 have been made to conform with the current
period's presentation. The statements presented give effect to
the following pro forma adjustments:

(h) Decrease in interest expense as a result of the paid down
debt, combined with the interest income which would have
been earned under the notes receivable.

(i) The tax rate used for pro forma adjustments was the
statutory rate of 39% which is made up of 35% for federal
Income taxes and 4% for state income taxes.

SECTION 3. CLOSING PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS.

3.1 Closing Statement.

(a) Promptly following the Closing, Seller shall cause to
be prepared a statement as of the close of business on the Closing
Date, which shall set forth (i) the Assets acquired by Buyer pursuant
to Section 1.1 and (ii) the Assumed Liabilities assumed by Buyer
pursuant to Section 2.2(a). Each line item included in (i) and (ii)
above shall be accounted for consistently with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a basis consistent
with the preparation of the February Statement (as defined herein).
Such statement of assets and liabilities prepared as provided in this
Section 3.1 is referred to herein as the "Closing Statement." Seller
shall, at its sole expense, engage KPMG Peat Marwick ("Seller's
Auditors") to perform an audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards with respect to the Closing Statement. Buyer,
MEDIQ and Seller shall cooperate fully with such audit and shall use
best efforts to cause their respective affiliates so to cooperate, so
as to cause Seller's Auditors to complete such audit within 40 days
after the Closing Date. Buyer and Buyer's independent public
accountants ("Buyer's Auditors") shall have the opportunity, at
Buyer's sole expense, to review the work papers of Seller and Seller's
Auditors relating to such audit.

(b) Upon completion of such audit, Seller shall deliver
to Buyer (i) the Closing Statement, (ii) the calculation of Net Asset
Value (as defined below), in each case as of the close of business on
the Closing Date, and (iii) Seller's Auditors' unqualified opinion on
the Closing Statement to the effect that (A) the Closing Statement is
accounted for in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent
with the preparation of the February Statement and the requirements of
this Section 3 and (B) the calculation of Net Asset Value complies
with the requirements of this Section 3.

(c) Unless Buyer notifies Seller within 30 days after
receipt of the Closing Statement and calculation of Net Asset Value of
any objections thereto (specifying in reasonable detail the basis
therefor), such Closing Statement and calculation shall be the
definitive Closing Statement and shall be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes. If Buyer timely notifies Seller of any
such objection, Buyer and Seller shall, together with Seller's
Auditors and Buyer's Auditors, attempt in good faith to reach an
agreement as to the matter in dispute. If the parties shall have
failed to resolve such disputed matter within ten (10) business days
after receipt of notice of such objection, then any such disputed
matter shall, at the instance of Buyer or Seller, be submitted to and
resolved by a national accounting firm other than Seller's Auditors
and Buyer's Auditors reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller. The
fees and expenses of any such accounting firm incurred in resolving
the disputed matters shall be divided equally between Seller and
Buyer. The Closing Statement and calculation of Net Asset Value
shall, after adjustment to reflect the resolution of any

-7-
<PAGE> 14
disputes pursuant to this Section 3.1, be the definitive Closing
Statement and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes.

except any such Transferred Employee terminated by Buyer or MEDIQ or
an Affiliate of MEDIQ for reasons that would constitute "cause" as set
forth in the modified form of Buyer's personnel policies described in
Exhibit III hereto or (C) are Transferred Employees whose employment
with Buyer or MEDIQ or an Affiliate of MEDIQ is terminated by the
employee as a result of any action by Buyer or MEDIQ or an Affiliate

employer's portion of FICA taxes relating to such payments shall not

shall promptly respond to Seller with such information.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall (i) not be

Agreement by Seller or a Seller Affiliate on or prior to the Closing
Date; provided that if any such employee remains in the employ of
Seller or a Seller Affiliate for a period of one (1) year or more
following the Closing Date, Seller will pay Buyer, within 30 days
after the expiration of such one year period, all amounts paid to
Seller out of the Escrow on account of any such employee.

31, 1994, through the Closing Date.

(f) The amount payable to Robert A. Wehrmeyer, Jr. from
the Escrow pursuant to this Section shall be payable whether or not
Seller's payment to him constitutes severance and whether or not he
continues to be an employee of or becomes an independent contractor or
consultant to Seller or any Seller Affiliate. However, Seller shall
pay to Buyer all amounts paid to Seller out of the Escrow with respect
to Mr. Wehrmeyer if and only if Mr. Wehrmeyer continues to be or
becomes

Seller Affiliate and his activities in that capacity (i) constitute an
activity in which Seller may not engage pursuant to Section 9.3 hereof

laws of the jurisdictions identified in the Disclosure Statement,
which includes each jurisdiction in which its ownership or leasing of
assets or properties relating to the Division or the operation of the
Division requires such qualification.

(b) The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock
and other securities of Seller and the beneficial and record ownership
thereof are fully and accurately described in the Disclosure
Statement. Except as described in the Disclosure Statement, no person
has any preemptive or other rights with respect to any such equity

right, power and authority to enter into and perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and under the other agreements and documents
(the "Seller Transaction Documents") required to be delivered by them under
this Agreement prior to or at the Closing. The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller and KCI of their respective obligations under this
Agreement and the Seller Transaction Documents have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Seller and KCI and, assuming the due execution and
delivery by Buyer and MEDIQ, constitutes the respective legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of them, enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms. When executed and delivered as contemplated herein,
each of the Seller Transaction Documents shall, assuming the due execution and
delivery by the other parties thereto, constitute the respective legal, valid
and binding obligation of Seller and KCI, enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms. Upon transfer of the Assets to Buyer at Closing as
contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall acquire good and valid title
thereto (other than any interest in Real Property), free and clear of any
restriction, mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, lien, security interest or other
charge, claim or encumbrance, other than the Assumed Liabilities and any
restriction, mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, lien, security interest or other

Holdings, and Holdings owns all of the outstanding capital stock of Buyer and

action. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Buyer, Holdings and MEDIQ and, assuming the due execution and delivery by
Seller and KCI, constitutes the respective legal, valid and binding obligation
of each of them, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms.
When executed and delivered as contemplated herein, each of the Buyer

governmental actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, Holdings, First PRN and MEDIQ, threatened that

9.3 Noncompetition; Confidential Information.

(a) For a period of five (5) years from and after the

neither Seller, KCI nor any Seller Affiliate shall, directly or
indirectly: (i) engage, anywhere in the United States of America, in
the rental of a portfolio of standard-of-care medical products
manufactured by third parties (examples of which include but are not
limited to the products identified on Schedule 1.1.1); or (ii) be or
become a stockholder, partner, owner, officer, director or employee or
agent of, or a consultant to or give financial or other assistance to,
any person or entity considering engaging in any such activities or so
engaged; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit Seller,
KCI and/or any Seller Affiliate from (A) owning, as passive investors,
in the aggregate not more than 5.0% of the outstanding publicly traded
stock of any corporation so engaged or (B) engaging in the KCITS
Business or (C) engaging in the manufacture, sale, lease, rental,
distribution or marketing of any medical product or equipment
(including, without limitation, the PlexiPulse and any other product
or product-line acquired or developed by Seller, KCI or a Seller
Affiliate) (1) that Seller, KCI or a Seller Affiliate manufactures,
(2) with respect to which Seller, KCI or a Seller Affiliate owns
proprietary rights (including, without limitation, through development
of such product or equipment), or (3) for which KCI, Seller or a
Seller Affiliate has distribution rights (but nothing in this clause
(C)(3) shall permit KCI, Seller or any Seller Affiliate to obtain
distribution rights for a series of products manufactured by third
parties such that Seller and/or its Affiliates are engaged in the
rental of a portfolio of standard- of-care products), or (D) engaging
in the business conducted by KCI Financial Services, Inc. a
wholly-owned subsidiary of KCI, on the date hereof, including, without
limitation, the leasing and "rent-to-own" types of financing. The
duration of Seller's and KCI's covenants set forth in this Section
shall be extended by a period of time equal to the number of days, if
any, during which Seller or KCI is in violation of the provisions
hereof.

(b) For a period of five (5) years from and after the
Closing Date, neither Seller, KCI nor any Seller Affiliate shall,
directly or indirectly use in furtherance of any of their business
affairs or otherwise and to the detriment of Buyer with respect to the
Medical Services Business, or disclose to any third party except as
required by Law, any trade secret, customer list, supplier list,
financial data, pricing or marketing policy or plan or any other
proprietary or confidential information relating exclusively

-35-
<PAGE> 42
to the Medical Services Business or any of its products or services so
long as the same is not publicly known (other than by the act of
Seller, KCI or any Seller Affiliate).

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, an "Affiliate" of
a person means: (i) any corporation, limited liability company,
partnership or other entity of which such person owns or otherwise
possesses the power to direct the vote, directly or indirectly, of an
amount of voting securities sufficient to elect a majority of the
board of directors of such corporation, and (ii) any other person or
entity controlled by such person. For the purposes of this definition
of "Affiliate," "control" means the power to direct the management and
policies of a person or entity, directly or indirectly, whether
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise;
provided that, any person or entity of which a person owns
beneficially or of record, either directly or through one or more
intermediaries, more than 20% of the ownership interests, shall be
conclusively presumed to be an "Affiliate" of such person. A "Seller
Affiliate" is an Affiliate of Seller or KCI.

(d) If any party hereto learns of any breach or potential
breach of Section 9.3, such party shall immediately notify the other
party hereto of such event, specifying the basis therefor in
reasonable detail. Buyer may, in its sole discretion, afford Seller
and KCI an opportunity to remedy or otherwise cure such breach or
potential breach before seeking legal redress, provided that Seller
and KCI are actively seeking to cure or remedy such breach or
potential breach; but such opportunity to remedy shall be without
prejudice to the right of Buyer to seek and obtain injunctive or other
relief.

(e) Seller and KCI acknowledge that damages alone shall
not be an adequate remedy for any breach by Seller, KCI or any Seller
Affiliate of Seller's covenants contained in this Agreement and
accordingly expressly agree that, in addition to any other remedies
which Buyer may have, Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief in
any court of competent jurisdiction for any breach or threatened
breach of any such covenants by Seller, KCI and/or any Seller
Affiliate.

(f) Seller and KCI acknowledge and agree that the
covenants contained in this Section 9.3 are fair and reasonable in
light of the consideration paid hereunder and in order to protect
Buyer's investment through its acquisition of the Assets in the
Medical Services Business, and the invalidity or unenforceability of
any particular provision, or part of any provision, of this Section
shall not affect the other provisions or parts hereof. If any
provision hereof is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a
court of competent jurisdiction, Seller and KCI shall negotiate in
good faith to provide Buyer with protection as nearly equivalent to
that found to be invalid or unenforceable and if any such provision
shall be so determined to be invalid or unenforceable by reason of the
duration or geographical scope of the covenants contained therein,
such duration or geographical scope, or both, shall be considered to

-36-
<PAGE> 43
be reduced to a duration or geographical scope to the extent necessary
to cure such invalidity. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
amount of Buyer's damages for any breach by Seller and KCI of the
provisions of this Section 9.3 shall be determined without reference
to, and irrespective of, the allocation of the Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.4.

9.4 Provisions Relating to Employees.

(a) Except as set forth in Sections 2.2(d) and 3.3,
Seller and KCI shall be solely responsible for any severance pay,
accrued salary, pension benefit, unemployment compensation, vacation
pay and any other obligations to present or former employees created
or owing as a consequence of the termination or prior employment
(whether by agreement, policy or by Law) of any employees of Seller
involved in the Medical Services Business. Seller and KCI shall be
solely responsible for preparing and filing for all their Pension
Plans and Welfare Plans all Forms 5500 (Annual Return/Report of
Employee Benefit Plan) and all other reports and filings required with
respect thereto. Seller and KCI shall remain solely responsible for
any and all violations of the Code and/or ERISA with respect to
Seller's and KCI's Pension Plans and Welfare Plans (including the
reporting and disclosure requirements and the fiduciary standards),
and shall be solely responsible for all continuation coverage
requirements of the Code and ERISA with respect to all such plans and
for all such continuation coverage requirements as a result of the
sale of Assets to Buyer or any termination of Seller's employees
following the sale of Assets.

(b) Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation)
in its sole discretion to offer to employ employees of Seller who are
employed in the Medical Services Business on the last business day
prior to the Closing Date, on terms and conditions determined solely
by Buyer; provided that Buyer shall not have any obligation to
continue the employment of any such person hired by Buyer or to
provide any benefits or pay any salaries comparable to those provided
by Seller.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 2.2(d) or Section 3.3,
Buyer is not assuming, nor shall Buyer be responsible for any
liability or obligation whatsoever to any present or former employee
of Seller, or any liability or obligation under any Employee Benefit
Plan with respect to any present or former employee of Seller whether
or not such present or former employee is hired by Buyer pursuant to
Section 9.4(b).

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if the Closing occurs, Buyer and MEDIQ shall be responsible
for any and all liabilities, obligations, commitments, costs and
expenses, including reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys and
other advisors, incurred in respect of any Transferred Employee
relating to or arising in connection with any and all claims made
after the Closing Date for

-37-
<PAGE> 44
workers compensation benefits arising in connection with any
occupational injury or disease occurring after the Closing Date.

9.5 Transitional Activities. From and after the Closing, Seller
promptly shall forward or refer to Buyer any orders, inquiries and requests
received by any of them for the sale, lease or rental of, or with respect to,
the Assets sold to Buyer hereunder, and shall take all other actions reasonably
requested by Buyer to assist in the prompt and orderly transition of the
Medical Services Business to Buyer.

9.6 Delivery of Financials. Within 40 days after the Closing,
Seller and KCI shall provide with respect to the Division: audited statements

statements of income and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1991, 1992
and 1993 (together with the original report thereon and required consents
related thereto of Seller's Auditors) and all interim financial statements, in
each case to the extent required for compliance by Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates
with the requirements of Rule 13a-11 of the SEC issued pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X of
the SEC. The expense of such audit shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer.
In addition, Seller shall reasonably cooperate and cause Seller's Auditors to
reasonably cooperate with Buyer and Buyer's Auditors in the preparation of any
other financial statements or schedules required to enable Buyer and Buyer's
affiliates to comply with applicable federal and state securities laws and
regulations.

9.7 Bug-Out Procedures. During the period described in Schedule
9.7 hereto, Buyer and Seller shall carry out the procedures described in
Schedule 9.7 hereto relating to the verification of the existence, location and
status (i.e., whether or not ready for patient use, whether or not under repair
and whether or not currently rented) of all of the equipment constituting
Assets and confirming the transfer of such Assets to Buyer.

9.8 Employee Health Insurance. From and after the effective time
of Closing, all employees of Seller who are employed by Buyer as of the Closing
shall cease to participate in any health insurance plans maintained by Seller
or KCI or any Seller Affiliate and shall, at the employee's election, commence
participation, on a basis whereby all waiting period and pre-existing condition
requirements shall have been waived or shall otherwise be inapplicable to such
employees (and covered dependents), in health insurance plans maintained by
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer. Any such health insurance plan maintained by
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall only cover (to the extent provided in such
plan) claims relating to health care services rendered after the Closing Date.
The health insurance plans maintained by Seller, KCI or a Seller Affiliate
shall cover (to the extent provided in such plans) all claims relating to
health care services rendered to such employees (and covered dependents) on or
prior to the Closing Date.

9.9 Customer Pricing. From and after Closing, Buyer shall, with
respect to all customer contracts of Seller relating to the Medical Services
Business that do not constitute

-38-
<PAGE> 45
Assumed Contracts, honor each pricing arrangement between Seller and a customer
of Seller under each such contract during the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the earlier to occur of (i) the date 90 days after the
Closing and (ii) the date on which such pricing arrangement (or the customer
contract to which it relates), by its terms, expires.

9.10 Computer Software Support. In connection with obtaining
consents of third parties to the assignment to Buyer of Assumed Contracts that
provide for the provision by Seller or a Seller Affiliate of M.E.M.S. or
C.A.P.S. or maintenance with respect thereto (collectively, "Computer
Support"), Seller shall propose to the other parties to such contracts
alternate arrangements mutually satisfactory to, and approved by, Seller and
Buyer, with respect to the provision of such software or services from and
after Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to
the extent the third parties to any such Assumed Contracts included in the
Assets do not accept any such proposed alternate arrangements, KCI and Seller
shall, from and after Closing, remain liable for performance of the portions of
such Assumed Contracts pertaining to Computer Support and the obligations of
Seller or a Seller Affiliate under such Assumed Contracts with respect to
Computer Support shall constitute Excluded Liabilities hereunder.

9.11 Intercreditor and Subordination Agreements. (a) If Buyer
refinances its indebtedness to Congress Financial Corporation incurred pursuant

and deliver an intercreditor and subordination agreement with the new lender on
terms substantially the same as those of the Congress Intercreditor Agreement.

N.A., KCI and Seller will execute and deliver a subordination agreement with

Seller and KCI shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold Buyer and its

net of any recoveries under insurance policies, indemnities or recoveries from
third parties or tax benefits to Buyer resulting from such damage
(collectively, "Damages"), which Buyer or any such person may suffer, incur or
become subject to arising out of, based upon or otherwise in respect of: (a)
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller made in
Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8(a), 4.12, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16(c), 4.16(d), 4.17

-40-
<PAGE> 47
provided supporting documentation) that such claimed customer credit or
discount does not arise from any billing error); and (f) Assumed Liabilities
described in Section 2.2(e) other than the first $20,000 of such Assumed
Liabilities.

11.2 Indemnification by Buyer and MEDIQ. Subject to Section 11.5,
Buyer, Holdings and MEDIQ shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold
Seller, KCI and Seller's and KCI's officers, directors and shareholders
harmless against and in respect of any and all Damages which Seller, KCI or any

or otherwise in respect of: (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer made in Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.7(a)
of this Agreement; (b) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer made in Section 5.6 of this Agreement or any breach or

11.3 Inter-Party Claims. Any party seeking indemnification
pursuant to this Section (an "Indemnified Party") shall notify the other party
or parties from whom such indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party")
of the Indemnified Party's assertion of such claim for indemnification,
specifying the basis of such claim.

11.4 Third Party Claims.

(a) Each Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party of the assertion by any third party of any claim
with respect to which the indemnification set forth in this Section
relates (which shall also constitute the notice required by Section
11.3). The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon notice to the
Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days after the receipt of any
such notice, to undertake the defense of or, with the consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld),
to settle or compromise such claim. The failure of the Indemnifying
Party to give such notice and to undertake the defense of or to settle
or compromise such a claim shall constitute a waiver of the
Indemnifying Party's rights under this Section 11.4(a) and shall
preclude the Indemnifying Party from disputing the manner in which the
Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of such claim or the
reasonableness of any amount paid by the Indemnified Party in
satisfaction of such claim.

(b) The election by the Indemnifying Party, pursuant to
Section 11.4(a), to undertake the defense of a third- party claim
shall not preclude the party against which such claim has been made
also from participating or continuing to participate in such defense,
so long as such party bears its own legal fees and expenses for so
doing.

11.5 Limitations and Requirements. No party hereto shall have any
obligation to indemnify any other party hereto or any other person against
Damages pursuant to Section 11.1(a) (in the case of Seller and KCI) or Section
11.2(a) (in the case of Buyer, Holdings and MEDIQ) arising out of or based upon
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made in or
pursuant to this Agreement or any Transaction Document unless and until the
aggregate of all such Damages suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Parties
under this Agreement exceeds $750,000 (the "Basket"); in which event such
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification only for the amount of
all Damages suffered or incurred in excess of the Basket; provided, however,
that the above limitation shall not be applicable to any claim for Damages
pursuant to Sections 11.1 (b) through (f) (in the case of Seller and KCI) or
Section 11.2(b) through (d) (in the case of Buyer, Holdings and MEDIQ) or
based upon a breach of any representation or warranty made in or pursuant to
Sections 4.20 or 5.4 of this Agreement. The aggregate amount of all Damages
for which Buyer may be indemnified pursuant to Section 11.1(a) of this
Agreement shall not exceed $10,000,000, and the aggregate amount of all Damages
for which Buyer may be indemnified hereunder shall not exceed the sum of
$81,300,000 and the Highline Buy-Out Amount. It is specifically understood and
agreed that in the event a misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
is discovered by Buyer and asserted by it after the Closing, the remedy of
Buyer shall be limited to indemnification as set forth in this Section 11, and
Buyer shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in seeking indemnification for
Damages solely under Section 11.1(a) of this Agreement, Buyer's sole and
exclusive remedy shall be to set off certain of the payments to be made to
Seller pursuant to the promissory notes delivered to Seller attached hereto as
Exhibit IB (the "IB Notes") in accordance with Section 11.6 of this Agreement;
provided, however, that in the event the IB Notes are pre- paid, in whole or in
part, and the aggregate amount of Damages under Section 11.1(a) for which Buyer
is entitled to indemnification (subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 11.5) exceeds the aggregate outstanding principal balance of and
accrued but unpaid interest under the IB Notes, Buyer shall be entitled to
recover such excess Damages first by setting off, in accordance with Section
11.6, remaining payments to be made to Seller under the Note in the form of
Exhibit IC hereto; second by setting off, in accordance with Section 11.6,
remaining payments to be made to Seller under the Note in the form of Exhibit
IA hereto; and third (to the extent any excess Damages have not been recovered
through set off as aforementioned) by receiving cash from Seller or KCI. To
the extent that any claim for indemnification may properly be made under
Section 11.1 (a) or Section 11.2(a) and any other provision of this Agreement,
then such claim shall be deemed for all purposes of this Section 11.5 to have
arisen only under such other provision and not under such Section 11.1(a) or
Section 11.2(a), as the case may be. Each Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party of a claim under Section 11.1(a) or 11.2(a) within the nine
(9) month period referenced in Section 12.1(a), in accordance with Section
11.3.

11.6 Right of Set-Off. Subject to the limitations in Section 11.5,
Buyer shall have the right to set-off, against any amount which may be owed by
Buyer or any Affiliate of MEDIQ to Seller pursuant to the Notes, any Damages
owed by Seller or KCI to Buyer under

-42-
<PAGE> 49
this Agreement, plus interest at a rate of 10% per annum on such Damages
accruing from the date that Buyer receives notice of claim for such Damages.
The exercise of such right of set-off by Buyer and the consequent failure of
Buyer or a MEDIQ Affiliate to pay amounts otherwise due and payable under the
Notes shall not constitute an event of default under the Notes if: (a) Buyer
shall have given Seller written notice of Buyer's intended exercise of such
set-off at least 30 days prior to the time amounts otherwise due and payable
under a Note (but for the exercise of such right of set-off) would be due and
payable under the terms of such Note and such notice shall have specified (i)
the aggregate amount that Buyer intends to set-off based on such written notice
(the "Aggregate Set-Off Amount"), (ii) the Note or Notes against which Buyer
intends to effect some or all of the set-off contemplated in such written
notice and (iii) the identity of the banking institution (having assets of at
least $500 million) (the "Selected Depository") at which Buyer will establish
an interest-bearing escrow account for deposit of the Contested Amount (as
hereinafter defined) in accordance with the following subclause; and (b) after
the Uncontested Amount (as hereinafter defined) has been set- off, Buyer shall
have deposited the Contested Amount into such escrow account in one or more
installments, each such installment to have been deposited in such escrow
account no later than the time the corresponding amount otherwise due and
payable under a Note (but for such set-off) would be payable under the terms of
such Note. At the time Buyer establishes the aforementioned escrow account,
the Selected Depository shall be instructed to (i) hold all amounts deposited
into escrow by Buyer in accordance with this Section 11.6, and interest
earnings attributable thereto, in escrow until such time as either (A) Buyer
and Seller deliver joint instructions to such banking institution regarding the
disposition of such funds or (B) a court of competent jurisdiction directs the
disposition of such funds out of escrow. "Contested Amount" means the amount,
if any, of the Aggregate Set-Off Amount which Seller asserts, in a written
notice delivered to Buyer no later than 20 days after the date of Buyer's
exercise notice, Buyer is not entitled to set off in accordance with this
Agreement, provided that if at any time prior to the deposit of some or all of
the Contested Amount into escrow Seller withdraws its previous objection with
respect to some or all of the Aggregate Set-Off Amount, the Contested Amount
shall be reduced by the amount with respect to which Seller has withdrawn its
objection. "Uncontested Amount" means an amount equal to the Aggregate Set-Off
Amount minus the Contested Amount. Buyer shall be entitled to give more than
one written notice pursuant to this Section 11.6.

SECTION 12. MISCELLANEOUS.

12.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

(a) The representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8(a), 4.11(b), 4.12, 4.14, 4.15,

notwithstanding, the representations and warranties of Seller and KCI

thereof, shall not be affected by any investigation of Seller, KCI or
the Medical Service Business made before or after the date hereof by
Buyer, MEDIQ or their agents or representatives.

Agreement and to provide for the orderly and efficient transition of the
Medical Services Business to Buyer. Seller and KCI shall, for five years after

Services Business and shall, upon prior notice, provide Buyer and its
authorized representatives reasonable access thereto, and in any event shall
not dispose of any of them without first offering them to Buyer. Each party
shall promptly notify the other parties of any event or circumstance known to

contemplated hereby or which would indicate a breach or non-compliance with any
of the terms, conditions, representations, warranties or agreements of any of
the parties to this Agreement.

12.3 Bulk Sales. The parties hereto waive compliance with all
applicable bulk sales laws, including, without limitation, the Uniform

filing fees incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated herein
shall be borne by Buyer.

Agreement, Seller, KCI, Buyer and MEDIQ shall each issue a press release

transactions contemplated herein without the prior agreement of each other
party hereto, provided that each party shall use best efforts to consult with
the other in advance of any disclosure required by law, but the agreement of
the other parties hereto shall not be required.

12.7 Assignment and Benefit.

(a) Buyer may assign this Agreement in whole or in part
(including, without limitation, its rights with respect to some or all
of the Assets under Section 1.1 hereof) to any corporation which is a
direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MEDIQ or to any person
which becomes a successor in interest (by purchase of assets or stock,
or by merger or otherwise) to Buyer; but no such assignment shall,
without the written consent of Seller, relieve Buyer, Holdings and
MEDIQ of their respective obligations hereunder. Seller shall not
assign this Agreement or any rights hereunder, or delegate any
obligations hereunder, without prior written consent of Buyer. Buyer
agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold its consent to the
assignment by Seller of all or a portion of its rights and the
delegation of all or a portion of its duties under this Agreement (and
the transfer, subject to Buyer's rights under this Agreement, of all
or a portion of the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities) to a Person
wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by KCI, and if Buyer so
consents, Buyer will accept the conveyance of such portion of the
Assets from such Person; but no such assignment or delegation shall,
without the written consent of Buyer, relieve Seller or KCI of their
respective obligations hereunder. Buyer may condition its agreement
to such an assignment on Seller's and KCI's agreement to furnish
pursuant to Section 9.6 any additional financial statements required
for the purposes stated in that Section, and Seller shall be
responsible for the additional expenses in preparing the statements
required by Section 9.6 resulting from such assignment. No such
assignment by Seller shall be made unless Congress Financial
Corporation consents thereto. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement and the rights and obligations set forth herein shall inure
to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties hereto, and each
of their respective successors and assigns. In accordance with the
foregoing, Buyer intends prior to Closing to assign to First PRN
Buyer's rights under Section 1.1 with respect to the Assets described
in Section 1.1(a)(ii) hereof and the customer contracts which
constitute Assumed Contracts (in which case Seller will transfer such
Assets directly to First PRN and not to Buyer at Closing).

(b) This Agreement shall not be construed as giving any
person, other than the parties hereto and their permitted successors
and assigns, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in
respect of this Agreement or any of the provisions

-46-
<PAGE> 53
herein contained, this Agreement and all provisions and conditions
hereof being intended to be, and being, for the sole and exclusive
benefit of such parties, and permitted successors and assigns and for
the benefit of no other person or entity.

12.8 Amendment, Modification and Waiver. The parties may amend or
modify this Agreement in any respect. Any such amendment, or modification
shall be in writing. The waiver by a party of any breach of any provision of
this Agreement shall not constitute or operate as a waiver of any other breach
of such provision or of any other provision hereof, nor shall any failure to
enforce any provision hereof operate as a waiver of such provision or of any
other provision hereof.

12.9 Governing Law. This Agreement is made pursuant to, and shall
be construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
(and United States federal law, to the extent applicable), irrespective of the
principal place of business, residence or domicile of the parties hereto, and
without giving effect to otherwise applicable principles of conflicts of law.

12.10 Section Headings and Defined Terms. The section headings
contained herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any way
affect the meaning and interpretation of this Agreement. The terms defined
herein and in any agreement executed in connection herewith include the plural
as well as the singular and the singular as well as the plural, and the use of
masculine pronouns shall include the feminine and neuter. Except as otherwise
indicated, all agreements defined herein refer to the same as from time to time
amended or supplemented or the terms thereof waived or modified in accordance
herewith and therewith.

12.11 Severability. Subject to Section 9.3, the invalidity or
unenforceability of any particular provision, or part of any provision, of this
Agreement shall not affect the other provisions or parts hereof, and this
Agreement shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or
unenforceable provisions or parts were omitted.

12.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original; and any person may
become a party hereto by executing a counterpart hereof, but all of such
counterparts together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. It
shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement or any counterpart
hereof to produce or account for any of the other counterparts.

12.13 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the
Disclosure Statement, the agreements, exhibits, schedules and certificates
referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto and the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the purchase and sale of the Assets and assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities and supersede all prior agreements and understandings. The
submission of a draft of this Agreement or portions or summaries thereof does
not constitute an offer to purchase or sell the Assets, it being understood and
agreed that Buyer, MEDIQ, Seller or KCI shall

-47-
<PAGE> 54
not be legally obligated with respect to such a purchase or sale or to any
other terms or conditions set forth in such draft or portion or summary unless
and until this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by all parties.

12.14 Guaranty. KCI hereby guarantees all of the obligations of
Seller pursuant to this Agreement and shall be deemed a beneficiary of the
terms of this Agreement in consideration therefor. MEDIQ hereby guarantees all
of the obligations of Buyer and Holdings pursuant to this Agreement (the terms
of MEDIQ's guaranty with respect to amounts payable under the Notes are as set
forth in the Guaranty Agreement), and in consideration therefor shall be deemed
a beneficiary of this Agreement. Holdings hereby guarantees all of the
obligations of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (the terms of Holdings'
guaranty with respect to amounts payable under the Notes with respect to which
Holdings is not maker are as set forth in the Guaranty Agreement) and in
consideration therefor shall be deemed a beneficiary of this Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has duly executed this
Agreement, all as of the date first above written.

any breach or default thereunder occurring on or after the Closing Date

EXHIBIT 99.1

PROMISSORY NOTE

$2,000,000 Pennsauken, New Jersey
September 30, 1994

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, PRN HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Maker"), hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of KCI
THERAPEUTIC SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Payee"), as hereinafter
provided, the principal amount of TWO MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($2,000,000),
together with interest on the unpaid principal balance from time to time
outstanding at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum beginning on March 31,
1996 (the "Interest Start Date"). All past due principal hereof and accrued
unpaid interest thereon shall bear interest from the maturity thereof until
paid at the lesser of the Default Rate (as hereinafter defined) and the maximum
rate of interest per annum permitted by applicable law. Prior to the Interest
Start Date no interest shall accrue on those portions of the outstanding
principal balance hereof which are not then past due. Interest shall be
calculated on the basis of a 365 or 366 day calendar year, as the case may be.

As used in this Note, the following terms shall have the
respective meanings indicated below:

"Default Rate" shall mean the sum of the Prime Rate in effect from
day to day plus five percent (5%) per annum.

"Prime Rate" shall mean the rate of interest per annum established
from time to time by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association in
San Francisco, California ("BOA"), and designated as its reference rate of
interest, which may not necessarily be the lowest interest rate charged by BOA.
In the event that BOA does not have a rate designated by it as its reference
rate, then the Prime Rate under this Note shall be deemed to be the variable
rate of interest per annum which is the rate designated by BOA as its "prime
rate", "base rate" or other similar rate and that Payee determines to be
comparable to the Prime Rate as described above. In the event that BOA shall
cease to announce any of the rates described in the preceding sentence, then
the Prime Rate shall be calculated using that variable rate of interest per
annum established by NationsBank of Texas, N.A., San Antonio, Texas, or such
other financial institution satisfactory to Payee, which institution may be
chosen by Payee, in its sole discretion, and changed by Payee, in its sole
discretion exercised in good faith, from time to time, any such change to
become effective on the date of such change.

This Note shall be repaid as follows:

(a) Interest, calculated on a daily basis, shall be due
and payable quarterly in arrears commencing on the 30th day of
September, 1996, and thereafter continuing regularly and quarterly on
the same day of each December, March, June, and September until
September 30, 1999 (the "Maturity Date").
<PAGE> 2
(b) The outstanding principal balance hereof and any and
all accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable in
full on the Maturity Date or upon earlier maturity hereof, whether by
acceleration or otherwise.

Payments of principal and interest shall be made in lawful money of
the United States of America by wire transfer of immediately available funds or
cash or bank cashier's check at 8023 Vantage Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78230
or at such other place as Payee shall designate to Maker in writing.

Payee expressly agrees that Maker shall be entitled to offset against
the last to mature portion of the indebtedness evidenced hereby, any and all
payments owed by Payee or any of its Affiliates (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement (hereinafter defined)) to MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services-I,
Inc. ("PRN-I") pursuant to Section 11.1 of that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") dated August 23, 1994, as amended by
Amendment No. 1 to Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of September 30, 1994, by
and among MEDIQ Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("MEDIQ"), PRN-I, Maker,
Kinetic Concepts, Inc. ("KCI") and Payee.

Any check, draft, money order or other instrument given in payment of
all or any portion hereof may be accepted by Payee and handled in collection in
the customary manner, but the same shall not constitute payment hereunder or
diminish any rights of Payee except to the extent that actual cash proceeds of
such instrument are unconditionally received by Payee.

Maker may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time without
premium or penalty. All prepayments hereunder shall be applied first to
accrued but unpaid interest, then to discharge any expenses for which Payee may
be entitled to receive reimbursement under the terms of this Note, and, lastly,
to principal due hereunder. Maker shall be required to prepay this Note in
whole or in part to the full extent of any Prepayment Offering Proceeds (as
defined herein) which may be realized from time to time from any Subsidiary
Equity Offering (as hereinafter defined) or any MEDIQ Equity Offering (as
hereinafter defined). For purposes hereof, "Prepayment Offering Proceeds"
shall mean (i) with respect to a Subsidiary Equity Offering, an amount equal to
fifty percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds (as hereinafter defined) equal to or
less than $20,000,000, or (ii) with respect to a MEDIQ Equity Offering, an
amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) an amount equal to
fifty percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds equal to or less than $20,000,000, by
(y) a fraction having a numerator equal to the total pro-forma combined gross
revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of the Subsidiaries (as
defined herein) on a consolidated basis and a denominator equal to the sum of
the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal
quarters of MEDIQ, plus, without duplication, (a) the sum of the products
derived by multiplying (i) the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the
previous four (4) fiscal quarters of each of the Subsidiaries by (ii) the daily
average percentage of capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ in
the respective Subsidiary over the same period, plus (b) the sum of the
products of the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the previous four
(4) fiscal quarters of each company in which, at any time during the relevant
period, twenty percent (20%) or more of the capital stock

-2-
<PAGE> 3
of such company was directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ multiplied by the
daily average percentage of capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ
in such company during the relevant period, all as determined using generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied ("GAAP"), other than
principles of consolidation. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Note
to the contrary, if, in connection with any MEDIQ Equity Offering, if the
fraction derived from the calculation described in clause (y) above is less
than 1/2, no mandatory prepayment shall be due. Any such mandatory prepayment
will be due five (5) business days after the Prepayment Offering Proceeds are
realized by the party entitled thereto. For purposes hereof, "Net Proceeds"
shall mean an amount equal to the cumulative gross proceeds resulting from any
and all Subsidiary Equity Offerings and MEDIQ Equity Offerings, from and after
the date hereof, minus (x) any underwriter's fees, discounts and commissions
and other reasonable and customary fees and expenses incurred in connection
with such offerings, (y) any success fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation
in connection with such offerings, but not to exceed one-half of one percent
(.5%) of the gross proceeds resulting from such offerings, and (z) any unpaid
portion of any closing fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation, but not to
exceed $75,000 in the aggregate. For purposes hereof, a "Subsidiary Equity
Offering" shall mean a primary or secondary offering and sale of Equity
Securities (as defined herein) of any of the Subsidiaries for cash. A "MEDIQ
Equity Offering" shall mean a primary offering and sale of Equity Securities of
MEDIQ for cash. For purposes hereof "Equity Securities" shall mean any (i)
capital stock or other equity interests, (ii) other right(s) with respect to
any such capital stock or other equity interests, (iii) offers, options (other
than employee stock options), obligations, warrants, rights, subscriptions,
agreements, claims of any character, or commitments of any kind (contingent or
otherwise) relating to the issuance, conversion, exchange, registration,
voting, sale or transfer of any such capital stock or equity interests, or (iv)
any debenture, bond, note or other instrument that may be converted into or
exchanged for any capital stock or other equity instrument. For purposes
hereof "Subsidiaries" or "Subsidiary" means Maker, MEDIQ/PRN Life Support
Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PRN"), PRN-I and/or any other entity
that is wholly or partially owned or controlled by Maker. For purposes hereof
an entity is "controlled by" another person or entity if such other person or
entity is in possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause
the direction of, the management and policies of the entity, whether by
ownership, contract or otherwise. For purposes hereof "pro-forma" revenues for
any entity means for any relevant period (a) the actual revenues of said entity
over the relevant period plus (b) the actual revenues during the relevant
period of any business acquired by the entity during the relevant period, as
accounted for in accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. As an
example and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the revenues of
PRN-I shall include the revenues of Payee from the Division (as defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement) for that portion of the relevant period that precedes
the effective time of the sale of the assets under the Asset Purchase
Agreement. Any prepayment required to be made under this paragraph and the
corresponding provisions of Holdings Note 2 and Holdings Note 3 (as hereinafter
defined) shall be applied first to Holdings Note 2 and Holdings Note 3 in
accordance with the terms of Holdings Note 2 and Holdings Note 3 before being
applied to this Note.

-3-
<PAGE> 4
The payment of this Note and the performance of Maker's obligations
hereunder is guaranteed by MEDIQ pursuant to the terms of that certain Guaranty
Agreement dated of even date herewith in favor of Payee (the "Guaranty").

The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event of
Default hereunder: (a) default in any payment by Maker hereunder when due or a
default in Maker's obligations to escrow any disputed offset amounts pursuant
to the terms of the Section 11.6 of the Asset Purchase Agreement and such
default continues uncured for five (5) days after the date any such payment or
escrow was due; provided, however, that if in any consecutive twelve (12) month
period Maker defaults two times in making payments when due hereunder and/or
timely making any required escrow deposits pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement, any such subsequent default shall immediately constitute an Event of
Default hereunder without the passage of any grace period; (b) any other
default occurs under this Note and such default remains uncured for thirty (30)
days after the delivery of notice from Payee to Maker; (c) default occurs under
the Guaranty; (d) any failure by PRN-I, Maker or MEDIQ as the case may be, to
perform and carry out, each and every of the respective agreements and
undertakings of such entities as set forth in that certain Negative Covenants
Agreement (so called herein) dated of even date herewith and entered into by
and among PRN-I, Maker, MEDIQ, KCI and Payee; (e) any failure by MEDIQ to
perform and carry out each and every of its agreements, covenants and
undertakings as set forth in that certain Collateral Transfer of Note (Security
Agreement) (so called herein) dated of even date herewith and executed by MEDIQ
in favor of Payee; (f) sale of all or substantially all of any of PRN-I's,
PRN's, Maker's or MEDIQ's assets, or any formal action in contemplation of the
dissolution, liquidation or termination of any of PRN-I's, PRN's, Maker's, or
MEDIQ's existence; (g) institution of any proceedings by or against any of
PRN-I, PRN, Maker or MEDIQ under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other form of debtor relief or any of PRN-I's, PRN's Maker's
or MEDIQ's making an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
appointment of a receiver, trustee, conservator or other judicial
representative for any of PRN-I, PRN, Maker or MEDIQ or any of PRN-I's, PRN's,
Maker's or MEDIQ's property, unless, in the case of any such proceeding or
appointment not instituted by any of PRN-I, PRN, Maker, or MEDIQ, such
proceeding or appointment is dismissed within sixty (60) days; (h) the
occurrence of any Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) without the prior
written consent of Payee; or (i) the failure of any Subsidiary to make any
payment when due under any indebtedness of any Subsidiary in excess of
$3,000,000.00 or the occurrence of any breach, default or event of default
under any such indebtedness that results in the acceleration of the maturity of
any such indebtedness.

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the unpaid principal
balance hereof, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall, at the
option of Payee, immediately become due and payable without presentment,
protest, demand, notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration,
notice of non-payment, notice of protest, or other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by Maker. If this Note is not paid at
maturity, however such maturity may be brought about, and the same is placed in
the hands of an attorney for collection, and/or if this Note is collected by
suit or through bankruptcy, or other legal proceedings, the

-4-
<PAGE> 5
Maker agrees to pay all reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other
expenses incurred by Payee in connection with such collection efforts.

Payee agrees that this Note is subject to the terms and provisions of
the Subordination and Standstill Agreement executed by and among Congress
Financial Corporation, Maker and Payee dated of even date herewith.

No failure or delay on the part of Payee to insist on strict
performance of Maker's obligations hereunder or to exercise any remedy shall
constitute a waiver of Payee's rights in that or any other instance. No waiver
of any of Payee's rights shall be effective unless in writing, and any waiver
of any default or any instance of non-compliance shall be limited to its
express terms and shall not extend to any other default or instance of
non-compliance.

Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be sent either by (a) personal delivery service with
charges therefor billed to shipper, (b) expedited delivery service with charges
therefor billed to shipper, (c) United States Mail, postage prepaid, registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, or (d) prepaid telegram or telex
(provided that the contents of such telegram or telex are confirmed by
expedited delivery service or by mail in the manner previously described)
addressed to Maker or Payee, as the case may be, at the address set forth in
the Asset Purchase Agreement, or at such other address as Maker or Payee may
have designated by notice to the other given as provided above. Any notice or
communication sent as hereinabove provided shall be deemed given (i) upon
receipt if sent by telegram or telex or if personally delivered (provided that
such delivery is confirmed by the courier delivery service), (ii) on the date
of deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and
custody of the United States Postal Service, if sent by United States Mail, or
(iii) on the date of delivery to any expedited delivery service.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the term
"Payee" shall mean the party so defined as Payee in the first paragraph of this
Note for so long as such party is the holder of this Note and, thereafter,
shall mean, at any time, the then holder of this Note.

Maker and any and all sureties, guarantors and endorsers of this Note
and all other parties now or hereafter liable hereon, severally waive grace,
demand, presentment for payment, protest, notice of any kind (including, but
not limited to, notice of dishonor, notice of protest, notice of intention to
accelerate and notice of acceleration) and diligence in collecting and bringing
suit against any party hereto and agree (i) to all extensions and partial
payments, with or without notice, before or after maturity, (ii) to any
substitution, exchange or release of any security now or hereafter given for
this Note, (iii) to the release of any party primarily or secondarily liable
hereon, and (iv) that it will not be necessary for Payee, in order to enforce
payment of this Note, to first institute or exhaust Payee's remedies against
Maker or any other party liable therefor or against any security for this Note.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or in
any other agreement entered into in connection herewith or securing the
indebtedness evidenced hereby, whether now

-5-
<PAGE> 6
existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, it is agreed that
the aggregate of all interest and any other charges constituting interest, or
adjudicated as constituting interest, and contracted for, chargeable or
receivable under this Note or otherwise in connection with the debt evidenced
hereby, shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest
permitted by applicable law. In the event the maturity of this Note is
accelerated by reason of an election by the holder hereof resulting from a
default hereunder or under any other document executed as security herefor or
in connection herewith, or by voluntary prepayment by Maker or otherwise, then
earned interest may never include more than the maximum rate of interest
permitted by applicable law. If from any circumstance any holder of this Note
shall ever receive interest or any other charges constituting interest, or
adjudicated as constituting interest, the amount, if any, of which would exceed
the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law (the "Excess
Interest"), then the Excess Interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
principal amount owing on this Note or on account of any other principal
indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note, and not to the payment of
interest. If the Excess Interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal
hereof and such other indebtedness, then that portion of the Excess Interest
which exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other
indebtedness shall be refunded to Maker. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to
the holder of this Note for the use, forbearance or detention of the
indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note shall be amortized, prorated,
allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until
payment in full so that the actual rate of interest on account of such
indebtedness is uniform throughout the term thereof.

Any provision hereof found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable for
any reason whatsoever shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability
of the remainder hereof.

This Note shall be binding upon Maker's successors and assigns and
shall inure to the benefit of Payee and its successors and permitted assigns;
provided that Payee may not transfer or assign this Note or any right or
interest herein to any person or entity without Maker's prior written consent.

Maker recognizes and acknowledges that contemporaneously herewith (i)
Maker has delivered to Payee that certain other Promissory Note ("Holdings Note
2") dated of even date herewith, being in the original principal amount of
$5,000,000 to Payee, (ii) Maker has delivered to Payee that certain other
Promissory Note ("Holdings Note 3"), dated of even date herewith, being in the
original principal amount of $3,000,000 to Payee, (iii) PRN has delivered to
Payee that certain Promissory Note ("Acquisition Note") in the original
principal amount of $5,835,707 and payable to the order of Payee and (iv) PRN-I
has delivered that certain Promissory Note ("$2,956,957 Note") dated of even
date herewith, in the original principal amount of $2,956,957 and being payable
to the order of Payee. Maker covenants and agrees that any Event of Default
under, or with respect to Holdings Note 2, Holdings Note 3, the Acquisition
Note, and/or the $2,956,957 Note, or under any other instruments relating
thereto, shall also constitute an Event of Default hereunder, entitling Payee
to pursue all rights, remedies and recourses available to it, including
acceleration of this Note and foreclosure of any liens securing repayment
hereof.

($2,956,957), together with interest from the date hereof on the principal
amount from time to time remaining unpaid, at the lesser of the rate of eight
percent (8%) per annum and the maximum rate of interest per annum permitted by
applicable law. All past due principal hereof and accrued unpaid interest
thereon shall bear interest from the maturity thereof until paid at the lesser
of the Default Rate (hereinafter defined) and the maximum rate of interest per
annum permitted by applicable law. Interest shall be calculated on the basis
of a 365 or 366 day calendar year, as the case may be.

As used in this Note, the following terms shall have the respective
meanings indicated below:

"Default Rate" shall mean the sum of the Prime Rate in effect from
day to day plus five percent (5%) per annum.

"Prime Rate" shall mean the rate of interest per annum established
from time to time by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association in
San Francisco, California ("BOA"), and designated as its reference rate of
interest, which may not necessarily be the lowest interest rate charged by BOA.
In the event that BOA does not announce a rate designated by it as its
reference lending rate, then the Prime Rate under this Note shall be deemed to
be the variable rate of interest per annum which is the general reference rate
designated by BOA as its "prime rate", "base rate" or other similar rate and
which Payee determines to be comparable to the Prime Rate as described above.
In the event that BOA shall cease to have any of the rates described in the
preceding sentence, then the Prime Rate shall be calculated using that variable
rate of interest per annum established by Nations Bank of Texas, N.A., San
Antonio, Texas, or such other financial institution satisfactory to Payee,
which institution may be chosen by Payee, or any subsequent holder hereof, in
its sole discretion and changed by Payee, or any subsequent holder hereof, in
its sole discretion exercised in good faith, from time to time, any such change
to become effective on the date of such change.

The principal amount hereof shall be repaid in equal monthly
installments of principal and interest of $310,748.17 with the first such
monthly installment being due and payable on December 31, 1994 and continuing
regularly and monthly on the last day of each successive calendar month
thereafter until September 30, 1995 (the "Maturity Date"), on which date the

<PAGE> 2
entire outstanding unpaid principal balance hereof, together with all accrued
and unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable.

Payments of principal and interest, shall be made in lawful money
of the United States of America by wire transfer of immediately available funds
or cash or bank cashier's check at 8023 Vantage Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78230
or at such other place as Payee shall designate to Maker in writing.

Payee expressly agrees that Maker shall be entitled to offset
against the last to mature portion of the indebtedness evidenced hereby, any
and all payments owed by Payee or any of its Affiliates (as defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement (hereinafter defined)) to Maker pursuant to Section
11.1 of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement")
dated August 23, 1994, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Asset Purchase
Agreement dated as of September 30, 1994, by and among MEDIQ Incorporated, a
Delaware corporation ("MEDIQ"), Maker, PRN Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings"),
Kinetic Concepts, Inc. ("KCI") and Payee.

Any check, draft, money order or other instrument given in payment
of all or any portion hereof may be accepted by Payee and handled in collection
in the customary manner, but the same shall not constitute payment hereunder or
diminish any rights of Payee except to the extent that actual cash proceeds of
such instrument are unconditionally received by Payee.

Maker may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time without
premium or penalty. All prepayments hereunder shall be applied first to
accrued but unpaid interest, then to discharge any expenses for which Payee may
be entitled to receive reimbursement under the terms of this Note, and lastly,
to installments of principal due hereunder in the inverse order of their
maturity. Subject to the subordination contained herein, Maker shall be
required to prepay this Note in whole or in part to the full extent of any
Prepayment Offering Proceeds (as hereinafter defined ) which may be realized
from time to time from any Subsidiary Equity Offering as defined herein) or any
MEDIQ Equity Offering (as hereinafter defined). For purposes hereof
"Prepayment Offering Proceeds" shall mean (i) with respect to a Subsidiary
Equity Offering, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds (as
hereinafter defined) equal to or less than $20,000,000 or (ii) with respect to
a MEDIQ Equity Offering, an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds equal to or less
than $20,000,000 by (y) a fraction having a numerator equal to the total pro
forma combined gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of the
Subsidiaries (as defined herein) on a consolidated basis and a denominator
equal to the sum of the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the
previous four (4) fiscal quarters of MEDIQ, plus, without duplication, (a) the
sum of the products derived by multiplying (i) the pro-forma unconsolidated
gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of each of the
Subsidiaries by (ii) the daily average percentage of capital stock directly or
indirectly owned by MEDIQ in the respective

-2-
<PAGE> 3
Subsidiary over the same period, plus (b) the sum of the products of the
pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal
quarters of each company in which, at any time during the relevant period,
twenty percent (20%) or more of the capital stock of such company was directly
or indirectly owned by MEDIQ multiplied by the daily average percentage of
capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ in such company during the
relevant period, all as determined using generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied ("GAAP"), other than principles of
consolidation. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Note to the
contrary, if, in connection with any MEDIQ Equity Offering, if the fraction
derived from the calculation described in clause (y) above is less than 1/2, no
mandatory prepayment shall be due. Any such mandatory prepayment will be due
five (5) business days after the Prepayment Offering Proceeds are realized by
the party entitled thereto. For purposes hereof, "Net Proceeds" shall mean an
amount equal to the cumulative gross proceeds resulting from any and all
Subsidiary Equity Offerings and MEDIQ Equity Offerings, from and after the date
hereof, minus (x) any underwriter's fees, discounts and commissions and other
reasonable and customary fees and expenses incurred in connection with such
offerings, (y) any success fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation in
connection with such offerings, but not to exceed one-half of one percent (.5%)

of any closing fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation, but not to exceed
$75,0000 in the aggregate. For purposes hereof, a "Subsidiary Equity Offering"
shall mean a primary or secondary offering and sale of Equity Securities (as
defined herein) of any of the Subsidiaries for cash. A "MEDIQ Equity Offering"

relating to the issuance, conversion, exchange, registration, voting, sale or
transfer of any such capital stock or equity interests, or (iv) any debenture,
bond, note or other instrument that may be converted into or exchanged for any
capital stock or other equity instrument. For purposes hereof "Subsidiaries"
or "Subsidiary" means Holdings, MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("PRN"), Maker, and/or any other entity that is wholly or
partially owned or controlled by Holdings. For purposes hereof an entity is
"controlled by" another person or entity if such other person or entity is in
possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction
of, the management and policies of the entity, whether by ownership, contract
or otherwise. For purposes hereof "pro-forma" revenues for any entity means
for any relevant period (a) the actual revenues of said entity over the
relevant period plus (b) the actual revenues during the relevant period of any

include the revenues of Payee from the Division (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement) for that portion of the relevant period that precedes the
effective time of the sale of the assets under the Asset

-3-
<PAGE> 4
Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
the mandatory prepayment provisions set forth herein are and shall at all times
be subordinate to the repayment of the Holdings Notes (each as hereinafter
defined) and Maker shall have no obligation to make any mandatory prepayments
to the extent, but only to the extent, that there remains any unpaid principal
and/or interest under the Holdings Notes at the time any Prepayment Offering
Proceeds are realized by the party entitled to such proceeds; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply in the event that at the time any
Prepayment Offering Proceeds are realized payment of the Holdings Notes is
prohibited or restricted.

The payment of this Note and the performance of Maker's
obligations hereunder is guaranteed by MEDIQ and Holdings pursuant to the terms
of two (2) certain Guaranty Agreements dated of even date herewith, in favor of
Payee and executed by MEDIQ and Holdings, respectively, (respectively, the
"MEDIQ Guaranty" and the "Holdings Guaranty").

The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event
of Default hereunder: (a) default in any payment by Maker hereunder when due or
a default in Maker's obligations to escrow any disputed offset amounts pursuant
to the terms of the Section 11.6 of the Asset Purchase Agreement and such
default continues uncured for five (5) days after the date any such payment or
escrow was due; provided, however, that if in any consecutive twelve (12) month
period Maker defaults two times in making payments when due hereunder and/or
timely making any required escrow deposits pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement, any such subsequent default shall immediately constitute an Event of
Default hereunder without the passage of any grace period; (b) any other

days after the delivery of notice from Payee to Maker; (c) default occurs under
the MEDIQ Guaranty or the Holdings Guaranty; (d) any failure by Maker,

existence; (g) institution of any proceedings by or against any of Maker,
Holdings, PRN or MEDIQ under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,

appointment of a receiver, trustee, conservator or other judicial
representative for any of Maker, Holdings, PRN or MEDIQ or any of Maker's,
Holdings', PRN's or MEDIQ's property, unless, in the case of any such
proceeding or appointment not instituted by any of Maker, Holdings, PRN or
MEDIQ, such proceeding or appointment is dismissed within sixty (60) days, (h)
the occurrence of any Change of Control (as hereinafter

-4-
<PAGE> 5
defined) without the prior written consent of Payee; or (i) the failure of any
Subsidiary to make any payment when due under any indebtedness of any
Subsidiary in excess of $3,000,000.00 or the occurrence of any breach, default
or event of default under any such indebtedness that results in the
acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness; or (j) if at any time
during the term of this Note the amount equal to the sum of the Tangible Equity
of MEDIQ plus the debt of MEDIQ, on an unconsolidated basis, that is
subordinate in right of payment to the MEDIQ Guaranty is less than $50,000,000
(for purposes of the foregoing the Tangible Equity (hereinafter defined) of
MEDIQ means an amount equal to the difference between the shareholders' equity
in MEDIQ and the goodwill (net of amortization) of MEDIQ other than goodwill
arising from the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, all
as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied).

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the unpaid principal
balance hereof, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall, at the
option of Payee, immediately become due and payable without presentment,
protest, demand, notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration,
notice of non-payment, notice of protest, or other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by Maker. If this Note is not paid at
maturity, however such maturity may be brought about, and the same is placed in
the hands of an attorney for collection, and/or if this Note is collected by
suit or through bankruptcy, probate, or other legal proceedings, the Maker
agrees to pay all reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses
incurred by Payee in connection with such collection efforts.

Payee agrees that this Note is subject to the terms and provisions
of the Subordination and Standstill Agreement executed by and among Congress
Financial Corporation, Maker and Payee dated of even date herewith.

No failure or delay on the part of Payee to insist on strict
performance of Maker's obligations hereunder or to exercise any remedy shall
constitute a waiver of Payee's rights in that or any other instance. No waiver
of any of Payee's rights shall be effective unless in writing, and any waiver
of any default or any instance of non- compliance shall be limited to its
express terms and shall not extend to any other default or instance of
non-compliance.

Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be sent either by (a) personal delivery service with
charges therefor billed to shipper, (b) expedited delivery service with charges
therefor billed to shipper, (c) United States Mail, postage prepaid, registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, or (d) prepaid telegram or telex
(provided that the contents of such telegram or telex are confirmed by
expedited delivery service or by mail in the manner previously described)
addressed to Maker or Payee, as the case may be, at the address set forth in
the Asset Purchase Agreement, or at such other address as Maker or Payee may
have designated by notice to the other given as provided above. Any notice or
communication sent as hereinabove provided shall be deemed given (i) upon
receipt if sent by telegram or telex or if personally delivered (provided that

-5-
<PAGE> 6
such delivery is confirmed by the courier delivery service), (ii) on the date
of deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and
custody of the United States Postal Service, if sent by United States Mail, or
(iii) on the date of delivery to any expedited delivery service.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
term "Payee" shall mean the party so defined as Payee in the first paragraph of
this Note for so long as such party is the holder of this Note and, thereafter,
shall mean, at any time, the then holder of this Note.

Maker and any and all sureties, guarantors and endorsers of this
Note and all other parties now or hereafter liable hereon, severally waive
grace, demand, presentment for payment, protest, notice of any kind (including,
but not limited to, notice of dishonor, notice of protest, notice of intention
to accelerate and notice of acceleration) and diligence in collecting and
bringing suit against any party hereto and agree (i) to all extensions and
partial payments, with or without notice, before or after maturity, (ii) to any
substitution, exchange or release of any security now or hereafter given for
this Note, (iii) to the release of any party primarily or secondarily liable
hereon, and (iv) that it will not be necessary for Payee, in order to enforce
payment of this Note, to first institute or exhaust Payee's remedies against
Maker or any other party liable therefor or against any security for this Note.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or
in any other agreement entered into in connection herewith or securing the
indebtedness evidenced hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising and
whether written or oral, it is agreed that the aggregate of all interest and
any other charges constituting interest, or adjudicated as constituting
interest, and contracted for, chargeable or receivable under this Note or
otherwise in connection with the debt evidenced hereby, shall under no
circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by applicable
law. In the event the maturity of this Note is accelerated by reason of an
election by the holder hereof resulting from a default hereunder or under any
other document executed as security herefor or in connection herewith, or by
voluntary prepayment by Maker or otherwise, then earned interest may never
include more than the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law. If
from any circumstance any holder of this Note shall ever receive interest or
any other charges constituting interest, or adjudicated as constituting
interest, the amount, if any, of which would exceed the maximum rate of
interest permitted by applicable law (the "Excess Interest"), then the Excess
Interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on
this Note or on account of any other principal indebtedness of Maker to the
holder of this Note, and not to the payment of interest. If the Excess
Interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other
indebtedness, then that portion of the Excess Interest which exceeds the unpaid
balance of principal hereof and such other indebtedness shall be refunded to
Maker. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holder of this Note for the
use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of Maker to the holder of
this Note shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the
full term of such

-6-
<PAGE> 7
indebtedness until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest on
account of such indebtedness is uniform throughout the term thereof.

Any provision hereof found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable
for any reason whatsoever shall not affect the validity, legality or
enforceability of the remainder hereof.

This Note shall be binding upon Maker's successors and assigns and
shall inure to the benefit of Payee and its successors and permitted assigns;
provided that Payee may not transfer or assign this Note or any right or
interest herein to any person or entity without Maker's prior written consent.

Maker recognizes and acknowledges that contemporaneously herewith
(i) Holdings has delivered those three (3) certain Promissory Notes
(collectively the "Holdings Notes"), each dated of even date herewith, one in
the original principal amount of $5,000,000.00, the second in the original

of $2,000,000.00, and each being payable to the order of Payee, and (ii) PRN
has delivered that certain Promissory Note (the "$5,835,707 Note") dated of
even date herewith, being in the original principal amount of $5,835,707 and

Default under or with respect to the $5,835,707 Note and/or any or all of the
Holdings Notes, or under any other instruments relating thereto, shall also
constitute an Event of Default hereunder, entitling Payee to pursue all rights,
remedies and recourses available to it, including, without limitation,
acceleration of this Note and foreclosure of any liens securing repayment
hereof.

This Note shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with,
and all issues relating to this Note or to the transaction which this Note
relates (including, without limitation, the validity and/or enforceability of
this Note or any portion of this Note) shall be governed by, the laws of the
State of Delaware (other than the conflict of law rules of the State of
Delaware), except as otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable
law and except to the extent that remedies provided by the laws of any state
other than Delaware are governed by the laws of said state.

March 31, 1996 (the "Interest Start Date"). All past due principal hereof and
accrued unpaid interest thereon shall bear interest from the maturity thereof
until paid at the lesser of the Default Rate (as hereinafter defined) and the
maximum rate of interest per annum permitted by applicable law. Prior to the
Interest Start Date no interest shall accrue on those portions of the
outstanding principal balance hereof which are not then past due. Interest

may be.

As used in this Note, the following terms shall have the respective

interest, which may not necessarily be the lowest interest rate charged by BOA.
In the event that BOA does not have a rate designated by it as its reference
rate, then the Prime Rate under this Note shall be deemed to be the variable
rate of interest per annum which is the rate designated by BOA as its "prime
rate", "base rate" or other similar rate and that Payee determines to be
comparable to the Prime Rate as described above. In the event that BOA shall
cease to announce any of the rates described in the preceding sentence, then
the Prime Rate shall be calculated using that variable rate of interest per
annum established by NationsBank of Texas, N.A., San Antonio, Texas, or such
other financial institution satisfactory to Payee, which institution may be

having a numerator equal to the total pro-forma combined gross revenues for the
previous four (4) fiscal quarters of the Subsidiaries (as defined herein) on a
consolidated basis and a denominator equal to the sum of the pro-forma
unconsolidated gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of

the Subordination and Standstill Agreement executed by and among Congress
Financial Corporation, Maker and Payee dated of even date herewith.

No failure or delay on the part of Payee to insist on strict
performance of Maker's obligations hereunder or to exercise any remedy shall
constitute a waiver of Payee's rights in that or any other instance. No waiver
of any of Payee's rights shall be effective unless in writing, and any waiver
of any default or any instance of non- compliance shall be limited to its
express terms and shall not extend to any other default or instance of
non-compliance.

Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be sent either by (a) personal delivery service with
charges therefor billed to shipper, (b) expedited delivery service with charges
therefor billed to shipper, (c) United States Mail, postage prepaid, registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, or (d) prepaid telegram or telex
(provided that the contents of such telegram or telex are confirmed by

addressed to Maker or Payee, as the case may be, at the address set forth in
the Asset Purchase Agreement, or at such other address as Maker or Payee may
have designated by notice to the other given as provided above. Any notice or
communication sent as hereinabove provided shall be deemed given (i) upon
receipt if sent by telegram or telex or if personally delivered (provided that

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the term

Maker and any and all sureties, guarantors and endorsers of this Note
and all other parties now or hereafter liable hereon, severally waive grace,

accelerate and notice of acceleration) and diligence in collecting and bringing
suit against any party hereto and agree (i) to all extensions and partial
payments, with or without notice, before or after maturity, (ii) to any
substitution, exchange or release of any security now or hereafter given for
this Note, (iii) to the release of any party primarily or secondarily liable
hereon, and (iv) that it will not be necessary for Payee, in order to enforce
payment of this Note, to first institute or exhaust Payee's remedies against
Maker or any other party liable therefor or against any security for this Note.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or in
any other agreement entered into in connection herewith or securing the
indebtedness evidenced hereby, whether now existing

-5-
<PAGE> 6
or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, it is agreed that the
aggregate of all interest and any other charges constituting interest, or
adjudicated as constituting interest, and contracted for, chargeable or
receivable under this Note or otherwise in connection with the debt evidenced
hereby, shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest
permitted by applicable law. In the event the maturity of this Note is
accelerated by reason of an election by the holder hereof resulting from a
default hereunder or under any other document executed as security herefor or
in connection herewith, or by voluntary prepayment by Maker or otherwise, then
earned interest may never include more than the maximum rate of interest
permitted by applicable law. If from any circumstance any holder of this Note
shall ever receive interest or any other charges constituting interest, or
adjudicated as constituting interest, the amount, if any, of which would exceed
the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law (the "Excess
Interest"), then the Excess Interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
principal amount owing on this Note or on account of any other principal
indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note, and not to the payment of
interest. If the Excess Interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal
hereof and such other indebtedness, then that portion of the Excess Interest
which exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other
indebtedness shall be refunded to Maker. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to
the holder of this Note for the use, forbearance or detention of the
indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note shall be amortized, prorated,
allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until
payment in full so that the actual rate of interest on account of such
indebtedness is uniform throughout the term thereof.

Any provision hereof found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable for
any reason whatsoever shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability
of the remainder hereof.

This Note shall be binding upon Maker's successors and assigns and
shall inure to the benefit of Payee and its successors and permitted assigns;
provided that Payee may not transfer or assign this Note or any right or
interest herein to any person or entity without Maker's prior written consent.

Maker recognizes and acknowledges that contemporaneously herewith (i)
Maker has delivered to Payee that certain other Promissory Note ("Holdings Note
2") dated of even date herewith, being in the original principal amount of
$5,000,000 to Payee, (ii) Maker has delivered to Payee that certain other

under, or with respect to Holdings Note 2, Holdings Note 3, the Acquisition
Note, and/or the $2,956,957 Note, or under any other instruments relating
thereto, shall also constitute an Event of Default hereunder, entitling Payee
to pursue all rights, remedies and recourses available to it, including
acceleration of this Note and foreclosure of any liens securing repayment
hereof.

EXHIBIT 99.4

PROMISSORY NOTE

$5,000,000 Pennsauken, New Jersey
September 30, 1994

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, PRN HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Maker"), hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the order of KCI
THERAPEUTIC SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Payee"), as hereinafter
provided, the principal amount of FIVE MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($5,000,000),
together with interest on the unpaid principal balance from time to time
outstanding at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum beginning on March 31,
1996 (the "Interest Start Date"). All past due principal hereof and accrued
unpaid interest thereon shall bear interest from the maturity thereof until
paid at the lesser of the Default Rate (as hereinafter defined) and the maximum
rate of interest per annum permitted by applicable law. Prior to the Interest
Start Date no interest shall accrue on those portions of the outstanding
principal balance hereof which are not then past due. Interest shall be
calculated on the basis of a 365 or 366 day calendar year, as the case may be.

As used in this Note, the following terms shall have the respective
meanings indicated below:

"Default Rate" shall mean the sum of the Prime Rate in effect from day
to day plus five percent (5%) per annum.

"Prime Rate" shall mean the rate of interest per annum established
from time to time by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association in
San Francisco, California ("BOA"), and designated as its reference rate of
interest, which may not necessarily be the lowest interest rate charged by BOA.
In the event that BOA does not have a rate designated by it as its reference
rate, then the Prime Rate under this Note shall be deemed to be the variable
rate of interest per annum which is the rate designated by BOA as its "prime
rate", "base rate" or other similar rate and that Payee determines to be
comparable to the Prime Rate as described above. In the event that BOA shall
cease to announce any of the rates described in the preceding sentence, then
the Prime Rate shall be calculated using that variable rate of interest per
annum established by NationsBank of Texas, N.A., San Antonio, Texas, or such
other financial institution satisfactory to Payee, which institution may be
chosen by Payee, in its sole discretion, and changed by Payee, in its sole
discretion exercised in good faith, from time to time, any such change to
become effective on the date of such change.

This Note shall be repaid as follows:

(a) Interest, calculated on a daily basis, shall be due
and payable quarterly in arrears commencing on the 30th day of
September, 1996, and thereafter continuing regularly and quarterly on
the last day of each December, March, June, and September until
September 30, 1999 (the "Maturity Date").
<PAGE> 2
(b) The outstanding principal balance hereof and any and
all accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable in
full on the Maturity Date or upon earlier maturity hereof, whether by
acceleration or otherwise.

Payments of principal and interest shall be made in lawful money of
the United States of America by wire transfer of immediately available funds or
cash or bank cashier's check at 8023 Vantage Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78230
or at such other place as Payee shall designate to Maker in writing.

Payee expressly agrees that Maker shall be entitled to offset against
the last to mature portion of the indebtedness evidenced hereby, any and all
payments owed by Payee or any of its Affiliates (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement (hereinafter defined)) to MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services-I,
Inc. ("PRN-I") pursuant to Section 11.1 of that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") dated August 23, 1994, as amended by
Amendment No. 1 to Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of September 30, 1994, by
and among MEDIQ Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("MEDIQ"), PRN-I, Maker,
Kinetic Concepts, Inc. ("KCI") and Payee.

Any check, draft, money order or other instrument given in payment of
all or any portion hereof may be accepted by Payee and handled in collection in
the customary manner, but the same shall not constitute payment hereunder or
diminish any rights of Payee except to the extent that actual cash proceeds of
such instrument are unconditionally received by Payee.

Maker may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time without
premium or penalty. All prepayments hereunder shall be applied first to accrued
but unpaid interest, then to discharge any expenses for which Payee may be
entitled to receive reimbursement under the terms of this Note, and, lastly, to
principal due hereunder. Maker shall be required to prepay this Note in whole
or in part to the full extent of any Prepayment Offering Proceeds (as defined
herein) which may be realized from time to time from any Subsidiary Equity
Offering (as hereinafter defined) or any MEDIQ Equity Offering (as hereinafter
defined). For purposes hereof, "Prepayment Offering Proceeds" shall mean (i)
with respect to a Subsidiary Equity Offering, an amount equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the Net Proceeds (as hereinafter defined) equal to or less than
$20,000,000, or (ii) with respect to a MEDIQ Equity Offering, an amount equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (x) an amount equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the Net Proceeds equal to or less than $20,000,000, by (y) a fraction
having a numerator equal to the total pro-forma combined gross revenues for the
previous four (4) fiscal quarters of the Subsidiaries (as defined herein) on a
consolidated basis and a denominator equal to the sum of the pro-forma
unconsolidated gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of
MEDIQ, plus, without duplication, (a) the sum of the products derived by
multiplying (i) the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the previous
four (4) fiscal quarters of each of the Subsidiaries by (ii) the daily average
percentage of capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ in the
respective Subsidiary over the same period, plus (b) the sum of the products of
the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal
quarters of each company in which, at any time during the relevant period,
twenty percent (20%) or more of the capital stock

-2-
<PAGE> 3
of such company was directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ multiplied by the
daily average percentage of capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ
in such company during the relevant period, all as determined using generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied ("GAAP"), other than
principles of consolidation. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Note
to the contrary, if, in connection with any MEDIQ Equity Offering, if the
fraction derived from the calculation described in clause (y) above is less
than 1/2, no mandatory prepayment shall be due. Any such mandatory prepayment
will be due five (5) business days after the Prepayment Offering Proceeds are
realized by the party entitled thereto. For purposes hereof, "Net Proceeds"
shall mean an amount equal to the cumulative gross proceeds resulting from any
and all Subsidiary Equity Offerings and MEDIQ Equity Offerings, from and after
the date hereof, minus (x) any underwriter's fees, discounts and commissions
and other reasonable and customary fees and expenses incurred in connection
with such offerings, (y) any success fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation
in connection with such offerings, but not to exceed one-half of one percent
(.5%) of the gross proceeds resulting from such offerings, and (z) any unpaid
portion of any closing fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation, but not to
exceed $75,000 in the aggregate. For purposes hereof, a "Subsidiary Equity
Offering" shall mean a primary or secondary offering and sale of Equity
Securities (as defined herein) of any of the Subsidiaries for cash. A "MEDIQ
Equity Offering" shall mean a primary offering and sale of Equity Securities of
MEDIQ for cash. For purposes hereof "Equity Securities" shall mean any (i)
capital stock or other equity interests, (ii) other right(s) with respect to
any such capital stock or other equity interests, (iii) offers, options (other
than employee stock options), obligations, warrants, rights, subscriptions,
agreements, claims of any character, or commitments of any kind (contingent or
otherwise) relating to the issuance, conversion, exchange, registration,
voting, sale or transfer of any such capital stock or equity interests, or (iv)
any debenture, bond, note or other instrument that may be converted into or
exchanged for any capital stock or other equity instrument. For purposes
hereof "Subsidiaries" or "Subsidiary" means Maker, MEDIQ/PRN Life Support
Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PRN"), PRN-I and/or any other entity
that is wholly or partially owned or controlled by Maker. For purposes hereof
an entity is "controlled by" another person or entity if such other person or
entity is in possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause
the direction of, the management and policies of the entity, whether by
ownership, contract or otherwise. For purposes hereof "pro-forma" revenues for
any entity means for any relevant period (a) the actual revenues of said entity
over the relevant period plus (b) the actual revenues during the relevant
period of any business acquired by the entity during the relevant period, as
accounted for in accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. As an
example and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the revenues of
PRN-I shall include the revenues of Payee from the Division (as defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement) for that portion of the relevant period that precedes
the effective time of the sale of the assets under the Asset Purchase
Agreement.

The payment of this Note and the performance of Maker's obligations
hereunder is guaranteed by MEDIQ pursuant to the terms of that certain Guaranty

default in Maker's obligations to escrow any disputed offset amounts pursuant
to the terms of the Section 11.6 of the Asset Purchase Agreement and such
default continues uncured for five (5) days after the date any such payment or
escrow was due; provided, however, that if in any consecutive twelve (12) month
period Maker defaults two times in making payments when due hereunder and/or
timely making any required escrow deposits pursuant to the Asset Purchase

days after the delivery of notice from Payee to Maker; (c) default occurs under
the Guaranty; (d) any failure by PRN-I, Maker or MEDIQ as the case may be, to

any such indebtedness.

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the unpaid principal
balance hereof, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall, at the
option of Payee, immediately become due and payable without presentment,
protest, demand, notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration,

Maker or any other party liable therefor or against any security for this Note.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or in
any other agreement entered into in connection herewith or securing the
indebtedness evidenced hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising and
whether written or oral, it is agreed that the aggregate of all interest and
any other charges constituting interest, or adjudicated as constituting
interest, and contracted for, chargeable or receivable under this Note or
otherwise in connection with the debt

-5-
<PAGE> 6
evidenced hereby, shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of
interest permitted by applicable law. In the event the maturity of this Note
is accelerated by reason of an election by the holder hereof resulting from a
default hereunder or under any other document executed as security herefor or
in connection herewith, or by voluntary prepayment by Maker or otherwise, then
earned interest may never include more than the maximum rate of interest
permitted by applicable law. If from any circumstance any holder of this Note
shall ever receive interest or any other charges constituting interest, or
adjudicated as constituting interest, the amount, if any, of which would exceed
the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law (the "Excess
Interest"), then the Excess Interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
principal amount owing on this Note or on account of any other principal
indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note, and not to the payment of
interest. If the Excess Interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal
hereof and such other indebtedness, then that portion of the Excess Interest
which exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other
indebtedness shall be refunded to Maker. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to
the holder of this Note for the use, forbearance or detention of the
indebtedness of Maker to the holder of this Note shall be amortized, prorated,
allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until
payment in full so that the actual rate of interest on account of such
indebtedness is uniform throughout the term thereof.

Any provision hereof found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable for
any reason whatsoever shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability
of the remainder hereof.

This Note shall be binding upon Maker's successors and assigns and
shall inure to the benefit of Payee and its successors and permitted assigns;
provided that Payee may not transfer or assign this Note or any right or
interest herein to any person or entity without Maker's prior written consent.

Maker recognizes and acknowledges that contemporaneously herewith (i)
Maker has delivered to Payee that certain other Promissory Note ("Holdings Note
2") dated of even date herewith, being in the original principal amount of
$3,000,000 to Payee, (ii) Maker has delivered to Payee that certain other
Promissory Note ("Holdings Note 3"), dated of even date herewith, being in the
original principal amount of $2,000,000 to Payee, (iii) PRN has delivered to
Payee that certain Promissory Note ("Acquisition Note") in the original
principal amount of $5,835,707 and payable to the order of Payee and (iv) PRN-I
has delivered that certain Promissory Note ("$2,956,957 Note") dated of even
date herewith, in the original principal amount of $2,956,957 and being payable
to the order of Payee. Maker covenants and agrees that any Event of Default
under, or with respect to Holdings Note 2, Holdings Note 3, the Acquisition
Note, and/or the $2,956,957 Note, or under any other instruments relating
thereto, shall also constitute an Event of Default hereunder, entitling Payee
to pursue all rights, remedies and recourses available to it, including
acceleration of this Note and foreclosure of any liens securing repayment
hereof.

This Note shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with, and
all issues relating to this Note or to the transaction which this Note relates
(including, without limitation, the

PROMISSORY NOTE

$5,835,707.00 Pennsauken, New Jersey
September 30, 1994

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, MEDIQ/PRN LIFE SUPPORT SERVICES, INC., a
Delaware corporation ("Maker"), hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the
order of KCI THERAPEUTIC SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Payee"), in
installments as hereinafter provided, the principal amount of FIVE MILLION
EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN AND NO/100 DOLLARS
($5,835,707). All past due principal hereof shall bear interest from the
maturity thereof until paid at the lesser of the Default Rate (hereinafter
defined) and the maximum rate of interest per annum permitted by applicable
law.

As used in this Note, the following terms shall have the
respective meanings indicated below:

"Default Rate" shall mean the sum of the Prime Rate in effect from
day to day plus five percent (5%) per annum.

"Prime Rate" shall mean the rate of interest per annum established
from time to time by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association in
San Francisco, California ("BOA"), and designated as its reference lending rate
of interest, which may not necessarily be the lowest interest rate charged by
BOA. In the event that BOA does not announce a rate designated by it as its
reference rate, then the Prime Rate under this Note shall be deemed to be the
variable rate of interest per annum which is the general reference rate
designated by BOA as its "prime rate", "base rate" or other similar rate and
which Payee or any subsequent holder hereof determines to be comparable to the
Prime Rate as described above. In the event that BOA shall cease to have any of
the rates described in the preceding sentence, then the Prime Rate shall be
calculated using that variable rate of interest per annum established by
NationsBank of Texas, N.A., San Antonio, Texas, or such other financial
institution satisfactory to Payee, which institution may be chosen by Payee, or
any subsequent holder hereof, in its sole discretion and changed by Payee, or
any subsequent holder hereof, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith,
from time to time, any such change to become effective on the date of such
change.

The principal amount hereof shall be repaid in ten (10) equal
monthly installments of $583,570.70, with the first such monthly installment
being due and payable on December 31, 1994 and continuing regularly and monthly
thereafter on the last day of each successive calendar month until September
30, 1995 (the "Maturity Date") on which date the entire outstanding unpaid
principal balance and interest hereof shall be due and payable.

Payments of principal and interest, if applicable, shall be made
in lawful money of the United States of America by wire transfer of immediately
available funds or cash or bank
<PAGE> 2
cashier's check at 8023 Vantage Drive, San Antonio, Texas 78230 or at such
other place as Payee shall designate to Maker in writing.

Payee expressly agrees that Maker shall be entitled to offset
against the last to mature portion of the indebtedness evidenced hereby, any
and all payments owed by Payee or any of its Affiliates (as defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement (hereinafter defined)) to MEDIQ/PRN Life Support
Services-I, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PRN-I") pursuant to Section 11.1 of
that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") dated
August 23, 1994, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Asset Purchase Agreement
dated as of September 30, 1994, by and among MEDIQ Incorporated, a Delaware
corporation ("MEDIQ"), PRN-I, PRN Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings") (Maker, MEDIQ,
Holdings, and PRN-I are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "MEDIQ
Group"), Kinetic Concepts, Inc. ("KCI") and Payee.

Any check, draft, money order or other instrument given in payment
of all or any portion hereof may be accepted by Payee and handled in collection
in the customary manner, but the same shall not constitute payment hereunder or
diminish any rights of Payee except to the extent that actual cash proceeds of
such instrument are unconditionally received by Payee.

Maker may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time without
premium or penalty. All prepayments hereunder shall be applied first to accrued
but unpaid interest, then to discharge any expenses for which Payee may be
entitled to receive reimbursement under the terms of this Note, and lastly, to
installments of principal due hereunder in the inverse order of their maturity.
Subject to the subordination contained herein, Maker shall be required to
prepay this Note in whole or in part to the full extent of any Prepayment
Offering Proceeds (as defined herein) which may be realized from time to time
from any Subsidiary Equity Offering (as hereinafter defined) or any MEDIQ
Equity Offering (as hereinafter defined). For purposes hereof "Prepayment
Offering Proceeds" shall mean (i) with respect to a Subsidiary Equity Offering,
an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds (as hereinafter
defined) equal to or less than $20,000,000, or (ii) with respect to a MEDIQ
Equity Offering, an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) an
amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net Proceeds equal to or less than
$20,000,000, by (y) a fraction having a numerator equal to the total pro- forma
combined gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of the
Subsidiaries (as defined herein) on a consolidated basis and a denominator
equal to the sum of the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues for the
previous four (4) fiscal quarters of MEDIQ, plus, without duplication, (a) the
sum of the products derived by multiplying (i) the pro-forma unconsolidated
gross revenues for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of each of the
Subsidiaries by (ii) the daily average percentage of capital stock directly or
indirectly owned by MEDIQ in the respective Subsidiary over the same period,
plus (b) the sum of the products of the pro-forma unconsolidated gross revenues
for the previous four (4) fiscal quarters of each company in which, at any time
during the relevant period, twenty percent (20%) or more of the capital stock
of such company was directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ multiplied by the
daily average percentage of capital stock directly or indirectly owned by MEDIQ
in such company during the relevant period, all as determined using generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied ("GAAP"), other than
principles of consolidation. Notwithstanding anything contained

-2-
<PAGE> 3
in this Note to the contrary, in connection with any MEDIQ Equity Offering, if
the fraction derived from the calculation described in clause (y) above is less
than 1/2, no mandatory prepayment shall be due. Any such mandatory prepayment
will be due five (5) business days after the Prepayment Offering Proceeds are
realized by the party entitled thereto. For purposes hereof, "Net Proceeds"
shall mean an amount equal to the cumulative gross proceeds resulting from any
and all Subsidiary Equity Offerings and MEDIQ Equity Offerings, from and after
the date hereof, minus (x) any underwriter's fees, discounts and commissions
and other reasonable and customary fees and expenses incurred in connection
with such offerings, (y) any success fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation
in connection with such offerings, but not to exceed one-half of one percent
(.5%) of the gross proceeds resulting from such offerings, and (z) any unpaid
portion of any closing fee paid to Congress Financial Corporation, but not to
exceed $75,000 in the aggregate. For purposes hereof, a "Subsidiary Equity
Offering" shall mean a primary or secondary offering and sale of Equity
Securities (as defined herein) of any of the Subsidiaries for cash. A "MEDIQ
Equity Offering" shall mean a primary offering and sale of Equity Securities
of MEDIQ for cash. For purposes hereof "Equity Securities" shall mean any (i)
capital stock or other equity interests, (ii) other right(s) with respect to
any such capital stock or other equity interests, (iii) offers, options (other
than employee stock options), obligations, warrants, rights, subscriptions,
agreements, claims of any character, or commitments of any kind (contingent or
otherwise) relating to the issuance, conversion, exchange, registration,
voting, sale or transfer of any such capital stock or equity interests, or (iv)
any debenture, bond, note or other instrument that may be converted into or
exchanged for any capital stock or other equity instrument. For purposes
hereof "Subsidiaries" or "Subsidiary" means Holdings, PRN-I, Maker, and/or any
other entity that is wholly or partially owned or controlled by Holdings. For
purposes hereof an entity is "controlled by" another person or entity if such
other person or entity is in possession, direct or indirect, of the power to
direct or cause the direction of, the management and policies of the entity,
whether by ownership, contract or otherwise. For purposes hereof "pro-forma"
revenues for any entity means for any relevant period (a) the actual revenues
of said entity over the relevant period plus (b) the actual revenues during the
relevant period of any business acquired by the entity during the relevant
period, as accounted for in accordance with GAAP and Regulation S-X promulgated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. As
an example and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the revenues
of Maker shall include the revenues of Payee from the Division (as defined in
the Asset Purchase Agreement) for that portion of the relevant period that
precedes the effective time of the sale of the assets under the Asset Purchase
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
mandatory prepayment provisions set forth herein are and shall at all times be
subordinate to the repayment of the Holdings Notes and the $2,956,957 Note
(each as hereinafter defined) and Maker shall have no obligation to make any
mandatory prepayments to the extent, but only to the extent, that there remains
any unpaid principal and/or interest under the Holdings Notes or the $2,956,957
Note at the time any Prepayment Offering Proceeds are realized by the party
entitled to such proceeds; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
apply with respect to the Holdings Notes in the event that at the time any
Prepayment Offering Proceeds are realized payment of the Holdings Notes is
prohibited or restricted.

-3-

The payment of this Note and the performance of Maker's
obligations hereunder is guaranteed by MEDIQ and Holdings pursuant to the terms
of those two (2) certain Guaranty Agreements dated of even date herewith,
being in favor of Payee and executed by MEDIQ and Holdings, respectively
(respectively, the "MEDIQ Guaranty" and the "Holdings Guaranty").

The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an Event
of Default hereunder: (a) default in any payment by Maker hereunder when due or
a default by any member of the MEDIQ Group of its respective obligations to
escrow any disputed offset amounts pursuant to the terms of the Section 11.6 of
the Asset Purchase Agreement and such default continues uncured for five (5)
days after the date any such payment or escrow was due; provided, however, that
if in any consecutive twelve (12) month period Maker defaults two times in
making payments when due hereunder and/or any member or members of the MEDIQ
Group defaults two times in making any required escrow deposits pursuant to the
Asset Purchase Agreement, any such subsequent default shall immediately
constitute an Event of Default hereunder without the passage of any grace
period; (b) any other default occurs under this Note and such default remains
uncured for thirty (30) days after the delivery of notice from Payee to Maker;
(c) default occurs under the MEDIQ Guaranty and/or the Holdings Guaranty; (d)

carry out each and every of its agreements, covenants and undertakings as set
forth in that certain Collateral Transfer of Note (Security Agreement) (so
called herein) dated of even date herewith and executed by MEDIQ in favor of
Payee; (f) sale of all or substantially all of any of Maker's, Holdings',
PRN-I's or MEDIQ's assets, or any formal action in contemplation of the
dissolution, liquidation or termination of any of Maker's, Holdings', PRN-I's

Maker, Holdings, PRN-I or MEDIQ under any law relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other form of debtor relief or any of Maker's,
Holdings', PRN-I's or MEDIQ's making an assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, conservator or other
judicial representative for any of Maker, Holdings, PRN-I or MEDIQ or any of
Maker's, Holdings', PRN-I's or MEDIQ's property, unless, in the case of any
such proceeding or appointment not instituted by any of Maker, Holdings, PRN-I
or MEDIQ, such proceeding or appointment is dismissed within sixty (60) days;
(h) the occurrence of any Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) without
the prior written consent of Payee; (i) the failure of any Subsidiary to make
any payment when due under any indebtedness of any Subsidiary in excess of
$3,000,000.00 or the occurrence of any breach, default or event of default
under any such indebtedness that results in the acceleration of the maturity of
any such indebtedness; or (j) if at any time during the term of this Note the
amount equal to the sum of the Tangible Equity (hereinafter defined) of MEDIQ
plus the debt of MEDIQ, on an unconsolidated basis, that is subordinate in
right of payment to the MEDIQ Guaranty is less than $50,000,000 (for purposes
of the foregoing the Tangible Equity of MEDIQ means an amount equal to the
difference between the shareholders' equity in MEDIQ and the goodwill (net of
amortization) of MEDIQ other than goodwill arising from the transactions
contemplated by the Asset Purchase

-4-
<PAGE> 5
Agreement, all as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied).

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the unpaid principal
balance hereof, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall, at the
option of Payee, immediately become due and payable without presentment,
protest, demand, notice of intention to accelerate, notice of acceleration,
notice of non-payment, notice of protest, or other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by Maker. If this Note is not paid at
maturity, however such maturity may be brought about, and the same is placed in
the hands of an attorney for collection, and/or if this Note is collected by
suit or through bankruptcy, probate, or other legal proceedings, the Maker
agrees to pay all reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses
incurred by Payee in connection with such collection efforts.

Payee agrees that this Note is subject to the terms and provisions
of the Standstill Agreement executed by and among Congress Financial
Corporation, Maker and Payee dated of even date herewith.

No failure or delay on the part of Payee to insist on strict
performance of Maker's obligations hereunder or to exercise any remedy shall
constitute a waiver of Payee's rights in that or any other instance. No waiver
of any of Payee's rights shall be effective unless in writing, and any waiver
of any default or any instance of non-compliance shall be limited to its
express terms and shall not extend to any other default or instance of

Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be sent either by (a) personal delivery service with
charges therefor billed to shipper, (b) expedited delivery service with charges
therefor billed to shipper, (c) United States Mail, postage prepaid, registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, or (d) prepaid telegram or telex
(provided that the contents of such telegram or telex are confirmed by
expedited delivery service or by mail in the manner previously described)
addressed to Maker or Payee, as the case may be, at the address set forth in
the Asset Purchase Agreement, or at such other address as Maker or Payee may
have designated by notice to the other given as provided above. Any notice or
communication sent as hereinabove provided shall be deemed given (i) upon
receipt if sent by telegram or telex or if personally delivered (provided that
such delivery is confirmed by the courier delivery service), (ii) on the date
of deposit in a post office or other official depository under the care and
custody of the United States Postal Service, if sent by United States Mail, or
(iii) on the date of delivery to any expedited delivery service.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
term "Payee" shall mean the party so defined as Payee in the first paragraph of
this Note for so long as such party is the holder of this Note and, thereafter,
shall mean, at any time, the then holder of this Note.

Maker and any and all sureties, guarantors and endorsers of this
Note and all other parties now or hereafter liable hereon, severally waive
grace, demand, presentment for payment, protest, notice of any kind (including,
but not limited to, notice of dishonor, notice of protest,

-5-
<PAGE> 6
notice of intention to accelerate and notice of acceleration) and diligence in
collecting and bringing suit against any party hereto and agree (i) to all
extensions and partial payments, with or without notice, before or after
maturity, (ii) to any substitution, exchange or release of any security now or
hereafter given for this Note, (iii) to the release of any party primarily or
secondarily liable hereon, and (iv) that it will not be necessary for Payee, in
order to enforce payment of this Note, to first institute or exhaust Payee's
remedies against Maker or any other party liable therefor or against any
security for this Note.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or
in any other agreement entered into in connection herewith or securing the
indebtedness evidenced hereby, whether now existing or hereafter arising and
whether written or oral, it is agreed that the aggregate of all interest and
any other charges constituting interest, or adjudicated as constituting
interest, and contracted for, chargeable or receivable under this Note or
otherwise in connection with the debt evidenced hereby, shall under no
circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by applicable
law. In the event the maturity of this Note is accelerated by reason of an
election by the holder hereof resulting from a default hereunder or under any
other document executed as security herefor or in connection herewith, or by
voluntary prepayment by Maker or otherwise, then earned interest may never
include more than the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law. If
from any circumstance any holder of this Note shall ever receive interest or
any other charges constituting interest, or adjudicated as constituting
interest, the amount, if any, of which would exceed the maximum rate of
interest permitted by applicable law (the "Excess Interest"), then the Excess
Interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on
this Note or on account of any other principal indebtedness of Maker to the
holder of this Note, and not to the payment of interest. If the Excess
Interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal hereof and such other
indebtedness, then that portion of the Excess Interest which exceeds the unpaid
balance of principal hereof and such other indebtedness shall be refunded to
Maker. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holder of this Note for the
use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness of Maker to the holder of
this Note shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the
full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the actual rate of
interest on account of such indebtedness is uniform throughout the term
thereof.

Any provision hereof found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable
for any reason whatsoever shall not affect the validity, legality or
enforceability of the remainder hereof.

This Note shall be binding upon Maker's successors and assigns and
shall inure to the benefit of Payee and its successors and permitted assigns;
provided that Payee may not transfer or assign this Note or any right or
interest herein to any person or entity without Maker's prior written consent.

Maker recognizes and acknowledges that contemporaneously herewith
(i) Holdings has delivered those three (3) certain Promissory Notes
(collectively the "Holdings Notes"), each dated of even date herewith, one in
the original principal amount of $5,000,000.00, the second in the original

delivered that certain Promissory Note (the "$2,956,957 Note") dated of even
date herewith, being in the original principal amount of $2,956,957 and payable

under or with respect to the $2,956,957 Note and/or any or all of the Holdings
Notes, or under any other instruments relating thereto, shall also constitute
an Event of Default hereunder, entitling Payee to pursue all rights, remedies
and recourses available to it, including, without limitation, acceleration of
this Note and foreclosure of any liens securing repayment hereof.

This Note shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with,
and all issues relating to this Note or to the transaction which this Note
relates (including, without limitation, the validity and/or enforceability of
this Note or any portion of this Note) shall be governed by, the laws of the
State of Delaware (other than the conflict of law rules of the State of
Delaware), except as otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable
law and except to the extent that remedies provided by the laws of any state
other than Delaware are governed by the laws of said state.

on demand and without presentment, protest, notice of
acceptance of this Guaranty, protest, further notice of
nonpayment or of dishonor or of default or nonperformance, or
notice of acceleration or of intent to accelerate, or any
other notice whatsoever, make payment in respect of or fully
perform, as the case may be, the Guaranteed Obligations.
Further, it shall not be necessary for KCIT, in order to
enforce such payment by Guarantor, first to institute suit or
pursue or exhaust any rights or remedies against Borrower, PRN
or others liable on such indebtedness, or to enforce any
rights against any security that shall ever have been given to
secure such indebtedness, or to join Borrower, PRN or any
others liable for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or
any part thereof in any action to enforce this Guaranty, or to
resort to any other means of obtaining payment or performance
of the Guaranteed Obligations.

(c) Suit may be brought or demand may be made against all parties
who have signed this Guaranty or any other guaranty covering
all or any part of the Guaranteed

-2-
<PAGE> 3
Obligations, or against any one or more of them, separately or
together, without impairing the rights of KCIT against any
party hereto. At any time that KCIT is entitled to exercise
its rights or remedies hereunder, it may in its discretion
elect to demand payment.

3. CERTAIN AGREEMENTS AND WAIVERS BY GUARANTOR.

(a) Guarantor hereby agrees that neither KCIT's rights or remedies
nor Guarantor's obligations under the terms of this Guaranty

to exist in connection with any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations;

(iv) whether express or by operation of law, any
partial release of the liability of Guarantor

any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, any
complete or partial release of any one or more of
such guarantors under any such other guaranty, or
any complete or partial release of Borrower, PRN

-3-
<PAGE> 4
(vi) either with or without notice to or consent of
Guarantor: any renewal, extension, modification
or rearrangement of the terms of any or all of
the Guaranteed Obligations (including the
Guaranteed Notes), including, without limitation,
material alterations of the terms of payment
(including changes in maturity date(s) and
interest rate(s)) or performance or any other
terms thereof, or any waiver, termination, or
release of, or consent to departure from, the
Guaranteed Notes or any other guaranty of any or
all of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any
adjustment, indulgence, forbearance, or
compromise that may be granted from time to time
by KCIT to Borrower, PRN, Guarantor, and/or any
other party at any time liable for the payment of
any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations;

(vii) any neglect, lack of diligence, delay, omission,
failure, or refusal of KCIT to (a) take or
prosecute (or in taking or prosecuting) any
action for the collection or enforcement of any
of the Guaranteed Obligations, or (b) foreclose
or take or prosecute any action to foreclose (or
in foreclosing or taking or prosecuting any
action to foreclose) upon any security therefor,
or (c) exercise (or in exercising) any other
right or power with respect to any security
therefor, or (d) take or prosecute (or in taking
or prosecuting) any action in connection with any
document relating to the Guaranteed Obligations,

(viii) any failure to sell or otherwise dispose of in a
commercially reasonable manner any collateral

Obligations.

(ix) any failure of KCIT to notify Guarantor of any
creation, renewal, extension, rearrangement,
modification, supplement, or assignment of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or of
the Guaranteed Notes, or of any release of or
change in any security or of any other action
taken or refrained from being taken by KCIT
against Borrower, PRN or any security, it being
understood that KCIT shall not be required to
give Guarantor any notice of any kind under any
circumstances with respect to or in connection
with the Guaranteed Obligations, and any and all
rights to notice that Guarantor may have
otherwise had being hereby waived by Guarantor;

(x) KCIT being required to refund any payment by
Borrower to Borrower or by PRN to PRN, as the
case may be, or any other party liable for the
payment of any or all of the Guaranteed
Obligations;

-4-
<PAGE> 5
(xi) the existence of any claim, set-off, or other
right that Guarantor may at any time have against
Borrower or PRN whether or not arising in
connection with this Guaranty or the Guaranteed
Notes (provided, that nothing contained herein
shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by
separate suit or compulsory counterclaim); or

(xii) the unenforceability of all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations against Borrower or PRN,
whether because the Guaranteed Obligations exceed
the amount permitted by law or violate any usury
law, or because the act of creating the
Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, is
ultra vires, or because the officers or persons
creating same acted in excess of their authority,
or because of a lack of validity or
enforceability of or defect or deficiency in the
Guaranteed Notes, or because of the subordination
of, or moratorium on, payments due and owing
under the Guaranteed Notes at such times as the
same would otherwise become due and owing under
the Guaranteed Notes but for such subordination
or moratorium, regardless of the party or
parties, including, without limitation, Congress
Financial Corporation, intended to be benefited
by such subordination or moratorium or because
Borrower's or PRN's obligation ceases to exist by
operation of law, or because of any other reason
or circumstance, it being agreed that Guarantor
shall remain liable hereon regardless of whether
Borrower, PRN or any other person be found not
liable on the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part
thereof, for any reason (and regardless of any
joinder of Borrower, PRN or any other party in
any action to obtain payment of any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations); provided, however, that
if any part of the Guaranteed Obligations is not
enforceable against Borrower or PRN, as the case
may be, because of the proper exercise of any
right of set-off against the Guaranteed Notes
pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition
Agreement, that such part of the Guaranteed
Obligations shall not be enforceable against
Guarantor.

(b) In the event any payment by Borrower, PRN or any other party
to KCIT is held to constitute a preference, fraudulent
transfer or other voidable payment under any bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar law, or if for any other reason KCIT is
required to refund such payment or pay the amount thereof to
any other party, such payment by Borrower, PRN or any other
party to KCIT shall not constitute a release of Guarantor from
any liability hereunder, and this Guaranty shall continue to
be effective or shall be reinstated (notwithstanding any prior
release or discharge by KCIT of this Guaranty or of
Guarantor), as the case may be, with respect to, and this
Guaranty shall apply to, any and all amounts so refunded by
KCIT or paid by KCIT to another party, together with any
interest paid by KCIT and any attorneys' fees, costs and
expenses paid or incurred by KCIT in

-5-
<PAGE> 6
connection with any such event (all of which amounts shall
constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations). It is the
intent of Guarantor and KCIT that the obligations and
liabilities of Guarantor hereunder are absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and that until
the Guaranteed Obligations are fully and finally paid, and not
subject to refund or disgorgement, the obligations and
liabilities of Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or
released, in whole or in part, by any act or occurrence that
might, but for the provisions of this Guaranty, be deemed a
legal or equitable discharge or release of a guarantor. KCIT
shall be entitled to continue to hold this Guaranty in its
possession for a period of one year from the date the
Guaranteed Obligations are paid and performed in full and for
so long thereafter as may be necessary to enforce any
obligation of Guarantor hereunder and/or to exercise any right
or remedy of KCIT hereunder.

(c) If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable
by Borrower and/or PRN under the Guaranteed Notes is stayed or
delayed by any law or tribunal, all such amounts shall
nonetheless be payable by Guarantor on demand by KCIT.

4. OTHER LIABILITY. If Guarantor becomes liable for any indebtedness
owing by Borrower or PRN to KCIT other than under this Guaranty, such
liability shall not be in any manner impaired or affected hereby, and
the rights of KCIT hereunder shall be cumulative of any and all other
rights that KCIT may have against Guarantor. If Borrower or PRN is or
becomes indebted to KCIT for any indebtedness other than or in excess
of the Indebtedness for which Guarantor is liable under this Guaranty,
any payment received or recovery realized upon any indebtedness of
Borrower or PRN to KCIT may, except to the extent paid by Guarantor on
the Indebtedness for which Guarantor is liable under this Guaranty or
specifically required by law or agreement of KCIT to be applied to the
Indebtedness for which Guarantor is liable under this Guaranty, in
KCIT's sole discretion, be applied upon indebtedness of Borrower or
PRN to KCIT other than the Indebtedness for which Guarantor is liable
under this Guaranty.

5. KCIT ASSIGNS. This Guaranty is for the benefit of KCIT and KCIT's
successors and assigns, and in the event of a permitted assignment of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, the rights and
benefits hereunder, to the extent applicable to the Guaranteed
Obligations so assigned, may be transferred with such Guaranteed
Obligations. Guarantor waives notice of any transfer or assignment of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, and agrees that
failure to give notice will not affect the liabilities of Guarantor
hereunder.

6. BINDING EFFECT. This Guaranty is binding not only on Guarantor, but
also on Guarantor's successors and assigns. Words importing persons
herein shall include firms, associations, partnerships (including
limited partnerships), joint ventures, trusts,

-6-
<PAGE> 7
corporations and other legal entities, including public or governmental
bodies, agencies or instrumentalities, as well as natural persons.

7. GOVERNING LAW. This Guaranty, and its validity, enforcement, and
interpretation, shall for all purposes by governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable
United States federal law, and is intended to be performed in
accordance with, and only to the extent permitted by, such laws. All
obligations of Guarantor hereunder are payable and performable at the
place or places where the Guaranteed Obligations are payable and
performable.

8. INVALIDITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS. If any provision of this Guaranty
or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, for
any reason and to any extent, be judicially declared to be invalid or
unenforceable, neither the remaining provisions of this Guaranty nor
the application of such provision to any other Person or circumstance
shall be affected thereby, and the remaining provisions of this
Guaranty, or the applicability of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances, as applicable, shall remain in effect and be
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

9. ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS OF COLLECTION. Guarantor shall pay on
demand all reasonable attorneys' fees and all other costs and expenses
incurred by KCIT in the enforcement of or preservation of KCIT's
rights under this Guaranty. Guarantor agrees to pay interest on any
expenses or other sums due to KCIT under this Section 9 that are not
paid when due, at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) the
maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law, or (ii) the
Default Rate (as defined in the Guaranteed Notes). Guarantor's
obligations and liabilities under this Section 9 shall survive any
payment or discharge in full of the Guaranteed Obligations.

10. PAYMENTS. All sums payable under this Guaranty shall be paid in
lawful money of the United States of America that at the time of
payment is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts.

11. CONTROLLING AGREEMENT. It is not the intention of KCIT or Guarantor
to obligate Guarantor to pay interest in excess of that lawfully
permitted to be paid by Guarantor under applicable law. Should it be
determined that any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
amount payable by Guarantor under this Guaranty constitutes interest
in excess of the maximum amount of interest that Guarantor, in
Guarantor's capacity as guarantor, may lawfully be required to pay
under applicable law, the obligation of Guarantor to pay such interest
shall automatically be limited to the payment thereof in the maximum
amount so permitted under applicable law. The provisions of this
Section 11 shall override and control all other provisions of this
Guaranty and of any other agreement between Guarantor and KCIT.

12. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND COVENANTS OF GUARANTOR. Guarantor
hereby represents, warrants, and covenants that (a) after giving
effect to this Guaranty,

-7-
<PAGE> 8
Guarantor is solvent, and does not intend to incur or believe that it
will incur debts that will be beyond its ability to pay as such debts
mature; (b) KCIT has no duty at any time to investigate or inform
Guarantor of the financial or business condition or affairs of
Borrower or PRN or any change therein, and Guarantor will keep itself
fully appraised of Borrower's and PRN's financial and business
condition; (c) Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that Guarantor may be
required to pay and perform the Guaranteed Obligations in full without
assistance or support from Borrower, PRN or any other party; and (d)
Guarantor has read and fully understand the provisions contained in
the Guaranteed Notes. Guarantor's representations, warranties and
covenants are a material inducement to KCIT to make the Loan and
accept the Guaranteed Notes and shall survive the execution hereof and
any bankruptcy, foreclosure, transfer of security or other event
affecting Borrower, PRN, Guarantor, any other party, or any security
for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.

13. NOTICES. Unless specifically provided otherwise, any notice for
purposes of this Guaranty or any other document relating hereto shall
be given in writing or by telex or by facsimile (fax) transmission and
shall be addressed or delivered to the respective addresses set forth
in this Guaranty, or to such other address as may have been previously
designated by the intended recipient by notice given in accordance
with this Section. If sent by prepaid, registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested), the notice shall be deemed effective when
deposited in a regularly maintained receptacle of the United States
Postal Service; if transmitted by telex, the notice shall be effective
when transmitted (answerback confirmed); and if transmitted by
facsimile or personal delivery, the notice shall be effective when
received. No notice of change of address shall be effective except
upon actual receipt. This Section 13 shall not be construed in any
way to affect or impair any waiver of notice or demand provided in
this Guaranty or in any other Loan Document or to require giving
notice or demand to or upon any Person in any situation or for any
reason.

14. CUMULATIVE RIGHTS. The exercise of KCIT of any right or remedy
hereunder or under the Guaranteed Notes, or at law or in equity, shall
not preclude the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right
or remedy. KCIT shall have all rights, remedies and recourses
afforded to KCIT by reason of this Guaranty, the Guaranteed Notes, or
by law, equity or otherwise, and the same (a) shall be cumulative and
concurrent, (b) may be pursued separately, successively or
concurrently against Guarantor or others obligated for the Guaranteed
Obligations, or any part thereof, or against any one or more of them,
or against any security or otherwise, at the sole discretion of KCIT,
(c) may be exercised as often as occasion therefor shall arise, it
being agreed by Guarantor that the exercise of, discontinuance of the
exercise of or failure to exercise any of such rights, remedies, or
recourses shall in no event be construed as a waiver or release
thereof or of any other right, remedy, or recourse, and (d) are
intended to be, and shall be, non-exclusive. No waiver of any
default on the part of Guarantor or of any breach of any of the
provisions of this Guaranty or of any other document shall be
considered a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach, and
no delay or omission in exercising or

-8-
<PAGE> 9
enforcing the rights and powers granted herein or in any other
document shall be construed as a waiver of such rights and powers, and
no exercise or enforcement of any rights or powers hereunder or under
any other document shall be held to exhaust such rights and powers,
and every such right and power may be exercised from time to time. The
granting of any consent, approval or waiver by KCIT shall be limited
to the specific instance and purpose therefor and shall not constitute
consent or approval in any other instance or for any other purpose.
No notice to or demand on Guarantor in any case shall of itself
entitle Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar
or other circumstances. No provision of this Guaranty or any right,
remedy or recourse of KCIT with respect hereto, or any default or
breach, can be waived, nor can this Guaranty or Guarantor be released
or discharged in any way or to any extent, except specifically in each
case by a writing intended for that purpose (and which refers
specifically to this Guaranty) executed, and delivered to Guarantor,
by KCIT.

15. TERM OF GUARANTY. This Guaranty shall continue in effect until all
the Guaranteed Obligations are fully and finally paid, and discharged,
except that, and notwithstanding any return of this Guaranty to
Guarantor, this Guaranty shall continue in effect (i) with respect to
all obligations and liabilities of Guarantor under Section 9 of this
Guaranty, and (ii) as provided in Section 4(b) hereof.

16. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Guarantor at Guarantor's expense will promptly
execute and deliver to KCIT upon KCIT's request all such other and
further documents, agreements, and instruments in compliance with or
accomplishment of the agreements of Guarantor under this Guaranty.

17. NO FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP. The relationship between KCIT and
Guarantor is solely that of KCIT and guarantor. KCIT has no fiduciary
or other special relationship with or duty to Guarantor and none is
created hereby.

18. INTERPRETATION. The term "KCIT" shall be deemed to include any
permitted subsequent holder(s) of the Guaranteed Notes. Whenever the
context of any provisions hereof shall require it, words in the
singular shall include the plural, words in the plural shall include
the singular, and pronouns of any gender shall include the other
genders. Captions and headings herein are for convenience only and
shall not affect the construction of the document. All references in
this Guaranty to Schedules, Articles, Sections, Subsections,
paragraphs and subparagraphs refer to the respective subdivisions of
this Guaranty, unless such reference specifically identifies another

similar terms refer to this Guaranty and not to any particular section
or subsection of this Guaranty. The terms "include" and "including"

and understandings, if any, with respect to the guaranty by Guarantor
of the Guaranteed Obligations. No condition or conditions precedent

entitled to the benefit of a Negative Covenants Agreement executed by Borrower,

being herein called the "Negative Covenants Agreement" and the Asset Purchase
Agreement being herein called the "Acquisition Agreement"), and;

KCIT to extend credit to Borrower, PRN and Holdings, Guarantor hereby
guaranties to KCIT the prompt and full
<PAGE> 2
payment of the Indebtedness described in Section 1 below in this Guaranty
(collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations"), this Guaranty being upon
the following terms and conditions:

1. GUARANTY OF PAYMENT. Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to KCIT the punctual payment when due, whether by lapse of
time, by acceleration of maturity, or otherwise, and at all times
thereafter, of all principal, interest (including interest accruing
after the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding by
or against Borrower, PRN or Holdings as the case may be, whether or
not allowed in such proceeding), costs, expenses, and other sums of
money now or hereafter due and owing pursuant to (i) the terms of the
Notes, and (ii) all renewals, extensions, refinancings, modifications,
supplements or amendments of such indebtedness or any part thereof
(the indebtedness described in clauses (i) and (ii) above in this
Section 1 is herein collectively called the "Indebtedness"). This
Guaranty covers the Indebtedness, whether presently outstanding or
arising subsequent to the date hereof. The guaranty of Guarantor as
set forth in this Section 1 is a continuing guaranty of payment and
not a guaranty of collection.

2. PRIMARY LIABILITY OF GUARANTOR.

(a) This Guaranty is an absolute, irrevocable and unconditional
guaranty of payment. Guarantor shall be liable for the payment
of the Guaranteed Obligations, as set forth in this Guaranty,
as a primary obligor. This Guaranty shall be effective as a
waiver of, and Guarantor hereby expressly waives, any and all
rights to which Guarantor may otherwise have been entitled
under any suretyship laws in effect from time to time.

(b) In the event of default by Borrower, PRN and/or Holdings, in
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof,
when such indebtedness becomes due, either by its terms or as
the result of the exercise of any power to accelerate,
Guarantor shall, on demand and without presentment, protest,
notice of acceptance of this Guaranty, protest, further notice
of nonpayment or of dishonor or of default or nonperformance,
or notice of acceleration or of intent to accelerate, or any
other notice whatsoever, make payment in respect of or fully
perform, as the case may be, the Guaranteed Obligations.
Further, it shall not be necessary for KCIT, in order to
enforce such payment by Guarantor, first to institute suit or
pursue or exhaust any rights or remedies against Borrower,
PRN, Holdings or others liable on such indebtedness, or to
enforce any rights against any security that shall ever have
been given to secure such indebtedness, or to join Borrower,
PRN, Holdings or any others liable for the payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof in any action to
enforce this Guaranty, or to resort to any other means of
obtaining payment or performance of the Guaranteed
Obligations.

-2-
<PAGE> 3
(c) Suit may be brought or demand may be made against all parties
who have signed this Guaranty or any other guaranty covering
all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or against any
one or more of them, separately or together, without impairing
the rights of KCIT against any party hereto. At any time that
KCIT is entitled to exercise its rights or remedies hereunder,
it may in its discretion elect to demand payment.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if
following an Event of Default (as defined in the Notes) by
Borrower, PRN and/or Holdings under any of the Notes, the
acceleration of the Notes is prohibited pursuant to (i) that
certain Standstill Agreement dated as of September 30, 1994,
by and among PRN, KCIT and Congress Financial Corporation
("Congress"), (ii) that certain Subordination and Standstill
Agreement dated September 30, 1994, by and among Borrower,
KCIT and Congress, or (iii) that certain Subordination and
Standstill Agreement dated September 30, 1994 entered into by
and among Holdings, KCIT and Congress (said agreements being
herein collectively called the "Standstill Agreements"), then
Guarantor shall, on demand and without presentment, protest,
notice of acceptance of the Guaranty, further notice of
non-payment or of dishonor or of default or non-performance,
or any notice of acceleration or notice of intent to
accelerate or any notice whatsoever, make payment to KCIT, or
the then owner or holder of the Notes, in an amount equal to
the then entire outstanding balance, including all principal,
regardless of whether or not same is then due under the terms
of the Notes, and accrued but unpaid interest thereon, of the
Guaranteed Obligations. Furthermore, it shall not be
necessary for KCIT, in order to enforce such payment by
Guarantor, first to institute suit or pursue or exhaust any
rights or remedies against Borrower, PRN, Holdings or others
liable on such indebtedness or to enforce any rights against
security that shall ever have been given to secure such
indebtedness, or to join Borrower, PRN, Holdings or any others
liable for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part
thereof in any action to enforce this Guaranty, or to resort
to any other means of obtaining payment or performance of the
Guaranteed Obligations.

3. CERTAIN AGREEMENTS AND WAIVERS BY GUARANTOR.

(a) Guarantor hereby agrees that neither KCIT's rights or remedies
nor Guarantor's obligations under the terms of this Guaranty
shall be released, diminished, impaired, reduced or affected
by any one or more of the following events, actions, facts, or
circumstances, and the liability of Guarantor under this
Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

dealings with, any collateral or security at any
time existing or purported, believed or expected
to exist in connection with any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations;

departure from, the Notes or any other guaranty of
any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any
adjustment, indulgence, forbearance, or compromise
that may be granted from time to time by KCIT to
Borrower, PRN, Holdings, Guarantor, and/or any
other party at any time liable for the payment of
any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations;

(vii) any neglect, lack of diligence, delay, omission,
failure, or refusal of KCIT to (a) take or
prosecute (or in taking or prosecuting) any action
for the collection or enforcement of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations, or (b) foreclose or take
or prosecute any action to foreclose (or in

-4-
<PAGE> 5
foreclosing or taking or prosecuting any action to
foreclose) upon any security therefor, or (c)
exercise (or in exercising) any other right or
power with respect to any security therefor, or
(d) take or prosecute (or in taking or
prosecuting) any action in connection with any
document relating to the Guaranteed Obligations,

(viii) any failure to sell or otherwise dispose of in a
commercially reasonable manner any collateral
securing any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations.

(ix) any failure of KCIT to notify Guarantor of any
creation, renewal, extension, rearrangement,
modification, supplement, or assignment of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or of
the Notes, or of any release of or change in any
security or of any other action taken or
refrained from being taken by KCIT against
Borrower, PRN or Holdings or any security, it
being understood that KCIT shall not be required
to give Guarantor any notice of any kind under any
circumstances with respect to or in connection
with the Guaranteed Obligations, and any and all
rights to notice that Guarantor may have otherwise
had being hereby waived by Guarantor;

(x) KCIT being required to refund any payment by
Borrower to Borrower, by PRN to PRN or by Holdings
to Holdings, as the case may be, or any other
party liable for the payment of any or all of the
Guaranteed Obligations;

(xi) the existence of any claim, set-off, or other
right that Guarantor may at any time have against
Borrower, PRN or Holdings whether or not arising
in connection with this Guaranty or the Notes
(provided, that nothing contained herein shall
prevent the assertion of any such claim by
separate suit or compulsory counterclaim); or

(xii) the unenforceability of all or any part of the
Guaranteed Obligations against Borrower, PRN or
Holdings, whether because the Guaranteed
Obligations exceed the amount permitted by law or
violate any usury law, or because the act of
creating the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part
thereof, is ultra vires, or because the officers
or persons creating same acted in excess of their
authority, or because of a lack of validity or
enforceability of or defect or deficiency in the
Notes, or because of the subordination of, or
moratorium on, payments due and owing under the
Notes at such times as the same would otherwise
become due and owing under the Notes but for such
subordination or moratium, regardless of the party
or parties, including, without limitation,
Congress Financial Corporation, intended to be
benefited by such

-5-
<PAGE> 6
subordination or moratium or because Borrower's,
PRN's or Holding's obligation ceases to exist by
operation of law, or because of any other reason
or circumstance, it being agreed that Guarantor
shall remain liable hereon regardless of whether
Borrower, PRN, Holdings or any other person be
found not liable on the Guaranteed Obligations, or
any part thereof, for any reason (and regardless
of any joinder of Borrower, PRN, Holdings or any
other party in any action to obtain payment of any
or all of the Guaranteed Obligations); provided,
however, that if any part of the Guaranteed
Obligations is not enforceable against Borrower,
PRN or Holdings, as the case may be, because of
the proper exercise of any right of set-off
against the Notes pursuant to the terms of the
Acquisition Agreement, that such part of the
Guaranteed Obligations shall not be enforceable
against Guarantor.

(b) In the event any payment by Borrower, PRN, Holdings or any
other party to KCIT is held to constitute a preference,
fraudulent transfer or other voidable payment under any
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or if for any other
reason KCIT is required to refund such payment or pay the
amount thereof to any other party, such payment by Borrower,
PRN, Holdings or any other party to KCIT shall not constitute
a release of Guarantor from any liability hereunder, and this
Guaranty shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated
(notwithstanding any prior release or discharge by KCIT of
this Guaranty or of Guarantor), as the case may be, with
respect to, and this Guaranty shall apply to, any and all
amounts so refunded by KCIT or paid by KCIT to another party,
together with any interest paid by KCIT and any attorneys'
fees, costs and expenses paid or incurred by KCIT in
connection with any such event (all of which amounts shall
constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations). It is the
intent of Guarantor and KCIT that the obligations and
liabilities of Guarantor hereunder are absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and that until
the Guaranteed Obligations are fully and finally paid, and not
subject to refund or disgorgement, the obligations and
liabilities of Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or
released, in whole or in part, by any act or occurrence that
might, but for the provisions of this Guaranty, be deemed a
legal or equitable discharge or release of a guarantor. KCIT
shall be entitled to continue to hold this Guaranty in its
possession for a period of one year from the date the
Guaranteed Obligations are paid and performed in full and for
so long thereafter as may be necessary to enforce any
obligation of Guarantor hereunder and/or to exercise any right
or remedy of KCIT hereunder.

(c) If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable
by Borrower, PRN and/or Holdings under the Notes is stayed or
delayed by (i) any law or tribunal, or (ii) pursuant to the
terms of the Standstill Agreements, all such amounts shall
nonetheless be payable by Guarantor on demand by KCIT.

4. OTHER LIABILITY. If Guarantor becomes liable for any indebtedness
owing by Borrower, PRN or Holdings to KCIT other than under this
Guaranty, such liability shall not be in any manner impaired or
affected hereby, and the rights of KCIT hereunder shall be cumulative
of any and all other rights that KCIT may have against Guarantor. If
Borrower, PRN or Holdings is or becomes indebted to KCIT for any
indebtedness other than or in excess of the Indebtedness for which
Guarantor is liable under this Guaranty, any payment received or
recovery realized upon any indebtedness of Borrower, PRN or Holdings
to KCIT may, except to the extent paid by Guarantor on the
Indebtedness for which Guarantor is liable under this Guaranty or
specifically required by law or agreement of KCIT to be applied to the
Indebtedness for which Guarantor is liable under this Guaranty, in
KCIT's sole discretion, be applied upon indebtedness of Borrower, PRN
or Holdings to KCIT other than the Indebtedness for which Guarantor is
liable under this Guaranty.

5. KCIT ASSIGNS. This Guaranty is for the benefit of KCIT and KCIT's
successors and assigns, and in the event of a permitted assignment of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, the rights and
benefits hereunder, to the extent applicable to the Guaranteed
Obligations so assigned, may be transferred with such Guaranteed
Obligations. Guarantor waives notice of any transfer or assignment of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, and agrees that
failure to give notice will not affect the liabilities of Guarantor
hereunder.

6. BINDING EFFECT. This Guaranty is binding not only on Guarantor, but
also on Guarantor's successors and assigns. Words importing persons
herein shall include firms, associations, partnerships (including
limited partnerships), joint ventures, trusts, corporations and other
legal entities, including public or governmental bodies, agencies or
instrumentalities, as well as natural persons.

7. GOVERNING LAW. This Guaranty, and its validity, enforcement, and
interpretation, shall for all purposes by governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable
United States federal law, and is intended to be performed in
accordance with, and only to the extent permitted by, such laws. All
obligations of Guarantor hereunder are payable and performable at the
place or places where the Guaranteed Obligations are payable and
performable.

8. INVALIDITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS. If any provision of this Guaranty
or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, for
any reason and to any extent, be judicially declared to be invalid or
unenforceable, neither the remaining provisions of this Guaranty nor
the application of such provision to any other Person or circumstance
shall be affected thereby, and the remaining provisions of this
Guaranty, or the applicability of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances, as applicable, shall remain in effect and be
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

-7-
<PAGE> 8
9. ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS OF COLLECTION. Guarantor shall pay on
demand all reasonable attorneys' fees and all other costs and expenses
incurred by KCIT in the enforcement of or preservation of KCIT's
rights under this Guaranty. Guarantor agrees to pay interest on any
expenses or other sums due to KCIT under this Section 9 that are not
paid when due, at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) the
maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law, or (ii) the
Default Rate (as defined in the Notes). Guarantor's obligations and
liabilities under this Section 9 shall survive any payment or
discharge in full of the Guaranteed Obligations.

10. PAYMENTS. All sums payable under this Guaranty shall be paid in
lawful money of the United States of America that at the time of
payment is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts.

11. CONTROLLING AGREEMENT. It is not the intention of KCIT or Guarantor
to obligate Guarantor to pay interest in excess of that lawfully
permitted to be paid by Guarantor under applicable law. Should it be
determined that any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
amount payable by Guarantor under this Guaranty constitutes interest
in excess of the maximum amount of interest that Guarantor, in
Guarantor's capacity as guarantor, may lawfully be required to pay
under applicable law, the obligation of Guarantor to pay such interest
shall automatically be limited to the payment thereof in the maximum
amount so permitted under applicable law. The provisions of this
Section 11 shall override and control all other provisions of this
Guaranty and of any other agreement between Guarantor and KCIT.

12. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND COVENANTS OF GUARANTOR. Guarantor
hereby represents, warrants, and covenants that (a) after giving
effect to this Guaranty, Guarantor is solvent, and does not intend to
incur or believe that it will incur debts that will be beyond its
ability to pay as such debts mature; (b) KCIT has no duty at any time
to investigate or inform Guarantor of the financial or business
condition or affairs of Borrower, PRN or Holdings or any change
therein, and Guarantor will keep itself fully appraised of Borrower's,
PRN's and Holdings' financial and business condition; (c) Guarantor
acknowledges and agrees that Guarantor may be required to pay and
perform the Guaranteed Obligations in full without assistance or
support from Borrower, PRN, Holdings or any other party; and (d)
Guarantor has read and fully understand the provisions contained in
the Notes. Guarantor's representations, warranties and covenants are
a material inducement to KCIT to make the Loan and accept the Notes
and shall survive the execution hereof and any bankruptcy,
foreclosure, transfer of security or other event affecting Borrower,
PRN, Holdings, Guarantor, any other party, or any security for all or
any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.

13. NOTICES. Unless specifically provided otherwise, any notice for
purposes of this Guaranty or any other document relating hereto shall
be given in writing or by telex or by facsimile (fax) transmission and
shall be addressed or delivered to the respective addresses set forth
in this Guaranty, or to such other address as may have been

-8-
<PAGE> 9
previously designated by the intended recipient by notice given in
accordance with this Section. If sent by prepaid, registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested), the notice shall be deemed
effective when deposited in a regularly maintained receptacle of the
United States Postal Service; if transmitted by telex, the notice
shall be effective when transmitted (answerback confirmed); and if
transmitted by facsimile or personal delivery, the notice shall be
effective when received. No notice of change of address shall be
effective except upon actual receipt. This Section 13 shall not be
construed in any way to affect or impair any waiver of notice or
demand provided in this Guaranty or in any other Loan Document or to
require giving notice or demand to or upon any Person in any situation
or for any reason.

14. CUMULATIVE RIGHTS. The exercise of KCIT of any right or remedy
hereunder or under the Notes, or at law or in equity, shall not
preclude the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right or
remedy. KCIT shall have all rights, remedies and recourses afforded
to KCIT by reason of this Guaranty, the Notes, or by law, equity or
otherwise, and the same (a) shall be cumulative and concurrent, (b)
may be pursued separately, successively or concurrently against
Guarantor or others obligated for the Guaranteed Obligations, or any
part thereof, or against any one or more of them, or against any
security or otherwise, at the sole discretion of KCIT, (c) may be
exercised as often as occasion therefor shall arise, it being agreed
by Guarantor that the exercise of, discontinuance of the exercise of
or failure to exercise any of such rights, remedies, or recourses
shall in no event be construed as a waiver or release thereof or of
any other right, remedy, or recourse, and (d) are intended to be, and
shall be, non-exclusive. No waiver of any default on the part of
Guarantor or of any breach of any of the provisions of this Guaranty
or of any other document shall be considered a waiver of any other or
subsequent default or breach, and no delay or omission in exercising
or enforcing the rights and powers granted herein or in any other
document shall be construed as a waiver of such rights and powers, and
no exercise or enforcement of any rights or powers hereunder or under
any other document shall be held to exhaust such rights and powers,
and every such right and power may be exercised from time to time.
The granting of any consent, approval or waiver by KCIT shall be
limited to the specific instance and purpose therefor and shall not
constitute consent or approval in any other instance or for any other
purpose. No notice to or demand on Guarantor in any case shall of
itself entitle Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances. No provision of this Guaranty or any
right, remedy or recourse of KCIT with respect hereto, or any default
or breach, can be waived, nor can this Guaranty or Guarantor be
released or discharged in any way or to any extent, except
specifically in each case by a writing intended for that purpose (and
which refers specifically to this Guaranty) executed, and delivered to
Guarantor, by KCIT.

15. TERM OF GUARANTY. This Guaranty shall continue in effect until all
the Guaranteed Obligations are fully and finally paid, and discharged,
except that, and notwithstanding any return of this Guaranty to
Guarantor, this Guaranty shall continue in effect (i) with

-9-
<PAGE> 10
respect to all obligations and liabilities of Guarantor under Section
9 of this Guaranty, and (ii) as provided in Section 4(b) hereof.

16. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Guarantor at Guarantor's expense will promptly
execute and deliver to KCIT upon KCIT's request all such other and
further documents, agreements, and instruments in compliance with or
accomplishment of the agreements of Guarantor under this Guaranty.

17. NO FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP. The relationship between KCIT and
Guarantor is solely that of KCIT and guarantor. KCIT has no fiduciary
or other special relationship with or duty to Guarantor and none is
created hereby.

18. INTERPRETATION. The term "KCIT" shall be deemed to include any
permitted subsequent holder(s) of the Notes. Whenever the context of
any provisions hereof shall require it, words in the singular shall
include the plural, words in the plural shall include the singular,

This Collateral Transfer of Note (Security Agreement) (this
"Collateral Transfer of Note") is executed to be effective as of the 30th day
of September, 1994, by MEDIQ INCORPORATED ("Debtor") for the benefit of Secured
Party (hereinafter defined).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, Debtor, PRN Holdings, Inc., MEDIQ/PRN Life Support
Services-I, Inc. ("PRN- I"), Kinetic Concepts, Inc. ("KCI") and KCI Therapeutic
Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Secured Party") entered into that one
certain Asset Purchase Agreement (so called herein) dated August 23, 1994, as
amended by Amendment No. 1 to Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of the date
hereof, whereby PRN-I agreed to acquire certain of the assets of Secured Party
(the Asset Purchase Agreement as so amended being herein called the
"Acquisition Agreement");

WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Acquisition Agreement, the promissory notes described in Section 18 herein
(collectively, the "Notes") and incorporated herein for all purposes have been
delivered to Secured Party. For purposes of this Agreement, the makers of the
Notes are herein collectively called the "Borrower"; and

WHEREAS, the Acquisition Agreement requires Debtor to enter into
that one certain Guaranty Agreement dated of even date herewith (the
"Guaranty"), whereby Debtor unconditionally guarantees the prompt and timely
payment of the Notes; and

WHEREAS, the Acquisition Agreement requires Debtor to enter into
this Agreement to secure the Guaranty.

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and confessed, Debtor agrees
as follows:

1. Collateral Transfer and Grant of Security Interest.
Debtor hereby collaterally transfers, assigns and conveys to Secured Party, and
grants to Secured Party a first priority security interest in, the following
described promissory note (herein called the "Collateral Note") and all liens,
rights, titles, equities and interests securing the same, to- wit:

That one certain $11,500,000.00 Promissory Note dated August 31, 1993,
executed by Mental Health Management, Inc., a Virginia corporation
("MHM"), and made payable to the order of Debtor.

2. Indebtedness Secured. The security interest and pledges and
assignments, as applicable, granted hereby are to secure punctual payment and
performance of the following:
<PAGE> 2
(i) the Guaranty, and any and all extensions, renewals, modifications,
increases and rearrangements thereof, (ii) all costs incurred by Secured Party
to enforce this Agreement and to defend and preserve the security interests
created herein, to collect the amounts owed under the Guaranty, this Collateral
Transfer of Note and to preserve, collect and enforce the Collateral Note,
including, but not limited to, taxes, assessments, insurance premiums,
reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses, and expenses of sale, and (iii)
interest on the above amounts at the highest rate applicable to the Notes from
time to time or, if less, at the highest lawful rate (all of which are herein
separately and collectively referred to as the "Obligations"). Debtor
acknowledges that the security interest hereby granted shall secure all future
advances pursuant to or under this Agreement or the Guaranty.

3. Representations and Warranties. Debtor represents and
warrants as follows:

a. This agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Debtor enforceable against the Debtor in
accordance with its respective terms.

b. The execution, delivery and performance of this
agreement will not violate or contravene any requirement of law
(assuming KCI and Secured Party execute the subordination agreement
contemplated by Section 7.9 of the Acquisition Agreement and that
notice is given to NationsBank, N.A. pursuant to the MHM Subordination
Agreement (as defined in the Acquisition Agreement)) or any
contractual obligation of the Debtor and, except as contemplated
hereby, will not result in, or require, the creation of imposition of
any lien on the Collateral Note pursuant to any requirement of law.
No contract between the Debtor and any governmental authority forbids
the security interest (and pledge and assignment, as applicable)
evidenced by this agreement.

c. The Debtor is the owner of good and marketable title
to the Collateral Note free and clear of all security interests, liens
or rights except for the security interests (and pledges and
assignments, as applicable) granted hereby and the rights of
NationsBank, N.A. under the MHM Subordination Agreement.

4. Default. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Event of
Default" has the meaning given to that term in the Notes.

5. Remedies. If an Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, Secured Party, in addition to any other rights and remedies
available to Secured Party at law or in equity, shall have the right to sell
the Collateral Note at private or public sale after sending reasonable notice
to Debtor and to such other person or persons legally entitled thereto under
the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction (the "UCC"), of the
time and place of such sale. Secured Party shall transfer to the purchaser at
such sale the Collateral Note, together with all liens, rights, titles,
equities and interests securing the payment of the Collateral Note, and the
recitals in such transfer shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of the
matters therein stated and all prerequisites to such sale required hereunder
and under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction shall be presumed to have
been performed. The proceeds of the sale shall be applied

-2-
<PAGE> 3
first to the expenses of the sale and then, in such order of application as
Secured Party may, in its sole discretion, elect toward the payment of the
principal, interest and reasonable attorney's fees due and unpaid upon the
Obligations hereby secured, rendering the balance, if any, and surplus, if any,
to the person or persons legally entitled thereto under the UCC, but if there
be any deficiency, Debtor shall remain liable therefor. Secured Party shall
have the right to purchase at any public sale of the Collateral Note, being the
highest bidder therefor, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law at any
private sale of the Collateral.

6. Additional Remedies. Secured Party, in addition to the
rights and remedies provided for in the preceding paragraph and the other
provisions hereof, shall have all the rights and remedies of a Secured Party
under the UCC and Secured Party shall be entitled to avail itself of all such
other rights and remedies as may now or hereafter exist at law or in equity for
the collection and/or enforcement of the Obligations and the foreclosure of the
security interest created hereby, or by any other law of applicable
jurisdiction, shall not prevent the concurrent employment of any other
appropriate remedy or remedies.

7. Expenses. Debtor shall be liable for and agrees to pay the
reasonable expenses incurred by Secured Party in enforcing its rights and
remedies, in retaking, holding, appraising, evaluating, selling, or disposing
of the Collateral Note, or like expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and out-of-pocket legal expenses (including, but not
limited to, the reasonable expenses and hourly fees of in-house counsel)
incurred by Secured Party. These expenses, together with interest thereon from
the date incurred until paid by Debtor at the highest rate applicable to the
Notes from time to time or, if less the highest rate allowed by law, shall
constitute additional Obligations and shall be secured by and entitled to the
benefits of this agreement.

8. Notice. The requirement of reasonable notice to Debtor of the
time and place of any public sale of the Collateral Note, or of the time after
which any private sale or any other intended disposition thereof is to be made,
shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor at least ten
(10) days before the date of any public sale or at least ten (10) days before
the time after which any private sale or other disposition is to be made.

9. Remedy of Defaults and Waiver. Secured Party may remedy any
default, without waiving same, or may waive any default without waiving any
prior or subsequent default.

10. Other Security; Extensions; Election of Remedies. The
security interest herein created shall not be affected by or affect any other
security taken for the Obligations, and any extensions may be made of the
Obligations without affecting the priority of such security interest or the
validity thereof with reference to any third party, and the holder of the
Obligations shall not be limited by any election of remedies if it chooses to
foreclose such security interest by suit. The right to sell under the terms
hereof shall also exist cumulative with said suit and one method shall not bar
the other, but both may be exercised at the same or different times, nor shall
one be a defense to the other.

-3-
<PAGE> 4
11. Possession and Collection of Collateral Note. Debtor shall
deliver possession of the Collateral Note to Secured Party, and shall endorse,
in a manner satisfactory to Secured Party, the Collateral Note payable to the
order of Secured Party. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Debtor may collect and receipt for any and all sums becoming due upon the
Collateral Note; provided, however, that any prepayments of principal under the
Collateral Note or the payment of any outstanding unpaid principal owing under
the Collateral Note at or after maturity shall be made to Secured Party or a
designated escrow agent in accordance with paragraph 12 below. After the
occurrence of an Event of Default, Debtor (i) authorizes Secured Party, at
Secured Party's option, to collect and receipt for any and all sums becoming
due upon the Collateral Note, such sums to be held by Secured Party without
liability for interest thereon and applied toward the payment and/or
performance of the Obligations as and when the same become due, and Secured
Party shall have the full control of the Collateral Note and any liens securing
the same until the Obligations are fully performed and shall have the further
right to release any lien or liens securing the Collateral Note upon the full
and final payment thereof to Secured Party, but Secured Party is under no
obligation to make or enforce the collection of the Collateral Note and the
failure of Secured Party from any cause to make or enforce the collection
thereof shall not in any way prejudice the right of Secured Party to thereafter
make or enforce collection thereof or in any way affect the indebtedness to
Secured Party hereby secured, and (ii) hereby agrees to direct,
contemporaneously with the execution hereof, MHM to make such payments directly
to Secured Party upon its receipt of notice from Secured Party demanding such
direct payment to Secured Party.

12. Prepayments and Balloon Payments. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, in the event that MHM makes any prepayments
of principal under the Collateral Note or makes any payment of principal at or
after maturity of the Collateral Note, as the same may be extended in
accordance with the terms hereof, such payments shall be made in accordance
with the terms of, and directly to the escrow agent designated in, an Escrow
Agreement executed and delivered by and between Secured Party and Debtor, the
form and substance of which shall be satisfactory to Secured Party and Debtor
(but which in any event will contain a provision requiring Secured Party to
immediately deliver notice to MHM designating the escrow agent under such
Escrow Agreement), and further subject to the execution and delivery of any
security agreements, instruments or financing statements, or the making of any
filings Secured Party may deem necessary or desirable in order to perfect its
first priority security interest in and to such proceeds of the Collateral Note
(subject, however, to any rights of NationsBank, N.A., pursuant to the MHM
Subordination Agreement); provided, however, that Debtor shall,
contemporaneously with the execution hereof, direct MHM to make any such
payments directly to Secured Party (x) unless, on or prior to the date that
such payment(s) are to be made, Secured Party has delivered to MHM a notice
designating the escrow agent to whom such payment should be made or (y) unless,
on or prior to the date that such payment(s) are to be made, Secured Party has
delivered to MHM a notice stating that Debtor has provided substitute
collateral satisfactory to Secured Party, in its reasonable discretion. In
consideration of the grant of security interest by Debtor herein, Secured Party
hereby covenants and agrees to deliver the notice required in subsection (x)
above immediately upon the execution and delivery of such Escrow Agreement and
such other agreements, instruments and financing

-4-
<PAGE> 5
statements, and the making of such filings, and subsection (y) above
immediately upon Debtor providing substitute collateral satisfactory to Secured
Party, in its reasonable discretion, and with respect to which Debtor has
executed and delivered all security agreements, instruments and financing
statements, and all filings have been made, that are necessary to establish a
first priority security interests in favor of Secured Party in and to such
substitute collateral. If such payments are made directly to Secured Party in
accordance with the foregoing, such sums shall be held by Secured Party without
liability for interest thereon and applied toward the payment and performance
of the Obligations as and when the same become due, until such time as (i)
Secured Party and Debtor have executed an Escrow Agreement satisfactory, in
form and substance, to Secured Party and Debtor, and Debtor has executed and
delivered to Secured Party any and all such security agreements, instruments,
and/or financing statements, and all such filings have been made, as Secured
Party determines to be necessary in order to perfect and preserve its first
priority security interest in and to the proceeds of the Collateral Note or
(ii) Debtor has provided substitute collateral satisfactory to Secured Party,
in its reasonable discretion, and with respect to which Debtor has executed and
delivered to Secured Party any and all such security agreements, instruments
and/or financing statements, and all such filings have been made, as Secured
Party determines to be necessary in order to perfect a first priority security
interest in and to such substitute collateral in favor of Secured Party.

13. Debtor's Actions on Collateral Note. Prior to the occurrence
of an Event of Default, Debtor may take such actions as it may reasonably deem
necessary to enforce performance by MHM under the Collateral Note in accordance
with the terms thereof; but in no event shall Debtor, without the prior written
consent of Secured Party, compromise or settle any action or otherwise agree to
accept any amount less than an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
the outstanding unpaid principal balance of the Collateral Note, together with
all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, in full and final satisfaction of
MHM's obligations under the Collateral Note. Additionally, Debtor hereby
expressly agrees that any proceeds that represent principal of the Collateral
Note which result from any such enforcement action by Debtor shall be deemed to
be a prepayment of principal on the Collateral Note, subject to all the terms
and provisions of paragraph 12 above, and the direction to MHM by Debtor in
accordance with the terms of paragraph 12 shall also include a direction that
the proceeds of any enforcement action shall be treated the same as the
prepayment of principal. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing,
the Debtor shall not accelerate the maturity of the Collateral Note or take any
affirmative collection actions without the prior written consent of the Secured
Party, which consent may be withheld in the Secured Party's sole discretion.
In the event the Secured Party consents to the sale of any collateral securing
the Collateral Note such sale shall be for cash (and such cash proceeds shall
be immediately paid to Secured Party), and the Debtor may not bid a credit
against the Collateral Note without the prior or contemporaneous written
consent of the Secured Party, which consent may, but need not, set a maximum
amount which may be so credited.

14. Receipt of Principal by Debtor. In the event that,
notwithstanding the terms of this Collateral Transfer of Note, Debtor receives
any payments of principal or proceeds that represent principal of the
Collateral Note which result from any enforcement action with respect

for Secured Party and shall immediately forward such payments to the designated
escrow agent or, unless, prior to or contemporaneously with Debtor's receipt of
the same, Substitute Collateral satisfactory to Secured Party, in its
reasonable discretion, with respect to which all matters necessary to create a
first priority security interest in favor of Secured Party have been completed,
to Secured Party in accordance with the terms hereof.

15. Modifications of Collateral Note. Prior to the occurrence of
an Event of Default, Debtor may modify the terms of the Collateral Note as
follows: (i) Debtor may agree to extend the maturity of the Collateral Note so
long as such extension is conditioned upon MHM's agreement to continue making
monthly payments of all accrued and unpaid interest and level monthly payments
that effect an amortization of the principal of the Collateral Note over the 15
year amortization period described therein in equal monthly installments of
$63,889.00, and (ii) Debtor may agree to any such other modifications that do
not impair the enforceability or the economic value of the Collateral Note;
provided, however, that Debtor shall provide Secured Party with written notice
of any proposed extension or modification together with the proposed terms of
such extension or modification at least ten (10) days prior to executing any
extension or modification agreement governing such extension or modification.
Debtor further agrees to immediately deliver to Secured Party the completely
executed original of any such extension or modification agreement, properly
endorsed to Secured Party.
