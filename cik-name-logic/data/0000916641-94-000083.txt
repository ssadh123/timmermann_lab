Stock (which includes the July, 1994 sale of 479,400 shares exercised by
the underwriters) in a public offering at $14.25 per share, (ii) the
acquisition of 21 apartment communities on July 1, 1994, 3 apartment
communities on August 16, 1994 and 1 apartment community to be acquired
on or about November 1, 1994 from partnerships affiliated with the
Clover Financial Corporation, a New Jersey Corporation (previously
reported on Form 8-K dated May 26, 1994) (the "Portfolio Acquisition"),
(iii) the acquisition of five apartment communities purchased in 1994
(previously reported on Forms 8-K dated April 15, 1994 and May 17,
1994), and (iv) the acquisition of eleven apartment communities
previously reported on Form 8-K dated December 31, 1993, at the
beginning of each pro forma period presented. In addition, such Pro
Forma Statements of Operation also assume that approximately $59,444,000
of 10 year senior unsecured notes are outstanding for approximately 8
months for the year ended December 31, 1993 and 4 months for the six
months ended June 30, 1994. In management's opinion, all significant
adjustments necessary to reflect these transactions have been made. The
Pro Forma Statements of Operation should be read in conjunction with the
Trust's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31,
1993 and its unaudited financial statements for the six months ended
June 30, 1994.

The unaudited Pro Forma Statements of Operations are not
necessarily indicative of what the Trust's results would have been for
the six months ended June 30, 1994 and the year ended December 31, 1993
if the Common Stock offering and related acquisitions had been
consummated at the beginning of each period presented, nor do they
purport to represent the results of operations of the Trust for future
periods.

2. ADJUSTMENTS TO PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and its

(B) Represents actual rental income and related operating expenses
of the Portfolio Acquisition for the full year ended December 31, 1993,
as reported on Form 8-K dated May 26, 1994. Represents actual rental
income and related operating expenses of the Portfolio Acquisition for
the six months ended June 30, 1994.

(C) Represents actual rental income and related operating expenses of five
apartment acquisitions, as previously reported on Forms 8-K dated April 15, 1994
and May 17, 1994.

(D) Represents the net adjustments required to allow for a full
year of actual rental income and related operating expenses for the
Trust's acquisitions reported on Forms 8-K during 1993.

(E) Reflects the net decrease in property management fees for the Portfolio
Acquisition and the Trust's 1994 and 1993 acquisitions. The Trust internally
manages its apartment portfolio at a cost of approximately 3% of rental income.

(F) Reflects the net decrease in insurance expense to reflect that the
Trust insures its apartments for approximately $107 per unit less than the
historical insurance expense of the Portfolio Acquisition.

(G) Represents the net adjustments to depreciation expense as outlined
below. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets. Buildings were depreciated using a 35 year
life and other improvements using a 15 year useful life.

Acquisition.

in bank lines of credit and the assumption of tax-exempt bonds on one of the

incurred by the Trust to purchase (i) the Portfolio Acquisition at interest
rates and maturities which are currently available to the Trust, (ii) the 1994
