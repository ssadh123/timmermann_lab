NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Kimberly-Clark Corporation's accounting policies conform to
generally accepted accounting principles. Significant policies
followed are described below.

Basis of Presentation
- ---------------------

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Kimberly-Clark Corporation and all significant subsidiaries
which are more than 50 percent owned and controlled. 
Investments in significant nonconsolidated companies which are
at least 20 percent owned are stated at cost plus equity in
undistributed net income. These latter companies are referred
to as equity companies.

Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior
years' data to the current year presentation.

Start-Up and Preoperating Costs
- -------------------------------

Costs of bringing certain new or expanded facilities into
operation are recorded as deferred charges and amortized to
income over periods of not more than five years.

Advertising and Promotion Expenses
- ----------------------------------

Advertising expenses are charged to income during the year in
which they are incurred. Promotion expenses are charged to
income over the period of the promotional campaign.

Per Share Data
- --------------

Per share data are based on the average number of common shares
outstanding, which was 160.9 million, 160.4 million and
160.0 million for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.

Inventories
- -----------

U.S. inventories valued at cost on the Last-In, First-Out
(LIFO) method for U.S. income tax purposes are valued in the
same manner for accounting purposes. The balance of the U.S.
inventories and inventories of consolidated operations outside
the U.S. are valued at the lower of cost, using the First-In,
First-Out (FIFO) method, or market.

Property and Depreciation
- -------------------------

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciable
property is depreciated on the straight-line or units-of-
production method for accounting purposes and generally on an
accelerated method for income tax purposes. When property is
sold or retired, the cost of the property and the related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and
any gain or loss on the transaction is included in income.

NOTE 2. INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1992, the Corporation adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (SFAS No. 109). SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred
income taxes be based on the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of
assets and liabilities. Previously, deferred income taxes were
determined based on the historical tax effects of timing
differences between book and taxable income. The $35.0 million
cumulative effect of this accounting change was credited to
1992 income as a separate item in the consolidated income
statement.

An analysis of the provision for income taxes follows:

====== ==== ====== ==== ====== ====
</TABLE>

The increase in the 1993 U.S. corporate income tax rate to
35 percent from 34 percent required that deferred income tax
assets and liabilities be remeasured at the new rate.

At December 31, 1993, income taxes have not been provided on
$911 million of permanently invested unremitted net income of
subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. These earnings could
become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as
dividends, were lent to the Corporation or a U.S. affiliate, or
if the Corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries. 
Any resulting U.S. or foreign tax liability would be largely
offset by U.S. foreign tax credits.

Income before income taxes included income of $31.2 million in
1993, a loss of $23.5 million in 1992 and income of
$110.6 million in 1991 from subsidiaries outside the U.S.

Net operating loss carryforwards of $270.7 million at
December 31, 1993 were applicable to certain subsidiaries
outside the U.S. If not utilized against taxable income,
$92.3 million of this amount will expire through the year 2000. 
The remaining $178.4 million has no expiration date.

NOTE 3. POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFITS

Pension Benefits

The Corporation and its subsidiaries in North America and the
United Kingdom have defined-benefit retirement plans (the
principal plans) covering substantially all of their full-time
employees. Retirement benefits are based on years of service
and generally on the average compensation earned in the highest
five of the last 15 years of service. The funding policy is to
contribute assets that, at a minimum, fully fund the
accumulated benefit obligation, subject to regulatory and tax
deductibility limits. Assets held in the pension trusts are
comprised principally of common stocks, high-grade corporate
and government bonds and various short-term investments.

Most other subsidiaries outside the U.S. have pension plans
covering substantially all full-time employees. Obligations
under such plans are provided for by contributing to trusts,
purchasing insurance policies, or recording liabilities.

The components of net pension cost were as follows:

Canadian plans ............. 4.25% 4.50%

Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits

Substantially all retired employees of the Corporation and its
North American subsidiaries are covered by unfunded health care
and life insurance benefit plans. Benefits are based on years
of service and age at retirement. The plans are principally
noncontributory for current retirees, but most future retirees
will pay a portion of the costs. The U.S. plans place a limit
on the Corporation's cost of future annual per capita retiree
medical benefits at no more than 200 percent of the 1992 annual
per capita cost.

Effective January 1, 1992, the Corporation adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS No. 106)
using the immediate transition option. Under SFAS No. 106, the
costs of retiree health care and life insurance benefits are
accrued over relevant employee service periods. Previously,
these costs generally were charged to expense as claims were
paid. The estimated accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (i.e., transition obligation) of $395.0 million,
less related deferred income tax benefits of $150.0 million,
was charged to 1992 income as a cumulative effect of the
accounting change. The net charge of $245.0 million is shown
as a separate item in the consolidated income statement.

The components of postretirement health care and life insurance
benefit costs were as follows:

Accrued postretirement benefit liability ....................... $417.4 $410.0
====== ======

</TABLE> 

The current portion of the accrued postretirement benefit
liability was $27.7 million and $34.1 million as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The December 31, 1993 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was determined using an assumed health care cost
trend rate of 16% in 1994, declining to zero in 2000 and
thereafter, which reflects the previously described limit on
the Corporation's cost of annual per capita retiree medical
benefits. The December 31, 1992 accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation was determined using an assumed health care
cost trend rate of 17% in 1993, declining to zero in 2000 and
thereafter. Assumed discount rates of 7.5% and 8.5% were used
to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
at December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992, respectively.

A one-percentage point increase in the health care cost trend
rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $5.4 million at December 31, 1993 and expense by
$.5 million for the year then ended.

Other Benefits

Voluntary contributory investment plans are provided to
substantially all U.S. employees. Under the plans, the
Corporation matches a portion of employee contributions. Costs
under the plans were $18.0 million, $16.4 million and
$14.9 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

</TABLE>

At December 31, 1992, $200 million of commercial paper was
classified as long-term debt. In February 1993, the
Corporation issued $200 million of 7 7/8% Debentures due
February 1, 2023. The proceeds were used to reduce commercial
paper borrowings.

Scheduled maturities of long-term debt are $159.6 million in
1995, $13.9 million in 1996, $109.2 million in 1997 and
$7.3 million in 1998.

At December 31, 1993, the Corporation had $500 million of
revolving credit facilities with a group of U.S. and European
banks. These facilities, which were unused at December 31,
1993, permit borrowing at competitive interest rates and are
available for general corporate purposes, including backup for
commercial paper borrowings. The Corporation pays commitment
fees on the unused portion but may cancel the facilities
without penalty at any time prior to their expiration. Of
these facilities, $250 million expires on September 30, 1994
and the remainder expires on December 31, 1996.

Debt payable within one year:

Total .............................................. $684.8 $445.3
====== ======

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the estimated fair value of the
Corporation's long-term debt was $1,165.0 million and
$1,183.1 million compared with a carrying value of
$1,062.8 million and $1,107.4 million, respectively. The fair
value of the Corporation's commercial paper and other short-
term debt approximated the carrying amount. These fair values
were based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt
or on current rates offered to the Corporation for obligations
with the same maturities.

NOTE 5. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

The income statements of foreign operations other than those in
hyperinflationary economies are translated into U.S. dollars at
rates of exchange in effect each month. The balance sheets of
these operations are translated at period-end exchange rates,
and the differences from historical exchange rates are
reflected in stockholders' equity as unrealized currency
translation adjustments. 

Summary of unrealized currency translation adjustments:

The income statements and balance sheets of operations in
hyperinflationary economies, i.e., Mexico prior to January 1,
1993, Brazil and Venezuela, are translated into U.S. dollars
using both current and historical rates of exchange. For
balance sheet accounts translated at current exchange rates,
such as cash and accounts receivable, the differences from
historical exchange rates are reflected in income.

Effective December 31, 1992, the Mexican economy was determined
to no longer be hyperinflationary. As a result, the Mexican
peso is considered to be the functional currency of the
Corporation's operations in Mexico. In conjunction with this
change, $25.3 million of deferred income taxes was charged to
unrealized currency translation adjustments in 1992.

The net loss reflected in consolidated net income from the
translation of balance sheet accounts of operations in
hyperinflationary economies and from currency transactions was
$15.7 million in 1993, $9.2 million in 1992 and $6.4 million in
1991.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries periodically enter into
forward contracts which hedge foreign currency exposures
arising from transactions related to their businesses. At
December 31, 1993, the Corporation had outstanding forward
exchange contracts, maturing at various dates in 1994, to
purchase $157 million and to sell $219 million of various
foreign currencies.

Note 6. Equity Participation Plans

Equity Participation Plans adopted in 1976, 1986 and 1992
provide for awards of participation shares and stock options to
key employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Upon maturity, participation share awards are paid in cash
based on the increase in the book value of the Corporation's
common stock during the award period. Participants do not
receive dividends on the participation shares, but their
accounts are credited with dividend shares payable in cash at
the maturity of the award. Neither participation nor dividend
shares are shares of common stock.

</TABLE>

On June 21, 1988, the board of directors declared a
distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each
outstanding share of the Corporation's common stock to
stockholders of record as of July 1, 1988. The rights are
intended to protect the stockholders against abusive takeover
tactics.

A right will entitle its holder to purchase one two-hundredth
of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at
an exercise price of $100, but will not become exercisable
until 10 days after a person or group acquires, or announces a
tender offer which would result in the ownership of, 20 percent
or more of the Corporation's outstanding common shares.

Under certain circumstances, a right will entitle its holder to
acquire either shares of the Corporation's stock or shares of
an acquiring company's common stock, in either event having a
market value of twice the exercise price of the right. At any
time after the acquisition by a person or group of 20 percent
or more, but fewer than 50 percent, of the Corporation's common
shares, the Corporation may exchange the rights, except for
rights held by the acquiring person or group, in whole or in
part, at a rate of one right for one share of the Corporation's
common stock or for one two-hundredth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

The rights may, or after a vote of stockholders at a special
meeting shall, be redeemed at $.005 per right prior to the
acquisition by a person or group of 20 percent or more of the
common stock. Unless redeemed earlier, the rights expire on
June 21, 1998.

The Corporation has 20 million shares of authorized preferred
stock with no par value, none of which has been issued.

At December 31, 1993, unremitted net income of equity companies
included in consolidated retained earnings was $377.2 million.

NOTE 9. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

In 1992, the Corporation announced a restructuring plan to
strengthen its competitive position in consumer and service
products operations in Europe and certain operations in North
America. The plan included eliminating approximately
800 positions, principally in Europe; restructuring
manufacturing facilities at Rouen, France, and Larkfield,
England; discontinuing diaper production at mills in Fullerton,
Calif., and Memphis, Tenn.; writing off the No. 2 newsprint
machine at the Coosa Pines, Ala., mill; and integrating certain
U.S. and Canadian consumer and service products operations.

The $250.0 million pretax cost of the restructuring was charged
to 1992 operating profit. The restructuring reduced 1992 net
income by $172.0 million, or $1.07 per share.

Events and decisions underlying the 1992 restructuring were as
follows:

- - In Europe, the Corporation's earnings had been
unsatisfactory due to weak economies, high marketing
expenses incurred in entering certain markets and defending
against intense competition, and an inability to achieve
sales goals primarily in the tissue business. In 1992,
management decided to significantly reduce costs to improve
its long-term cost structure, competitive position and
financial performance. The cost-cutting measures included
reducing the work force at mills where personnel costs were
too high in relation to competition and focusing on
production of fewer products at each mill to simplify the
manufacturing process. The principal mills affected were in
Rouen, France, and Larkfield, England.

- - In North America, partially in response to the easing of
border restrictions and tariffs, management decided to
integrate certain U.S. and Canadian operations to increase
manufacturing efficiencies and reduce overhead costs. Due
to changes in product design and improved rates of
operation, certain of the Corporation's older diaper
manufacturing equipment was no longer needed. As a
consequence, diaper production was discontinued at mills in
Fullerton, Calif., and Memphis, Tenn.

- - The No. 2 newsprint machine at the Coosa Pines, Ala., mill
was shut down indefinitely in the first quarter of 1992 in
response to weak newsprint markets, and severance costs were
incurred. During the balance of 1992, depreciation
continued to be recorded on the machine while management
assessed its options. In December, management concluded
that there was no profitable manner in which to use the
machine in the foreseeable future, and wrote off the
remaining book value of the machine.

- - Approximately $162 million of the $250 million restructuring
charge related to asset write-offs and $88 million related
to the accrual of liabilities for severance pay and other
cash obligations arising from the restructuring. During
1993, approximately $60 million was disbursed against
$88 million of accrued liabilities established in connection
with the 1992 restructuring. In 1993, as expected, the
Corporation began to realize lower ongoing operating costs
and improved operating cash flow from the restructured
operations.

Independent Auditors' Report

Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Its Directors and Stockholders:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31,
1993 and 1992 and the related consolidated income and cash flow
statements for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements of
Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Subsidiaries present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the companies
at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial
statements, in 1992 the Corporation changed its methods of
accounting for Income Taxes and Postretirement Health Care and
Life Insurance Benefits to conform with Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 and 106, respectively.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Management believes that the following commentary and tables
appropriately discuss and analyze the comparative results of
operations and the financial condition of the Corporation for
the periods covered.

1992 Restructuring and Accounting Changes

The comparability of income statement data is affected by the
following items that occurred in 1992:

- - The Corporation announced a restructuring plan to
strengthen its competitive position in consumer and
service products operations in Europe and certain
operations in North America. The plan included
eliminating approximately 800 positions, principally in
Europe; restructuring manufacturing facilities at
Rouen, France, and Larkfield, England; discontinuing
diaper production at mills in Fullerton, Calif., and
Memphis, Tenn.; writing off the No. 2 newsprint machine
at the Coosa Pines, Ala., mill; and integrating certain
U.S. and Canadian consumer and service products
operations. Additional information concerning events
and decisions which gave rise to the restructuring plan
is presented in Note 9 to the Financial Statements.

The $250.0 million pretax cost of the restructuring was
charged to 1992 operating profit. The restructuring charge
decreased 1992 product class and geographic operating
profit as follows:

</TABLE>

The restructuring reduced 1992 net income by $172.0
million, or $1.07 per share. 

For the purposes of this Management's Discussion and
Analysis, the 1992 restructuring charge has been segregated
in the product class and geographic presentations to
facilitate a meaningful discussion of ongoing operations. 
For a summary of the product class and geographic data
including the restructuring charge, see Note 12 to the
Financial Statements.

- - New required accounting rules were adopted for
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits
and for income taxes. These rules resulted in a one-
time "catch-up" charge of $210.0 million, or $1.31 per
share, against 1992 net income. These changes had no
effect on cash flow. See Notes 2 and 3 to the
Financial Statements.

Product Classes referred to in this Management's Discussion and
Analysis are:

- Class I includes tissue products for household,
commercial, institutional and industrial uses; infant,
child, feminine and incontinence care products;
industrial and commercial wipers; health care products;
and related products.

- Class II includes newsprint, printing papers, premium
business and correspondence papers, tobacco industry
papers and products, technical papers, and related
products.

- Class III includes aircraft services, commercial air
transportation and other products and services. 

Commentary:

Sales volumes increased 2.6 percent compared with 1992, but net
sales declined because of lower selling prices and changes in
currency exchange rates.

- The Corporation reduced selling prices for its Huggies
disposable diapers in the U.S. in October 1992 and
again in June 1993 to match diaper price reductions
announced by a major competitor. These price
reductions were partially offset by U.S. price and
count changes in January 1993 and Canadian price
increases in February 1993. 

- Although sales volumes for Huggies disposable diapers
were flat in North America, this product continues to
be the number one selling brand in the U.S. 

- Selling prices were lower for feminine care products
and facial tissue in the U.S., as well as tobacco
industry papers and products, principally in response
to competitive business conditions. 

- Sales volumes for Huggies Pull-Ups training pants
increased due to the launch of the product in Canada,
the United Kingdom, parts of Continental Europe, Korea
and various other countries and territories. During
1993, private-label and economy-branded competitors
continued to expand distribution of their disposable
training pants nationally in competition with the
Corporation's training pants business, and, in the
fourth quarter, a major competitor initiated regional
introductions of a branded training pant. 

- Sales volumes increased for Depend and Poise
incontinence care products and Huggies baby wipes in
North America, consumer products in Asia and Latin
America, Neenah Paper's premium business and
correspondence papers, and Midwest Express Airlines,
Inc. Sales volumes were lower for household tissue
products in North America.

- Although selling prices for newsprint improved, pricing
remains at depressed levels due to overcapacity and
weak demand in the industry.

- Currency translation, primarily in Europe and Canada,
is estimated to have reduced consolidated sales by $147
million.

Gross profit declined in absolute terms, 6.5 percent, and as a
percentage of sales. 

- Selling prices were lower as previously discussed. 

- Product improvement costs were higher, primarily for
the new Huggies UltraTrim diapers.

- Increased start-up costs were attributable to a new
European facility to support the introduction of
Huggies Pull-Ups training pants and the upcoming launch
of disposable diapers in the United Kingdom and parts
of Continental Europe, and to a new feminine care
products facility in the U.S.

- Industry overcapacity and weak prices in markets for
consumer and industrial bathroom tissue contributed to
continuing poor results for these businesses in North
America and Continental Europe.

- Raw material costs were lower.

Excluding the 1992 restructuring charge, consolidated operating
profit was $793.1 million in 1992 compared with $793.5 million
in 1993. On this basis, operating profit was virtually
unchanged but improved slightly as a percentage of sales.

- In connection with the lower selling prices, promotion
expenses in North America were reduced for disposable
diapers, feminine care products and facial tissue,
which more than offset the decline in gross profit.

- Higher product introduction costs for expansion of
Huggies Pull-Ups training pants, as well as continued
heavy investment to support the upcoming launch of
diapers in Europe, reduced operating profit outside
North America.

- General expense in 1993 included a $6.5 million charge
related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit
brought by a group of property and business owners near
the Coosa Pines, Ala., pulp and newsprint mill.

- General expense in 1992 was reduced by the recovery of
legal fees related to the settlement of diaper
litigation.

- Currency translation is estimated to have reduced
consolidated operating profit by $6 million.

Additional Commentary:

- Excluding the previously mentioned 1992 restructuring
charge and the cumulative effects of accounting
changes, 1993 consolidated net income declined 1.2
percent. 

- Interest expense was higher in 1993 because of higher
debt levels primarily related to capital spending
programs and working capital needs.

- Other income in 1993 included a $9.4 million pretax
gain from the sale of forestland in Alabama.

- Net income was adversely affected by the enactment of
the 1993 Tax Act, which increased the U.S. federal
income tax rate to 35 percent from 34 percent. This
tax change reduced net income by $15.5 million or $.10
per share. Five cents related to 1993 and five cents
related to deferred taxes for prior years. The
effective income tax rate declined to 39.9 percent in
1993 from 40.3 percent in 1992. Significant factors
affecting the comparison were lower operating losses in
certain non-U.S. operations for which no income tax
benefits were recognized in 1993, a lower 1993
effective state income tax rate and lower effective tax
rates associated with certain other non-U.S. operations
in 1993, partially offset by the U.S. tax rate
increase.

- The Corporation's share of net income from equity
companies grew 18.2 percent, primarily from results of
operations in Mexico and Colombia, on the strength of
higher sales volumes and improved selling prices. 
Earnings from Australia declined due to higher start-up
costs and interest expense in 1993, tempered by a lower
income tax rate. An insurance settlement in Australia
also benefited 1992 results. 

- The sale of the assets of the Corporation's Karolton
Envelope business was completed in December 1993.
Neither the sale transaction, nor the operating results
of Karolton, were material to the consolidated
financial statements.

Adjustments:

- Adjustments to sales shown in the preceding tables
consist of intercompany sales of products between
product classes or geographic areas. Adjustments to
operating profit consist of expenses not associated
with product classes or geographic areas.

</TABLE>

Commentary:

- The Corporation's working capital decreased $93.1
million from December 31, 1992 to December 31, 1993. 
Major factors affecting the decline were:

-- a reduction in accounts receivable of $36.4 million
related, in part, to lower net sales, 

-- an increase in inventories of $56.2 million
principally to support the introduction of Huggies
diapers and training pants in Europe and Huggies
Supreme diapers in the U.S., 

-- a decrease in dividends payable of $65.8 million
due to the timing of dividend declarations, 

-- an increase in debt payable within one year of
$239.5 million primarily related to capital
spending programs and working capital needs, and 

-- lower accrued liabilities related to the 1992
restructuring, as discussed in Note 9 to the
Financial Statements.

- In 1993, four cash dividends were paid aggregating
$273.4 million, or $1.70 per share. In 1992, four cash
dividends were paid aggregating $262.8 million, or
$1.64 per share. 

- The ratio of total debt to capital remains outside the
Corporation's target range, in part as a consequence of
the 1992 restructuring charge and the cumulative
effects of the changes in accounting principles. 
Capital is the sum of total debt, minority owners'
interests in subsidiaries and stockholders' equity.

- A shelf registration for $100 million of debt
securities is on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The filing allows flexibility to issue
debt promptly if the Corporation's needs and market
conditions warrant.

- In February 1993, the Corporation issued $200 million
of 7 7/8% Debentures due February 1, 2023. The
proceeds were used to reduce commercial paper
borrowings. See Note 4 to the Financial Statements.

- Revolving credit facilities of $500 million are in
place for general corporate purposes and to back up
commercial paper borrowings.

- The Corporation's long-term debt securities have a
Double-A rating, and its commercial paper is rated in
the top category.

- Management believes that the Corporation's ability to
generate cash from operations and its capacity to issue
short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund

- Consolidated net sales grew $.6 billion since 1990. 
The increase was due to volume, partially offset by
lower selling prices and changes in currency
exchange rates in 1993.

</TABLE>

Excluding the 1992 restructuring charge, operating profit
margins have increased during the last two years as a
result of higher sales volumes, improved manufacturing
efficiencies, cost control measures, lower raw material
costs, and lower marketing expenses which more than offset
lower selling prices in 1993. Other factors affecting
operating profit margins for the last three years were:

- higher product improvement and start-up costs,
particularly in 1993, 

- higher than historical marketing expenses in 1992
and 1991,

- lower net price realizations for newsprint in 1992
and continuing in 1993, 

- poor results for consumer and industrial bathroom
tissue businesses in North America and Continental
Europe in the past two years, and

- litigation settlements in 1993 and 1992.

Net income .......................................................... +278.6 -73.6

</TABLE>

- The decline in net sales in 1993 was a result of lower
selling prices and currency translation as previously
discussed. The increase in 1992 primarily was a result
of higher sales volumes.

- Gross profit declined in 1993, principally because of
the lower selling prices. It grew in 1992, primarily
as a result of higher sales volumes.

- Excluding the effect of the 1992 restructuring charge,
operating profit grew .1 percent in 1993 and
6.9 percent in 1992. Factors affecting 1993 operating
profit have been discussed previously. The 1992
improvement was primarily attributable to the higher
sales volumes and improved operating efficiencies at
certain manufacturing facilities, partially offset by
higher marketing expenses.

- Excluding the 1992 restructuring charge, income before
cumulative effects of accounting changes declined 1.2
percent in 1993 and grew 1.7 percent in 1992. On a per
share basis, it declined 1.2 percent in 1993 and grew
1.3 percent in 1992.

- The effective income tax rate declined to 39.9 percent
in 1993 after increasing to 40.3 percent in 1992 from
34.5 percent in 1991. The higher effective income tax
rates in the last two years were primarily caused by
operating losses in certain non-U.S. operations for
which no income tax benefits were recognized, the 1993
U.S. tax rate increase and 1991 tax effects from the
disposition of a subsidiary, as discussed below.

- Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company, a former 50.5-
percent-owned Canadian newsprint subsidiary, was
disposed of in the fourth quarter of 1991. The
transaction benefited 1991 net income by $20.0 million,
or $.13 per share. 

- Share of net income of equity companies increased in
the last three years, especially at Kimberly-Clark de
Mexico, S.A. de C.V., which benefited primarily from
higher sales volumes and from higher selling prices in
1993.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

During 1993, legislation was introduced in the United States
Congress and certain states requiring the inclusion of
secondary fiber in newsprint and certain other paper products. 
No such legislation was enacted that had or is expected to have
a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business. It is
believed that similar legislation will be introduced in 1994 in
the United States Congress and certain states. The Corporation
is unable to determine the effect, if any, which such
legislation, if enacted, would have on its business or on its
consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 

The Corporation is subject to federal, state and local
environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to
its business operations and is operating in compliance with, or
taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with, such laws and
regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations is not
expected to materially affect the Corporation's business or
competitive position. Management does not believe that the
Corporation has been identified as a potentially responsible
party at an Environmental Protection Agency-designated cleanup
site which could have a material adverse impact on the
Corporation's business or results of operations. Additional
information concerning environmental matters is disclosed in
the Corporation's annual report to the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993
under the "Business" and "Legal Proceedings" sections.

OUTLOOK - 1994 

Management expects more intense competition in its disposable
training pants business in 1994 due, in part, to an anticipated
wider distribution of a training pants product by a major
competitor in the U.S. At this time, management is unable to
determine the effect of this competition on its future results
of operations. Management also expects to continue to invest
heavily to support the Corporation's introduction of training
pants in Europe and its 1994 launch of diapers there. 

Beginning in 1993, management took steps to exit businesses
that do not meet its strategic objectives of building on the
Corporation's core technologies, well-known trademarks and
strong product franchises. The assets of the Corporation's
Karolton Envelope business were sold in 1993, and the sale of
the Corporation's adhesive-coated label stock business is
pending. Management expects to continue to review all of its
businesses to determine their ability to meet strategic
objectives. Those businesses that are unable to meet these
objectives may become candidates for divestiture.
