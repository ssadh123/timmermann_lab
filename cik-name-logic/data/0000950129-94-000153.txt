Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity with respect thereto. Except as
provided in the licenses set forth on Schedule 4.15(a), each of the
Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities has not
given and is not bound by any agreement of indemnification for any Proprietary
Right as to any property manufactured, used or sold by the Partnership or the
applicable Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity, as the case may be.

(d) To Seller's knowledge, no Person is infringing upon
any Proprietary Rights nor has misappropriated or improperly disclosed any
Trade Secret.

(e) To Seller's knowledge, no operation of the
Partnership, the Affiliated Entities or the Controlled Subsidiaries is
infringing, or has infringed, any foreign or domestic patent, trademark,
service mark, trade name or copyright of any Person, or is involved in any
misappropriation or improper use or disclosure of any Trade Secrets, of any
Person.

(f) All proofs of use, renewals and all fees, annuities
and other payments that are due with respect to the Proprietary Rights have
been met or paid.

Entities pursuant to agreements with respect to the Proprietary Rights have
been performed and, to Seller's knowledge, no Person party to any such
agreement is materially in default in any respect thereunder.

4.16 Partnership Name. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or,
to Seller's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Partnership which
would result in any impairment of the right of the Partnership to use its name.
To Seller's knowledge, the use of the name of the Partnership does not infringe
the rights of any third Person nor is it confusingly similar with the name of
any third Person.

4.17 Customers. Set forth on Schedule 4.17 is a complete and
accurate list of the Partnership's, the Controlled Subsidiaries' and the
Affiliated Entities top 20 customers during the 12-month period ended October

Partnership or any Controlled Subsidiary or
Affiliated Entity, either of the partners of the
Partnership or any of their officers, directors or

- 13 -
<PAGE> 21
(m) agreement or obligation of the Partnership or any
Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity to pay any
royalty or similar charge for the use or exploitation
of any tangible or intangible property other than a
lease or an agreement under which the Partnership or
any Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity is
lessee of any tangible property or real property;

(n) except for the types of agreements covered by another
subsection of this Section, agreement or other
commitment or arrangement with any Person continuing
for a period beyond the Closing Date that involves an
expenditure or receipt by the Partnership or any
Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity in excess
of $50,000 individually or $200,000 in the aggregate;

(o) joint venture, partnership, joint operating or
similar agreement;

(p) standard warranties for products the Partnership or
any Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity
manufactures or supplies; and

(q) other Contracts not made in the ordinary course of
business or that are material to the operations,
business, prospects or financial condition of the
Partnership or any Controlled Subsidiary or
Affiliated Entity.

To the extent requested, each of the Partnership, the Controlled
Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities has furnished accurate and complete
copies of the foregoing Contracts to Purchaser. All such Contracts are in full
force and effect and are valid, binding, subsisting and enforceable, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and
remedies generally and general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). Each of the
Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities is not,
and to Seller's knowledge no other party is, in default under any of such
Contracts, and there is no existing breach, violation, default, event of
default or event, occurrence or act by the Partnership or any Controlled
Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity or, to Seller's knowledge, by any other party
thereto that, with or without the giving of notice, lapse of time or the
occurrence of any other event, would constitute a default. Except as to
insurance policies in Seller's or any of its subsidiaries' name, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not affect
the continuance in full force and effect of such Contracts. Seller has no
knowledge of any plan or intention of any other party to any such Contract to
exercise any right to cancel or terminate any such Contract in advance of its
normal maturity or termination date, and Seller does not know of any fact that
would justify the exercise of such right. None of the Partnership's or any
Controlled Subsidiaries' or Affiliated Entities' customers or suppliers, which
during the fiscal year ended October 31, 1993 accounted for 5% or more of the
Partnership's or any Controlled Subsidiaries' of Affiliated Entities' sales or
purchases, has refused, or indicated to the Partnership, the Controlled
Subsidiaries, the Affiliated Entities or Seller that it will or may refuse, to
purchase or supply goods or services, as the case may be, or that it will or
may substantially reduce the amount of goods or services that it is willing to
purchase from, or sell to, the Partnership or any Controlled Subsidiary or
Affiliated Entity after the date hereof or that it will or may substantially
increase the price for such goods or services.

4.19 Tax Liabilities and Status.

(a) Filed. To the best of Seller's knowledge, all Tax Returns
required to be filed with, or furnished to, any Taxing Authority by the
Partnership or any Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity as of the Closing
Date, have been timely filed or furnished to the appropriate Person when due in
accordance with all applicable laws.

(b) Paid. To the best of Seller's knowledge, the Partnership, the
Controlled Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities have timely paid, withheld
or established adequate reserves for all Taxes due prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Correctness. To the best of Seller's knowledge, all Tax
returns, reports, or forms filed by the Partnership, the Controlled
Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities correctly and fairly reflect the Taxes
of the Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries or the Affiliated Entities, as
the case may be, for the periods covered thereby.

(d) Not Delinquent. To the best of Seller's knowledge, except
with respect to certain amended state partnership returns reflecting changes
resulting from a 1987 Internal Revenue Service examination that have not yet
been filed, neither the Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries nor any
Affiliated Entity is delinquent in the payment of any Tax, nor is there any Tax
deficiency or delinquency asserted or threatened against the Partnership, the
Controlled Subsidiaries or any Affiliated Entity, nor is there any unpaid
assessment, proposal for additional Taxes, deficiency, or delinquency in the
payment of any of the Taxes of the Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries or
any Affiliated Entity that could be asserted by any Taxing Authority with
respect to any period ending on or before the Closing Date.

(e) Audit. To the best of Seller's knowledge, except as set forth
on Schedule 4.19(e), there are no pending, or to Seller's knowledge,
threatened, income tax audits of the Partnership and the five largest
Affiliated Entities or Controlled Subsidiaries (based on October 31, 1993
revenues, a list of which Affiliated Entities or Controlled Subsidiaries is set
forth on Schedule 4.19(e)).

(f) No Extensions. To the best of Seller's knowledge, except as
set forth on Schedule 4.19(f), neither the Partnership nor any Controlled
Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity has granted any extension to any Taxing
Authority of the limitations period during which any Tax liability may be
assessed or collected.

(g) No Violations. To the best of Seller's knowledge, neither the
Partnership nor any Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity has violated or
failed to comply with any Tax law that would result in the assessment or
collection of a material amount of Taxes from the Partnership, the Controlled
Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities by a Taxing Authority.

(h) Withholding. To the best of Seller's knowledge, all monies
required to be withheld or collected by the Partnership, the Controlled
Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities and the portion of any such Taxes to
be paid by the Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries and the Affiliated
Entities to Taxing Authorities have been collected or withheld and either paid
to the respective Taxing Authority or set aside in accounts for such purposes.

- 15 -
<PAGE> 23
(i) Financial Statements. To the best of Seller's knowledge, the
liabilities shown in the Financial Statements (rather than any notes thereto)
and to be accrued on the books and records of the Partnership through the
Closing Date for Taxes (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established
to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income), computed as if the
partial year beginning with the first day of the fiscal year and ending with
the Closing Date were a complete Tax year ending on the Closing Date, (i) will
be adequate accruals with respect to the Tax liabilities of the Partnership,
the Controlled Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities, and (ii) have been and
will be accrued in a manner consistent with the practices previously used by
the Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities for
accruing Tax liabilities. For this Agreement, all references to the
Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities shall
include any entities that merged with or into the Partnership, the Controlled
Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities.

(j) New York Real Property. The Partnership, the Controlled
Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities do not own any interest in real
property in the State of New York.

(k) Tax Indemnity Agreements. To the best of Seller's knowledge,
the Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities are
currently under no Contractual obligation to indemnify any other person with
respect to Taxes. The Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries and the
Affiliated Entities are not and never have been a party to or bound by any Tax
sharing, Tax allocation, or similar agreement or arrangement.

4.20 Employee Benefit Plans and Arrangements; ERISA.

(a) Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.18(a) and (b),
neither the Partnership, nor any ERISA Affiliate, sponsors, maintains, or
otherwise is a party to any pension, profit sharing, thrift or other retirement
plan, employee stock ownership plan, deferred compensation plan or arrangement,
stock option, stock purchase, performance share, bonus or other incentive plan,
severance plan, health, group insurance or other welfare plan, or other similar
plan, agreement, policy or understanding, whether formal or informal, including
without limitation any "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA whether or not such plan is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and whether or not such plan, agreement, policy or
understanding is or has been administered or maintained in compliance with
ERISA, under which the Partnership or an ERISA Affiliate has any current or
future obligation or liability or under which any present or former employee's
dependents or beneficiaries, has any current or future right to benefits (each
such plan, agreement, policy or understanding being hereinafter referred to
individually as a "Plan"). Neither the Partnership nor any ERISA Affiliate has
any formal plan or commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create any
additional Plan or modify or change any existing Plan that would affect any
present or former employee of the Partnership, or such present or former
employee's dependents or beneficiaries. Schedule 4.20(a) identifies each Plan
which is (i) subject to Title IV of ERISA (a "Title IV Plan"), (ii) maintained
in connection with any trust described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code or
(iii) intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(b) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the
Partnership or any ERISA Affiliate since the effective date of ERISA that has
not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material
risk to the Partnership or an ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability under
Title IV

- 16 -
<PAGE> 24
of ERISA, other than liability for premiums due to the PBGC. Moreover, there
are no circumstances pursuant to which the Partnership may be liable to the
PBGC with respect to any Title IV Plan sponsored or previously sponsored by an
entity other than the Partnership, including any predecessor of the
Partnership, any former employer of any present or former employee of the
Partnership if such former employer (or the assets of such former employer) was
acquired by or merged into the Partnership, or any ERISA Affiliate of the
Partnership.

(c) The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any Title
IV Plan and no condition exists that presents a material risk that such
proceedings will be instituted. No "reportable event", within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA and regulations promulgated thereunder, and no event
described in Sections 4062 or 4063 of ERISA, have occurred in connection with
any Plan. With respect to each Title IV Plan, the fair market value of the
assets of each such plan (excluding for these purposes any accrued but unpaid
contributions) exceed the present value of accrued benefits under such Title IV
Plan determined on a termination basis using the actuarial assumptions
established by the PBGC and currently in effect.

(d) Full payment has been made, or will be made in accordance with
Section 404(a)(6) of the Code, of all amounts which the Partnership is required
to pay under the terms of each Plan as of the last day of the most recent Plan
year thereof ended prior to the date of this Agreement. All such amounts
properly accrued through the Closing Date with respect to the current Plan year
thereof will be paid by the Partnership on or prior to the Closing Date or have
been properly accrued in the Financial Statements. No Plan or any trust
established thereunder has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not
waived. No ERISA Affiliate of the Partnership has failed to make a
contribution to a Plan which could reasonably be expected to subject the
Partnership to any liability under ERISA.

(e) Neither the Partnership nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever
participated in, or has any liability or contingent liability under, a
multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

(f) Each of the Plans covering any employee or former employee of
the Partnership has been maintained and administered in all material respects
in accordance with applicable Laws, including but not limited to the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, the Older Workers Benefit
Protection Act of 1990, Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1986, as amended ("COBRA"), ERISA and the Code, and all
notices that are required to be given under applicable Law to employees or
their dependents or beneficiaries with respect to each Plan have been timely
given. All reports required by any governmental agency with respect to each of
the Plans, including annual reports on Form 5500, covering any employee or
former employee of the Partnership have been timely filed. To the best of
Seller's knowledge, there are no pending, threatened or anticipated claims or
actions with respect to any Plan covering any employee or former employee of
the Partnership (other than routine claims for benefits by employees covered
under any such Plan and their beneficiaries). No "prohibited transaction", as
defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code has occurred with
respect to any Plan, excluding transactions effected pursuant to a statutory or
administrative exemption. No Tax under Section 4980B of the Code has been
incurred, or is reasonably expected to be incurred, in respect of any Plan that
is a group health plan as defined in Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code.

(g) No Lien has been filed by any person or entity on the assets
of the Partnership or any ERISA Affiliate relating to the operation or
maintenance of the Plans and no Lien exists by operation of Law or otherwise on
the assets of the Partnership as a result of the operation or maintenance of
the Plans,

- 17 -
<PAGE> 25
and Seller has no knowledge of the existence of facts or circumstances that
would reasonably likely result in the imposition of such a Lien.

(h) Each Plan that is intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is, and has been during the period from
its adoption to date, so qualified, both as to form and operation and all
necessary governmental approvals, including a favorable determination as to the
qualification under the Code of each of such Plans and each amendment thereto,
have been obtained. Each trust created under any such Plan and each trust
described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code is exempt from federal income
taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code and has been so exempt during the
period from creation to date. Future compliance with the requirements of ERISA
and the Code as in effect on the Closing Date or any collective bargaining
agreements to which the Partnership is a party will not result in any increase
in the rate of benefit accrual under any of the Plans.

(i) No Plan is, or has been during the twelve-month period ending
on the Closing Date, under investigation or audit by any regulatory authority,
including the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Labor, and neither
the Partnership nor a representative of any Plan has been notified by any
regulatory authority of an intent to commence an investigation or audit of a
Plan. There are no proceedings or requests for rulings, determinations or
opinions pending with the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Labor
with respect to any Plan.

(j) With respect to any Plan that is maintained for the benefit of
employees of the Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries or the Affiliated
Entities located outside of the United States, (i) such Plan has been funded
and maintained in compliance with all Laws applicable thereto and the
requirements of such Plan's governing documents and (ii) no liability exists
with respect to such Plan which has given rise to, or could give rise to, a
Lien on any of the assets of the Partnership or any Controlled Subsidiary or
Affiliated Entity.

(k) Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.20(k), the Partnership does
not provide, and is not obligated to provide, benefits, including without
limitation death, health, medical, or hospitalization benefits (whether or not
insured), with respect to its current or former employees, their dependents or
beneficiaries beyond their retirement or other termination of employment other
than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits or retirement
benefits under any "employee pension benefit plan", as that term is defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA, (iii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as
liabilities in the Financial Statements or (iv) benefits the full cost of which
is borne by the current or former employee (or his beneficiary). Any benefit
provided under a Plan to current or former employees of the Partnership, their
dependents or beneficiaries beyond their retirement or other termination of
employment may be modified or terminated by the Partnership at any time without
liability to the Partnership.

(l) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not: (i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of
the Partnership to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee or officer, (iii) cause any amounts payable with respect to the Plans
to fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section
280G of the Code or (iv) to Seller's knowledge, result in any prohibited
transaction described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code for
which an exemption is not available.

- 18 -
<PAGE> 26
(m) A true and complete copy of: (i) each Plan that covers any
employee or former employee of the Partnership (and, if applicable, related
trust agreements) and all amendments thereto and written interpretations
thereof have been furnished to Purchaser together with the most recent
favorable determination letter, if any, with respect to each Plan, (ii) the
most recent annual reports prepared in connection with any such Plan (Form 5500
including all applicable schedules), (iii) the most recent actuarial valuation
report prepared in connection with any such Plan and (iv) the most recently
disseminated summary plan description relating to each Plan and any summary of
material modifications made after the date thereof.

4.21 Labor Relations. (a) To the best of Seller's knowledge,
no employee who is material to the operations of the Business has any plans to
terminate his relationship with the Partnership or the applicable Controlled
Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity and to Seller's knowledge, the Partnership or
the applicable Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity has no intention of
terminating the relationship with any such employee.

(b) Neither the Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries nor the
Affiliated entities permit employees to carryover unused vacation time to
subsequent years or are obligated to make, or have agreed to make, payments to
employees in lieu of vacation time.

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.18(a), there exists no
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to any
employee of the Partnership or any Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity.
The Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries and the Affiliated Entities have
not received any written notification of any unfair labor practice charges or
complaints pending before any agency having jurisdiction thereof nor are there
any current union representation claims involving any of the employees of the
Partnership or the applicable Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity.
Further, Seller is not aware of any such threatened charges or claims.

(d) Seller is not aware of any union organizing activities or
proceedings involving, or any pending petitions for recognition of, a labor
union or association as the exclusive bargaining agent for, or where the
purpose is to organize, any group or groups of employees of the Partnership or
any Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity. There is not currently
pending, with regard to any of its facilities, any proceeding before the
National Labor Relations Board, wherein any labor organization is seeking
representation of any employees of the Partnership or any Controlled Subsidiary
or Affiliated Entity.

(e) Seller is not aware of any strikes, work stoppages, work
slowdowns, or lockouts nor of any threats thereof, by or with respect to any of
the employees of the Partnership or any Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated
Entity. There have been no labor disputes, strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages,
lockouts or similar matters involving employees of the Partnership or any
Controlled Subsidiary or Affiliated Entity.

(f) There are not pending any material grievances filed by any
Controlled Subsidiary's, Affiliated Entity's or the Partnership's employees
within any collective bargaining unit or by representatives of employees within
any collective bargaining unit.

4.22 Insurance. The Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries and
the Affiliated Entities have not been refused any insurance coverage sought or
applied for, and the Partnership, the Controlled Subsidiaries and the
Affiliated Entities have no reason to believe that it will be unable to renew
its

- 19 -
<PAGE> 27
existing insurance coverage or obtain substantially comparable coverage as and
when the same shall expire upon terms at least as favorable as those presently
in effect, other than possible increases in premiums that do not result from
any act or omission of the Partnership or any Controlled Subsidiary or
Affiliated Entity. To Seller's knowledge, the Partnership has not failed to
give any notice or present any presently existing claims under any insurance
policy in due and timely fashion.

4.23 Accuracy of Information Furnished. No representation or
warranty by Seller in this Agreement, any Schedule hereto or in any certificate
or other documents provided herein to be executed by Seller and delivered to
Purchaser under this Agreement contains any untrue statement of a material fact
or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements herein or
therein not false or misleading. The Partnership have provided to Purchaser
originals or true, correct and complete copies of all information and documents
requested by or on behalf of Purchaser.

4.24 Illegal or Unauthorized Payments; Political Contributions.
Neither the Partnership, any of its Affiliates, any of their officers or
employees, nor to the best knowledge of Seller, any Affiliated Entity or
subsidiary of the Partnership that is not its Affiliate or officers or
employees of any of them, any agents or other representatives of the
Partnership or any Affiliated Entities nor any other business entity or
enterprise with which the Partnership or any Affiliated Entity is or has been
affiliated, has, directly or indirectly, made or authorized any payment,
contribution or gift or money, property or services, whether or not in
contravention of applicable law, (a) as a kickback or bribe to any Person or
(b) to any political organization, or the holder of or any aspirant to any
elective or appointive public office, except for personal political
contributions not involving the direct or indirect use of funds of the
Partnership or such Affiliated Entities.
