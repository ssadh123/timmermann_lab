WILMINGTON, Del., April 22 -- DuPont today announced that it has 
settled 220 of its "Benlate" DF 50 fungicide lawsuits for various amounts 
totaling about $214 million. This settlement is fully covered by previous 
charges to earnings. Details of the settlement are confidential. The 
settlement follows two recent verdicts in a Florida trial in which a jury 
found Benlate to be free of defects.
The settled cases, handled by the law firm of Krupnick, Campbell, 
Malone, Roselli, Buser and Slama, located in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., represent 
almost half of pending Benlate litigation.
"The scientific evidence proves Benlate is not defective. DuPont 
remains convinced that Benlate is not responsible for alleged crop damage and 
DuPont will continue to prove this in ongoing matters," said John F. Schmutz, 
DuPont Senior Vice President and Special Counsel.
"At the same time, the disheartening but pervasive economics are 
that, in most of these Benlate cases, litigation costs exceed settlement 
costs. Therefore, after several months of negotiations, we have concluded a 
settlement which we believe to be in our best interest," he noted. "Winning

jury trials does not always justify the economic costs -- management focus and 
time, money and other corporate resources -- required to uphold the integrity 
of our product. This is a sad commentary that once again illustrates just how 
badly this country's tort law system is out of control."
With today's settlement, more than half of the 560 lawsuits brought 
against the company since 1991 have been disposed of. Excluding today's 
settlement, more than 70 Benlate cases have been disposed of by courts, juries 
and settlements, many in DuPont's favor. Even where juries have awarded 
growers any damages, those damages have been, on average, less than a third of 
what they sought, and growers have been found to share responsibility for 
their claimed losses.
"Now we can focus energy and resources on the remaining issues and 
increase our attention to the business of new product discovery and tech- 
nology, for which DuPont is recognized worldwide," Schmutz added.
To date, DuPont has accrued $476 million after tax for estimated 
costs in excess of insurance coverage in connection with the recall of 
Benlate. The Company will continue to evaluate its position to determine 
whether the remaining reserve is adequate.

WILMINGTON, Del., April 25 -- DuPont reported net 
income for the first quarter of 1994 of $642 million, or $.94 
per share, compared with $493 million, or $.73 per share, earned 
in the first quarter 1993. Excluding a prior-year $32 million 
nonrecurring gain from exchange of North Sea petroleum 
properties, first quarter 1994 net income was up 39 percent, 
principally due to lower costs.
The first quarter earnings announced today mark the 
company's best quarterly performance since 1990. "Our people 
have made terrific progress in transforming the company," said 
Chief Executive Officer Edgar S. Woolard. "Although not yet 
complete, the restructuring efforts are having a significant 
positive impact on our bottom line performance. Everything 
we've done, all the hard work by our employees, is coming 
together. Excluding the 1993 nonrecurring item, every one of 
our industry segments posted earnings gains over last year."
Sales totaled $9.2 billion, up $120 million or 
1 percent. Despite lower worldwide crude oil prices, Petroleum 
segment sales were up 2 percent versus last year on higher

<PAGE>

worldwide natural gas prices and volumes and higher inter-
national crude oil volumes. For combined segments other than 
Petroleum, sales were up 1 percent, reflecting 5 percent higher 
volume, partly offset by 4 percent lower selling prices.
"Our significant reduction in costs is having the 
desired effect on our earnings," Woolard said, "but it's also 
important to note that, compared to last year, we are seeing 
increased demand in key markets for a number of our businesses, 
including automotive products, engineering polymers, nylon, 
'Lycra' spandex, and nonwovens. Not only is demand generally 
improved in the United States, but market conditions are better 
in Europe and Asia, where our chemicals and specialties sales 
are up 15 percent and 6 percent respectively."
Petroleum segment earnings were $215 million, up 
$15 million, or 8 percent, excluding the prior-year property 
exchange benefit. The earnings improvement is attributable to 
stronger domestic downstream performance, reflecting higher 
refined product margins. Upstream earnings were down 5 percent, 
reflecting a drop of more than 20 percent in crude oil prices. 
Higher worldwide natural gas prices and volumes, higher crude 
oil volumes outside of the United States, and lower costs were 
sufficient to offset most of the impact of the lower crude oil 
prices.

<PAGE>

Chemicals segment earnings were $83 million, up 
$14 million, or 20 percent, attributable to better results for 
fluorochemicals and specialty chemicals. Sales decreased 
1 percent, as 3 percent higher volume was more than offset by a 
4 percent decline in selling prices.
Fibers segment earnings of $144 million were up 
$42 million, or 41 percent, as improvements in nylon and "Lycra" 
spandex were partly offset by lower results for "Dacron" 
polyester. Segment results reflect lower costs and an 
improvement in European business from weaker conditions a year 
ago. Segment sales were 14 percent higher. After adjusting for 
additional sales from the acquisition of ICI's nylon business, 
sales volume was up 6 percent. Prices were down 2 percent, 
principally from the currency effect of a stronger dollar.
Polymers segment earnings were $147 million, up 
$70 million or 91 percent from last year. Both automotive 
products and engineering polymers improved significantly, 
reflecting lower costs and higher sales. Adjusting for the 
absence of sales from the acrylics business divested last year, 
segment sales were up 5 percent, reflecting 9 percent higher 
volume, partly offset by 4 percent lower prices.
Diversified Businesses segment earnings totaled 
$148 million, up $41 million or 38 percent from the prior year. 
This reflects earnings improvements in crop protection chemicals 
and printing and publishing, primarily from lower costs. 
Segment sales were down 1 percent after adjusting for prior-year

divestitures of the connector systems and sporting goods 
businesses, primarily reflecting lower sales of crop protection 
chemicals and medical products in the United States.
"Our improved performance is a solid indication that 
our strategies are providing the ability for us to improve, even 
if overall economic conditions are not in our favor," said 
Woolard.
