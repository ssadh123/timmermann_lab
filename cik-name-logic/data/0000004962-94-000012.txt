Item 5. Other Events

On May 31, 1994, American Express Company issued the following
press release:

NEW YORK, May 31, 1994 -- American Express Company today announced
that it has completed the distribution of a special tax-free dividend
consisting of approximately 98.2 million shares of Lehman Brothers common
stock to its shareholders of record on May 20, 1994. This represents all of
the Lehman common stock held by American Express.

Shareholders of American Express are receiving one share of Lehman
Brothers common stock for each five common shares of American Express held on
the record date. In lieu of fractional shares, shareholders will receive
cash.

As a result of the distribution, Lehman Brothers common stock will
begin "regular-way" trading on the New York Stock Exchange today; it has been
trading on a "when-issued" basis since May 2, 1994. Lehman Brothers common
stock trades under the symbol LEH. American Express shares, which trade under
the symbol AXP, have been trading both "regular way" and on a "when-issued"
basis since May 2. As of today, the "regular way" trading price of American
Express shares will reflect the spin-off.

Lehman Brothers is a global investment bank with leadership
positions in corporate and municipal finance, advisory services, and in
securities research, sales and trading. Lehman Brothers serves the financial
needs of corporate, government, and institutional clients and high-net-worth
individuals through 44 offices in major financial centers worldwide.

American Express Company, a diversified travel and financial
services company founded in 1850, is a world leader in charge cards, Travelers
Cheques, travel, financial planning and international banking.
