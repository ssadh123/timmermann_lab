REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholder
Norandex Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Norandex Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Noranda
Aluminum, Inc., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Noranda
Finance Inc., as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related consolidated statements of operations and retained
deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Effective with the close of business on August 31, 1994, the
Common Stock of Norandex Inc. was acquired by an unrelated party.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Norandex Inc. at December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements, in
1993 the Company changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefits and income taxes, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 1993

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

Norandex Inc. (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Noranda Aluminum,
Inc. (the Parent), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Noranda Finance Inc.
in 1993 and 1992. Through 1991, the Company was a majority-owned subsidiary
of Noranda Aluminum, Inc. and partially owned by the Corporate officers
of Norandex Inc. (see Note 3). The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Master Shield,
Inc. (Mastershield) which was sold in February 1993. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Earnings per share data has not been provided because Norandex Inc.
is wholly owned by Noranda Finance Inc.

Norandex Inc. is a national manufacturer and distributor of building
materials for residential new construction and remodeling. The Company
manufactures vinyl siding and sells vinyl siding and other purchased
products to the home building industry through its distribution network.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed
principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets for financial reporting purposes.

PENSION

Pension cost accruals are funded as required by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA).

GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired and is generally amortized using the straight-line method over
periods ranging from 10 to 15 years. The carrying value of goodwill is
reviewed if the facts and circumstances suggest that it may be impaired.

2. INVENTORIES

The components of inventory, stated at the lower of cost or market, are:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
DECEMBER 31
1993 1992
-------- -------
(IN THOUSANDS)
<S> <C> <C>
Work-in-process and finished goods $22,506 $22,636
Raw materials 1,409 3,057
------- -------
Inventories on the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method $23,915 $25,693
------- -------
------- -------
</TABLE>

3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

ADVANCES PAYABLE TO PARENT

Advances payable to Parent represents the net amount due to the Parent for
activity between the Company and its Parent. Generally, this balance is
increased by automatic cash transfers from the Parent to reimburse the
Company's bank accounts and certain expenses charged to the Company such as
interest and income taxes. The balance is decreased through daily cash
deposits by the Company to the Parent's bank account. The Company is charged
interest at 1/2% over the prime rate on advances from its Parent. There are
no formal debt instruments representing the advances.

DIVIDEND PAYMENT

In January 1992, the Parent repurchased the Corporate officers' 9.1% share
of the Common Stock and entered into an agreement requiring the payment of
dividends back to the Parent, based on a percentage formula of current
earnings. Dividends are required to be declared and paid in January of
the year subsequent to each year end, beginning December 31, 1992.

Norandex Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

4. PENSION PLANS

The Company participates in a defined benefit plan sponsored by Noranda
Finance Inc. Benefits under the plan are based on years of service and/or
salary levels prior to retirement.

Noranda Finance Inc. charged the Company $495,000, $488,000, and $1,222,000
with respect to its plan in 1993, 1992, and 1991 respectively. In 1993,
the Company recorded a curtailment gain of $477,000 as a result of the sale
of Master Shield and the termination of those employees from the Noranda
Finance Inc. plan. This gain has been included in the gain on sale of this
facility (see Note 9). In 1991, the Company terminated its participation in
a union multiemployer plan for its former window and door manufacturing
hourly workers (see Note 8).

The following assumptions were used in accounting for the defined
benefit plan:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
1993 1992 1991
---- ---- ----
<S> <C> <C> <C>
Discount rate 7.50% 9.00% 9.25%
Annual compensation increase 5.00 6.00 7.50
Expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets 9.25 9.50 9.25
</TABLE>

The plan's funding policy is for its participating companies to contribute
such amounts as are deemed necessary on an actuarial basis to provide the plan
with assets sufficient to meet the benefits to be paid to the plan
participants. The Company's allocation of the Noranda Finance, Inc. net
accrued pension liability was $4,060,000 and $4,042,000 at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively, which is classified in the balance sheet in
deferred liabilities and credits.

The decrease in the discount rate from 9.00% to 7.50% resulted in a significant
increase in the accumulated benefit obligation of the plan. The increase had a
nominal impact on current year pension expense.

5. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company provides life insurance benefits for eligible active and retired
employees. These plans are unfunded, and the Company retains the right to
modify or eliminate these benefits.

11

<PAGE>
Norandex Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

5. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (CONTINUED)

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106), for its unfunded life insurance
program. This Statement requires the accrual of the cost of postretirement
benefits during the service lives of the employees. As prior years' cost
were recognized as expense when incurred by the Company, postretirement
benefit cost is not comparable with 1992 and 1991. The accounting change
resulted in a 1993 charge to earnings of $396,000, net of taxes of $266,000.

Components of the 1993 postretirement benefit expense were (in thousands):

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Service cost of benefits earned $ 36
Interest cost on liability 57
----
Net postretirement benefit cost $ 93

</TABLE>

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) classified in the
balance sheet in deferred liabilities and credits at December 31, 1993
was (in thousands):

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Retirees $102
Active participants 560
----
APBO $662
----
----
</TABLE>

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined using an
8.75% discount rate and an assumed compensation increase of 6%.

6. INCOME TAXES

The Company is a member of the Noranda Finance Inc. consolidated group
for federal income tax purposes. Certain state returns are filed on a unitary
basis together with other members of the consolidated group.

Noranda Finance Inc.'s tax allocation policy requires each member of the
consolidated group to provide federal income tax at the maximum statutory
rate, adjusted for applicable credits, applied to income before income taxes.
The charge (credit) in lieu of federal income tax represents amounts
charged (credited) in accordance with this policy. State and local income
taxes are computed on a separate return basis after consideration of unitary
filings. Income tax benefits or liabilities are reflected in advances payable
to Parent.

12

<PAGE>
Norandex Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

6. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by
FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," (SFAS 109). As
permitted under the new rules, prior years' financial statements have not
been restated.

The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109 as of January 1, 1993 was to
increase net income by $1,946,000.

The Company's effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate
primarily due to amortization of goodwill. Significant temporary differences
include depreciation, inventory capitalization and accrued expenses which
are deductible for tax purposes as economic performance occurs.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards
for state income tax purposes of approximately $18,590,000.

7. LEASE OBLIGATIONS

The Company operates certain manufacturing and warehouse facilities under
operating leases which expire principally during the next nine years. In most
cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, leases will
be renewed or replaced with other leases.

The following is a schedule of future minimum rental payments required under
operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms
in excess of one year as of December 31, 1993 (in thousands):

------- ------ ------

</TABLE>

Contingent rentals represent transportation equipment operating lease
payments made on the basis of mileage.

8. SHUTDOWN COSTS

In the fourth quarter of 1990, the Company's Board of Directors approved a
plan to shutdown two production facilities that manufactured aluminum
and vinyl windows and doors in favor of purchasing windows and doors from
outside suppliers. This shutdown has been accounted for as a shutdown
of a portion of a line of business. The Company recorded a shutdown charge
of $10,500,000 in 1990 based on estimated shutdown costs, including estimated
operating losses through the date of shutdown.

In 1991, the Company shutdown the two production facilities and recorded
additional shutdown charges totaling $1,500,000 million principally due to
underestimating plant site restoration costs and plant operating losses
prior to the respective dates of shutdown. Also in 1991, the Company sold
fixed assets previously used as production equipment to a building products
manufacturer in exchange for a $1,600,000 note receivable. The Company had
entered into a five-year supply contract with this manufacturer in 1990 in
connection with the Company's plan to shutdown the facilities.

In 1992, the Company recorded additional shutdown charges of approximately
$3,800,000 due to costs not originally contemplated in the original plan
to shutdown the facilities. These costs were principally attributable
to the settlement of litigation brought by the landlord of one of the
shutdown production facilities for failure by the Company to maintain

Norandex Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

8. SHUTDOWN COSTS (CONTINUED)

the leased property and the write-off of the note received in 1991 in exchange
for fixed assets sold by the Company. The write-off of the note receivable
was net of trade accounts payable to this supplier for purchased windows
and doors.

In 1993, the building materials supplier mentioned above and its bank filed
a lawsuit against the Company asserting breach of contract, improper set-offs
and an avoidable preference. The complaint alleged that the Company improperly
terminated its relationships under the terms of the supply agreement.
The Company vigorously defended the asserted claims believing it was fully
justified in terminating its relationship because this vendor had already
breached its underlying agreements. Further, the Company filed counter claims.

On September 23, 1994, the Company agreed to settle the lawsuit with the
supplier of building materials and its bank, discussed above, for a payment
from the Company of $1,400,000. Because the vendor is currently in Chapter 7
proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code, this settlement is contingent upon the
approval of the Bankruptcy Court. This settlement will be charged to
expense in 1994.

9. DISPOSITIONS

In February 1993, the Company recognized a gain of $3,079,000 for the sale
of Master Shield, its vinyl siding operations in Weatherford, Texas.

Total revenue from the disposed entity included in net sales in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Retained Deficit for 1993,
1992, and 1991 was $3,513,000, $41,451,000 and $39,406,000, respectively.

10. SALE OF NORANDEX COMMON STOCK

Effective with the close of business on August 31, 1994, the Common Stock of
Norandex Inc. was acquired by Fibreboard Corporation, an unrelated party,
in a $115 million cash transaction. The purchase price is subject to price
adjustments for changes in working capital, pension plan funding and
interest on price adjustments.

(In 000's)

1. Principles of Presentation:
On August 31, 1994, Fibreboard Corporation acquired all the outstanding
stock of Norandex Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of residential
exterior building products, for approximately $120,000. The allocation
of the purchase price resulted in goodwill of approximately $63,800 which
will be amortized over 30 years.

The unaudited pro forma combined income statements for the year ended
December 31, 1993 and for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and
1993 give effect to the transaction as though it had occurred on
January 1, 1993, January 1, 1994 and January 1, 1993, respectively. The
pro forma combined income statements are based on the historical income
statements of Fibreboard Corporation for the year ended December 31,
1993 and for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and 1993 and the
historical income statements of Norandex Inc. for the year ended
December 31, 1993, the eight months ended August 31, 1994 and the nine
months ended September 30, 1993.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements give effect to the
acquisition transaction using the purchase method of accounting and the
adjustments described below.

Because the pro forma statements include only the adjustments described
below, they should not be considered indicative of the results that would
have occurred if the combination had been in effect on the dates indicated
or which may be obtained in the future. No attempt has been made to
quantify in the pro forma statements additional costs which may be incurred
as a result of the combination, even though certain costs are expected
to increase. Furthermore, the pro forma statements include the effects of
gains on asset sales and restructuring costs which occurred during the
periods and may not reoccur.

The pro forma statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements of Fibreboard Corporation and of
Norandex Inc.

2. Pro Forma Adjustments:

The following adjustments are incorporated in the pro forma combined
income statements:

Inc/(Dec) Reported Pre-Tax Income
---------------------------------
Year Nine Months Ended
Ended -----------------
12/31/93 9/30/94 9/30/93
-------- ------- -------
<S> <C> <C> <C>

a. Adjust depreciation and amortization to (1,476) (1,066) (1,084)
reflect revised book basis in property, plant and
equipment and to amortize goodwill and other
purchased intangibles

b. Adjust interest expense to reflect debt (1,158) (998) (719)
incurred to fund purchase price at rates
which would have been in effect during the
periods under Fibreboard's credit facility in
place at the date of acquisition

c. Adjust income tax provision to consider (164) (407) 38
items a. and b. above and to reflect the
non-deductible nature of acquired goodwill
</TABLE>

The impact of a 1/8% increase in interest rates would reduce pre-tax income
by $150 per year.
