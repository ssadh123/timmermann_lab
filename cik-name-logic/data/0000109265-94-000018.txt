FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
- ---------------------

ZENITH REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER LOSS, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES 

GLENVIEW, Ill., Feb. 15, 1994 -- Zenith Electronics Corporation's 
fourth-quarter 1993 pre-tax operating results were essentially unchanged 
from the fourth quarter of 1992 -- an operating loss of $5 million 
before restructuring charges.
Major cost-reduction efforts helped offset the effect of a $26 million 
drop in sales in non-core business areas, $8 million of color TV price 
reductions implemented a year ago, and a $3 million charge for increases 
in certain inventories accounted for on a LIFO basis. 
Special fourth-quarter 1993 charges were $31 million, primarily related 
to restructuring and re-engineering actions announced in December. The 
charges cover actions that, together with other initiatives, are expected 
to reduce ongoing costs by about $50 million in 1994, compared with 1993. 
The total fourth-quarter loss was $36.0 million, or $1.04 per share in 
1993, compared with a net loss of $20.3 million, or 67 cents per share in 
1992. (Fourth-quarter 1992 results included net charges of $15 million, 
made up of a $25 million special charge, offset in part by a $10 million 
tax credit.)
Fourth-quarter sales were $361 million in 1993 and $385 million in 1992. 
Sales in the core product areas were up slightly in the fourth quarter. 
Sales for non-core product areas declined by $26 million.

Color television dollar sales were up substantially, despite the $8 million 
of lower prices compared with the fourth quarter of 1992 (although pricing 
remained relatively stable throughout 1993). The higher TV sales were 
largely offset by lower sales of other core products, primarily picture 
tubes sold to other manufacturers, due to a glass shortage which also 
adversely impacted Zenith color TV sales. 
For the full year, Zenith reported a net loss of $97.0 million, or $3.01 
per share, compared with a 1992 loss of $105.9 million, or $3.59 per share. 
Results for 1992 included restructuring charges of $48 million and tax 
credits of $16 million. 
Full-year sales were $1,228 million in 1993, compared with $1,243 million 
in 1992. 
Zenith Electronics Corporation, based in Glenview, Ill., has been a 
leader in electronics for 75 years. Zenith's core business -- consumer 
electronics, cable and networking products -- is at the center of the 
company's digital strategy, which includes interactive television, digital 
cable, video dial- tone, networking and high-definition television systems.
