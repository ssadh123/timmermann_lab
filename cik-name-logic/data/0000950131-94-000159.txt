WMX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS;
PROJECTS EARNINGS TO GROW AT 5 PERCENT TO 10 PERCENT IN 1994

Oak Brook, Illinois, February 8, 1994 -- WMX Technologies, Inc. today
reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 1993.

For the quarter ended December 31, 1993, revenue was $2,386,909,000 versus
$2,203,080,000 in the quarter a year earlier. Net income was $162,923,000, or
$0.34 per share, versus $182,805,000, or $0.37 per share, in the quarter in
1992.

For the full year ended December 31, 1993, net income was $452,776,000, or
$0.93 per share, compared with $850,036,000, or $1.72 per share, in 1992.
Revenue was $9,135,577,000 compared with $8,661,027,000 in 1992.

As discussed below, net income for both 1993 and 1992 was impacted by
special charges, gains from stock issuances by subsidiaries and, in 1992,
accounting changes. Excluding such items in both years, earnings per share were
$1.53 in 1993 compared with $1.68 in 1992.

"We are obviously disappointed with our 1993 performance, as we know our
shareholders are," said Dean L. Buntrock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
"but we believe that we have now taken the steps necessary to return our Company
to a position of overall earnings growth for 1994. Our target is a 5 percent to
10 percent growth in earnings per share in 1994.

"During the past three years, we have heavily invested both financial
resources and senior management time in an aggressive expansion into new service
lines and geographic markets. Our achievements during this period have included
the successful public offering and rapid expansion of Waste Management
International; Wheelabrator Technologies' successful expansion through targeted
acquisitions of water, wastewater and air pollution control technologies; and
the formation during 1993 of Rust International as a premier environmental
engineering,

1
<PAGE>

consulting and remediation company. These efforts have positioned WMX
Technologies as the undisputed leader of the global environmental services
market.

"At the same time, our core North American solid and hazardous waste
operations have faced very difficult business conditions, including a lengthy
recession which masked, to a certain extent, some important structural changes
in these markets. During 1993, we moved to address these developments, first,
with a major restructuring of our Chemical Waste Management subsidiary. As a
result, we have strengthened and streamlined that business and concentrated on
generating increased returns from the markets in which Chemical Waste Management
participates.

"We next turned our attention to our North American solid waste services
company by forming a new Waste Management, Inc. corporate management team and
returning to the nine-group management structure it had in 1992. This
reorganization is designed to focus the talents of our most senior management on
addressing division-level operations and profitability issues, decreasing our
operating costs, improving returns on capital in place and growing the business.

"While we believe these efforts will improve our performance in 1994, they
have been disruptive to the Waste Management organization and increased its
fourth quarter costs." Fourth quarter results were impacted by a variety of
reorganization-related expenses including costs associated with workforce
reductions and related relocations involving approximately 500 people within
Waste Management.

The increased focus on profitability improvement within Waste Management,
Inc. has led to selective dispositions of operating divisions and other assets.
In this regard, Waste Management has signed an agreement to sell its Modulaire
division, a mobile/modular office rental, sales and servicing business, to GE
Capital Modular Space, a division of Transport International Pool, Inc., a
subsidiary of General Electric Capital Corporation. The sale is expected to
close in the first quarter.

The fourth quarter provided some encouragement, the Company said. Chemical
Waste Management's restructuring plan is on schedule and it is meeting its core
business revenue and profitability targets. Good progress is being made in the
faster growing Wheelabrator Technologies, Rust International and Waste
Management International groups as each extends its capabilities and market
presence.

Chemical Waste Management continues to respond to recent changes in the
hazardous waste services marketplace with efforts

<PAGE>

to drive down its costs and improve profitability. During the fourth quarter,
the subsidiary's Port Arthur, Texas hazardous waste incinerator facility
received authorization from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to begin
receiving wastes from Superfund site cleanups. Chemical Waste Management noted,
however, that the incineration marketplace continues to be characterized by
excess capacity that may continue for the foreseeable future.

Wheelabrator Technologies began commercial operations at its owned-and-
operated composting facility located at the Waste Management, Inc. Turnkey
landfill in Rochester, N.H. in the quarter. The subsidiary also opened offices
in Singapore and Mexico City to facilitate sale of its water and air pollution
control systems in the Pacific Rim and Mexico.

Rust International continued its acquisition program in the U.S. and
overseas during the quarter. It completed the acquisition of Sky Climber in
October, expanding its scaffolding services capability. It signed a letter of
intent to acquire Kennedy and Donkin, a 950-person U.K.-based engineering firm,
which will add engineering and design expertise and experience in the utility
power industry. Shortly after the quarter ended, it completed the acquisition
of Wahler Associates, expanding its environmental consulting expertise in
California. Rust also was notified in recent months that it has been qualified
to bid on projects for the remediation of Hill and Kelly Air Force bases. In
January 1994, it was notified that it was selected as one of four companies to
bid on the cleanup of hazardous waste sites at Tinker and Eglin Air Force bases.

Overseas, the Waste Management International plc subsidiary continued to
expand in 1993. Revenue in Europe grew despite the fact that only the United
Kingdom experienced positive economic growth during 1993. The subsidiary
expanded in the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands, France, Denmark and Finland
through acquisitions and internal growth. In Hong Kong, commercial operations
began at its chemical waste treatment facility and it was awarded an
approximately U.S. $450-million project to develop the SENT landfill. The
project includes construction, site operations for 13 years, and aftercare for a
further 30 years. Shortly after year-end, it began operating Indonesia's first
commercial hazardous waste landfill near Cibinong, West Java. In Taiwan,
through a joint venture with Ret-Ser, one of the country's largest construction
groups, it has submitted bids for several trash-to-energy projects.

Operating results for both 1993 and 1992 were impacted by special charges,
gains from stock issuances of subsidiaries, and, in 1992, accounting changes.

such items:

The Company said it would allocate $710 million to its North American solid
