Item 4. Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountants

On March 21, 1994, the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors of UNC Incorporated (the "Company")
recommended to the Board of Directors that the firm of
Coopers & Lybrand be appointed to succeed the firm of
KPMG Peat Marwick as the Company's independent
accountants. On that date the Board of Directors
approved the appointment of the firm of Coopers &
Lybrand as the Company's independent accountants,
subject to ratification by the shareholders at the
annual meeting of shareholders to be held on
April 29, 1994.

During the two most recent fiscal years, and the
period December 31, 1993, to the date of their
appointment, the Company has not consulted Coopers &
Lybrand regarding the application of accounting
principles to a specific transaction, either completed
or proposed, the type of audit opinion that might be
rendered on the Company's financial statements, or a
reportable event as defined in Item 304 (a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K.
