Item 5. Other Events
- - ---------------------

On May 15, 1994, GATX redeemed rights (the "Rights") issued pursuant to the
Rights Agreement dated as of May 15, 1986, and amended and restated as of 
June 2, 1989 (the "Rights Agreement"). When the Rights were first issued, one
Right was associated with each share of common stock of GATX (the "Common
Stock"). However, the Rights were adjusted effective May 10, 1990, to reflect
the distribution of one share of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock
then outstanding. Accordingly, one-half of one Right became associated with
each share of Common Stock resulting in a redemption price of two and one-half
cents ($.025) per share. Redemption payments will be made in cash to the
holders of record of Common Stock as of the close of business on May 15, 1994,
by Chemical Bank, the Rights Agent and Paying Agent under the Rights Agreement. 
Checks will be mailed by May 24, 1994.
