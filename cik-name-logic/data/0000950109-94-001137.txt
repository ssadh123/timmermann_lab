Item 5. Other Events.
------------

The Registrant owns and operates a pulp and paper mill located on the
lower Fox River in Neenah, Wisconsin. The Registrant acquired that mill in 
1979 in its merger with Bergstrom Paper Company. In the 1980's, 
investigations into the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") in 
sediments in the lower Fox river were begun. One source of such PCBs is 
claimed to be the recycling of NCR(R) carbonless paper which contained PCBs in
its coating formulation. The Registrant previously recycled such paper at its
Neenah Mill. As an outgrowth of the investigation, the Fox River Coalition, 
an ad hoc group comprised of members of private industry, local governmental 
entities, publicly-owned wastewater treatment plants and the Wisconsin 
Department of Natural Resources, was formed to develop and implement a quick 
and cost-effective clean up of the contaminated sediments in the lower Fox 
River. The Registrant is a member of the Fox River Coalition.

Despite the efforts of the Fox River Coalition, in a letter dated 
June 20, 1994 (received by the Registrant June 22, 1994), pursuant to the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 
("CERCLA"), 42 U.S.C. (S)(S) 9601-75, and the Federal Water Pollution Control 
Act, 33 U.S.C. (S)(S) 1251-1387, the United States Department of the Interior,
Fish and Wildlife Service ("FWS"), notified the Registrant and at least four 
other paper companies that they had been identified as Potentially Responsible
Parties ("PRPs") under CERCLA for injuries to natural resources resulting from
releases of hazardous substances to the Fox River and Bay of Green Bay (the 
"Site"). Further, the PRPs were advised of the FWS' intent to perform a Natural
Resources Damage Assessment for the Site. Prior to notification from the FWS,
DNR declined to join or support the FWS in its proposed action and urged the
FWS not to assess damages for natural resources, stating that it believed that
the voluntary approach of the Fox River Coalition was the fastest way to
reduce any contamination in the lower Fox River. The Registrant is in the
process of investigating this matter and is presently unable to determine the
extent and materiality of liability, if any, associated with the action taken
by the FWS, for which the Registrant may be responsible.
