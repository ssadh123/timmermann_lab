CALIFORNIA ENERGY CLOSES FINANCING OF THE
120 MW UPPER MAHIAO PHILIPPINE PROJECT

OMAHA, NEBRASKA, April 11, 1994 -- California Energy Company,
Inc. (NYSE, PSE and LSE symbol: CE) announced today the close of
financing for the 120 MW Upper Mahiao geothermal power project
located in the Philippines. The Export-Import Bank of the U.S.
(Ex-Im Bank) is the project term lender, with the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (OPIC), providing political risk insurance
on the equity investment by CE. The Upper Mahiao project is
scheduled to begin construction shortly, and is expected to be in
service by July of 1996.

The project is structured as a ten-year Build-Own-Operate-Transfer
(BOT), in which CE Cebu, the project company, will be responsible
for building the power plant and providing the operations and
maintenance during the ten-year BOT period. The electricity
generated by the Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant will be
provided to the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC), which is
also responsible for supplying the facility with the geothermal
steam. After a ten-year cooperation period, the plant is
transferred to PNOC. Ormat Inc. of Sparks, Nevada, is the turnkey
contractor for the project, which will be the third geothermal
project Ormat has constructed in the Philippines.

The total project cost for the facility is approximately
$218,000,000. CE will supply $56,000,000 of equity which will be
insured by OPIC, with the Ex-Im Bank providing approximately
$162,000,000 of the permanent financing, and political risk
insurance during the construction phase. The Ex-Im Bank funding is
a ten year project finance loan which will be repaid from the cash
flows of the project.

David Sokol, Chief Executive Officer of CE stated, "This is clearly
a win-win project for everyone involved. The Philippines receives
an environmentally clean, renewable and indigenous electricity
supply with which to sustain their economic growth; a large portion
of the equipment will be produced in the United States, creating
jobs; and for CE, it sets the groundwork and foundation for our
other international projects." Sokol added, " We are pleased with
this financing and the support we have received from Ex-Im Bank in
the implementation of the Upper Mahiao project. We believe this is
a good example of how the public and private sector can work
together to support American exports."

California Energy Company is an international developer, owner and
operator of geothermal and other environmentally responsible power
generation facilities.
