ITEM OF INFORMATION

Item 5. Other Events

GTE Northwest Incorporated today
announced that its results for the fourth quarter of 1993
will include a one-time pre-tax restructuring charge of
$124.9 million related primarily to the implementation of
its re-engineering plan over the next three years. The
restructuring charge will reduce fourth quarter and full
year net income by $76.9 million.

The re-engineering plan will
redesign and streamline processes in order to improve
customer-responsiveness and product quality, reduce the
time necessary to introduce new products and services and
further reduce costs. The re-engineering plan includes
$49.7 million to upgrade or replace existing customer
service and administrative systems and enhance network
software, $56.2 million for employee separation benefits
associated with workforce reductions and $15.2 million
primarily for the consolidation of facilities and
operations and other related costs. The charge for
employee separation benefits includes $28.4 million
related to the recognition of previously deferred
postretirement health and life insurance costs for
separating employees.
