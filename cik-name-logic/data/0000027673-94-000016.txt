Item 5. Other Information Events.

The following information was included in Deere & Company's
press release reporting earnings for the quarter:

John Deere Capital Corporation's net income was $25.8 million in
the third quarter
of 1994 compared with $28.6 million in the same period last
year. The decrease
reflects lower gains from the sale of retail notes and slightly
lower financing margins
due to a competitive marketplace.

For the first nine months of 1994, net income was $74.7 million,
compared with
income of $82.8 million in 1993, excluding the cumulative effect
of accounting
changes ($79.0 million after the accounting changes). Compared
with last year,
income for the first nine months of 1994 was unfavorably
affected by the impact of
a smaller average receivable and lease portfolio caused mainly
by the sale of retail
notes in 1993, and lower gains related to notes previously sold.

These decreases
were partially offset by higher securitization and servicing fee
income from retail notes
previously sold but still administered and a lower provision for
credit losses. The
average receivable and lease portfolio financed was
approximately four percent lower
during the first nine months of this year compared with a year
ago.

Total receivable and lease acquisitions increased by 15 percent
for the quarter and
14 percent year-to-date compared with the same periods last
year. The higher
acquisitions during the first nine months were attributable to
increased volumes of
retail notes, revolving charge accounts and wholesale
receivables. Net credit
receivables and leases financed by John Deere Capital
Corporation were $4.134
billion at July 31, 1994 compared with $3.710 billion one year
ago. The increase in
the receivable and lease portfolio financed resulted mainly from
a higher balance of
John Deere notes and leases, and revolving charge accounts. Net
credit receivables
and leases administered, which include receivables previously
securitized and sold,
amounted to $4.947 billion at July 31, 1994 compared with $4.670
billion at July 31,
1993.
