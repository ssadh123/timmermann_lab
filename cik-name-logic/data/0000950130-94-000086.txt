THURSDAY, JANUARY 20, 1994

BANKERS TRUST REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS UP 110%;
RECORD EARNINGS OF $1.070 BILLION FOR 1993

Bankers Trust New York Corporation earned $279 million for the quarter ended
December 31, 1993, an increase of 110% from the $133 million earned in the prior
year period. Primary earnings per share were $3.26, up 119% from $1.49 a year
ago. The Corporation's return on average common equity was 26%.

For the full year 1993, earnings before cumulative effects of accounting changes
were a record $1.070 billion, 67% higher than the $639 million recorded a year
earlier. These earnings represented primary earnings per share of $12.40, up
72% from $7.23 in 1992. The Corporation's return on average common equity for
1993 was 26%.

"The fourth quarter capped an exceptional year, with excellent performance
across the full range of our businesses," said Bankers Trust Chairman Charles S.
Sanford, Jr. "Clearly, our clients are coming more and more to recognize and
value our products and services that assist them in the management of risk.
Noteworthy, too, was the steady improvement in asset quality, evidenced by the
eighth consecutive quarterly decline in nonperforming assets. Our earnings
momentum and improved asset quality, together with strong capital and reserves,
position us well as we enter 1994."
<PAGE>

The following are highlights of full-year 1993 results:

o a 35% increase in total revenue, which reflected record levels of trading,
fiduciary and funds management and net interest revenue, as well as a 25%
improvement in corporate finance fees;

o continued improvement in asset quality, evidenced by a full-year decline of
29% in cash basis loans, as well as an increase from 118% to 136% in the
ratio of the allowance for credit losses to cash basis loans;

o a strengthened capital position, with increases of 18% and 20% in common
stockholders' equity and book value per common share, respectively.

An analysis of fourth quarter results follows:

NET INTEREST REVENUE

Fully taxable net interest revenue totaled $398 million, down 3% from the fourth
quarter of 1992. The current and prior year quarters included interest
recognized from Argentina ($29 million) and Brazil ($60 million), respectively.
Excluding these amounts, fully taxable net interest revenue increased by 5%,
reflecting a higher level of trading-related net interest.

A 13% increase in average interest-earning assets from the fourth quarter of
1992 was driven by a 58% increase in debt securities positions (primarily U.S.
Treasuries and other sovereign bonds) in the trading account.

NONINTEREST REVENUE

Total trading revenue of $449 million represented the firm's third consecutive
quarterly record, and an increase of $348 million from the $101 million recorded
in the fourth quarter of
<PAGE>

1992. Many of the firm's proprietary trading businesses benefited from the
continued movement in interest rate and currency markets around the world, with
significantly improved results from the trading of fixed income instruments
within and across markets in Latin America, Asia and Europe. Deal flow also
remained strong for risk management products provided to customers worldwide.

Fiduciary and funds management revenue totaled a record $185 million for the
fourth quarter, up $27 million, or 17%, from the same period last year. The
increased revenue reflected mainly new business in securities lending and
retirement services, as well as higher levels of private banking assets under
management.

Fees and commissions of $192 million were $48 million higher than in the fourth
quarter of 1992. Of this increase, $25 million related to corporate finance
fees, which rose 30%, to $108 million, led by higher revenue from securities
underwriting, leasing syndication, financial advisory and private placement
activities. The largest component of the remaining $23 million increase was
higher fees from the structuring of products for employee benefit plans.

Other noninterest revenue totaled $45 million, down $24 million from the prior
year's quarter. Included in the current quarter were a writedown of assets
previously acquired in satisfaction of indebtedness and losses from the
revaluation of non-trading foreign currency positions, offset in part by a gain
on the sale of the Corporation's Bankstat business. Also contributing to the
year-to-year decline was a $15 million gain from the partial curtailment of an
overseas defined benefit plan in the fourth quarter of 1992.

NONINTEREST EXPENSES

Total noninterest expenses of $816 million increased by $193
<PAGE>

million from the fourth quarter of 1992. Incentive compensation and employee
benefits expense increased $91 million, or 53%, reflecting higher accruals for
both bonuses and severance. Salaries expense increased $16 million, or 10%,
from the fourth quarter of 1992. The average number of employees increased by
7% over the same period, to 13,640.

All other expenses totaled $375 million for the quarter, up $86 million, or 30%,
from last year's fourth quarter. Increases were recorded in a variety of
expense categories, principally contributions expense, professional fees,
travel and entertainment, telecommunications and agency personnel fees. Other
real estate expense also increased, as the Corporation recorded a modest net
expense in the current quarter, versus a net gain a year ago.

ASSET QUALITY

The provision for credit losses for the quarter was $23 million, compared with
$50 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net charge-offs for the quarter
were $184 million, compared with $82 million a year ago.

Nonrefinancing country net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 1993 totaled
$186 million. This amount included charge-offs of $142 million related to sales
of Mexican government Par and Discount Bonds and industrial development bonds as
well as the loss on revaluation to market value of the remainder of these bonds
as the result of their designation as available for sale in connection with the
adoption of SFAS 115.

Cash basis loans declined by $153 million, or 14%, to $974 million during the
fourth quarter. Total nonperforming assets, including renegotiated loans,
declined for the eighth consecutive quarter, to $1.383 billion. The allowance
for credit losses at December 31, 1993 was $1.324 billion, representing 136% of
cash
<PAGE>

basis loans.

The Corporation's renegotiated loans decreased by $462 million, to $21 million,
during the fourth quarter of 1993. This decrease was almost entirely
attributable to the sale of $75 million of Mexican government Par Bonds and the
transfer of the balance of the bonds to securities available for sale as the
result of the Corporation's adoption of SFAS 115 at December 31, 1993.

CAPITAL
Common stockholders' equity of $4.284 billion at December 31, 1993 was up $247
million from September 30, 1993, primarily due to the retention of earnings.

The Corporation estimated that its ratios of Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital to
risk-adjusted assets were approximately 8.30% and 14.10%, respectively, at
December 31, 1993. The Leverage Ratio was 6.28% at that same date.

ADOPTION OF SFAS 115

Effective December 31, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities." This new accounting standard mandates that affected
securities which are neither trading securities nor held to maturity be
designated as available for sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses recorded directly to a separate component of stockholders'
equity.

The Corporation, in addition to the securities which had been classified as
investment securities (and carried at either the lower of aggregate cost or
market, or at market), identified and transferred at market value to a new asset
category, securities available for sale, Mexican government Par Bonds,
industrial development bonds and Brazilian sovereign bonds previously
<PAGE>

carried in the loan portfolio, as well as marketable equity securities
previously classified as other assets (and carried at cost).

Also at December 31, 1993, the Corporation recorded an after-tax credit of $88
million in the securities valuation allowance component of stockholders' equity,
representing the net unrealized gains on securities available for sale. The
adoption of SFAS 115 had no effect on net income.

CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF OTHER ACCOUNTING CHANGES

As previously reported, in the first quarter of 1993, the Corporation adopted
accounting standards for income taxes (SFAS 109), postretirement benefits other
than pensions (SFAS 106) and postemployment benefits (SFAS 112). The
Corporation adopted SFAS 109 retroactively to January 1, 1992, resulting in the
restatement of earnings for each quarter of 1992.

For 1992, the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109 was a credit of $446
million, equivalent to $5.30 primary earnings per share. For 1993, the
cumulative effects of adopting SFAS 106 and SFAS 112 totaled a charge of $75
million, equivalent to $.89 primary earnings per share.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

Effective with its December 31, 1993 financial statements, Bankers Trust New
York Corporation has changed its reporting of earnings per common share. The
Corporation now reports primary and fully diluted earnings per share. Primary
earnings per share is based on the sum of average common shares outstanding plus
average common stock equivalents, with the latter attributable to outstanding
stock options and deferred stock awards. The Corporation's fully diluted
earnings per share is computed on the same basis, except for the use of a more
conservative assumption in the calculation of the number of average common stock
equivalents. The Corporation has not issued any securities which are
convertible to shares of its common stock.

Previously, the Corporation's reported earnings per common share were based
solely on the number of average common shares outstanding, due to the fact that
the difference between that figure and primary earnings per share was not
significant.

The Corporation is now reporting primary and fully diluted earnings per share
for all prior periods presented in its financial reports. The attached schedule
contains these figures for each of the last eight quarters and the last five
years.

As previously reported, Bankers Trust intends to continue its practice of
satisfying awards under its 1991 Stock Option and Stock Award Plan through the
purchase of its shares of common stock in the open market, since the use of
newly issued shares would dilute the ownership interests of existing
shareholders. During 1993, the Corporation purchased 4.153 million shares and
expects to purchase an additional 1 to 2 million shares during the first quarter
of 1994.
