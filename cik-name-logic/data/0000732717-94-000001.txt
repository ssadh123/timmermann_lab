CALCULATION AGENT: 

SOUTHWESTERN BELL CAPITAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
(herein called "Capital Corporation") for value received,
hereby promises to pay to , or registered
assigns the principal sum of 
on the Maturity Date specified above, and to pay interest on
said principal sum, 
of each year and on the Maturity Date (each
an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on the next Interest
Payment Date succeeding the Original Issue Date specified
above, at the Interest Rate specified below from the Original
Issue Date and thereafter from the next preceding Interest
Payment Date in respect of which interest has been paid, to,
but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or Maturity
Date, and on any overdue principal and (to the extent that the
payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) on any
overdue installment of interest at the Interest Rate. The
interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for
on any will be
paid to the person in whose name this Note is registered on
the close of business on the 
(whether or not a Business Day (as defined below))
(each, a "Record Date") next preceding such 
; provided, however, that
principal, premium, if any, and interest payable on the
Maturity Date will be payable to the Person in whose name this
Note is registered on the Maturity Date. If any Interest
Payment Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business
Day, interest will be paid on the next Business Day, without
adjustment for period end dates. 

Payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
this Note due at the Maturity Date will be made at the
Maturity Date upon presentation of this Note, in immediately
available funds, at the office or agency of Capital
Corporation maintained for that purpose in the Borough of
Manhattan, the City of New York, in the Specified Currency. 
Payment of interest on this Note due on any other Interest 
Payment Date will be made by check mailed to the address of
the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in
the Note Register. Interest (other than interest payable at
maturity and upon redemption) on Notes in global form will be
paid by wire transfer to The Depository Trust Company or its
nominee in accordance with the Medium-Term Notes, Series D,
Administrative Procedures. Any interest not punctually paid
or duly provided for shall be payable as provided in the
Indenture. Interest will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

As used herein, "Business Day" means any day, other than a
Saturday or Sunday, on which banks in The City of New York are
not required or authorized by law to close.

The Interest Rate with respect to this Note for any Interest
Reset Date shall be the Base Rate minus the Spread, as
specified on the face hereof, as determined on the applicable
Determination Date; provided, however, that the interest rate
in effect from the Original Issue Date to the first Interest
Reset Date will be the Initial Interest Rate and the interest
rate in effect for the 10 days immediately prior to the
Maturity Date will be that in effect on the 10th day preceding
such Maturity Date.

The Base Rate shall be the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate set
forth in the Federal Reserve Board publication H.15(519)
opposite the caption "U.S. Government/Securities/Treasury
Constant Maturities/", decompounded to a Quarterly Rate, in
the Index Maturity with respect to the applicable Interest
Determination Date. If the H.15(519) is no longer published,
the "Constant Maturity Treasury Rate" shall be the rate that
was set forth on Telerate Page 7055, or its successor page (as
determined by the Treasury Rate Determination Agent), on the
applicable Interest Determination Date opposite the applicable
Index Maturity. If no such rate is set forth, then the
Constant Maturity Treasury Rate for such Interest Reset Date
shall be established by the Treasury Rate Determination Agent
as follows. The Treasury Rate Determination Agent will
contact the Federal Reserve Board and request the Constant
Maturity Treasury Rate, in the applicable Index Maturity, for
the Interest Reset Date. If the Federal Reserve Board does
not provide such information, then the Constant Maturity
Treasury Rate for such Interest Reset Date will be the
arithmetic mean of quotations reported by three leading U.S.
government securities dealers (one of which may be the
Treasury Rate Determination Agent), according to their written
records, with reference to the 3:00 p.m. (New York City time)
Interest Rate Determination Date closing bid-side yield
quotations for the noncallable U.S. Treasury Note that is
nearest in maturity to the Index Maturity, but not less than
exactly the Index Maturity and for the noncallable U.S.
Treasury Note that is nearest in maturity to the Index
Maturity, but not more than exactly the Index Maturity. The 
Treasury Rate Determination Agent shall calculate the Constant
Maturity Treasury Rate by interpolating to the Index Maturity
based on an Actual/Actual day count basis, the yield on the
two Treasury Notes selected. If the Treasury Rate
Determination Agent cannot obtain three such adjusted
quotations, the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate for such
Interest Reset Date will be the arithmetic mean of all such
quotations, or if only one such quotation is obtained, such
quotation, obtained by the Treasury Rate Determination Agent. 
In all events, the Treasury Rate Determination Agent shall
continue polling dealers until at least one adjusted yield
quotation can be determined. 

The Interest Rate with respect to this Note will reset
, whether or not a Business Day.

Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set
forth on the reverse hereof, which shall have the same effect
as though fully set forth at this place.

This Note shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose
until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been
manually signed by the Trustee.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, SOUTHWESTERN BELL CAPITAL CORPORATION has
caused this instrument to be signed in its name by the
facsimile signatures of its President and its Vice President
and Treasurer and has caused a facsimile of its corporate seal
to be imprinted hereon.

SOUTHWESTERN BELL CAPITAL CORPORATION
MEDIUM-TERM NOTE, SERIES D

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of notes of
Capital Corporation (the "Securities") of the series specified
on the face hereof (hereinafter called the "Notes") limited in
aggregate principal amount to U.S. $1,000,000,000 (or the
equivalent thereof in one or more currencies or currency
units), issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an
indenture dated as of February 1, 1987, and supplemented by a
First Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 1, 1990 among
Capital Corporation, Southwestern Bell Corporation ("SBC") and
The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term
includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which
indenture and First Supplemental Indenture and all indentures
supplemental thereto (collectively, the "Indenture") reference
is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of
rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the
Trustee, Capital Corporation, SBC and the holders of the
Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more
series, which different series may be issued in various
aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times,
may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject
to different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise
vary as provided in the Indenture.

The authorized denominations of Notes denominated in U.S.
dollars will be U.S. $ and any larger amount that is an
integral multiple of U.S. $ .

References herein to "U.S. dollars" or to "U.S.$" are to the
currency of the United States of America.

Holders of Notes and the Trustee are entitled to the benefits
of the Support Agreement dated as of November 10, 1986 (the
"Support Agreement") between Capital Corporation and SBC, in
which SBC has agreed to ensure the timely payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest owed on certain
obligations of Capital Corporation, including the Notes;
however, no Holders of Notes or the Trustee will have recourse
to or against the stock or assets of Southwestern Bell
Telephone Company (the "Telephone Company") or any interest of
Capital Corporation or SBC in the Telephone Company.

This Note may not be redeemed at the option of Capital
Corporation or of the Holder of this Note prior to its
Maturity Date. 

The Indenture contains provisions permitting Capital
Corporation, SBC and the Trustee with the written consent of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the 
outstanding Securities of each series affected by a
supplemental indenture (with each series voting as a class),
to enter into a supplemental indenture to add any provisions
to or to change or eliminate any provisions of the Indenture
or to modify, in each case in any manner not covered by
provisions in the Indenture relating to amendments and waivers
without the consent of Holders, the rights of the Holders of
each such series. The Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding Securities of each series affected
by such waiver (with each series voting as a class), by notice
to the Trustee, may waive compliance by Capital Corporation or
SBC with any provisions of the Indenture, any supplemental
indenture or the Securities of any such series except a
default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any
Security. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this
Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon
all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon
the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or
in lieu hereof, whether or not a notation of such waiver is
made upon this Note.

Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the respective
obligations of Capital Corporation or SBC, which are absolute
and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on
this Note (in the case of Capital Corporation) or make
payments in respect thereof under the Support Agreement (in
the case of SBC), at the times, place and rate, and in the
coin or currency, herein prescribed.

The Notes are issued in registered form without coupons.

When Notes are presented to the Registrar with a request to
register their transfer or to exchange them for an equal
principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations
and like tenor, the Registrar shall register the transfer or
make the exchange if its requirements for such transactions
are met. Capital Corporation will not make any charge for any
registration of transfer or exchange but may require the
payment by the party requesting such registration of transfer
or exchange of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Ownership of Notes shall be proved by the register for the
Notes kept by the Registrar. Capital Corporation, SBC, the
Trustee and any agent of Capital Corporation may treat the
person in whose name a Note is registered as the absolute
owner thereof for all purposes.

No director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of
Capital Corporation or SBC shall have any liability for any
obligations of Capital Corporation or SBC under this Note, the
Indenture or the Support Agreement or for any claim based on,
in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their 
creation. Each Holder by accepting this Note waives and
releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part
of the consideration for the issue of this Note.

All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

The Indenture and this Note shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the law of the State of New York.
