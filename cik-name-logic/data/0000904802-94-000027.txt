REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors of
AlliedSignal Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related
statements of operations and division equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the AlliedSignal Mechanical and Hydraulic Actuation Division
(a division of AlliedSignal Inc.) at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the two years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Division's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

1. Basis of presentation

The accompanying financial statements reflect the
assets, liabilities and division equity and the
revenues, expenses, changes in division equity and cash
flows of the AlliedSignal Mechanical and Hydraulic
Actuation Division (the Division), a wholly-integrated
line of business of Aerospace Systems & Equipment
(ASE), a division of AlliedSignal Inc. (AlliedSignal). 
The Division designs, manufactures, markets and
supports actuation equipment for commercial and
military applications.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

Inventories

Inventories, which include costs of material, labor and
manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market and consist of the
following:

1993 1992

Raw materials $ 590 $ 1,405
Work-in-process 13,067 15,995
Finished goods 10,347 8,674

24,004 26,074
Less: Unliquidated progress 
payments (6,051) (5,282)

$ 17,953 $ 20,792

Property and equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is
computed by the straight-line method on the basis of the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. The Division
capitalizes expenditures which materially increase asset
lives and charges ordinary maintenance and repairs to
operations as incurred. When assets are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the cost of the assets and the
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
respective accounting records and the resulting gain or loss
is included in operations.

Revenue recognition

Revenues are generally recognized as products are shipped to
customers. A portion of the Division's revenues results
from contracts performed for the United States government. 
Revenues and profits on such contracts are recognized using
the units-shipped method of accounting. The Division
provides for anticipated losses on contracts by a charge to
income during the period in which the losses become evident;
contracts that are part of a program are evaluated on an
overall program basis. Contract costs, including indirect
costs allocated to contracts, are subject to audit and
adjustment by negotiations between the Division and the
United States government. Contract revenues have been
recorded in amounts which are expected to be realized upon
final settlement.

Warranty expense

The Division warrants its products against defects for
periods ranging from six months to three years. A provision
for estimated future costs relating to warranty expense is
recorded when products are shipped. Warranty expense was
$1,510 and $5,645 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Income taxes

For income tax purposes, the Division's taxable income
(loss) is included in the consolidated and combined tax
returns of AlliedSignal. AlliedSignal allocates a portion
of the consolidated income tax provision (benefit) to the
Division in an amount generally equivalent to the provision
(benefit) which would result if the Division filed a
separate income tax return, without regard to net operating
loss carryover limitations. Income taxes currently payable,
as allocated pursuant to this policy, and deferred income
taxes relating to temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets are included in
division equity in the balance sheet.

Statement of cash flows

The Division paid no cash for interest or income taxes in
1993 and 1992.

5. Related party transactions

The Division is allocated amounts from ASE and AlliedSignal
for corporate overhead charges and income taxes (Notes 2 and
4). Corporate charges, which are allocated to the Division 
based on specific identification, headcount, and certain
formulas, totalled $3,447 and $3,685 for the years ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Corporate charges
are included in general and administrative expenses in the
statement of operations. In the opinion of management, the
allocation methods are reasonable.

The Division is also charged interest in accordance with a
formula based on AlliedSignal's net investment in the
Division, cash flow generated by the Division, and other
factors. Interest expense totalled $1,812 and $2,571 for
the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Division equity includes AlliedSignal's investment in the
Division, net cash transfers between the Division and ASE
and AlliedSignal for cash generated from operations, and
cash transfers for working capital and asset purchases,
corporate charges and allocations and cumulative earnings of
the Division. Additionally, assets or liabilities related
to pension costs and postretirement benefits are included in
division equity.

The Division purchases certain components used in its
products from affiliates. Purchases from affiliates
totalled $1,662 and $1,910 for the years ended December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively. In addition, the Division
sells certain manufactured hardware to affiliates. Sales to
affiliates totalled $12,320 and $10,600 for the years ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

6. Commitments and contingencies

Litigation

The Division is from time to time a party to various legal
actions and other claims which arise during the normal
course of business. In the opinion of management, the
resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the Division's financial position or results of
operations.

Transactions with the United States government

In the normal course of the Division's contracting business,
issues are raised by government agencies involving cost
accounting methods, procurement practices, manufacturing
methodology, research activities, design and quality
standards, and a broad range of other issues. Resolution of
these issues may result in costs to the Division, including
delays in shipments and changes in manufacturing methods and
costs. In the opinion of management, the resolution of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Division's financial position or results of operations.

7. Revenues and accounts receivable

The Company generates revenues principally from the sales of
products to the aerospace industry. As a result, the
Company's trade accounts receivable are concentrated
primarily in this industry. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not
require collateral.

Four customers accounted for 22%, 14%, 12% and 10% of
revenue, respectively, in 1993 and three customers accounted
for 31%, 16% and 12% of revenue, respectively, in 1992. 
Foreign sales in 1993 and 1992 amounted to $20,353 and
$10,323, respectively.

8. Subsequent events

Effective June 17, 1994, the Division was sold to Moog, Inc.
for approximately $71 million. Approximately 500 employees
of ASE directly associated with the Division have
transferred to the acquiring company.

Introduction

On June 17, 1994 Moog Inc. (Moog) completed the purchase of
the Mechanical and Hydraulic Actuation Systems product lines (the
"Product Lines") from AlliedSignal Inc. (AlliedSignal). Included
in the purchase are all of the inventories, machinery and
equipment and real property associated with the Product Lines. 
It is expected that these assets will continue to be used in the
operation of the acquired Product Lines. Moog Inc. assumed
certain contract related liabilities and other miscellaneous
accrued liabilities as part of the transaction. The original
purchase price, including payment for specified transition
services to be provided by AlliedSignal over a period of
approximately one year, was $78,000 in cash which was financed
under Revolving Credit and Term Loan facilities provided by a
banking group. Interest on borrowing will be charged at LIBOR
plus 2.12% for the first year and 2.00% thereafter. The final
purchase price has been adjusted downward to $74,352 based upon a
formula set forth in the stock purchase agreement which adjusted
the purchase price based upon the level of net assets forwarded
at closing. 

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements give effect to the acquisition of the
Product Lines by Moog assuming the transaction was consummated as
of September 30, 1992. Included in the statement of operations
for the year ended September 30, 1993 is Moog's fiscal year ended
September 30, 1993 and the Product Lines' calendar year ended
December 31, 1993. The statement of operations for the six
months ended March 31, 1994 includes the actual six month periods
then ended for both entities. Sales of $24,181 and earnings
before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of
$1,189 for the Product Lines' fourth calendar quarter is included
in both periods presented. The pro forma adjustments are
described in the accompanying notes to the pro forma condensed
combined financial statements and should be read in conjunction
with such pro forma condensed combined financial statements. 
Such pro forma financial statements should also be read in
conjunction with Moog's consolidated financial statements and
notes set forth in the Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
September 30, 1993 and the Report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended March 31, 1994. The pro forma condensed combined financial
statements are not necessarily indicative of the actual results
that would have occurred had the transaction been consummated
September 30, 1992 or of the future results of operations which
will be obtained by Moog as a result of the acquisition.

(Unaudited)

The following pro forma adjustments have been made to
reflect the acquisition of the Product Lines by Moog Inc. as if
the acquisition occurred on September 30, 1992:

(1) Represents the adjustment required to conform the
Product Lines' accounting principle for long-term
contracts to Moog's methods.

Moog follows the cost to cost percentage of
completion method of accounting and uses the
contract as source for determining profitability
or loss reserve requirements. AlliedSignal (the
previous parent of the Product Lines) records
revenue on a units shipped basis and views
contracts as part of a program when determining
whether contract loss reserves are required.

In addition, depreciation and amortization expense
has been reduced by $914 in 1993 and $588 for the
six months ended March 31, 1994 relating to the
allocation of the purchase price. Intangibles
associated with the allocation of purchase price
total $20,994. 

(2) Represents amortization of deferred costs
associated with the acquisition and debt issuance
costs ($286 in 1993 and $143 for the six months
ended March 31, 1994) offset by a proforma
reduction to the amount allocated to the Product 
Lines by AlliedSignal for corporate and sector
assessments ($655 in 1993 and $306 for the six
months ended March 31, 1994).

(3) Represents incremental interest on debt used to
finance the transaction including $2,003 in
acquisition related costs.

(4) Represents elimination of equity income from an
affiliate of the Product Lines which was not
acquired as part of the transaction.

(5) Represents the tax effects of the above adjust-
ments at Moog's approximate statutory tax rate.

(6) These adjustments are required to reflect the
allocation of the $74,352 purchase price to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed and record
costs associated with the transaction including
deferred debt issuance costs.
