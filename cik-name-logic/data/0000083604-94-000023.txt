in Western Australia, to PosGold (BGM) Pty Ltd., a subsidiary of Poseidon
Gold Limited.

REYNOLDS METALS COMPANY COMPLETES PURCHASE
OF ALUMAX INC. METALS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS

RICHMOND, Va. -- Reynolds Metals Company (NYSE & CHX: RLM) said today
that it has completed the purchase of the metals distribution business of
Alumax Inc.'s (NYSE: AMX) wholly owned subsidiary, Prime Metals, Inc. The
two companies announced the proposed transaction in June. Terms of the
sale were not disclosed.

Prime Metals distributed aluminum and stainless steel mill products
through six facilities located in Atlanta; Dallas; Cleveland; Detroit and
Grand Rapids, Mich.; and Kansas City, Mo.

Reynolds intends to operate the business as part of its Reynolds
Aluminum Supply Company (RASCO) division, which is the largest aluminum
distributor in the country with 24 locations nationwide. The company also
processes and distributes stainless steel and nickel-alloy mill products.

"With its strong customer focus in the transportation, construction,
food preparation and consumer durables markets, we believe Prime Metals
will complement RASCO's strengths," said John F. Rudin, RASCO's president
and general manager. "This purchase allows us to broaden our quality
processing and service capabilities, our customer base and the geographic
scope of our operations."
