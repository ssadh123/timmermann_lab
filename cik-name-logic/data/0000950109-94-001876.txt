Item 5. Other Events

On October 17, 1994, the Registrant announced that it entered into a
$14,500,000 financing commitment with AMRESCO Capital Corporation. The
financing, which is contingent upon credit underwriting, due diligence and other
customary closing conditions and criteria, will be secured by first liens on two
of the Registrant's properties. The financing has a maturity of seven years with
a 25-year amortization and provides the Registrant with the option of a fixed
interest rate of 2.65% over comparable term treasuries or a variable interest
rate of 3.00% over 30-day LIBOR. The variable rate feature would include a cap
of 12.5%. Proceeds from the financing, if funded, will be used by the Registrant
to defease its outstanding Zero Coupon Notes and refinance existing
indebtedness. The closing is anticipated to occur on or about November 15, 1994.
