release:

MCN CORPORATION REPORTS SEASONAL THIRD QUARTER LOSS

DETROIT, October 19, 1994 -- MCN Corporation (NYSE: MCN) today reported a
seasonal third quarter loss of $15.6 millon or $.52 a share. In last year's
third quarter, MCN lost $11.2 million or $.38 a share. As expected, this year's
third quarter loss was greater than last year's because of the timing, on a
quarterly basis, of certain increased operating expenses and the revenues
generated from a January 1994 rate increase, which was intended to recover such
expenses.

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Alfred R. Glancy III
said, "Given the seasonal decline in demand for natural gas in our utility
business during the summer, we typically experience a third quarter loss.
However," he said, "the continued excellent performance of our nonutility
businesses helped offset some of this loss. As anticipated, these results keep
us on track for another year of record financial results in 1994."

For the nine months ended September 30, MCN earned $57 million or $1.92
a share compared to $44.8 million or $1.53 a share for the same period last
year. For the twelve months ended September 30, MCN earned $85.1 millon or
$2.87 a share compared to $58.5 million or $2.01 a share for the prior
twelve-month period. Earnings for the nine- and twelve-month periods were
higher primarily because of the effect of colder weather on utility sales
earlier in the year and increased nonutility earnings from gas production and
marketing operations.

UTILITY SERVICES

In outlining the performance of the company's two major business segments, 
Glancy said MCN's utility services lost $19.5 million or $.65 a share during 
the third quarter compared to a loss of $13 million or $.44 a share during the 
third quarter of 1993.

Higher third quarter operating expenses, primarily postretirement
health care costs and depreciation, exceeded additional revenues from the
January 1994 MichCon rate order. By comparison, the rate order resulted in
higher first quarter earnings since additional revenues are realized on a
volumetric basis, the bulk of which occur in the first and fourth quarters.

Colder weather boosted earnings for utility services for the nine months ended 
September 30 to $44.8 million or $1.51 a share compared to $41.9 million or 
$1.43 a share during the same period in 1993. Likewise, for the twelve months 
ended September 30, utility services earned $65.5 million or $2.21 a share 
versus $52.9 million or $1.82 a share during the comparable prior
twelve-month period.

NONUTILITY SERVICES

Earnings from MCN's nonutility businesses more than doubled to $3.9 million or 
$.13 a share during the third quarter from $1.8 million or $.06 a share in the 
third quarter of 1993.

Gas exploration and production (E&P) operations produced 4.8 billion cubic 
feet (Bcf) in the third quarter of 1994, boosting earnings. By comparison, 
MCN's E&P program, launched in late 1992, produced approximately 1 Bcf of 
natural gas during last year's third quarter. Through September,
year-to-date natural gas production was 10.9 Bcf.

E&P, gas marketing and computer operations services contributed to
higher nine- and twelve-month results. For the nine months ended September 30,
nonutility services earned $12.3 million or $.41 a share compared to $2.9
million or $.10 a share during the nine months ended last September 30. For the
twelve months ended September 30, nonutility services earned $19.6 million or
$.66 a share versus $5.6 million or $.19 a share during the similar
twelve-months ended period.

Glancy concluded, "With the seasonal increase in demand for natural gas
in the final quarter of the year, we anticipate we will produce record results
for 1994."

MCN Corporation is a $1.5 billion (revenues) holding company for
Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MichCon), a natural gas distribution and
transmission company serving 1.1 million customers in more than 500 communities
throughout Michigan; for Citizens Gas Fuel Company, a Michigan natural gas
utility; and for MCN Investment Corporation, which owns subsidiaries involved
in gas exploration and production, marketing, cogeneration, gas storage,
gathering and processing, and computer operations services.
