To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors
of Marshall & Ilsley Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Marshall &
Ilsley Corporation (a Wisconsin corporation) and subsidiaries as of December
31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992
and 1991. The consolidated statements give retroactive effect to the merger
with Valley Bancorporation on May 31, 1994, which has been accounted for as a
pooling of interests as described in Note 2. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Marshall & Ilsley
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results
of their operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992
and 1991, after giving retroactive effect to the merger with Valley
Bancorporation as described in Note 2, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 1992, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions and income taxes.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991 ($000's except share data)

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation principles - The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of Marshall & Ilsley Corporation (the "Corporation") and all
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in the 1992 and 1991 Consolidated
Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform with the 1993
presentation.

Cash and cash equivalents - For purposes of the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Corporation defines cash equivalents as short-term investments
which have an original maturity of three months or less and are readily
convertible into cash.

Securities - Securities, when purchased, are designated as Trading, Investment
Securities Held to Maturity, or Investment Securities Available for Sale and
remain in that category until they are sold or mature. The specific
identification method is used in determining the cost of securities sold.

Investment Securities Held to Maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Investment Securities
Available for Sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market. See
Note 6 for changes affecting Investment Securities Available for Sale beginning
January 1, 1994. Short-term Investments other than Trading Securities are
stated at cost, which approximates market value. Trading Securities are
carried at January 1, 1994. Short-term Investments other than Trading
Securities are stated at cost, which approximates market value. Trading
Securities are carried at market value. Adjustments to the carrying value of
securities are reflected in the consolidated income statements.

Loans - Interest on loans, other than direct financing leases, is recognized as
income based on the loan principal outstanding during the period. Unearned
income on direct financing leases is recognized over the lease term on a basis
that results in an approximate level rate of return on the lease investment.
Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they are past due 90 days
as to either interest or principal. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,
previously accrued and uncollected interest is charged to interest income on
loans. A nonaccrual loan may be restored to an accrual basis when interest and
principal payments are brought current and collectibility of future payments is
not in doubt.

The Corporation defers and amortizes fees and certain incremental direct costs,
primarily salary and employee benefit expenses, over the contractual term of the
loan or lease as an adjustment to the yield. The unamortized net fees and costs
are reported as part of the loan balance outstanding.

Allowance for loan losses - The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a
level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated potential losses in
the loan portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the
allowance is based on a continual review of the loan portfolio, loan loss
experience, economic conditions, growth and composition of the portfolio, and
other relevant factors. As a result of management's continual review, the
allowance is adjusted through provisions for loan losses charged against
income.

Premises and equipment - Premises and equipment are recorded at cost and
depreciated principally on the straight-line method with annual rates varying
from 2% to 10% for buildings and 10% to 35% for equipment. Maintenance and
repairs are charged to expense and betterments are capitalized.

Other real estate owned - Other real estate owned includes assets that have been
acquired in satisfaction of debts, accounted for as insubstance foreclosures, or
bank branch premises held for sale. Other real estate is recorded at the lower
of cost or fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the date of transfer.
Valuation adjustments required at the date of transfer for assets acquired in
satisfaction of debts or accounted for as insubstance foreclosures are charged
to the allowance for loan losses, whereas any valuation adjustments on bank
branch premises are reported in other expense. Subsequent to transfer, other
real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair market value, less
estimated selling costs, based upon periodic evaluations. Rental income from
properties and gains on sales are included in other income, and property
expenses, which include carrying costs, required valuation adjustments and
losses on sales, are recorded in other expense.

<PAGE>
Mortgage servicing - Normal fees related to the servicing of mortgage loans are
recorded as income when payments are received from mortgagors. Gains or losses
recognized on the sale of mortgage loans are adjusted to reflect any excess or
below market servicing fee generated at the time of sale. Mortgage loans held
for sale to investors are carried at the lower of cost or market, determined on
an aggregate basis, based on outstanding firm commitments received for such
loans or on current market prices.

Data processing services - Direct costs associated with the production of
computer software which will be marketed or used in data processing operations
are capitalized and amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated
economic life of the product, generally four years. Direct costs associated
with customer system conversions to the data services operations are
capitalized and amortized on the straight-line method over the terms,
generally five to seven years, of the related servicing contract. Routine
maintenance of software products, design costs and development costs incurred
prior to establishment of a product's technological feasibility are expensed as
incurred. Net unamortized capitalized costs were $16,979 at December 31, 1993,
and $11,189 at December 31, 1992. Amortization expense was $4,668, $5,161, and
$6,059, for 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

Intangibles - Unamortized intangibles resulting from acquisitions, primarily
goodwill, core deposit premiums and purchased mortgage servicing rights were
$58,890 at December 31, 1993, and $57,532 at December 31, 1992. Purchased
mortgage servicing rights are amortized primarily over the periods during which
the corresponding servicing revenues are anticipated to be generated.
Adjustments for portfolio runoff in excess of that originally anticipated are
made in the period when the excess runoff appears permanent. The other
intangibles are amortized principally on the straight-line method over periods
ranging from 6 to 25 years. Amortization expense was $7,204, $7,159, and
$7,429, for 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. The Corporation also has
approximately $14,000 of negative goodwill included in other liabilities as of
December 31, 1993. The majority of this amount arose from a 1992 acquisition
and is being accreted on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years.
Accretion of $1,576 and $807 is included in the 1993 and 1992 results of
operations, respectively.

Foreign exchange contracts - The Corporation enters into foreign exchange
contracts primarily to enable customers involved in international trade to hedge
their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. These contracts are carried at
market value, with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in other
income.

Stock split - Common stock per share and average share information for years
1992 and prior have been retroactively restated for the 3 for 1 stock split
effected in the form of a 200% stock dividend which was distributed to
shareholders in May 1993.

Net income per share - Primary net income per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus common equivalent
shares issuable upon the assumed conversion of the preferred stock outstanding
and shares issuable under outstanding stock option plans. The average number of
common and common equivalent shares used in computing primary net income per
share was 102,672,361 in 1993, 101,028,932 in 1992, and 97,993,374 in 1991.

Fully diluted net income per share also includes dilution resulting from the
assumed conversion of the convertible notes. The average number of shares used
in the computation of fully diluted net income per share was 108,874,600 in
1993, 107,411,875 in 1992, and 105,015,610 in 1991.

2. Business Combination

On May 31, 1994, Valley Bancorporation ("Valley") merged with and into the
Corporation in a tax-free reorganization accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Accordingly, prior year financial statements have been restated to
give effect to this transaction. In accordance with the terms of the merger,
each share of Valley Common Stock was converted into the right to receive 1.72
shares of the Corporation's Common Stock (approximately 35.7 million shares).

A reconciliation of net interest income and net income of the Corporation as
previously reported to the amounts for that period in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements as restated for the 1994 pooling of interests
is as follows:
1993 1992 1991
------------------------------
Net Interest Income:
Corporation, as previously reported $ 309,178 $ 307,805 $ 288,968
Valley Bancorporation 171,101 164,746 140,530
--------- --------- ---------
Combined $ 480,279 $ 472,551 $ 429,498
========= ========= =========
Net Income:
Corporation, as previously reported $ 125,491 $ 109,235 $ 99,347
Valley Bancorporation 45,903 38,032 30,666
--------- --------- ---------
Combined $ 171,394 $ 147,267 $ 130,013
========= ========= =========

Certain divestitures were required in connection with regulatory approvals
obtained for the merger. The Corporation has filed applications with such
authorities proposing the divestiture of certain bank branches in the State of
Wisconsin with total deposits of approximately $300 million. The Federal
Regulators required and the Corporation obtained commitments for the
divestitures prior to consummation of the merger and will complete the
divestitures within six months of the consummation of the merger. The
Corporation does not anticipate that such divestitures will have a material
impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Corporation estimates that employee severance and contract costs, write-
downs and write-offs of duplicative facilities, equipment and data processing
software associated with the merger will result in a one-time merger/
restructuring charge of approximately $80 million, $48 million net of tax, in
1994. Also, an additional loan loss provision may be recorded after the
consummation of the merger to conform Valley's loan valuation policies with
those of the Corporation. While the amounts have not been quantified, it is not
anticipated that the amount of such provision will be material to the combined
entity.

The Corporation has also consummated the following business combinations:

Financial Date Method of

------------ ----------- ------------------ ----------

Exchange State Bank January 2, 1991 $ 5,886 Purchase

United Savings &
Loan Association,
S.S.B. July 1, 1992 -- Purchase
Pierce County Bank
and Trust Company November 6, 1993 $14,678 Purchase

The results of operations for the acquired companies accounted for as purchases
are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the dates of
acquisition.

3. Changes in Method of Accounting

During 1992, the Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standard No. 106
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits, Other than Pensions" (FAS
106). This standard, which applies to the Corporation's employee health plans,
requires that the expected cost of these postretirement benefits be charged to
expense in the years the employees render the services necessary to earn their
benefits. The Corporation elected immediate recognition of the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at January 1, 1992.

The Corporation also adopted during 1992, Financial Accounting Standard No. 109
"Accounting for Income Taxes." Statement 109 requires a change from the
deferred method of accounting for income taxes to an asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under Statement 109, the
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The
cumulative effect of the change in accounting for income taxes at January 1,
1992, amounted to a $4.8 million reduction of beginning net deferred tax
liabilities.

<PAGE>
The following table summarizes the January 1, 1992 effects of these changes in
methods of accounting:

4. Cash and Due from Banks

At December 31, 1993, $183,259 of cash and due from banks was restricted,
primarily due to requirements of the Federal Reserve System to maintain certain
reserve balances.

5. Other Short-term Investments

Other short-term investments at December 31 were:

The gross realized gains and losses amounted to $8,552 and $218 in 1993 and
$14,743 and $5,536 in 1992, and $6,837 and $1,731 in 1991, respectively.

At December 31, 1993, securities with a value of approximately $413,256 were
pledged to secure public deposits, short-term borrowings, and for other purposes
required by law.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities," (FAS 115). FAS 115 requires, among other things,
that securities classified as available for sale be carried at fair value,
however, fair value adjustments and the related income tax effects, are excluded
from earnings and reported separately as a component of shareholders' equity.
In anticipation of this new standard, the Corporation conducted a review of its
investment portfolio. This review resulted in reclassifications of Investment
Securities Held to Maturity and Investment Securities Available for Sale at
December 31, 1993. This new standard which must be adopted by the Corporation
on January 1, 1994 will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

7. Loans

Loans at December 31 were:
1993 1992
---------- ----------
Commercial, financial, and agricultural $2,538,830 $2,471,150
Industrial development revenue bonds 45,889 58,388

Lease financing 257,622 242,282
---------- ----------
Total loans $8,617,372 $7,980,845
========== ==========

The Corporation's lending activities are concentrated primarily in the Midwest.
Approximately 2.5% of its portfolio consists of loans granted to customers
located in Arizona. The Corporation had $3,029 in foreign credits at December
31, 1993. The Corporation's loan portfolio consists of business loans extending
across many industry types, as well as loans to individuals. As of December 31,
1993, total loans to any group of customers engaged in similar activities and
having similar economic characteristics, as defined by standard industrial
classifications, did not exceed 10% of total loans.

The Corporation evaluates the credit risk of each customer on an individual
basis and, where deemed appropriate, collateral is obtained. Collateral varies
by Individual loan customer but may include accounts receivable, inventory,
real estate, equipment, deposits, personal and government guaranties, and
general security agreements. Access to collateral is dependent upon the type of
collateral obtained. On an on-going basis, the Corporation monitors its
collateral and the collateral value related to the loan balance outstanding.

An analysis of loans outstanding to directors and officers, including their
related interests, of the Corporation and its significant subsidiaries for 1993
is presented below. All of these loans were made in the ordinary course of
business with normal credit terms, including interest rates and collateral. The
beginning balance has been adjusted to reflect the activity of newly-appointed
directors and executive officers and directors and executive officers of
subsidiaries previously not considered significant.

Balance, beginning of year $ 134,587
New loans 242,962
Repayments (255,981)
---------
Balance, end of year $ 121,568
=========

An analysis of the allowance for loan losses follows:

1993 1992 1991
-------- -------- --------
Balance, beginning of year $123,805 $105,156 $ 94,145
Allowance of Banks Acquired 1,167 4,284 4,344
Provision charged to expense 18,034 23,546 28,924

Recoveries 8,060 13,163 7,799
-------- ------- -------
Balance, end of year $133,600 $123,805 $105,156
======== ======== ========

As of December 31, 1993, and 1992, nonaccrual loans totalled $44,186 and
$52,811, respectively. The effect of nonaccrual loans on net income in 1993,
1992, and 1991, was not significant.

In May 1993, the FASB also issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," (FAS 114).
FAS 114 requires that a loan's value be measured when it has been determined
that the loan is impaired and loss is probable. Write-downs which result from
the measurement process are to be expensed. This new standard must be adopted
by the first quarter of 1995. Based upon the current status of the
Corporation's loan portfolio, it is not anticipated that this pronouncement
will have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

8. Premises and Equipment

The composition of premises and equipment at December 31 was:

1993 1992
-------- --------

Land $ 40,538 $ 39,771

The Corporation leases certain of its facilities and equipment. Rent expense
under such operating leases was $20,420 in 1993, $19,925 in 1992, and $20,419 in
1991, respectively.

9. Short-term Borrowings

Short-term borrowings at December 31 were:
1993 1992

Total long-term borrowings $234,418 $194,861
======== ========

The Series A and B unsecured note agreements place certain limitations on
indebtedness which may be incurred or guaranteed by the Corporation, the payment
of cash dividends and the purchase or redemption of the Corporation's stock.
The Corporation may elect to prepay the senior unsecured notes at any time
subject to a premium.

<PAGE>
The 8.5% convertible subordinated notes (the "Notes") require semi-annual
interest payments and are convertible at the option of the holder into common
stock at a conversion price of $8.75. The holder has the right to exchange
common stock, acquired by conversion of the Notes or otherwise, for Series A
convertible preferred stock ("Series A"). The holder may own up to 24.9%
(computed as the percentage of common shares owned directly or indirectly
through conversion privileges) of the Corporation's outstanding common stock and
convertible securities, but may not own directly more than 5% of the
Corporation's outstanding common stock. Except under limited circumstances, the
holder may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Notes or common stock
acquired by conversion, and then, only under prescribed conditions and subject
to the Corporation's right of first refusal.

A portion of the Notes qualify as equity contract notes as defined by the
applicable guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
The Notes require the holder to take common stock (or other equity securities)
in lieu of cash in satisfaction of the claim for principal repayment, unless the
Corporation sells new common stock (or certain other equity securities) and
dedicates the proceeds thereof to the redemption or retirement of the Notes.

In July 1993, the Corporation issued $100 million of unsecured subordinated
notes at a price of 99.351%. Interest is payable semiannually in January and
July of each year and the notes mature July 15, 2003. The notes are not
redeemable prior to maturity and qualify as "Tier 2" or supplementary capital
for regulatory capital purposes.

The Corporation has filed registration statements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to issue up to $100 million of medium-term unsecured and
unsubordinated Series B and up to $150 million of medium-term unsecured and
unsubordinated Series C notes. Both issues have maturities which range from 9
months to 30 years from the date of issue, at a fixed or floating rate.

The Medium-term Series B notes outstanding at December 31, 1993 mature in 1994
through 1996, and have fixed interest rates of 4.60% to 8.65%. Approximately
$35,730 of unissued Series B notes are remaining and available to be issued in
the future. At December 31, 1993, there were no Series C notes outstanding.

The nonrecourse notes are reported net of prepaid interest and represent
borrowings by the leasing subsidiary from banks and other financial
institutions. These notes have a weighted average interest rate of 7.77% at
December 31, 1993, and are due in installments over varying periods through
2001. Lease financing receivables at least equal to the amount of the notes
are pledged as collateral.

Scheduled maturities of long-term borrowings are: $65,254, $19,150, $43,578, and
$751 for 1995 through 1998, respectively.

11. Shareholders' Equity

The Corporation has 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, of which the
Board of Directors has designated 500,000 shares as Series A convertible, with
a $100 value per share for conversion purposes. Series A is nonvoting preferred
stock. The same cash dividends will be paid on Series A as would have been paid
on the common stock exchanged for Series A. Series A has the same restrictions
on sale as are applicable to the 8.5% convertible subordinated notes.

The holder of the convertible subordinated notes has the option through 1997 to
exchange common stock of the Corporation for Series A. If the common stock is
acquired by the holder in conversion of the Notes, the exchange ratio is one
share of Series A for 11.43 shares of common stock. If acquired otherwise, the
exchange ratio is one share of Series A, valued at $100, to the holder's
weighted average purchase price per common share. Also, the holder has the
option to convert Series A into common stock at the same ratio that the common
stock was exchanged for Series A. The Corporation has issued 185,314 shares of
its Series A convertible preferred stock in exchange for 1,962,900 shares of
common stock, which were subsequently retired.

The preferred stock is treated as a common stock equivalent in all per share
calculations.

In April 1993, the Corporation's Board of Directors authorized a common share
repurchase program for 5.7 million shares in anticipation of the conversion of
its 8.5% convertible subordinated notes and reaffirmed the Corporation's
on-going program for the repurchase of up to 1.5 million shares annually to
fund obligations to deliver or have available shares of common stock for stock
option and other employee benefit plans. During 1993, the Corporation
purchased 5.0 million common shares.

<PAGE>
Federal banking regulatory agencies have established capital adequacy rules
which take into account risk attributable to balance sheet assets and
off-balance sheet activities. All banks and bank holding companies must meet
a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8%. Of the 8% required, half must
be comprised of core capital elements defined as Tier 1 capital. The federal
banking agencies also have adopted leverage capital guidelines which banking
organizations must meet. Under these guidelines, the most highly rated banking
organizations must meet a minimum leverage ratio of at least 3% Tier 1 capital
to total assets, while lower rated banking organizations must maintain a ratio
of at least 4% to 5%.

<PAGE>
The Corporation's risk-based capital and leverage ratios are as follows:

All of the Corporation's banking subsidiaries' risk-based capital and leverage
ratios meet or exceed the defined minimum requirements.

Banking subsidiaries are restricted by banking regulations from making dividend
distributions above prescribed amounts and are limited in making loans and
advances to the Corporation. At December 31, 1993, the retained earnings of
subsidiaries available for distribution as dividends without regulatory approval
was approximately $287,563.

12. Income Taxes

Total income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 was
allocated as follows:

1993 1992
-------- --------
Income before Cumulative Changes in
Accounting $ 93,190 $ 75,391

Amounts Recognized for Financial Reporting
Purposes (8,154) (2,571)
-------- --------
$ 85,036 $ 59,165
======== ========

As discussed in Note 3, the Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standard
No. 109 in 1992. This change had no significant effect on net income,
excluding the cumulative effect, in 1992. Financial statements for 1991 have
not been restated to apply the new standard.

The current and deferred portions of the provision for income taxes were:

1993 1992 1991
------- ------- -------
Current:
Federal $81,561 $71,896 $46,298

The following is a reconciliation between the amount of the provision for income
taxes and the amount of tax computed by applying the statutory Federal income
tax rate (35% in 1993, 34% in 1992 and 1991, respectively):

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant elements
of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, are as
follows:

1993 1992
--------- ---------
Deferred tax assets:
Deferred compensation $ 7,996 $ 7,301
Allowance for loan losses 33,938 29,426
Accrued postretirement benefits 11,769 10,205

========= =========

The amount of income tax expense related to net securities gains amounted to
$3,103, $3,675, and $1,576, in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

13. Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans

The Corporation has Executive Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans which
provide for the grant of nonqualified and incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights and rights to purchase restricted shares to key employees at
prices ranging from not less than the par value of the common shares to the fair
market value of the shares at the date of grant.

Activity relating to common stock options, restated for the 3 for 1 stock split,
was:

Number Option Price
Of Shares Per Share
--------- ---------------

Shares under option at December 31, 1991 7,749,351 $ 2.17 - 17.21
Options granted 1,222,249 12.40 - 19.92
Options lapsed or surrendered (43,230) 2.17 - 17.21
Options exercised (1,125,576) 2.17 - 13.38
--------- ---------------
Shares under option at December 31, 1992 7,802,794 $ 3.35 - 19.92
Options granted 839,040 15.38 - 23.25
Options lapsed or surrendered (18,215) 9.34 - 19.50
Options exercised (2,228,186) 3.35 - 19.50
--------- ---------------
Shares under option at December 31, 1993 6,395,433 $ 4.03 - 23.25
=========

Options exercisable at December 31, 1993, and 1992, were 5,542,645 and
6,169,783, respectively. Shares reserved for the granting of additional
options at December 31, 1993, were 3,859,774.

<PAGE>
There were no restricted stock purchase rights outstanding at December 31, 1993,
and 1992. In addition, there were no stock purchase rights exercised during
1993 and 85,500 rights exercised in 1992.

Restrictions on stock issued pursuant to the exercise of stock purchase rights
lapse within a seven-year period. Accordingly, the compensation related to
issuance of the rights is deferred and amortized over the vesting period.
Unamortized deferred compensation is reflected as a reduction of shareholders'
equity.

Aggregate compensation expense related to stock purchase rights was $1,008,
$1,004, and $1,129, in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

14. Employee Retirement and Health Plans

The Corporation has a defined contribution retirement plan for substantially all
employees. The plan provides for a guaranteed contribution for eligible
participants equal to 2% of compensation. At the Corporation's option, a profit
sharing amount may also be contributed and may vary from year to year up to a
maximum of 6% of eligible compensation. Total retirement plan expense on this
plan was $12,915, $11,927, and $10,591, in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

The Corporation also has supplemental retirement plans to provide retirement
benefits to certain of its key executives. Total expense relating to these
plans amounted to $2,703 in 1993, $4,561 in 1992, and $166 in 1991.

Valley maintained a trusteed defined benefit retirement plan which covered
substantially all its employees. The following table reflects the plan's funded
status and amounts recognized in the financial statements at December 31:

1993 1992
-------- --------
Actuarial present value of benefit obligations:
Vested benefit obligation $ 38,326 $ 26,311
Nonvested benefit obligation 1,820 1,283
-------- --------
Accumulated benefit obligation 40,146 27,594
Effect of projected future compensation levels 19,911 13,857
-------- --------
Projected benefit obligation 60,057 41,451
Plan assets at fair value 45,159 37,163
-------- --------
Plan assets less than projected
benefit obligations (14,898) (4,288)
Unrecognized net loss 23,148 9,970
Unrecognized prior service cost 2,401 2,642
Unrecognized net asset (1,672) (1,811)
-------- --------
Prepaid pension cost $ 8,979 $ 6,513
======== ========

The net pension cost for 1993, 1992, and 1991, included the following
components:

1993 1992 1991
---------- ----------- ----------

Service cost $ 3,361 $ 2,348 $ 1,898
Interest cost 3,283 2,502 2,244
Actual return on plan assets (2,885) (1,852) (3,423)
Net amortization and deferral (416) (882) 1,306
-------- -------- --------
Net periodic pension cost $ 3,343 $ 2,116 $ 2,025
======== ======== ========

The following assumptions were used in determining the projected benefit
obligation:

1993 1992
------ ------

Discount rate 6.75% 8.00%
Rate of increase in compensation levels 5.00% 5.00%
Expected long-term rate of return
on assets 10.00% 10.00%

<PAGE>
As of the merger date former Valley employees will become eligible to
participate in the Corporation's defined contribution pension plan.

The Corporation sponsors a defined benefit health plan that provides health care
benefits to all eligible current and retired employees. The plan is
contributory, with contributions adjusted periodically such that participants
contribute approximately 40% of the cost of health care benefits. The plan also
contains other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance.
Retiree eligibility is dependent upon age, years of service, and participation
in the health plan during active service. The plan is not funded.

Valley provided postretirement health care benefits to retired employees. These
benefits are subject to deductibles, copayment provisions and other limitations.
Only those employees retiring on or before December 31, 1994 will be eligible
for such benefits. As part of the merger, all former Valley employees will
become eligible to participate in the Corporation's postretirement health plan.
The Corporation will not recognize years of service with Valley prior to the
merger.

As discussed in Note 3, the Corporation adopted FAS 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits, Other than Pensions" as of January 1, 1992. The
Corporation elected immediate recognition of the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of the beginning of the year through a one-time charge to
earnings of $19,934 before income taxes. Valley's results of operations have
been restated to conform their policy to the Corporation, thereby resulting in
a total charge to earnings of $22,789. Postretirement benefit costs for 1991
were recorded on the cash basis.

The components of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
reconciled with the amount recognized in the Corporation's Consolidated Balance
Sheets at December 31, were:

1993 1992
-------- --------

Accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation:
Retirees $ 13,602 $ 11,192
Fully eligible active plan
participants 9,019 4,098
Active plan participants 16,679 9,751
-------- --------
39,300 25,041
Unrecognized gain (loss) (10,837) 29
-------- --------
Accrued postretirement benefit cost $ 28,463 $ 25,070
======== ========

Weighted average discount rate
used in determining APBO 7.50% 8.50%
======== ========

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 1993
and 1992 includes the following components:

1993 1992
-------- --------

Service cost $ 1,385 $ 1,212
Interest on APBO 2,279 1,668
-------- --------
$ 3,664 $ 2,880
======== ========

For measurement purposes, the assumed health care cost trend rate was 14% and
13% in 1992 and 1993, respectively, and gradually declines to 6.5% in the year
2021.

The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the
amounts reported. An increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one
percentage point would increase the APBO at December 31, 1993 by $4,376 and
increase 1993 postretirement benefit expense by $701.

<PAGE>
In November 1992, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
112 "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," (FAS 112). FAS 112
establishes accounting and reporting standards for employers who provide
benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement
and must be adopted in the first quarter of 1994. Based on the current types of
postemployment benefits provided by the Corporation, it is not anticipated that
this new standard will have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

15. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk at December 31 were:

1993 1992
----------- ----------
Financial instruments whose amounts
represent credit risk:
Commitments to extend credit:
To commercial customers $3,210,573 $2,639,331
To individuals 725,122 617,827
Standby letters of credit, net of
participations 295,382 268,664
Commercial letters of credit 17,032 15,131
Mortgage loans sold with recourse 8,408 12,695
Financial instruments whose amounts
exceed the amount of credit risk:
Foreign exchange contracts:
Commitments to purchase foreign exchange 229,061 152,544
Commitments to deliver foreign exchange 231,925 154,287
Options written 24,251 20,263
Interest rate swaps 105,000 50,000

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates and may require payment of a fee. Since
many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the
total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

The Corporation evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on an individual
basis. Collateral obtained, if any, upon extension of credit, is based upon
management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral requirements and the
ability to access collateral is generally similar to that required on loans
outstanding as discussed in Note 7.

Standby and commercial letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by
the Corporation to support the financial obligations of a customer to a third
party. Standby letters of credit are issued to support public and private
financing, and other financial or performance obligations of customers.
Commercial letters of credit are issued to support payment obligations of
a customer as buyer in a commercial contract for the purchase of goods.
Letters of credit have maturities which generally reflect the maturities of
the underlying obligations. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of
credit is the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. If deemed
necessary, the Corporation holds various forms of collateral to support letters
of credit.

Mortgage loans sold with recourse are pools of residential mortgage loans sold
to government agencies subject to certain underwriting requirements. If the
loans do not meet the underwriting requirements of the government agencies, the
Corporation may be required to reacquire the loans.

Interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange, at specified intervals, interest
payment streams calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount with at
least one stream based on a floating rate index. Periodic payments between
counterparties are typically settled on a net basis over the life of the swap.
Interest rate swaps are subject to the market risk inherent in such agreements
and the risk that a counterparty will fail to meet the terms of the agreement.

Foreign exchange contracts are commitments to purchase or deliver foreign
currency at a specified exchange rate. These contracts are entered into to
hedge the Corporation's own exposure, and to enable customers involved in
international trade to hedge their exposure, to foreign currency fluctuations.
Generally, the Corporation does not require collateral to support these
financial instruments.

<PAGE>
The Corporation's market risk from unfavorable movements in currency exchange
rates is minimized by essentially matching commitments to deliver foreign
exchange with commitments to purchase foreign exchange.

16. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The book values and estimated fair values for on and off-balance sheet financial
instruments as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 are reflected below.

BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ($ In Millions)

1993 1992

Other long-term borrowings 247.6 255.6 191.9 202.2
Interest payable 39.1 39.1 38.9 38.9

Where readily available, quoted market prices were utilized by the Corporation.
If quoted market prices were not available, fair values were based on estimates
using present value or other valuation techniques. These techniques were
significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and
estimates of future cash flows. The calculated fair value estimates, therefore,
cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases,
could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. Statement 107
excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial assets and
liabilities from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair
value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the
Corporation.

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value for
financial instruments.

Cash and Short-term Investments
- - -------------------------------

The carrying amounts reported for cash and short-term investments approximates
the fair values for those assets.

Trading and Investment Securities
- - ---------------------------------

Fair value is based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. See Note 6,
Securities, for additional information.

<PAGE>
Loans
- - -----

Loans that reprice or mature within three months of December 31 were assigned
fair values based on their book value. Market values were used on performing
loans where available. Most remaining loan balances were assigned fair values
based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rate was based on the
treasury yield curve, with rate adjustments for credit quality, cost and profit
factors.

Deposits
- - --------

The fair value for demand deposits or any interest bearing deposits with no
fixed maturity date was considered to be equal to the carrying value. Time
deposits with defined maturity dates were considered to have a fair value
equal to the book value if the maturity date was within three months of
December 31. The remaining time deposits were assigned fair values based
on a discounted cash flow analysis using discount rates which approximate
interest rates currently being offered on time deposits with comparable
maturities.

Borrowings
- - ----------

Short-term borrowings are carried at cost which approximates fair value. The
Corporation has convertible debt (see Note 10) for which fair value was
considered to be the current market value of the shares that would be issued in
a full conversion. Other long-term debt was generally valued using a discounted
cash flow analysis with a discount rate based on current incremental borrowing
rates for similar types of arrangements or, if not readily available, based on
a build up approach similar to that used for loans and deposits. Long-term
borrowings include their related current maturities.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ($ in millions)

Fair values of Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit have been estimated based
on the equivalent fees, net of expenses, that would be charged for similar
contracts and customers at December 31. The fair value of interest rate swaps
are based on pricing models using current assumptions.

1993 1992
------ ------

Loan commitments $ 9.8 $ 7.3
Letters of credit 2.8 2.6
Interest rate swaps .1 --

Foreign exchange contracts are carried at market value (U.S. dollar equivalent
of the underlying contract).

The Corporation owns 53 banks, 2 savings associations, and numerous nonbank
subsidiaries. Each subsidiary is a separate legal and operating entity. Our
banking operations provide traditional banking products along with trust,
mortgage banking, leasing, insurance agency and venture capital services. M&I
Data Services, Inc. (DSI) provides data processing, software, and other related
services to both affiliated and unaffiliated customers. In addition, a Valley
affiliate provided similar services and other operational support to affiliated
customers.

Revenues from affiliated customers are primarily accounted for at rates similar
to those charged to unaffiliated customers.

Operating profit is pretax net income. Depreciation and amortization expense
for the banking services business amounted to $30,378, $18,365, and $19,106 in
1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively, and for DSI amounted to $26,680 in 1993,
$23,012 in 1992, and $19,992 in 1991.
