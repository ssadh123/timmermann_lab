ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On July 25, 1994, the following news release was issued:

UNOCAL REPORTS $50 MILLION EARNINGS FOR SECOND QUARTER

Los Angeles, July 25 -- Unocal Corporation today reported second
quarter 1994 net earnings of $50 million, or 16 cents per common share,
compared with $88 million, or 33 cents per common share, for the same
period last year. Total revenues were slightly lower -- $2.05 billion
versus $2.1 billion a year ago.
Excluding the effect of special items (detailed in attached table),
Unocal's earnings from operations for the second quarter were $65 million,
or 23 cents per common share. This compares with operating earnings of $88
million, or 33 cents per common share, last year.
For the first six months of 1994, Unocal's reported net earnings were
$104 million, or 35 cents per common share. This compares with $99
million, or 34 cents per common share, for the same period a year ago.
Revenues were $3.96 billion, down from $4.42 billion last year.
Adjusting for special items, earnings from operations for the six
months were $127 million, down from $186 million last year. Adjusted
earnings per common share were 45 cents, down from 70 cents last year.
Roger C. Beach, Unocal chief executive officer, said the company's
worldwide crude oil and natural gas production were both up 7 percent from
last year's second quarter. He noted that domestic gas production, which
has been a major focus of Unocal's accelerated development program, was
1,119 million cubic feet per day, up 22 percent from last year's second
quarter.
"Operating earnings were lower, however, because commodity prices
trailed behind the year-ago levels," Beach said.
He added that crude oil prices have strengthened since the middle of
the second quarter. "Continued improvements in commodity prices, combined
with increasing production levels, would benefit Unocal in the future," he
said.
Beach said that Unocal's worldwide average crude oil sales price was
$13.92 per barrel in the second quarter, compared with $11.32 in the first
quarter and $15.93 a year ago. The company's worldwide average natural gas
sales price was $1.89 per thousand cubic feet (mcf), compared with $2.04
per mcf in the previous quarter and $2.08 per mcf in the second quarter
1993.
Cash flows from operations in the second quarter, before working
capital changes, were $353 million, up from $351 million last year.

Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $254 million, down
from $297 million in the same period a year ago. Beach said that total
capital expenditures for the year are expected to range from $1.3 billion
to $1.4 billion under current crude oil price situations.

SECOND QUARTER OPERATIONS
- -------------------------
Exploration and production earnings were $79 million, down from $113
million a year ago. The lower earnings were due principally to lower
crude oil and natural gas prices, which remained below year-ago levels.
This was partially offset by higher worldwide crude oil and natural gas
production. Adjusted for special items, earnings from petroleum
exploration and production operations were $92 million, compared with $122
million in the same period a year ago.
Earnings from refining, marketing and transportation were $38 million,
down from $46 million in the second quarter a year ago, when the company
recorded gains from asset sales. Adjusting for special items, operating
earnings from the downstream segment were $37 million, up from $32 million
last year. Despite the improvement in operating earnings, West Coast
product margins continued to lag behind last year.
Chemicals earnings were $13 million, down from $16 million in the
second quarter 1993 due principally to lower petroleum coke earnings.
Geothermal earnings were $9 million, compared with $6 million a year
ago. The improved earnings were due to adjustments in the depreciation
schedule to reflect the longer productive life of The Geysers geothermal
project in Northern California.
Net expense for corporate and other was $89 million in the second
quarter of 1994. This compares with an expense of $93 million in the same
period of 1993. Adjusted for special items, net expense for corporate and
other was $86 million, compared with $88 million last year.
