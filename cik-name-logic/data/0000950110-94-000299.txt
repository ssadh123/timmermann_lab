Item 5. Other Events

On August 22, 1994, Johnson & Johnson (the "Company") announced that it had
entered into an agreement with Neutrogena Corporation ("Neutrogena") pursuant to
which it would acquire for a net price of approximately $924 million all of the
outstanding shares of common stock and options to purchase shares of common
stock of Neutrogena through a tender offer and subsequent merger. During the
week of September 26, 1994, the Company acquired and made payment for the
Neutrogena common stock tendered in the tender offer, which represented
approximately 98.6% of the Neutrogena common stock outstanding. On October 3,
1994, the Company consummated a short form merger pursuant to which the
remaining shares of Neutrogena common stock were acquired at the same price per
share paid pursuant to the tender offer.

On September 6, 1994, the Company announced that it had entered into an
agreement with Eastman Kodak Company ("Kodak") to purchase Kodak's clinical
diagnostics division for $1.008 billion. It is anticipated that the closing of
such acquisition will occur during the fourth quarter of 1994. Such acquisition
is subject to customary conditions.

DESCRIPTION OF UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
July 3, 1994, and the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Income for the twelve months ended January 2, 1994 and the six months ended July
3, 1994, give effect to the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements are based on the historical Consolidated Financial Statements of
Johnson & Johnson ("J&J"), Neutrogena Corporation ("Neutrogena"), and the
Clinical Diagnostics Division ("CDD") of Eastman Kodak Company ("Kodak") under
the assumptions and adjustments set forth in the accompanying Notes to the
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

The 1993 fiscal year ended on January 2, 1994 for J&J, December 31, 1993 for CDD
and October 31, 1993 for Neutrogena. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet assumes that the transactions were consummated on
July 3, 1994 and the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Income assume that the transactions were consummated on January 4, 1993 for the
fiscal year ended January 2, 1994 and January 3, 1994 for the six month period
ended July 3, 1994. The historical Statements of Income for Neutrogena which
were used in preparing the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements
of Income are: November 1, 1992 - October 31, 1993 for the fiscal year 1993 and
February 1, 1994 - July 31, 1994 for the six months ended July 3, 1994. The
Neutrogena Balance Sheet used in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of July 3, 1994 is the Neutrogena Balance Sheet as of July 31,
1994.

The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain
assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The allocations of the
purchase price assigned to the assets acquired, including their related
amortizations, and the liabilities assumed in the accompanying Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are based upon preliminary
estimates and will be revised when the final fair value allocations are
determined, as will the related income tax effects of the pro forma adjustments.
For purposes of developing the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet, the book value of Neutrogena's and CDD's assets are assumed to
approximate fair market value, and the excess purchase price has been allocated
to goodwill.

<PAGE>

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income exclude any
nonrecurring costs for merging the companies. The amount of these costs cannot
be determined until the transactions are completed. Also excluded from the
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income are any benefits
that could have resulted from the transactions due to synergies that may have
been derived and from the elimination of duplicate efforts.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may not be
indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the transactions
had been in effect on the dates indicated or which may be obtained in the
future, due to the hypothetical nature of the pro forma information. The
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the
historical audited Consolidated Financial Statements for J&J, Neutrogena and the
unaudited divisional historical results and account balances of CDD. CDD has
been operated by Kodak as a division, hence the historical results and account
balances were not audited as if it were a separate company. Various allocations
and "carve out" adjustments have been made in the preparation of the historical
results of CDD.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
STATEMENTS OF INCOME

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income have been
prepared to reflect the transactions as if they occurred on January 4, 1993 for
the fiscal year ended January 2, 1994 and January 3, 1994 for the six months
ended July 3, 1994. The acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. The excess of the purchase price over the net assets
acquired is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 40-year period for
the Neutrogena acquisition and over a 30 year period for the CDD acquisition.
Since the acquisition of Neutrogena was just completed and the acquisition of
CDD is pending, information is not yet available to assign a fair market value
to the individual assets.

The following is a summary of reclassifications and adjustments reflected in the
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income:

Note A: Represents the historical consolidated results of J&J for the year
ended January 2, 1994 and the 6 months ended July 3, 1994.

Note B: * Represents the historical consolidated results of Neutrogena for
the year ended October 31, 1993 (11/1/92 - 10/31/93) and the six
months ended July 31, 1994 (2/1/94 - 7/31/94).

* Represents the historical results for CDD for the year ended
December 31, 1993 and the 6 months ended June 30, 1994.

Note C: Represents the effects of pro forma adjustments. The adjustments
are as follows:

1) Represents the amortization of the excess purchase price over
the net assets acquired for the acquisitions.

2) Represents the increase in interest expense based on issuance of
floating rate short-term debt at an assumed interest rate of
3.1% in 1993 and 3.6% in 1994 and fixed rate debt at an assumed
interest rate of 5.9% in 1993 and 6.8% in 1994. Also included is
the amortization of debt issuance costs to finance the
transactions. For purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma

8

<PAGE>

Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the six months
ending July 3, 1994, it is assumed that the full amount of debt
due to the transactions is outstanding as of January 2, 1994,
and that no debt was paid down in 1993.

In addition, this represents a decrease in interest income due
to the assumed use of $200MM of cash in overseas accounts to
fund the acquisitions, assuming an interest income rate of 8.1%
in 1993 and 5.9% in 1994.

3) Represents the tax effect of the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income adjustments based on the
statutory rate in effect for the periods shown. An actual tax
provision was not made for CDD since it was part of Kodak's
consolidated tax return, therefore the pro forma adjustments
include an imputed provision for taxes, at the statutory rate.

4) Pro Forma combined earnings per share amounts as presented in
the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Income are based on the combined weighted average
number of J&J shares outstanding for each period presented.
