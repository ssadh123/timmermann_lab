FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (Wednesday, October 26, 1994)

TAMBRANDS REPORTS RECORD THIRD-QUARTER SALES;
---------------------------------------------
ANNOUNCES 43RD ANNUAL DIVIDEND INCREASE
---------------------------------------

White Plains, New York--October 26, 1994--Tambrands Inc. (NYSE:TMB) today
reported third-quarter results that included record sales and improved earnings.

Net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 1994 were $175,336,000, an
increase of 9% over sales of $161,417,000 in the third quarter of 1993, driven
by substantial gains in International volumes. Net earnings were $25,024,000,
5% more than third-quarter 1993 earnings of $23,824,000. Earnings per share
increased to $0.68 in the third quarter of 1994, up 10% from earnings per share
of $0.62 in the same period of 1993. Earnings per share increased at a higher
rate than net earnings because Tambrands' stock buybacks reduced the number of
shares outstanding.

Commenting on the results, Edward T. Fogarty, President and Chief Executive
Officer, said, "I am encouraged by the third quarter. Worldwide sales reached a
new third-quarter record in dollars and in units, based on strong performances
in the United States and Europe and on new product introductions. Overall, the
quarter demonstrates that the fundamental strengths of this franchise remain in
place around the world, forming a solid foundation for future growth."

"In addition," Fogarty said, "I am delighted that Tambrands' new top management
team is now in place. As previously announced, we have recently hired Mike
Lorelli as Executive Vice President and President, North America/Latin America;
Tom Mason as Group Vice President - International; and Tom Soper as Senior Vice
President - Human Resources and Communications. With these additions to the
team, we have experienced, world-class management to lead this world-class
Tampax franchise into the future."

Companywide marketing, selling and distribution expenses in the quarter were
above last year's levels, as Tambrands continued its increased marketing
spending. This increased spending was

partially offset by reductions in administrative expenses, driven
principally by the Company's continuing overhead reduction programs.

For the first nine months of 1994, net sales were $480,133,000, compared to
$464,806,000 in the comparable period of 1993. Net earnings for the nine months
were $67,075,000, or $1.81 per share, compared to earnings before the cumulative
effect of accounting change of $52,628,000, or $1.36 per share, in the first
nine months of 1993. Excluding also the second-quarter 1993 restructuring
charge, net earnings for the first nine months of 1993 were $72,901,000.

The Company also announced that its Board of Directors had voted to increase the
regular quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock from 42 to 44 cents per
share. This is the forty-third consecutive year that the Company has increased
its dividend. The increased dividend will be payable on December 15, 1994 to
shareholders of record on December 5, 1994.

Said Fogarty, "The Board and management have great confidence in the strength of
this business, and increasing the dividend is an expression of that confidence.
We are very proud of our long history of dividend increases, which few companies
can match."

Tambrands has manufactured Tampax(R) tampons for almost 60 years, and today is
the market leader worldwide. Tambrands' major markets include the United
States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada and Spain.

A summary of consolidated operating results for the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 1994 is attached.
