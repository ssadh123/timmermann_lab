SANTA FE ENERGY RESOURCES
REPORTS 1993 RESULTS

Houston, Texas - February 8, 1994

Santa Fe Energy Resources announced that it recorded non-recurring charges
against fourth quarter operating income totaling $137.9 million, including
$127.1 million of non-cash items. As a result, the Company reported a net loss
for the full year 1993 in the amount of $77.1 million with a loss attributable
to common shares of $84.1 million or $0.94 per share. Included in the
non-recurring fourth quarter charges were about $39 million in costs primarily
related to the disposition of non-core assets under the Company's previously
announced restructuring program and approximately $99 million in property
impairments which were principally a result of lower oil prices. Before the
effect of the one-time charges, the Company recorded a gain of $7.5 million
with a gain to common shares of $0.5 million or $0.01 per share. In 1992 the
Company reported a net loss of $1.4 million with a loss attributable to common
shares of $5.7 million or $0.07 per share.

James L. Payne, Chairman and CEO said, "The non-recurring charges recorded in
the fourth quarter do not alter the productive quality of our resource base but
instead significantly reduce the Company's cost structure. That lower cost
structure combined with our strong balance sheet and our extensive, core area
inventory of low risk, high return asset exploitation opportunities have
positioned our Company for rapid growth in earnings and cash flow as prices
improve".

The Company set another record production level in 1993 with a total of 34.4
million oil equivalent barrels produced, up 12% from the prior record in 1992
due in part to the entire year's effect of the merger with Adobe Resources in
May 1992. Annualized average daily production records were established for
both oil and gas during 1993, with production of 66,700 barrels of oil and
165.4 million cubic feet of gas. In 1992 the Company reported average daily
production of 62,500 barrels of oil and 126.3 million cubic feet of gas.

The Company also continued its fine record of adding proved reserves in 1993.
Improved recovery operations along with new drilling added more than enough new
reserves to replace the year's total production; however, almost 17 million oil
equivalent barrels were sold in the 1993 disposition program. As a result,
year end proved reserves totaled 292 million oil equivalent barrels, 97% of the
301 million oil equivalent barrels at year end 1992.

Oil prices recognized by SFR during 1993 averaged $12.93 per barrel, $2.03 per
barrel below the average hedged price of $14.96 recorded for 1992. The Company
had no oil hedged in 1993. Hedged natural gas prices recognized by the Company
averaged $1.89 per thousand cubic feet, up from the average of $1.70 per
thousand cubic feet recognized in 1992. Unhedged natural gas prices received
by SFR in 1993 averaged $2.03 per thousand cubic feet compared with an average
of $1.71 per thousand cubic feet in 1992.

Revenues for the year totaled $436.9 million compared with $427.5 million in
1992. Total costs and expenses were $549.9 million, up from $370.0 million in
1992 principally due to the restructuring charges and impairments. When
measured on a unit of production basis, production and operating costs were
reduced for the third consecutive year. Overhead costs per unit of production
were also reduced from the previous year.

Discretionary cash flow for 1993 was $166.2 million or $1.85 per share compared
with $155.9 million or $1.97 per share in 1992.

RESULTS OF FOURTH QUARTER 1993

For the fourth quarter of 1993, SFR reported a net loss of $83.1 million with a
loss attributable to common shares of $84.8 million or $0.95 per share due
principally to the restructuring charges and impairments. The Company reported
a net loss of $1.7 million with a loss attributable to common shares of $3.4
million or $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 1992.

Crude oil prices recognized by Santa Fe Energy Resources during the quarter
averaged $11.15 per barrel compared with $15.13 per barrel in the 1992 period.
Natural gas prices averaged $2.11 per thousand cubic feet during the 1993
period compared with $2.07 per thousand cubic feet during the same period of
the earlier year. Oil production in the fourth quarter averaged 66,500 barrels
per day, up from 65,100 barrels per day in the 1992 period. Natural gas
production increased from 154.8 million cubic feet per day in the fourth 
quarter 1992 to 165.9 million cubic feet in the fourth quarter 1993.

Total costs and expenses, including the restructuring charges and impairments,
rose to $244.2 million in the 1993 quarter from $111.9 million in the 1992
period. Production and operating costs when measured on a unit of production
basis were reduced by more than 13% from the same period in 1992.

Discretionary cash flow for the fourth quarter of 1993 was $28.6 million or
$0.32 per share compared with $47.2 million or $0.53 per share in the 1992
period due to the lower oil prices.

Santa Fe Energy Resources is an independent oil and gas exploration and
production company with headquarters in Houston, Texas. It has production in
the United States, Argentina and Indonesia with additional exploration
activities in several other regions of the world. Its common stock is traded
on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SFR.
