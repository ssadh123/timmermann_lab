Rochester Tel to Acquire Minnesota Long Distance Company

Rochester, New York -- November 30, 1994 -- Rochester Tel (NYSE: RTC) 
today announced an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares 
of American Sharecom, Inc. (ASI), a long distance company headquartered 
in Minneapolis, Minnesota. ASI is one of the largest privately owned 
long distance companies in the country with annual revenues of 
approximately $125 million. ASI's sales operations are concentrated in 
the Midwest, Northwest and California. Together with Rochester Tel's 
pending acquisition of West Coast Communications (WCT), this 
acquisition firmly establishes the nationwide presence of RCI Long 
Distance, Rochester Tel's long distance subsidiary.

A definitive agreement with the shareholders of ASI has been 
approved by Rochester Tel's Board of Directors subject to some final 
due diligence items and regulatory approvals in the states in which 
American Sharecom does business. Under the agreement, Rochester Tel 
will acquire all of the outstanding shares of ASI in exchange for RTC 
common stock. Rochester Tel will account for the transaction as a 
pooling of interests and expects closing in the first quarter of 1995.

This is Rochester Tel's second long distance acquisition 
announced in the last month. On November 8, the company reached a 
definitive agreement with WCT Communications on terms of its 
acquisition of the California-based long distance company. The 
combination of WCT, American Sharecom and RCI Long Distance will bring 
Rochester Tel's annual long distance revenues to over $550 million and 
make RCI the seventh largest long distance company in the country.

Commenting on the transaction, Ronald L. Bittner, Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer of Rochester Tel, said, "We are creating the 
premier firm in our industry and the addition of American Sharecom 
represents a major step toward that goal. Steve Simon, president of 
ASI and Jim Weinert, vice president, have built one of the finest, 
independent long distance companies in the industry. This merger is 
consistent with our growth strategy of expanding our long distance 
operations nationwide."

As a private company, ASI had reached a critical point in its 
development, according to ASI's Simon. "Given the changing competitive 
structure of our industry, we felt that a wider diversity of products 
and substantially greater financial capacity were important to our 
future success," he said. "In RTC we have found the ideal partner. We 
confidently look forward to continuing Rochester Tel's record of growth 
in revenue and earnings." 

In the joint announcement, Rochester Tel and American Sharecom 
said that Simon will become a vice president of the combined long 
distance operation, with responsibilities for the American Sharecom 
Division. Weinert will remain in charge of American Sharecom's sales 
and marketing organization.

Dale Gregory, president of Rochester Tel's telecommunications 
group, noted that RCI has no long distance sales or operations 
personnel based in the upper Midwest and that Minneapolis will become 
the focal point of this new long distance market. Rochester Tel 
operates a 100,000 access-line telephone company in Minnesota, Vista 
Telephone, and a cellular acquisition in southern Minnesota is pending.

"In long distance, we grew more than 35 percent last year and are 
up another 30 percent this year," said Gregory. "We will need the 
employees of American Sharecom to help us meet the needs of an 
expanding customer base."

Rochester Tel has a special shareowner meeting scheduled for 
December 19 in New York City to approve a pending corporate 
reorganization which includes changing its name to Frontier 
Corporation. These steps will continue, but the proxy issued in advance
of that meeting will be updated as a result of the ASI announcement to 
further describe the transaction, including Rochester Tel's issuance of 
approximately 8.7 million shares of its common stock, 95 percent of 
which will be restricted. 

Founded in 1921, Rochester Tel is one of the largest non-Bell 
telecommunications firms in the United States, with 1993 revenues of 
$906 million. The company is a provider of integrated 
telecommunications solutions to more than 1.5 million customers in the 
Northeast, South and Midwest through its long distance, local telephone 
and wireless communication companies. Its long distance operation 
provides a full range of voice, video and data communications services 
for business and residential customers. RCI has nine switch locations 
and had revenues of $263 million in 1993.

In October of this year, the New York State Public Service 
Commission approved Rochester Tel's corporate restructuring plan, 
authorizing it to form a corporate holding company. Rochester Tel has 
previously announced its plan, subject to shareowner approval, to name 
the holding company Frontier Corporation effective January 1, 1995.
