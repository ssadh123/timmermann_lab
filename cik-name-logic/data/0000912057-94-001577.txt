Dear Sirs:

W. R. GRACE & CO.-CONN., a Connecticut corporation (the "Company"),
confirms its agreement with each of you with respect to the issuance and sale by
the Company of its Medium-Term Notes, Series A (the "Notes"), having an
aggregate issue price of up to $300,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof, if any
of the notes are denominated other than in U.S. dollars). The Notes will be
unconditionally guaranteed (the "Guarantees") as to payment of principal (and
premium, if any) and interest, if any, by W. R. GRACE & CO., a New York
corporation and sole shareholder of the Company (the "Guarantor"). The Notes
and the Guarantees will be issued under an indenture (the "Indenture") dated as
of January 28, 1993 among the Company, the Guarantor and NationsBank of Georgia,
National Association, trustee (the "Trustee"). Unless otherwise specifically
provided for and set forth in a Pricing Supplement (as defined below), Notes
will be issued in minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples
thereof, will be issued only in fully registered form and will have the interest
rates, maturities and other terms set forth

<PAGE>

in such Pricing Supplement. The Notes and the Guarantees will be issued, and
the terms thereof established, in accordance with the Designated Indenture (as
defined below) and the Medium-Term Notes Administrative Procedures attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "Procedures"), unless a Terms Agreement (as defined in
Section 2(b)) modifies or otherwise supersedes the Procedures with respect to
the Notes or the Guarantees issued pursuant to such Terms Agreement. The
Procedures may be amended only by written agreement among the Company, the
Guarantor and you after notice to, and with the approval of, the Trustee. For
the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Agent" shall refer to any of you
acting solely in the capacity as agent for the Company pursuant to Section 2(a),
and not as principal (collectively, the "Agents"); the term "Purchaser" shall
refer to one of you acting solely as principal pursuant to Section 2(b) and not
as agent; and the term "you" shall refer to you collectively, whether at any
time any of you is acting in either or both such capacities. In acting under
this Agreement, in whatever capacity, each of you is acting individually and not
jointly.

1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The Company and the Guarantor,
jointly and severally, represent and warrant to, and agree with, you as set
forth below in this Section 1. Certain terms used in this Section 1 are defined
in Section 1(v) hereof.

(a) The Company and the Guarantor meet the requirements for use of
Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and have filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration
statement on such Form (File Number 33-50983), including a form of basic
prospectus relating to securities that may be issued by the Company, as
well as a form of basic prospectus relating to certain securities that may
be issued by the Guarantor, which registration statement has become
effective, for the registration under the Act of securities (the
"Securities"), including the Notes and the Guarantees, having an aggregate
issue price of $750,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof, if any of the
securities are denominated other than in U.S. dollars). The Company and
the Guarantor have included in such registration statement, or have filed
or will file with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of
Rule 424(b) under the Act, a supplement to the form of basic prospectus
included in such registration statement relating to the Notes and the
Guarantees, and the plan of distribution thereof (the "Prospectus
Supplement"). In connection with the sale of Notes (with the Guarantees
endorsed thereon), the Company and the Guarantor propose to file with the
Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) under the
Act one or more further supplements to the Prospectus Supplement (each a
"Pricing Supplement") specifying the interest rates, maturity dates and
other terms of the Notes and Guarantees sold pursuant hereto and the
offering thereof.

(b) As of the Execution Time, on the Effective Date, when any
supplement to the Prospectus is filed with the Commission, as of the date
of a Terms Agreement and at the

<PAGE>

date of delivery by the Company of any Notes sold hereunder (a "Closing
Date"), (i) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time,
and the Prospectus, as supplemented as of any such time, did or will
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the
respective rules and regulations thereunder; (ii) the Designated
Indenture did or will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture
Act"); (iii) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time,
did not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; and
(iv) the Prospectus, as supplemented as of any such time, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company and the Guarantor make no
representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration
Statement that shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility
(Form T-1) of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act or (ii) the
information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement (or
any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any supplement thereto) in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished or confirmed
in writing to the Company or the Guarantor by any of you specifically for
inclusion in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the
Prospectus (or any supplement thereto).

(c) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, at the
time they were filed with the Commission or as amended, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "Exchange Act
Regulations") and, when read together with the other information in the
Prospectus, do not and will not, on the date hereof and at each Closing
Date, include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading.

(d) Price Waterhouse, who have reported on certain of the financial
statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement, as amended as of any time referred to in Section 1(b) above, are
independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "Act Regulations").

(e) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Company and the Guarantor.

(f) The consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement, as amended as of any time referred
to in Section 1(b) above, present fairly the consolidated

<PAGE>

financial position of the Guarantor and its consolidated subsidiaries as
of the dates indicated, and the consolidated results of operations and
cash flows of the Guarantor and its consolidated subsidiaries for the
periods specified, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the entire period
involved, except as indicated therein. The financial statement
schedules, if any, included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement, as amended as of any time referred to in Section
1(b) above, present fairly the information required to be stated therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. Except as indicated in the Prospectus, as supplemented as of
any time referred to in Section 1(b) above, the selected financial data,
if any, included therein are fairly stated in all material respects in
relation to the consolidated financial statements from which they have
been derived.

(g) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and validly
existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Connecticut, with
full corporate power and authority under such laws to own its properties
and conduct its business. The Company is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation in good standing in all jurisdictions in which
the conduct of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties
requires such qualification, with only such exceptions as would not
materially adversely affect the conduct of the business of the Guarantor
and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

(h) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable; and all of such shares of capital stock of the Company are
owned by the Guarantor free and clear of any liens, claims, equities or
encumbrances in favor of others or restricting the Guarantor's disposition
thereof, except that the terms of various financing arrangements of the
Guarantor and the Company require the Guarantor to hold shares representing
not less than 75% in voting power of all the voting stock of the Company
and that certain financing arrangements effectively limit the disposition
by the Guarantor of shares of capital stock of the Company.

(i) The Guarantor is a corporation duly incorporated and validly
existing in good standing under the laws of the State of New York, with
full corporate power and authority under such laws to own its properties
and conduct its business. The Guarantor is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation in good standing in all jurisdictions in which the
conduct of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties
requires such qualification, with only such exceptions as would not
materially adversely affect the conduct of the business of the Guarantor
and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

<PAGE>

(j) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Guarantor have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable, and none of such shares was issued in violation of the
preemptive rights of any stockholder of the Guarantor.

(k) Each Significant Subsidiary (as defined below) of the Company is
a corporation or partnership duly organized and validly existing in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, with full
corporate or other power and authority under the laws of its jurisdiction
of organization to own its properties and conduct the business in which it
is engaged. Each Significant Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation or partnership in good standing in all
jurisdictions in which the conduct of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties requires such qualification, with only such
exceptions as would not materially adversely affect the conduct of the
business of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries considered as one
enterprise. "Significant Subsidiary" means any corporation (other than the
Company) or partnership that is a subsidiary of the Guarantor and that, as
of December 31 of the most recently completed fiscal year of the Guarantor
for which financial statements are available, was a "significant
subsidiary" as defined in Regulation S-X under the Act and Exchange Act or
that, if acquired after such date, would have been a "significant
subsidiary" as defined therein if it had been acquired as of such date.

(l) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Significant Subsidiary that is a corporation have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and all partnership
interests in each Significant Subsidiary that is a partnership have been
duly authorized. The shares of capital stock and the partnership interests
of each Significant Subsidiary owned directly or indirectly by the
Guarantor are owned free and clear of any liens, claims, equities or
encumbrances in favor of others or restricting the Guarantor's disposition
thereof, which liens, claims, equities or encumbrances are material to the
Guarantor and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, except for
restrictions on the sale of certain shares of such stock or certain of such
partnership interests by the Guarantor and certain of its subsidiaries
pursuant to various financing arrangements, or partnership, joint venture
or other agreements.

(m) The Indenture as executed has been filed as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement. The Indenture, as supplemented by any and all
supplements thereto, if any, to the date hereof and the supplement thereto,
the Board Resolution or the Officers' Certificate (as such terms are
defined in the Indenture) setting forth the terms of the Notes and the
Guarantees (the Indenture, as so supplemented by any such supplements and
by such supplement, Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate, being herein
referred to as the "Designated Indenture"),

<PAGE>

has been duly authorized by the Company and the Guarantor. The Designated
Indenture, when duly executed and delivered (to the extent required by the
Indenture) by the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee, will constitute a
valid and binding obligation of the Company and the Guarantor, enforceable
against the Company and the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except
as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and except as enforcement thereof is subject to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

(n) The Notes have been duly authorized by the Company and, when
executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in the manner provided for in
the Designated Indenture and sold and paid for as provided herein, will
constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the
benefits of the Designated Indenture and enforceable against the Company in
accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except as enforcement
thereof is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(o) The Guarantees have been duly authorized by the Guarantor and,
when the Guarantees and the Notes are executed, authenticated, issued and
delivered in the manner provided for in the Designated Indenture and sold
and paid for as provided herein, the Guarantees will constitute valid and
binding obligations of the Guarantor, entitled to the benefits of the
Designated Indenture and enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance
with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except as enforcement
thereof is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(p) Each of the Designated Indenture, the form of the Notes and the
Guarantees conforms to the descriptions thereof contained in the
Prospectus.

(q) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in
the Registration Statement (as amended as of any time referred to in
Section 1(b) above) and the Prospectus (as supplemented as of any time
referred to in Section 1(b) above), except as otherwise disclosed therein
or contemplated thereby, there has been no material adverse change in the
condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business affairs or business
prospects of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries considered as one
enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business.

<PAGE>

(r) Neither the Company, the Guarantor nor any Significant Subsidiary
is in violation of its certificate of incorporation (in the case of
corporate subsidiaries) or its certificate of limited partnership or its
partnership agreement (in the case of partnership subsidiaries) or in
default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement,
covenant or condition contained in any bond, debenture, note or other
evidence of indebtedness or in the terms of any class of its preferred
stock or in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, lease or
other agreement or instrument to which the Company, the Guarantor or any
Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them or any of their
properties are bound, which violation or default is material to the
Guarantor and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Designated Indenture, the incurrence of
the obligations herein and therein set forth, the consummation of the
transactions herein and therein contemplated and compliance with the terms
and provisions hereof and thereof are within the corporate power of the
Company and the Guarantor and do not and will not result in any violation
of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, the
Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary (or, with respect to any
Significant Subsidiary that is a partnership, its certificate of limited
partnership or partnership agreement) or conflict with or result in a
breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under,
or result in the imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any
property of the Company, the Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary under,
any indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or
instrument to which the Company, the Guarantor or any Significant
Subsidiary is a party or by which they or any of their properties are
bound, or any existing applicable law, rule or regulation, or any judgment,
order or decree of any government, governmental instrumentality or court,
domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company, the Guarantor or
any Significant Subsidiary or any of their properties, or any published
rule, regulation or policy of any United States securities exchange on
which any securities of the Company or the Guarantor are listed.

(s) No authorization, approval, consent or license of any regulatory
body or authority (other than under the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and
the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various states), is legally required
of the Company or the Guarantor for the valid authorization, issuance, sale
and delivery of the Notes or for the execution, delivery or performance of
the Designated Indenture by the Company and the Guarantor.

(t) No action, suit or other proceeding at law or in equity is
pending or threatened to which the Company, the Guarantor or any
Significant Subsidiary is a party, and no proceeding is pending or
threatened against or affecting the Company, the Guarantor or any
Significant Subsidiary before or by any governmental official or
commission, board or other administrative agency, wherein an

<PAGE>

unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would materially adversely affect
the consummation of this Agreement or the condition (financial or
otherwise), earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the
Guarantor and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, except as may
otherwise be disclosed in the Prospectus.

(u) The Guarantor (or the Company or one or more of their
subsidiaries) holds all material licenses, certificates and permits from
governmental authorities necessary for the conduct of the business of the
Guarantor and its subsidiaries (considered as one enterprise) and owns, or
possesses adequate rights to use, all material patents, inventions,
trademarks and other rights necessary for the conduct of such business.

(v) The following terms, when used in this Agreement, shall have the
meanings indicated. The term "Effective Date" shall mean each date that
the Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment or amendments
thereto became or become effective and the latest date after the date
hereof on which a document incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 is filed with the Commission.
"Execution Time" shall mean the date and time that this Agreement is
executed and delivered by the parties hereto. "Basic Prospectus" shall
mean the form of basic prospectus, relating to the Notes and the

"Prospectus" shall mean the Basic Prospectus as supplemented by the
Prospectus Supplement. "Registration Statement" shall mean the
registration statement referred to in paragraph (a) above, including
exhibits and financial statements, as amended at the Execution Time.
"Rule 415" and "Rule 424" refer to such rules under the Act. Any reference
herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus
Supplement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the
documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3
that have been filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act on or
before the effective date of the Registration Statement or the issue date
of the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus, as

the documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus, the
Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus shall only include such documents
filed with the Commission from and including the filing of the last report
on Form 10-K; and any reference herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or
"supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic
Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Prospectus shall be deemed to
refer to and include the filing of any document with the Commission under

2. APPOINTMENT OF AGENTS; SOLICITATION BY THE AGENTS OF OFFERS TO
PURCHASE; SALES OF NOTES TO A PURCHASER. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Company hereby authorizes each of the Agents to
act as its agent to solicit offers to purchase Notes from the Company.

On the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company and
the Guarantor set forth herein, and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, each of the Agents agrees to use its reasonable efforts, as agent
of the Company, to solicit offers to purchase Notes from the Company upon the
terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus (and any supplement thereto)
and in the Procedures. Each Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the
Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser of its offer to purchase
Notes that has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company, but
such Agent shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, be
obligated to disclose the identity of any purchaser or have any liability to the
Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason.
Except as provided in Section 2(b), under no circumstances will any Agent be
obligated to purchase any Notes for its own account. It is understood and
agreed, however, that any Agent may purchase Notes as principal pursuant to
Section 2(b).

The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct
the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the
soliciting of offers to purchase Notes. Upon receipt of instructions from the
Company, the Agents will forthwith suspend soliciting offers to purchase Notes
from the Company until such time as the Company has advised them that such
solicitation may be resumed.

The Company agrees to pay each Agent, on the Closing Date with respect
to each sale of Notes by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such
Agent, a commission (the "Agency Sale Commission") in an amount equal to the
percentage specified in Schedule I hereto of the aggregate issue price of the
Notes offered through such Agent and sold by the Company. Such Agency Sale
Commission shall be payable as specified in the Procedures.

The Company may from time to time offer Notes for sale otherwise than
through an Agent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, so long as this Agreement is in
effect, the Company will not appoint any other agent for the purpose of
soliciting purchases of Notes on a continuous basis. It is understood, however,
that if, from time to time, the Company is approached by a prospective agent
offering a specific purchase of Notes, the Company may engage such agent with
respect to such specific purchase, PROVIDED that (i) such agent is engaged
pursuant to the terms of a Reverse Inquiry Agency Agreement in substantially the
form of Exhibit B hereto and (ii) the Agents are given written notice of such
purchase promptly after it is agreed to.

If, as a result of a default by the Company in its

<PAGE>

obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer therefor it has accepted,
any Agent shall be subject to (i) any litigation or (ii) any investigation or
proceeding by any governmental agency or body, the Company and the Guarantor,
jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and each
person, if any, who controls such Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Act,

(1) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever (x) arising out of such litigation, investigation or proceeding
or (y) to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any such
litigation, investigation or proceeding or of any third-party claim
whatsoever in connection with such default, if such settlement is effected
with the written consent of the Company and the Guarantor, and

(2) against any and all expenses whatsoever (including fees and
disbursements of counsel chosen by the Agent, except to the extent
otherwise expressly provided in Section 8(c)) reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any such litigation,
investigation or proceeding commenced or threatened, or any third-party
claim whatsoever in connection with such default to the extent that any
such expense is not paid under the above paragraph

and any such indemnification of any Agent shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 8(c) hereof. If the indemnity provided for in the preceding sentence is
for any reason held to be unenforceable, each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses to
the extent provided under Section 8(d) hereof.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, whenever
the Company and any of you determine that the Company shall sell Notes directly
to any of you as principal, each such sale of Notes shall be made in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and a supplemental agreement relating to such
sale. Each such supplemental agreement (which may be either an oral or written
agreement) is herein referred to as a "Terms Agreement". Each Terms Agreement
shall describe the Notes to be purchased by the Purchaser pursuant thereto and
shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, the price to be paid
to the Company for such Notes, the maturity date of such Notes, the rate at
which interest will be paid on such Notes, the dates on which interest will be
paid on such Notes and the record date with respect to each such payment of
interest, the Closing Date for the purchase of such Notes, the place of delivery
of such Notes and payment therefor, the method of payment and any requirements
for the delivery of opinions of counsel, certificates from the Company and the
Guarantor or their respective officers or a letter from the Guarantor's
independent public accountants as described in Section 6(b). Any such Terms
Agreement may also specify the period of time referred to in Section 4(q). Any
written Terms Agreement may be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C. The
Purchaser's commitment to purchase Notes shall be deemed to have been made on
the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor
herein contained and shall be subject to the terms

<PAGE>

and conditions hereof.

Delivery of the certificates for Notes (with the Guarantees endorsed
thereon) sold pursuant to a Terms Agreement shall be made not later than the
Closing Date agreed to in such Terms Agreement, against payment of funds to the
Company in the net amount due to the Company for such Notes by the method and in
the form set forth in the Procedures, unless otherwise agreed to among the
Company, the Guarantor and the Purchaser in such Terms Agreement.

Unless otherwise agreed to among the Company, the Guarantor and the
Purchaser in a Terms Agreement, any Note sold to a Purchaser (i) shall be
purchased by such Purchaser at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof less a percentage equal to the Agency Sale Commission applicable to a
Note of identical maturity and (ii) may be resold by such Purchaser at varying
prices from time to time or, if set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement and
Pricing Supplement, at a fixed public offering price. In connection with any
resale of Notes purchased by a Purchaser, such Purchaser may use a selling or
dealer group and may reallow to any broker or dealer any portion of the discount
or commission payable pursuant hereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Purchaser
shall notify the Company in advance of the identity of the members of the
selling or dealer group that the Purchaser proposes to use and the Purchaser
shall not use any such proposed member as to which the Company shall object.

3. OFFERING AND SALE OF NOTES. Each Agent and each of the Company
and the Guarantor agree to perform the respective duties and obligations
specifically provided to be performed by them in the Procedures.

4. AGREEMENTS. Each of the Company and the Guarantor agrees with you
that:

(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of Notes (and, in the
event that an Agent has purchased Notes as principal, for a period equal to
the lesser of (i) nine months following the date of issuance of such Notes
and (ii) the resale by such Agent of all Notes purchased by it), neither
the Company nor the Guarantor will file any amendment of the Registration
Statement or supplement to the Prospectus (except for (i) periodic or
current reports filed under the Exchange Act, (ii) a supplement relating to
any offering of Notes and Guarantees providing solely for the specification
of or a change in the maturity dates, interest rates, issue prices or
other similar terms of any Notes or (iii) a supplement relating to an
offering of Securities other than the Notes or the Guarantees) unless the
Company and the Guarantor have furnished each of you a copy for your review
prior to filing and given each of you a reasonable opportunity to comment
on any such proposed amendment or supplement. Subject to the foregoing
sentence, the Company and the Guarantor will cause each supplement to the
Prospectus to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable
paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide
evidence of such filing satisfactory to you and will promptly advise each
of you (i) when the Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been
filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (ii) when, prior to
termination of any offering of Notes, any amendment of the Registration
Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iii) of any request
by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or
supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the
issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement as amended, or the institution or threatening
of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company or
the Guarantor of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of the Notes or Guarantees for sale in any jurisdiction or
the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The
Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts to prevent the
issuance of any such stop order or of any order suspending such
qualification and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the lifting
thereof as soon as possible.

(b) If, at any time when a prospectus is required by the Act to be
delivered in connection with any offering of Notes, any event shall occur
as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the
Agents or counsel for the Company and the Guarantor, to amend the

<PAGE>

Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus in order that the
Prospectus as supplemented will not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances
existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be
necessary, in the opinion of either such counsel, to amend the
Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply
with the requirements of the Act or the Act Regulations, the Company
and the Guarantor promptly will (i) notify each of you to suspend
soliciting offers to purchase Notes (and, if so notified by the Company and
the Guarantor, each of you shall forthwith suspend such solicitation and
cease using the Prospectus as then supplemented), (ii) prepare and file
with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of Section 4(a), an
amendment or supplement that will correct such statement or omission or
effect such compliance and (iii) supply any supplemented Prospectus to each
of you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. If such amendment
or supplement, and any documents, certificates and opinions furnished to
each of you pursuant to Section 4(k) hereof in connection with the
preparation or filing of such amendment or supplement, are satisfactory in
all respects to each of you, you will, upon the filing of such amendment or
supplement with the Commission and, if applicable, upon the effectiveness
of an amendment to the Registration Statement, resume your obligation to
solicit offers to purchase Notes hereunder.

(c) During the period when a prospectus is required by the Act to be
delivered in connection with any offering of Notes, the Company and the
Guarantor will file promptly all documents required to be filed with the
Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act and will promptly furnish to each of you copies of such documents.

(d) Promptly after there shall be released to the general public
quarterly financial statement information, restated quarterly financial
statement information, interim financial statement information with respect
to any unanticipated charge or gain or, upon the reasonable request of the
Agents, any other interim financial statement information related to the
Guarantor with respect to each of the first three quarters of any fiscal
year or preliminary financial statement information with respect to any
fiscal year, the Guarantor shall file with the Commission a Form 8-K under
the Exchange Act that includes (or the Company and the Guarantor shall
otherwise cause the Registration Statement to be amended and the Prospectus
to be supplemented to include or incorporate by reference) a summary of
such financial statement information with respect thereto and, if and to
the extent relevant, corresponding information for the comparable period of
the preceding fiscal year, and will furnish to each of you copies of such
documents.

<PAGE>

(e) Promptly after audited financial statements of the Guarantor for
any fiscal year are available, the Company and Guarantor will, upon the
reasonable request of the Agents, cause the Registration Statement to be
amended and the Prospectus to be supplemented, whether by the filing of
documents pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Act or otherwise, to include or
incorporate by reference such audited financial statements and the report
or reports, and consent or consents to such inclusion or incorporation by
reference, of the independent accountants with respect thereto and will
furnish to each of you copies of such documents.

(f) On, prior to or promptly following the date on which the Company
or the Guarantor makes any announcement to the general public concerning
earnings or concerning any other event that is required to be described, or
that the Company or the Guarantor proposes to describe, in a document filed
pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may
be, will furnish to each of you the information contained or to be
contained in such announcement.

(g) The Company and the Guarantor also will promptly furnish to each
of you copies of all press releases or announcements issued by the Company
or the Guarantor for dissemination on the Dow Jones Broad Tape. The
Company or the Guarantor will immediately notify each of you of (i) any
decrease in the rating of the Notes or any other debt securities of the
Company or the Guarantor by any "nationally recognized statistical rating
organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or
(ii) any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such
rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate
the direction of the possible change, as soon as the Company or the
Guarantor learns of any such decrease or notice.

(h) As soon as practicable, the Guarantor will make generally
available to its security holders an earnings statement or statements of
the Guarantor and its subsidiaries that will satisfy the provisions of
Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.

(i) The Company will furnish to each of you and your counsel, without
charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto)
and any amendment thereto and, so long as delivery of a prospectus may be
required by the Act, as many copies of the Prospectus and any supplement
thereto as you may reasonably request.

(j) The Company and the Guarantor will arrange for the qualification
of the Notes and the Guarantees for sale under the laws of such
jurisdictions as any of you may designate, will maintain such
qualifications in effect for so long as may be required for the
distribution of the Notes and the Guarantees, and will arrange for the
determination of the legality of the Notes and the Guarantees for purchase
by institutional investors; PROVIDED that neither the Company nor the
Guarantor shall

<PAGE>

be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to
qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any
jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to
taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is
not otherwise so subject.

(k) The Company and the Guarantor shall furnish to each of you such
information, documents, certificates of officers of the Company or the
Guarantor and opinions of counsel for the Company and the Guarantor
relating to the business, operations and affairs of the Guarantor, the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, and any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, the Designated Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees,
this Agreement, the Procedures and the performance by each of the Company,
the Guarantor and you of its and your respective obligations hereunder and
thereunder as any of you may reasonably request from time to time and at
any time prior to the termination of this Agreement.

(l) The Company and the Guarantor shall, jointly and severally,
whether or not any sale of the Notes is consummated, (i) pay all expenses
incident to the performance of their obligations under this Agreement and
any Terms Agreement, including the fees and disbursements of their
accountants and counsel, the cost of printing or other production and
delivery of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, all amendments
thereof and supplements thereto, the Designated Indenture, this Agreement,
any Terms Agreement and all other documents relating to the offering, the
cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Notes (with the
Guarantees endorsed thereon), the fees and disbursements, including fees of
counsel, incurred in compliance with Section 4(j) hereof, the fees and
disbursements of the Trustee, including fees and disbursements of
counsel, and the fees of any agency that rates the Notes, (ii) reimburse
each of you as requested for all out-of-pocket expenses (including
without limitation advertising expenses), if any, incurred by you in
connection with this Agreement and (iii) pay the fees and expenses of
your counsel incurred in connection with this Agreement.

(m) Each acceptance by the Company and the Guarantor of an offer to
purchase Notes will be deemed to be an affirmation that their respective
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are true and
correct at the time of such acceptance as though made at and as of such
time, and will be true and correct at the settlement date for the sale of
the Notes relating to such acceptance, as though made at and as of such
time (it being understood that for purposes of the foregoing affirmation
such representations and warranties shall relate to the Registration
Statement and Prospectus as amended or supplemented at each such time).
Each such acceptance by the Company and the Guarantor of an offer for the
purchase of Notes will be deemed to constitute an additional
representation, warranty and agreement by the Company and the Guarantor
that, as of the settlement date

<PAGE>

for the sale of such Notes, after giving effect to the issuance of such
Notes and Guarantees, of any other Notes and Guarantees to be issued on or
prior to such settlement date and of any other Securities to be issued and
sold by the Company or the Guarantor on or prior to such settlement date,
the aggregate issue price of Securities (including any Notes and
Guarantees) which have been issued and sold by the Company or the Guarantor
will not exceed the amount of Securities registered pursuant to the
Registration Statement. The Company and the Guarantor will inform you
promptly upon your request of the aggregate issue price of Securities
registered under the Registration Statement that remain unsold.

(n) Each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is
amended or supplemented (except for (i) a supplement relating to any
offering of Notes and Guarantees providing solely for the specification
of a change in the maturity dates, interest rates, issue prices or other
similar terms of any Notes or (ii) a supplement relating to an offering
of Securities other than the Notes or the Guarantees), the Company and
the Guarantor will deliver or cause to be delivered promptly to each of
you a certificate of the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, signed
by the President or any Vice President, and the Chief Financial Officer
or the Treasurer of each of the Company and the Guarantor, dated the date
of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of the filing of such
supplement, in form reasonably satisfactory to you, of the same tenor as
the certificate referred to in Section 5(d) but modified to relate to the
last day of the fiscal quarter for which financial statements of the
Guarantor were last filed with the Commission and to the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of
the effectiveness of such amendment or the filing of such supplement.

(o) Each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended
or supplemented (except for (i) quarterly reports filed under the Exchange
Act, (ii) a supplement relating to any offering of Notes and Guarantees
providing solely for the specification of or a change in the maturity
dates, interest rates, issue prices or other similar terms of any Notes or
(iii) a supplement relating to an offering of Securities other than the
Notes or the Guarantees unless, in the case of clause (i) above, in the
reasonable judgment of any of you, such financial statements or other
information is of such a nature that an opinion of counsel should be
furnished), the Company and the Guarantor shall furnish or cause to be
furnished promptly to each of you a written opinion of counsel of the
Company and the Guarantor satisfactory to each of you, dated the date of
the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of the filing of such
supplement, in form satisfactory to each of you, of the same tenor as the
opinion referred to in Section 5(b) but modified to relate to the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to
the time of the effectiveness of such amendment or the filing of such
supplement or, in lieu of such opinion, counsel last furnishing such an

<PAGE>

opinion to you may furnish each of you with a letter to the effect that you
may rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it were dated
the date of such letter authorizing reliance (except that statements in
such last opinion will be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement
and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to the time of the
effectiveness of such amendment or the filing of such supplement).

(p) Each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is
amended or supplemented to include or incorporate amended or supplemental
financial information, the Guarantor shall cause its independent
public accountants to promptly furnish each of you a letter, dated the date
of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of the filing of such
supplement, in form satisfactory to each of you, of the same tenor as the
letter referred to in Section 5(e), with such changes as may be necessary
to reflect the amended and supplemental financial information included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus,
as amended or supplemented to the date of such letter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that, if the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or
supplemented solely to include or incorporate by reference financial
information as of and for a fiscal quarter, the Guarantor's independent
public accountants may limit the scope of such letter, which shall be
satisfactory in form to each of you, to the unaudited financial statements,
the related "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations" and any other information of an accounting,
financial or statistical nature included in such amendment or supplement,
unless, in the reasonable judgment of any of you, such letter should cover
other information or changes in specified financial statement line items.

(q) During the period, if any, specified (whether orally or in
writing) in any Terms Agreement, neither the Company nor the Guarantor
will, directly or indirectly, without the prior consent of the Purchaser
thereunder, offer, sell or enter into any agreement to sell, in a public
offering, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or the
Guarantor with a maturity of more than one year and terms substantially
similar to those of the Notes being purchased pursuant to such Terms
Agreement (other than the Notes and the Guarantees being sold pursuant to
such Terms Agreement). This limitation is not applicable to the public
offering of tax exempt debt securities guaranteed by the Company or the
Guarantor or to such other public offering of debt securities as may be
specified in the Terms Agreement.

(r) The Company and the Guarantor confirm as of the date hereof, and
each acceptance by the Company and the Guarantor of an offer to purchase
Notes will be deemed to be an affirmation, that the Company and the
Guarantor have complied with all the provisions of Florida H.B. 1771,
codified as Section 517.075 of the Florida Statutes, and

<PAGE>

all regulations promulgated thereunder relating to issuers doing business
in Cuba, and will comply with such provisions and regulations during the
period when a Prospectus is required by the Act to be delivered in
connection with offering of Notes (including in connection with resales by
a Purchaser of the Notes).

(s) From the time (i) each of the Agents shall have suspended
soliciting purchases of Notes in its capacity as agent pursuant to an
instruction from the Company provided pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof and
(ii) either all of the Agents that have purchased Notes as principal
pursuant to a Terms Agreement have resold such Notes or nine months from
the date of issuance of such Notes, to the time that the Company (x)
advises the Agents that they may resume soliciting offers to purchase Notes
as provided pursuant to Section 2(a) or (y) subsequently enters into a new
Terms Agreement with an Agent, the Company shall not be required to comply
with the provisions of subsections (b), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of this
Section 4.

5. CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE AGENTS. The obligations of
each Agent to solicit offers to purchase the Notes shall be subject to the
accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company and
the Guarantor contained herein as of the Execution Time, on the Effective Date,
when any supplement to the Prospectus is filed with the Commission and as of
each Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company and the
Guarantor made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the
performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their respective obligations
hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

(a) If filing of the Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, is
required pursuant to Rule 424(b), the Prospectus, and any such supplement,
shall have been filed in the manner and within the time period required by
Rule 424(b); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement as amended as of any such date shall have been
issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or
threatened.

(b) The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to each Agent
the opinion of the General Counsel of the Company and the Guarantor, dated
the Execution Time, to the effect that:

<PAGE>

(i) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated and validly
existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Connecticut,
with full corporate power and authority under such laws to own its
properties and conduct its business.

(ii) The Guarantor is a corporation duly incorporated and validly
existing in good standing under the laws of the State of New York,
with full corporate power and authority under such laws to own its
properties and conduct its business.

(iii) Each of the Company and the Guarantor is duly qualified to
do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all
jurisdictions in which the conduct of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties requires such qualification, with only such
exceptions as would not materially adversely affect the conduct of the
business of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries considered as one
enterprise.

(iv) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid and nonassessable. All of such shares of capital stock of the
Company are owned by the Guarantor free and clear of any liens,
claims, equities or encumbrances in favor of others or restricting the
Guarantor's disposition thereof, except that the terms of various
financing arrangements of the Guarantor and the Company require the
Guarantor to hold shares representing not less than 75% in voting
power of all the voting stock of the Company and that certain
financing arrangements effectively limit the disposition by the
Guarantor of shares of capital stock of the Company.

(v) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Guarantor have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable, and none of such shares was issued in
violation of the preemptive rights of any stockholder of the
Guarantor.

(vi) Except as disclosed in the Prospectus, each Significant
Subsidiary is a corporation or partnership duly organized and validly
existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has full corporate or other power and authority to
own its properties and conduct the business in which it is engaged.
All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Significant Subsidiary that is a corporation have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and all the
partnership interests in each Significant Subsidiary that is a
partnership have been duly authorized. To the best of such counsel's
knowledge, the shares of capital stock and the partnership interests
of each

<PAGE>

Significant Subsidiary owned directly or indirectly by the Guarantor
are owned free and clear of any liens, claims, equities or
encumbrances in favor of others or restricting the Guarantor's
disposition thereof, which liens, claims, equities or encumbrances are
material to the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, considered as one
enterprise, except for restrictions on the sale of certain shares of
such stock or certain of such partnership interests by the Guarantor
and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to various financing
arrangements, or partnership, joint venture or other agreements.

(vii) The Designated Indenture has been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by the Company and the Guarantor and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the Company and the Guarantor,
enforceable against the Company and the Guarantor in accordance with
its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting enforcement
of creditors' rights generally and except as enforcement thereof is
subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(viii) The Notes have been duly authorized by the Company and, when
duly executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of
the Designated Indenture and delivered and paid for as contemplated
herein, such Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of
the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Designated Indenture and
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except
as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws affecting enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and except as enforcement thereof is
subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(ix) The Guarantees have been duly authorized by the Guarantor
and, assuming that the Notes have been duly executed and authenticated
in accordance with the provisions of the Designated Indenture, the
Guarantees will have been duly endorsed on the Notes and will
constitute valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor, entitled to
the benefits of the Designated Indenture and enforceable against the
Guarantor in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
other similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and except as enforcement thereof is subject to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered
in a proceeding

<PAGE>

in equity or at law).

(x) Each of the Designated Indenture and the form of the Notes
and the Guarantees conforms in all material respects as to legal
matters to the descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus.

(xi) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company and the Guarantor.

(xii) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act.

(xiii) No authorization, approval, consent or license of any
regulatory body or authority (other than under the Act, the Trust
Indenture Act and the securities or Blue Sky laws of the various
states), is presently legally required of the Company or the Guarantor
for the valid authorization, issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes
and the Guarantees as provided in the Prospectus, or for the
execution, delivery or performance of the Designated Indenture by the
Company and the Guarantor or, if so required, all such authorizations,
approvals, consents and licenses, specifying the same, have been
obtained and are in full force and effect.

(xiv) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no
contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, leases or other
documents of a character required to be described or referred to in
the Registration Statement or Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to
the Registration Statement, other than those so described, referred to
or filed. The existing contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan
agreements, leases and other documents so described, referred to or
filed are correctly described as referred to therein, and no default
exists in the due performance or observance of any obligation,
agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract or lease so
described, referred to or filed, which default is material to the
Guarantor and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise.

(xv) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no legal
or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the
Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is or may be a party, or of which
any of their properties are or may be the subject, that are required
to be disclosed in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, other
than those disclosed therein.

(xvi) The descriptions in the Prospectus of such of the statutes,
regulations, legal or governmental proceedings, contracts and other
documents as have been included therein are accurate in all material
respects and set forth the information required to be shown in the
context presented.

<PAGE>

(xvii) The issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Guarantees,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Designated
Indenture, the consummation of the transactions herein and therein
contemplated, and compliance with the terms hereof and thereof are
within the corporate power of the Company and the Guarantor, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and do not and will
not (A) result in any violation of the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws of the Company, the Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary
(or, with respect to any Significant Subsidiary that is a partnership,
its certificate of limited partnership or partnership agreement) or
(B) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or
provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the
imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property of the
Company, the Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary under (1) any
indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or
instrument known to such counsel to which the Company, the Guarantor
or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which they or any of
their properties are bound, or (2) any existing applicable law, rule
or regulation (other than the securities or Blue Sky laws of the
various states, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), or
(3) any judgment, order or decree known to such counsel of any
government, governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or
foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company, the Guarantor or any
Significant Subsidiary or any of their properties, or (4) any
published rule, regulation or policy of any United States securities
exchange on which any securities of the Company or the Guarantor are
listed.

(xviii) The Registration Statement has become effective under the
Act and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in
effect and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are
pending or are threatened under the Act.

(xix) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and each
amendment or supplement thereto (except for the documents incorporated
by reference therein and except for the financial statements and other
financial or statistical data included or incorporated by reference
therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no
opinion), as of their respective effective or issue dates, appear on
their face to have been appropriately responsive in all material
respects to the requirements of the Act and the Act Regulations. The
Designated Indenture and the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee
on Form T-1 filed with the Commission as part of the Registration
Statement appear on their face to have been appropriately responsive
in all material respects to the

<PAGE>

requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

(xx) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus
(except for the financial statements and other financial or
statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein or
omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion,
and except to the extent that any statement in any such document is
modified or superseded in a subsequently filed document or in the
Prospectus), as of the dates they were filed with the Commission,
appear on their face to have been appropriately responsive in all
material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Exchange Act Regulations.

(xxi) Such counsel has participated in the preparation of the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the documents incorporated
by reference therein, and no facts have come to his attention to lead
him to believe (A) that the Registration Statement (except for the
financial statements and other financial or statistical data included
or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which
such counsel need express no opinion), at the Effective Date or at the
Execution Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (B) that
the Prospectus (except for the financial statements and other
financial or statistical data included or incorporated by reference
therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express
no opinion), at the time the Prospectus was issued or at the
Execution Time, included or includes an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Such opinion shall be to such further effect with respect to other legal
matters relating to this Agreement and the offering of the Securities as
counsel for the Agents may reasonably request. In giving such opinion,
such counsel may rely, as to all matters governed by laws other than the
law of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States, upon
opinions of other counsel, who shall be counsel satisfactory to counsel for
the Agents, in which case the foregoing opinion shall state the belief that
you and such counsel are entitled to so rely. Such counsel may also state
that he expresses no opinion on fraudulent conveyances and that, insofar as
such opinion involves factual matters, he has relied, to the extent he
deems proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company or the
Guarantor, or both, and their subsidiaries and certificates of public
officials (together with any supplement thereto). References to the
Registration

<PAGE>

Statement and the Prospectus in this paragraph (b) include any amendments
or supplements thereto at the date such opinion is rendered.

(c) Each Agent shall have received from Shearman & Sterling, counsel
for the Agents, such opinion or opinions, dated the Execution Time, with
respect to the issuance and sale of the Notes and the Guarantees, the
Designated Indenture, the Registration Statement (together with any
amendment thereto), the Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto)
and other related matters as the Agents may reasonably require, and the
Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to such counsel such
documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon
such matters. In giving such opinion such counsel may rely, as to all
matters governed by laws other than the law of the State of New York and
the federal law of the United States, upon the opinions of counsel
satisfactory to you. Such counsel may also state that they express no
opinion on fraudulent conveyances and that, insofar as such opinion
involves factual matters, they have relied, to the extent they deem proper,
upon certificates of officers of the Company or the Guarantor, or both, and
its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials.

(d) Each of the Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to
each Agent a certificate, signed by the President or any Vice President,
and the Chief Financial Officer or the Treasurer of each of the Company and
the Guarantor, dated the Execution Time, to the effect that the signers of
such certificates have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, any supplement to the Prospectus and this Agreement and that:

(i) the representations and warranties of the Company and the
Guarantor in this Agreement are true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the date hereof with the same effect as if made
on the date hereof and each of the Company and the Guarantor has

updated, (i) a certificate of the Company and the Guarantor, dated as of

<PAGE>

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have

and the applicable Terms Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates

required to be delivered to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms hereof and

7. RIGHT OF PERSON WHO AGREED TO PURCHASE TO REFUSE TO PURCHASE.
(a) The Company and the Guarantor agree that any person who has agreed to
purchase and pay for any Note pursuant to a solicitation by any of the Agents
shall have the right to refuse to purchase such Note if, at the Closing Date
therefor, any condition set forth in Section 5 or 6, as applicable, shall not be
satisfied.

(b) The Company and the Guarantor agree that any person who has
agreed to purchase and pay for any Note pursuant to a solicitation by any of the
Agents shall have the right to refuse to purchase such Note if, subsequent to
the agreement to purchase such Note, any change, condition or development
specified in any of Sections 9(b)(i) through (v) shall have occurred (with the
judgment of the Agent that presented the offer to purchase such Note being
substituted for any judgment of a Purchaser required therein) the effect of
which is, in the judgment of the Agent that presented the offer to purchase such
Note, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to
proceed with the sale and delivery of such Note (it being understood that under
no circumstance shall any such Agent have any duty or obligation to the Company
or the Guarantor or to any such person to exercise the judgment permitted to be
exercised under Section 7(b) and Section 9(b)).

8. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. (a)
The Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and
hold harmless each Agent and each person, if any, who controls any Agent within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Act as follows:

(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever arising out of or based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement
(or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom
of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or arising out of or based

<PAGE>

upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
included in any preliminary prospectus supplement or the Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission
therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading;

(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any
litigation, or of any investigation or proceeding by any governmental
agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based
upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the written
consent of the Company and the Guarantor; and

(iii) against any and all expenses whatsoever (including fees and
disbursements of counsel chosen by you, except to the extent otherwise
expressly provided in Section 8(c)), reasonably incurred in investigating,
preparing or defending against any litigation, any investigation or
proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or
any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or
any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such
expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above;

PROVIDED that this indemnity does not apply to any loss, liability, claim,
damage or expense to the extent arising out of an untrue statement or omission
or alleged untrue statement or omission (A) made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished or confirmed in writing to the Company or
the Guarantor by any of you specifically for inclusion in the Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any supplement
thereto) or (B) made in that part of the Registration Statement constituting the
Statement of Eligibility under the Trust Indenture Act (Form T-1) of the
Trustee.

Insofar as this indemnity agreement may permit indemnification for
liabilities under the Act of any person who is a partner of an Agent or who
controls an Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act and who, at the
date of this Agreement, is a director, officer or controlling person of the
Company or the Guarantor, such indemnity agreement is subject to the
undertakings of the Company and the Guarantor in the Registration Statement
under Item 17 thereof.

(b) Each of you severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and the Guarantor, their directors, each of their officers who signed
the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or
the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any and all
loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained
in Section 8(a), as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or
omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, relating

<PAGE>

to each of you made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or
any preliminary prospectus supplement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished or confirmed in writing to the Company or the Guarantor by each of you
specifically for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or
any preliminary prospectus supplement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto).

(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each
indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying
party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than
on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate
at its own expense in the defense of such action. If it so elects within a
reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly
with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the
defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified
parties defendant in such action, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, PROVIDED that, if such indemnified party or parties reasonably
determine that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different
from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party or parties,
then such indemnifying party or parties shall not be entitled to assume such
defense. If the indemnifying party or parties are not entitled to assume the
defense of such action as a result of the proviso to the preceding sentence,
counsel for the indemnifying party or parties shall be entitled to conduct the
defense of such indemnifying party or parties and counsel for the indemnified
party or parties shall be entitled to conduct the defense of such indemnified
party or parties, it being understood that both such counsel will cooperate with
each other to conduct the defense of such action as efficiently as possible. If
an indemnifying party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying
parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the
indemnified parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action. In no
event shall the indemnifying party or parties be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with
any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same
jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No
indemnifying party shall be liable under this Section 8 for any settlement of
any claim or action effected without its consent.

(d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances under which the indemnity provided for in Section 8(a) and 8(b) is
for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although
applicable in accordance with its terms, each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of
the nature contemplated by such indemnity incurred by the Company, the Guarantor
or one or more of the Agents in such proportions that (a) each of the Agents is
responsible for that portion of such losses represented by the percentage that
the total commissions received by such Agent with respect to the offering of the

<PAGE>

Notes to the date of such liability bears to the total sale price from the sale
of the Notes sold to or through the Agents to the date of such liability and (b)
the Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, are responsible for the
balance; PROVIDED that (i) in no case shall any Agent be responsible for any
amount in excess of the commissions received by such Agent in connection with
the sale of Notes and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who
controls an Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act shall have the
same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each director of the Company or
the Guarantor, each officer of the Company or the Guarantor who signed the
Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the
Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act shall have the same rights
to contribution as the Company and the Guarantor.

9. TERMINATION. (a) This Agreement will continue in effect until
terminated as provided in this Section 9. This Agreement may be terminated by
the Company and the Guarantor as to any Agent or by any Agent insofar as this
Agreement relates to such Agent, by giving written notice of such termination to
such Agent or to the Company and the Guarantor, as the case may be. This
Agreement shall so terminate at the close of business on the first business day
following the receipt of such notice by the party to whom such notice is given.
In the event of such termination, no party shall have any liability to the other
party hereto, except as provided in the fourth paragraph of Section 2(a),
Section 4(l), Section 8 and Section 10.

(b) Each Terms Agreement shall be subject to termination, in the
absolute discretion of the Purchaser, by notice given to the Company and the
Guarantor prior to payment for any Note to be purchased thereunder, if at or
prior to such time (i) there has been, subsequent to the acceptance by the
Company of the Purchaser's offer to purchase such Note, except as otherwise
disclosed in the Registration Statement and Prospectus (exclusive of any
supplement or amendment thereto filed after the date of the related Terms
Agreement), any material adverse change in the condition (financial or
otherwise), earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and
its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, (ii) there shall have been,
subsequent to the agreement to purchase such Note, any decrease in the rating of
any debt securities of the Company or the Guarantor by any "nationally
recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of
Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential
decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does
not indicate the direction of the possible change, (iii) trading in the
Guarantor's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New
York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock
Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been
established on such Exchange, (iv) a banking moratorium shall have been declared
by either Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred
any

<PAGE>

outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a
national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on
financial markets is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Purchaser,
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of such
Notes as contemplated by the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).

10. SURVIVAL OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS. The respective agreements,
representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company and
the Guarantor or their respective officers and of you set forth in or made
pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of you, the Company or the Guarantor or
any of the directors, officers, employees, agents or controlling persons
referred to in Section 8, and will survive delivery of and payment for the
Notes. The provisions of Sections 4(l) and 8 shall survive the termination or
cancelation of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement (including
without limitation Section 7) applicable to any purchase of a Note for which an
agreement to purchase exists prior to the termination hereof shall survive any
termination of this Agreement. If at the time of termination of this Agreement
any Purchaser shall own any Notes with the intention of selling them, the
provisions of Section 4 shall remain in effect until such Notes are sold by the
Purchaser.

11. NOTICES. All communications hereunder will be in writing and
effective only on receipt, and, if sent to any of you, will be mailed, delivered
or telecopied and confirmed to such of you, at the address specified in Schedule
I hereto; or, if sent to the Company or the Guarantor, or both, will be mailed,
delivered or telecopied and confirmed to it at One Town Center Road, Boca Raton,
Florida 33486-1010, attention of the Treasurer (with a copy to the Secretary).

12. SUCCESSORS. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the parties hereto, their respective successors, the directors,
officers, employees, agents and controlling persons referred to in Section 8
and, to the extent provided in Section 7, any person who has agreed to purchase
Notes, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.

13. APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement will be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts
made and performed in such State.

If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding of our
agreement, please sign and return to us the enclosed duplicate hereof, whereupon
this letter and your acceptance shall represent a binding agreement among the
Company, the Guarantor and you.

Very truly yours,

EXHIBIT A

W. R. GRACE & CO.-CONN.

Medium-Term Note Administrative Procedures
Dated as of April 7 , 1994
----------------------------------------------------------------

Medium-Term Notes, Series A with an aggregate issue price of up to
$300,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof, if any of the Notes are denominated
other than in U.S. dollars) (the "Notes") of W. R. Grace & Co.-Conn. (the
"Company") are to be offered on a continuous basis. Salomon Brothers Inc, J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities Inc., as agents (each an "Agent"),
have agreed to solicit offers to purchase Notes. The Notes are to be guaranteed
by W. R. Grace & Co. (the "Guarantor"). The Notes and the related guarantees
(the "Guarantees") are being sold pursuant to a Selling Agency Agreement, dated
the date hereof, among the Company, the Guarantor and the Agents (the "Agency
Agreement"). The Notes will rank equally with all other unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company; and the
Guarantees will rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness for borrowed money of the Guarantor. Both the Notes and the
Guarantees have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission"). The Notes and Guarantees will be issued under an Indenture dated
as of January 28, 1993 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor and
NationsBank of Georgia, National Association, Trustee (the "Trustee").

The Agency Agreement provides that Notes may also be purchased by an
Agent acting solely as principal and not as agent. In the event of any such
purchase, the functions of both the Agent and the beneficial owner under the
administrative procedures set forth below shall be performed by such Agent
acting solely as principal, unless otherwise agreed by the Company and such
Agent acting as principal.

Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Indenture and
the Prospectus (as defined in the Agency Agreement) shall be used herein as
therein defined. To the extent the procedures set forth below conflict with the
provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Letter of Representations (as
defined below), DTC's operating requirements or the Agency Agreement, the
relevant provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the Letter of Representations,
DTC's operating requirements and the Agency Agreement shall control.

Each Note (with a Guarantee endorsed thereon) will be represented
either by (i) a Global Note registered in the name of The Depository Trust
Company ("DTC") or another depository (each Note represented by a Global Note, a
"Book-Entry Note") or (ii) a Note issued in certificated form (a "Certificated
Note"). Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, each
Note will be represented by a Global Note and the

<PAGE>

2

depository will be DTC. Beneficial interests in Book-Entry Notes may be
exchanged for Notes in certificated form only in the limited circumstances set
forth in the Prospectus.

The following description explains (or provides a cross reference to
explanations of) procedures to be followed for the solicitation of offers to
purchase Notes and the sale of Notes by the Company as a result thereof.
Book-Entry Notes will be issued in accordance with the administrative procedures
set forth in Part I hereof, as adjusted to comply with any changes in DTC's
operating requirements, and Certificated Notes will be issued in accordance with
the administrative procedures set forth in Part II hereof. Administrative and
record-keeping responsibilities will be handled for the Company by the staff of
its Treasurer. The Company will advise the Agents and the Trustee in writing of
those persons handling administrative responsibilities with whom the Agents and
the Trustee are to communicate regarding offers to purchase Notes and the
details of their delivery.

PART I

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES FOR BOOK-ENTRY NOTES

In connection with qualification of the Book-Entry Notes for
eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, the Trustee will perform
the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in
accordance with its obligations under a Letter of Representations from the
Company and the Trustee to DTC dated as of the date hereof (the "Letter of
Representations") and a Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between the
Trustee and DTC and its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's
Same-Day Funds Settlement system ("SDFS").

DESCRIPTION OF BOOK-ENTRY NOTES. Each Book-Entry Note will mature on
a date more than nine months after the Issue Date for such Note.

The authorized denominations of Book-Entry Notes denominated in U.S.
dollars will be $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. Global Notes will be
denominated in principal amounts not in excess of $150,000,000. If one or more
Book-Entry Notes having an aggregate principal amount in excess of $150,000,000
would, but for the preceding sentence, be represented by a single Global Note,
then one Global Note will be authenticated and issued to represent $150,000,000
principal amount of such Book-Entry Note or Notes and an additional Global Note
will be authenticated and issued to represent any remaining principal amount of
such Book-Entry Note or Notes. In such a case, each of the Global Notes
representing such Book-Entry Note or Notes shall be assigned the same CUSIP
number.

<PAGE>

3

ISSUANCE. On any date of settlement (as defined under "Settlement"
below) for one or more Book-Entry Notes, the Company will issue one or more
Global Notes in fully registered form without coupons in accordance with Section
3 of the Letter of Representations.

CUSIP NUMBERS. The Company will comply with (and the Company will
make arrangements with the CUSIP Service Bureau of Standard & Poor's Corporation
(the "CUSIP Service Bureau") for the reservation of a series of CUSIP numbers in
accordance with) their respective obligations under Section 2 of the Letter of
Representations. The Company and/or the Trustee will assign CUSIP numbers to
Global Notes and will, on the day on which an offer to purchase one or more
Book-Entry Notes is accepted by the Company, notify the Agents by telephone of
the CUSIP number assigned to the related Global Note. DTC will notify the CUSIP
Service Bureau periodically of the CUSIP numbers that the Company has assigned
to Global Notes. The Trustee will notify the Company at any time when fewer
than 100 of the reserved CUSIP numbers remain unassigned to Global Notes, and
the Company will reserve additional CUSIP numbers for assignment to Global
Notes. Upon obtaining such additional CUSIP numbers, the Company shall deliver
a list of such additional CUSIP numbers to the Trustee and DTC.

TRANSFERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS. Transfers of Notes will be accomplished
by book entries made in accordance with the procedures described in the Basic
Prospectus under the heading "Book-Entry Debt Securities". Consolidations of
Notes will be accomplished in accordance with Section 8 of the Letter of
Representations.

ACCRUAL AND PAYMENT OF INTEREST. Interest on Book-Entry Notes will
accrue and will be paid at the times and in the manner consistent with the
descriptions thereof in the Prospectus Supplement and the applicable Pricing
Supplement.

NOTICE OF INTEREST PAYMENT AND REGULAR RECORD DATES. Between a
Regular Record Date and an Interest Payment Date, the Trustee will notify the
Company and DTC of the amount of interest due with respect to each Book-Entry
Note. Promptly after each Interest Determination Date for Floating Rate Book-
Entry Notes, the Trustee, as Calculation Agent, will notify Standard & Poor's
Corporation of the interest rates determined on such Interest Determination
Date.

PROCEDURES UPON COMPANY'S EXERCISE OF OPTIONAL INTEREST RESET. In the
event the Company has the option to elect to reset the interest rate on a Fixed
Rate Note or the Spread or Spread Multiplier on a Floating Rate Note, and the
Company exercises such option, the Company and the Trustee shall comply with the
provisions of the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Subsequent Interest
Periods -- Interest Rate Reset" and Section 9 of the Letter of Representations.

<PAGE>

4

PROCEDURES UPON COMPANY'S EXERCISE OF OPTIONAL REDEMPTION. In the
event the Company has the option to elect to redeem a Book-Entry Note, and the
Company exercises such option, the Company and the Trustee shall comply with the
provisions of the Prospectus Supplement under the heading "Redemption and
Repayment" and Section 9 of the Letter of Representations.

PROCEDURE FOR RATE SETTING AND POSTING. The Company and the Agents
will discuss from time to time the aggregate principal amount of, the issue
price of, and the interest rates to be borne by, Book-Entry Notes that may be
sold as a result of the solicitation by the Agents of offers to purchase Notes.
If the Company decides to set prices of, and rates borne by, any Book-Entry
Notes in respect of which the Agents are to solicit offers (the setting of such
prices and rates to be referred to herein as "posting") or if the Company
decides to change prices or rates previously posted by it, it will promptly
advise the Agents of the prices and rates to be posted. When the Company has
determined to change the posted interest rates of Book-Entry Notes being
offered, it will promptly advise the Agents and the Agents will forthwith
suspend soliciting offers. At such time as the Company has advised the Agents
of the new interest rates, the Agents may resume soliciting offers. Until such
time, only "indications of interest" may be recorded.

PREPARATION AND DELIVERY OF PRICING SUPPLEMENT. If any offer to
purchase a Book-Entry Note is accepted by the Company, the Company and the
Guarantor will prepare a Pricing Supplement reflecting the applicable interest
rates and other terms of such Book-Entry Note, will arrange to have copies
thereof filed with the Commission in accordance with the applicable paragraph of
Rule 424(b) under the Act and will supply at least ten copies thereof (and
additional copies if requested) to the Agent that presented the offer (the
"Presenting Agent"). On the day on which an offer to purchase a Book-Entry Note
is accepted by the Company, the Company will inform the Trustee of such
acceptance by telephone at (404) 607-3101 and deliver via telecopy (with a hard
copy to follow by mail) a copy of the Pricing Supplement at the following
location: NationsBank of Georgia, N.A., 600 Peachtree St. NE, Suite 900,

The Presenting Agent will cause a Prospectus and Pricing Supplement to

A copy of the Prospectus and a Pricing Supplement relating to a Book-
Entry Note must accompany or precede the earliest of (i) a written acceptance by
the Company, if any, of an offer by the purchaser of a Book-Entry Note, (ii)
confirmation of the purchase of such Book-Entry Note and (iii) payment for such
Book-Entry Note by its purchaser. Subject to the terms of the Agency Agreement,
the Presenting Agent will deliver a Prospectus and Pricing Supplement as herein
described with respect to each Book-Entry Note sold by it. The Company will
make such delivery if such Book-Entry Note is sold directly by the Company to a
purchaser (other than an Agent).

Outdated Pricing Supplements (other than those retained for files)
will be destroyed.

CONFIRMATION. For each offer to purchase a Book-Entry Note solicited
by any Agent and accepted by or on behalf of the Company, the Presenting Agent
will issue a confirmation to the purchaser, with a copy to the Company, setting
forth the details referred to above and delivery and payment instructions.

SETTLEMENT. The receipt by the Company of immediately available funds
in payment for a Book-Entry Note and the authentication and issuance of the
Global Note representing such Book-Entry Note shall constitute "settlement" with
respect to such Book-Entry Note. All orders accepted by the Company will be
settled on the fifth Business Day following the date of sale of such Book-Entry
Note pursuant to the timetable for settlement set forth in the Medium-Term Note
Certificate Agreement between the Depository and the Trustee, unless the
Company and the purchaser agree to settlement on another day, which shall be no
earlier than the next Business Day following the date of sale.

SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES. Settlement procedures with regard to each
Book-Entry Note sold by the Company through any Agent, as agent, shall be
consistent with those used in DTC's Participant Terminal System ("PTS"). The
procedures to be followed upon a failure to settle shall also be governed by
PTS.

AUTHENTICITY OF SIGNATURES. The Company will cause the Trustee to
furnish to the Agents from time to time the specimen signatures of the Trustee's
officers, employees or agents who have been authorized by the Trustee to
authenticate Global Notes, but no Agent

<PAGE>

of the authenticity of the signature of any officer, employee or agent of the
Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee on any Global Note.

send to the Company a statement setting forth the principal amount of Book-Entry
Notes outstanding as of that date and setting forth a brief description of any

MATTERS TO BE COVERED BY LETTER
OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

Price Waterhouse shall have furnished to you the following letter (in each case
in form and substance satisfactory to you):

(a) They are independent certified public accountants with respect to
the Guarantor within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933
(the "Act") and the applicable published rules and regulations
thereunder (the "Act Regulations");

(b) In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements of the
Guarantor and its subsidiaries audited by them and included or
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
of the Act and the Act Regulations with respect to registration
statements on Form S-3 and, to the extent applicable, the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the
published rules and regulations thereunder (the "Exchange Act
Regulations") with respect to annual reports on Form 10-K;

(c) On the basis of procedures (but not an audit in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards) consisting of:

(i) a reading of the minutes of all meetings of the Guarantor's

least years prior to the date of such letter as set forth

its consolidated subsidiaries included or incorporated by
reference in the Prospectus; and

(iii) making inquiries of certain officials of the Guarantor who
have responsibility for financial and accounting matters
regarding the specific items for which representations are
requested below;

nothing has come to their attention as a result of the foregoing
procedures that caused them to believe that:

(A) the unaudited interim financial statements, if any, included
or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements of the Act and the Act Regulations
and, to the extent applicable, the Exchange Act and the

to the exercise of stock options or otherwise related
to employee benefit plans, pursuant to
<PAGE>

D-3

conversions of convertible securities or pursuant to
business acquisitions) in the Common Stock of the Guarantor,
as compared with the amount shown in such latest balance
sheet, or any issuance of shares of any other class of
capital stock of the Guarantor; or

(y) any increase in the total amount of consolidated short-term
and long-term debt of the Guarantor and its consolidated
subsidiaries (excluding debt or subsidiaries principally
engaged in business outside the United States and Canada);

except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases that
the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur.

(d) In addition to their audits, inspections, inquiries and other
procedures referred to therein, they have performed such other
procedures, specified by you, not constituting an audit, as they
have agreed to perform and report on with respect to certain
amounts, percentages, numerical data and other financial
information in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the
exhibits to the Registration Statement or in the documents
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, and have compared
certain of such amounts, percentages, numerical data and
financial information with, and have found such items to be in
agreement with or derived from, the detailed accounting records
of the Guarantor and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Date (such terms together are hereinafter referred to as the "MATURITY" with
respect to the principal repayable on such date) as provided on the reverse
hereof. Except as indicated above, "BUSINESS DAY" means any day, other than a

the day is (i) not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or
required by law or regulation to be closed in The City of New York; (ii) if this
Note is denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars or ECU, (a)
not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or

may be the Trustee) in The City of New York. The Company has initially
appointed the Paying Agent designated above.

If this Note is not a Global Security, payment of interest, if any, on
this Note (other than at Maturity) shall be made by check mailed to the
registered address of the holder hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if (i) the
Specified Currency is U.S. dollars and the holder hereof is the holder of
$10,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Securities of the series of
which this Note forms a part (whether having identical or different terms and
provisions) or (ii) the Specified Currency is not U.S. dollars, and, if such
option is set forth on the face hereof, the holder has elected to receive
payments in such Specified Currency as set forth on the reverse hereof, such
interest payments shall be made by transfer of immediately available funds, but
only if appropriate instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee on
or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date or at least 15 calendar days
prior to Maturity, as the case may be. Simultaneously with any election by the
holder hereof to receive payments in respect hereof in the Specified Currency
(if other than U.S. dollars), such holder may provide appropriate instructions

Note in such Specified Currency as set forth on the reverse hereof will be paid
directly by the Paying Agent.

The Company shall pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in
making payments in immediately available funds, but any tax, assessment or
governmental charge imposed upon payments, including, without limitation, any
withholding tax, shall be borne by the holder of the Note in respect of which
such payments are made.

REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS NOTE SET
FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF, WHICH FURTHER PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES
HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS IF SET FORTH AT THIS PLACE.

GUARANTEE

For value received, W. R. GRACE & CO., a New York corporation (herein
referred to as the "Guarantor", which term includes any successor under the
Indenture referred to on the reverse of the Note upon which this Guarantee is
endorsed), hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
holder of the Note upon which this Guarantee is endorsed, and to the Trustee on
behalf of each such holder, the due and punctual payment of the principal of
(and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on such Note (including, in case
of default, interest, if any on any overdue principal, premium and interest and
including any additional interest required to be paid according to the terms of
such Note), when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether on the
Maturity Date, upon redemption or repayment, upon declaration of acceleration or
otherwise, according to the terms of such Note and of the Indenture. In case of
the failure of the Company or any successor thereto punctually to pay any such
principal, premium or interest, the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause any such
payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable,
whether on the Maturity Date, upon redemption or repayment, upon declaration of
acceleration or otherwise, as if such payment were made by the Company.

The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be
unconditional and absolute, irrespective of the identity of the Company, the
validity, regularity or enforceability of such Note or the Indenture, the
absence of any action to enforce the same, the granting of any waiver or consent
by the holder of such Note with respect to any provisions thereof, the recovery
of any judgment against the Company or any action to enforce the same, or any
other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a guarantor. The Guarantor hereby waives diligence,
presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first
against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants
that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of
the obligations contained in such Note and in this Guarantee.

If the Trustee or the holder of such Note is required by any court or
otherwise to return to the Company or the Guarantor, or any custodian, receiver,
liquidator, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official acting in relation
to the Company or the Guarantor, any amount paid to the Trustee or such holder
in respect of such Note, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged,
shall be reinstated in full force and effect. The Guarantor further agrees, to
the fullest extent that it may lawfully do so, that, as between the Guarantor,
on the one hand and the holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, the maturity
of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article
Five of the Indenture for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any
stay, injunction or other prohibition extant under any applicable bankruptcy law
preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby.

The Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any claim or other rights
which it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the
existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Guarantor's obligations
under this Guarantee, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of any holder of such Note

authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and the Trustee on behalf of such
holder against the Company or any collateral which any such holder or the
Trustee on behalf of such holder hereafter acquires, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law,
including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company,
directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other
manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. If any
amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence at
any time prior to the payment in full of all obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Guarantee, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to
the Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, any
holder of any Outstanding Note and the Trustee on behalf of such holder and
shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of such holder to be
credited and applied upon such guaranteed obligations, whether matured or
unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The Guarantor
acknowledges that the waiver set forth herein is knowingly made.

All capitalized terms used without definition in this Guarantee shall
have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.

This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless
the certificate of authentication on the Note on which this Guarantee is
endorsed shall have been executed by the Trustee under the Indenture by the
manual signature of one of its authorized officers.

[REVERSE OF NOTE]

W. R. GRACE & CO.-CONN.

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE, SERIES A

UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY W. R. GRACE & CO.

Section 1. GENERAL. This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of
securities (the "SECURITIES") of the Company, issued and to be issued in one or
more series under the Indenture, dated as of January 28, 1993, as it may be
supplemented from time to time (the "INDENTURE"), among the Company, the
Guarantor and NationsBank of Georgia, National Association, trustee (including
any successor trustee under the Indenture with respect to a series of which this
Note is a part, the "TRUSTEE"), to which Indenture and all indentures
supplemental thereto, reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective
rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company,
the Guarantor, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities, and of the terms
upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This
Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, which series is
unlimited in aggregate principal amount.

This Note is unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor, as set forth
in Article Sixteen of the Indenture and in the Guarantee endorsed on the face
hereof.

Section 2. PAYMENTS. Payments of principal (and premium, if any)
and interest, if any, to be made in respect hereof shall, if this Note is
denominated in U.S. dollars, be paid in the manner described on the face hereof.
Payments of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, to be made in
respect hereof shall, if this Note is denominated in a Specified Currency other
than U.S. dollars, be made by the Paying Agent in U.S. dollars in the manner
described on the face hereof in an amount calculated by the Exchange Rate Agent;
PROVIDED that, if such option is set forth on the face hereof, the holder hereof
(or, if this Note is a Global Security, the beneficial owner hereof) may elect
to receive all payments in respect thereof in such Specified Currency by
delivering a written election to that effect to the Paying Agent in The City of
New York on or prior to the applicable Regular Record Date or at least 15
calendar days prior to Maturity, as the case may be. Such election shall remain
in effect unless and until changed by written notice to the Paying Agent, but
(i) the Paying Agent must receive written notice of any such change on or prior
to the applicable Regular Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior to
Maturity, as the case may be, and (ii) no such change of election may be made
with respect to payments on this Note with respect to which (a) an Event of
Default has occurred, (b) the Company has exercised any of its defeasance or
covenant defeasance options, (c) the Indenture has been satisfied and discharged
pursuant to Article Four thereof, (d) the Company has given a notice of
redemption or (e) such holder has exercised its repayment option. All currency
exchange costs shall be borne by the Company unless any holder hereof has made
the election referred to above in this paragraph, in which case each electing
holder shall bear the currency exchange costs related hereto, if any, by
deductions from payments otherwise due such holder.

<PAGE>

The amount of U.S. dollar payments in respect hereof, if this Note is
denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars (the "EXCHANGE
RATE"), shall be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent, based on the indicative
quotation in The City of New York selected by such Exchange Rate Agent at
approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day
preceding the applicable payment date, that yields the largest number of U.S.
dollars upon conversion of such Specified Currency. Such selection shall be
made from the quotations received by the Exchange Rate Agent from no more than
three nor less than two recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of which may be
the Exchange Rate Agent) in The City of New York, selected by the Exchange Rate
Agent and approved by the Company, for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the
Specified Currency in exchange for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment
date. If no such bid quotations are available, payments shall be made in the
Specified Currency unless such Specified Currency is unavailable, in which case
the Company shall be entitled to make payments in U.S. dollars, all as provided
below.

If this Note is denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S.
dollars and payments hereon are required to be made in such Specified Currency
(either because (i) the holder thereof has elected to receive payment in such
Specified Currency, as specified above, or (ii) payments in U.S. dollars may not
be made due to the unavailability of the Exchange Rate as of any particular
payment date) and such Specified Currency is unavailable as of the due date
thereof (due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances
beyond the Company's control, or because such Specified Currency is no longer
used by the government of the country issuing such Specified Currency or for the
settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international
banking community), the Company shall be entitled to make all payments due on
such due date with respect hereto in U.S. dollars until such Specified Currency
is again available or so used, on the basis of the noon buying rate in The City
of New York for cable transfers in the Specified Currency, as certified for
customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("MARKET EXCHANGE
RATE") for such Specified Currency on the second Business Day prior to such
date. In the event such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, the Company
shall be entitled to make payments in U.S. dollars (i) if such Specified
Currency is not a composite currency, in an amount determined by the Exchange
Agent on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate for such
Specified Currency or (ii) if such Specified Currency is a composite currency
(including, without limitation, the ECU), in an amount determined by the
Exchange Rate Agent to be the sum of the amounts obtained by multiplying the
appropriate number of units of each component currency comprising such composite
currency, as of the most recent date on which such composite currency was used,
by the Market Exchange Rate for such component currency on the second Business
Day prior to such payment date (or if such Market Exchange Rate is not then
available, by the most recently available Market Exchange Rate for such
component currency).

If the official unit of any component currency of a composite currency
is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the number of units of that
currency as a component shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion.
If two or more component currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the
amounts of those currencies as components shall be replaced by an amount in such
single currency equal to the sum of the amounts of the consolidated component
currencies expressed in such single currency. If any component currency is
divided into two or more currencies, the amount of that currency as a component
shall be replaced by amounts of such two or more currencies having an aggregate
value on

<PAGE>

the date of division equal to the amount of the former component currency
immediately before such division.

The determinations made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its
sole discretion (except to the extent expressly provided herein that any
determination is subject to approval by the Company) and, in the absence of
manifest error, shall be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company
and the holder hereof, and the Exchange Rate Agent shall have no liability
therefor.

Section 3. REDEMPTION. If so specified on the face hereof, the
Company may at its option redeem this Note in whole or from time to time in part
in increments of $1,000 (provided that any remaining principal amount of this
Note shall not be less than the minimum denomination of such Note) on or after
the Initial Redemption Date set forth on the face hereof at 100% of the unpaid
principal amount hereof or the portion thereof redeemed (or, if this Note is a
Discount Security, such lesser amount as is provided for below) multiplied by
the Initial Redemption Percentage set forth on the face hereof, together with
accrued interest to the Redemption Date. Such Initial Redemption Percentage
shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by an amount
equal to the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction set forth on the face hereof
until the redemption price is 100% of such amount. The Company may exercise any
such option by causing the Trustee to mail a notice of such redemption at least
30 but not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. In the event of any
such redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes for the
unredeemed portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon
the cancellation hereof. If less than all of the Notes with like tenor and
terms to this Note are to be so redeemed, the Notes to be so redeemed shall be
selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and
appropriate.

Section 4. REPAYMENT. If so specified on the face hereof, this Note
shall be repayable prior to the Maturity Date at the option of the holder on
each applicable Optional Repayment Date set forth on the face hereof at the
repayment price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repaid, together
with accrued interest to the Repayment Date. In order for this Note to be so
repaid, the Trustee must receive, at least 30 but not more than 45 days prior to
an Optional Repayment Date, this Note with the form attached hereto entitled
"OPTION TO ELECT REPAYMENT" duly completed. Any tender of this Note for
repayment shall be irrevocable. The repayment option may be exercised by the
holder of this Note in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 (provided that
any remaining principal amount of this Note shall not be less than the minimum
denomination of such Note). Upon any partial repayment, this Note shall be
cancelled and a new Note or Notes for the remaining principal amount hereof
shall be issued in the name of the holder of this Note.

sinking fund.

referred to as a "DISCOUNT SECURITY") (a) has been issued at an Issue Price (as
set forth on the face hereof) lower, by more than a DE MINIMIS amount (as
determined under United States federal income tax rules applicable to original
issue discount instruments), than the principal amount hereof or (b) would be
considered an original issue discount instrument for United States federal
income tax purposes, then the amount payable on this Note in the event of
redemption by the Company, repayment at the option of the holder or acceleration
of the maturity hereof, in lieu of the principal amount due at the Maturity
Date, shall be the Amortized Face Amount

<PAGE>

12

(as defined below) of this Note as of the date of such redemption, repayment or
acceleration. The "AMORTIZED FACE AMOUNT" of this Note shall be the amount
equal to the sum of (a) the Issue Price (set forth on the face hereof) plus
(b) that portion of the difference between the Issue Price and the principal
amount hereof that has accrued at the Yield to Maturity set forth on the face
hereof (computed in accordance with generally accepted United States bond yield
computation principles) at the date as of which such Amortized Face Amount is
calculated, but in no event shall the Amortized Face Amount of this Note exceed
its stated principal amount.

of such defaults, by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount
of all Outstanding Securities on behalf of the holders of all Outstanding
Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be
conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note
and of any Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
therefore or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver
is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note, of
the Guarantees or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the
Company or the Guarantor (in the event the Guarantor is obligated to make
payments in respect of this Note), which is absolute and unconditional, to pay

the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

in denominations of $1,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral
multiple of $1,000. If this Note is denominated in a Specified Currency other

W. R. GRACE & CO.-CONN., a Connecticut corporation (herein referred to
as the "COMPANY", which term includes any successor under the Indenture
hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to

___________________________________, or registered assigns, the principal sum of

the Maturity Date (except to the extent redeemed or repaid prior to such
Maturity Date) and to pay interest thereon at the Initial Interest Rate from the
Issue Date until the first Interest Reset Date following such Issue Date and
thereafter at the interest rate determined in accordance with the provisions set
forth on the reverse hereof, until the principal hereof is paid or duly provided
for. The Company shall pay interest on each Interest Payment Date specified
above, commencing with the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the Issue
Date, and at the Maturity Date, on any Redemption Date or Repayment Date (such
terms together are hereinafter referred to as the "MATURITY" with respect to the
principal repayable on such date) as provided on the reverse hereof. Except as
indicated above, "BUSINESS DAY" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday,
that meets each of the following applicable requirements: the day is (i) not a
day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or
regulation to be closed in The City of New York; (ii) if this Note is
denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars or ECU, (a) not a
day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law or
regulation to close in the principal financial center of the country issuing the
Specified Currency and (b) a day on which banking institutions in such principal
financial center are carrying out transactions in such Specified Currency;
(iii) if this Note is denominated in ECU, (a) not a day on which banking
institutions are authorized or required by law or regulation to close in

Interest on this Note shall accrue as provided on the reverse hereof.
Interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest
Payment Date shall, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose
name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of
business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the date
(whether or not a Business Day) 15 calendar days prior to such Interest Payment
Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if this Note is issued between a Regular Record
Date and the related Interest Payment Date, interest for the period beginning on
the Issue Date and ending on such Interest Payment Date shall be paid on the
Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the
holder on such succeeding Regular Record Date; and PROVIDED FURTHER that
interest payable at Maturity shall be payable to the Person to whom the
principal hereof shall be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or
duly provided for by the Company shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
holder on such Regular Record Date, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid, at
the election of the Company, to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or
more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a Special
Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the
Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to the holders of the Securities of the
series of which this Note forms a part, not less than 10 days prior to such
Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all
as more fully provided in the Indenture.

Principal (and premium, if any) and interest payable at Maturity shall
be paid upon surrender of this Note at the office of the Paying Agent in The
City of New York. Until the Securities of the series of which this Note forms a
part are paid in full or payment therefor in full is duly provided for, the
Company shall at all times maintain a Paying Agent (which Paying Agent may be
the Trustee) in The City of New York. The Company has initially appointed the
Paying Agent designated above.

If this Note is not a Global Security, payment of interest on this
Note (other than at Maturity) shall be made by check mailed to the registered
address of the holder hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if (i) the Specified
Currency is U.S. dollars and the holder hereof is the holder of $10,000,000 or
more in aggregate principal amount of Securities of the series of which this
Note forms a part (whether having identical or different terms and provisions)
or (ii) the Specified Currency is not U.S. dollars, and, if such option is set
forth on the face hereof, the holder has elected to receive payments in such
Specified Currency as set forth on the reverse hereof, such interest payments
shall be made by transfer of immediately available funds, but only if
appropriate instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee on or
prior to the applicable Regular Record Date or at least 15 calendar days prior
to Maturity, as the case may be. Simultaneously with any election by the holder
hereof to receive payments in respect hereof in the Specified Currency (if other
than U.S. dollars), such holder may provide appropriate instructions to the
Trustee, and all such payments shall be made in immediately available funds to
an account maintained by the payee with a bank, but only if such bank has
appropriate facilities therefor. Payments of principal of (and premium, if any,
on) and interest on this Note at Maturity shall be paid in immediately available
funds upon surrender of this Note at the office of the Paying Agent in The City
of New York (or at such other location as may be specified above).

If this Note is a Global Security, payment of interest on this Note
(other than at Maturity) shall be made by the Paying Agent to the Depository in
immediately available funds. Payments of principal of (and premium, if any, on)
and interest payable on this Note at Maturity shall be made by the Paying Agent
by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by the
Depository. Owners of an interest in this Note shall be paid in accordance with
the procedures of the Depository and the applicable Participant therein, as in
effect from time to time. If this Note is denominated in a Specified Currency
other than U.S. dollars, owners of an interest in this Note who have elected
through the Depository to receive payments of principal of (and premium, if any,
on) and interest on this Note in such Specified Currency as set forth on the
reverse hereof will be paid directly by the Paying Agent.

The Company shall pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in
making payments in immediately available funds, but any tax, assessment or
governmental charge imposed upon payments, including, without limitation, any
withholding tax, shall be borne by the holder of the Note in respect of which
such payments are made.

REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS NOTE SET
FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF, WHICH FURTHER PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES
HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS IF SET FORTH AT THIS PLACE.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by
the Trustee hereinafter referred to by manual signature, this Note and the
Guarantee endorsed thereon

shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or
obligatory for any purpose.

GUARANTEE

For value received, W. R. GRACE & CO., a New York corporation (herein
referred to as the "Guarantor", which term includes any successor under the
Indenture referred to on the reverse of the Note upon which this Guarantee is
endorsed), hereby fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
holder of the Note upon which this Guarantee is endorsed, and to the Trustee on
behalf of each such holder, the due and punctual payment of the principal of
(and premium, if any, on) and interest on such Note (including, in case of
default, interest on any overdue principal, premium and interest and including
any additional interest required to be paid according to the terms of such
Note), when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether on the
Maturity Date, upon redemption or repayment, upon declaration of acceleration or
otherwise, according to the terms of such Note and of the Indenture. In case of
the failure of the Company or any successor thereto punctually to pay any such
principal, premium or interest, the Guarantor hereby agrees to cause any such
payment to be made punctually when and as the same shall become due and payable,
whether on the Maturity Date, upon redemption or repayment, upon declaration of
acceleration or otherwise, as if such payment were made by the Company.

The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be
unconditional and absolute, irrespective of the identity of the Company, the
validity, regularity or enforceability of such Note or the Indenture, the
absence of any action to enforce the same, the granting of any waiver or consent
by the holder of such Note with respect to any provisions thereof, the recovery
of any judgment against the Company or any action to enforce the same, or any
other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a guarantor. The Guarantor hereby waives diligence,
presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first
against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants
that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of
the obligations contained in such Note and in this Guarantee.

If the Trustee or the holder of such Note is required by any court or
otherwise to return to the Company or the Guarantor, or any custodian, receiver,
liquidator, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official acting in relation
to the Company or the Guarantor, any amount paid to the Trustee or such holder
in respect of such Note, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged,
shall be reinstated in full force and effect. The Guarantor further agrees, to
the fullest extent that it may lawfully do so, that, as between the Guarantor,
on the one hand and the holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, the maturity
of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article
Five of the Indenture for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any
stay, injunction or other prohibition extant under any applicable bankruptcy law
preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby.

The Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any claim or other rights
which it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the
existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Guarantor's obligations
under this Guarantee, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of any holder of such Note

authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and the Trustee on behalf of such
holder against the Company or any collateral which any such holder or the
Trustee on behalf of such holder hereafter acquires, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law,
including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company,
directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other
manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. If any
amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence at
any time prior to the payment in full of all obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Guarantee, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to
the Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, any
holder of any Outstanding Note and the Trustee on behalf of such holder and
shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of such holder to be
credited and applied upon such guaranteed obligations, whether matured or
unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The Guarantor
acknowledges that the waiver set forth herein is knowingly made.

All capitalized terms used without definition in this Guarantee shall
have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.

This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless
the certificate of authentication on the Note on which this Guarantee is
endorsed shall have been executed by the Trustee under the Indenture by the
manual signature of one of its authorized officers.

The amount of U.S. dollar payments in respect hereof, if this Note is
denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars (the "EXCHANGE
RATE"), shall be determined by the Exchange Rate Agent, based on the indicative
quotation in The City of New York selected by such Exchange Rate Agent at
approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day
preceding the applicable payment date, that yields the largest number of U.S.
dollars upon conversion of such Specified Currency. Such selection shall be
made from the quotations received by the Exchange Rate Agent from no more than
three nor less than two recognized foreign exchange dealers (one of which may be
the Exchange Rate Agent) in The City of New York, selected by the Exchange Rate
Agent and approved by the Company, for the purchase by the quoting dealer of the
Specified Currency in exchange for U.S. dollars for settlement on such payment
date. If no such bid quotations are available, payments shall be made in the
Specified Currency unless such Specified Currency is unavailable, in which case
the Company shall be entitled to make payments in U.S. dollars, all as provided
below.

If this Note is denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S.
dollars and payments hereon are required to be made in such Specified Currency
(either because (i) the holder thereof has elected to receive payment in such
Specified Currency, as specified above, or (ii) payments in U.S. dollars may not
be made due to the unavailability of the Exchange Rate as of any particular
payment date) and such Specified Currency is unavailable as of the due date
thereof (due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances
beyond the Company's control, or because such Specified Currency is no longer
used by the government of the country issuing such Specified Currency or for the
settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international
banking community), the Company shall be entitled to make all payments due on
such due date with respect hereto in U.S. dollars until such Specified Currency
is again available or so used, on the basis of the noon buying rate in The City
of New York for cable transfers in the Specified Currency, as certified for
customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("MARKET EXCHANGE
RATE") for such Specified Currency on the second Business Day prior to such
date. In the event such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, the Company
shall be entitled to make payments in U.S. dollars (i) if such Specified
Currency is not a composite currency, in an amount determined by the Exchange
Agent on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate for such
Specified Currency or (ii) if such Specified Currency is a composite currency
(including, without limitation, the ECU), in an amount determined by the
Exchange Rate Agent to be the sum of the amounts obtained by multiplying the
appropriate number of units of each component currency comprising such composite
currency, as of the most recent date on which such composite currency was used,
by the Market Exchange Rate for such component currency on the second Business
Day prior to such payment date (or if such Market Exchange Rate is not then
available, by the most recently available Market Exchange Rate for such
component currency).

If the official unit of any component currency of a composite currency
is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the number of units of that
currency as a component shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion.
If two or more component currencies are consolidated into a single currency, the
amounts of those currencies as components shall be replaced by an amount in such
single currency equal to the sum of the amounts of the consolidated component
currencies expressed in such single currency. If any component currency is
divided into two or more currencies, the amount of that currency as a component
shall be replaced by amounts of such two or more currencies having an aggregate
value on

<PAGE>

11

the date of division equal to the amount of the former component currency
immediately before such division.

The determinations made by the Exchange Rate Agent shall be at its
sole discretion (except to the extent expressly provided herein that any
determination is subject to approval by the Company) and, in the absence of
manifest error, shall be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company
and the holder hereof, and the Exchange Rate Agent shall have no liability
therefor.

Section 3. INTEREST RATE CALCULATIONS. Unless otherwise set forth on
the face hereof, the following provisions of this Section 3 shall apply to the
calculation of interest on this Note. This Note shall bear interest from and
including its Issue Date to but excluding the first Interest Reset Date at the
Initial Interest Rate set forth on the face hereof. Subsequently, this Note
shall bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at the interest rate
determined by (i) adding to or subtracting from the Base Rate set forth on the
face hereof, the Spread, if any, and/or (ii) multiplying the Base Rate by the
Spread Multiplier, if any, in either case as set forth on the face hereof. The
interest rate for an Interest Reset Period shall be the interest rate as
determined on the immediately preceding Interest Determination Date.

The rate of interest on this Note shall be reset daily, weekly,
monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually, on the Interest Reset Dates set
forth on the face hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the interest rate in effect
for the ten days immediately prior to the date of Maturity shall be that in
effect on the tenth day prior to Maturity. If an Interest Reset Date would
otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be
postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, except that, if the Base Rate set
forth on the face hereof is LIBOR and in the event that such Business Day would
fall in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be
the immediately preceding Business Day.

Each payment of interest on this Note shall include interest accrued
from and including the Issue Date or the last Interest Payment Date to which
interest has been paid or duly provided for, as the case may be, to but
excluding the next Interest Payment Date or the date of Maturity, as the case
may be; PROVIDED that, if this Note resets daily or weekly, each payment of
interest shall include the interest accrued from and including the Issue Date or
from and excluding the last Regular Record Date to which interest has been paid
or duly provided for, as the case may be, to but including the Regular Record
Date immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or to but
excluding the date of Maturity, as the case may be. Any payment required to be
made in respect of this Note on a date that is not a Business Day for this Note
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect
as if made on such date, and no additional interest shall accrue as a result of
such delayed payment; PROVIDED that if the Base Rate specified above is LIBOR
and such Business Day would fall in the succeeding calendar month, such payment
shall be made on the Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Payment
Date.

Accrued interest shall be calculated by multiplying the principal
amount hereof by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor shall
be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the period
for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor (expressed
as a decimal calculated to seven decimal places, without rounding) for each day
in such period shall be computed by dividing the interest rate in effect on such
day by 360 (if the Base Rate set forth on the face hereof is the CD Rate,

<PAGE>

12

Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or Prime Rate) or by the actual
number of days in the relevant year (if the Base Rate set forth on the face
hereof is the Treasury Rate).

As set forth on the face hereof, this Note may also have either or
both of a Maximum Interest Rate and a Minimum Interest Rate. In addition to any
Maximum Interest Rate that may be set forth on the face hereof, the interest
rate on this Note shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by
applicable New York and United States federal law.

All percentages resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest
on this Note shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1%
(.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, and
all currency amounts used in or resulting from such calculation hereon shall be
rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a unit (with .005 of a unit being
rounded upward).

The Company has appointed the Calculation Agent designated on the face
hereof to calculate the rate of interest on this Note. All determinations of
interest by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the holder hereof.
Upon the request of the holder (or if this Note is a Global Security, the
beneficial owner hereof) the Calculation Agent shall provide the interest rate
then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that shall become effective
on the next Interest Reset Date.

DETERMINATION OF CD RATE. If the Base Rate set forth on the face
hereof is the CD Rate, this Note shall bear interest for each Interest Reset
Period at the interest rate calculated with reference to the CD Rate and the
Spread and/or the Spread Multiplier, if any, as set forth on the face hereof.

The "CD RATE" means, with respect to any Interest Determination Date,
the rate on such date for negotiable certificates of deposit having the Index

the Federal Reserve System in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected Interest
Rates", or any successor publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System ("H.15(519)") under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)". If
such rate is not published by 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Calculation

rate on such Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of deposit
of the Index Maturity set forth on the face hereof, as published by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York in its daily statistical release, "Composite 3:30 p.m.
Quotations for U.S. Government Securities", or any successor publication of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("COMPOSITE QUOTATIONS") under the heading
"Certificates of Deposit". If such rate is not published in Composite
Quotations by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining
to such Interest Determination Date, then the CD Rate for such Interest
Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the
arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m., New York
City time, on such Interest Determination Date, of three leading nonbank dealers
in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in The City of New York,
selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Company, for
negotiable certificates of deposit of major United States money center banks of
the highest credit standing (in the market for negotiable certificates of
deposit) with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity set forth on
the face hereof

The "COMMERCIAL PAPER RATE" means, with respect to any Interest
Determination Date, the Money Market Yield on such date of the rate for

Interest Determination Date, the Commercial Paper Rate shall be the Money Market
Yield on such Interest Determination Date of the rate for commercial paper of
the applicable Index Maturity, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York in Composite Quotations under the heading "Commercial Paper". If such rate
is not published in Composite Quotations by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the Calculation Date pertaining to such Interest Determination Date, then the
Commercial Paper Rate for such Interest Determination Date shall be calculated
by the Calculation Agent and shall be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic
mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m. New York City time, on such Interest
Determination Date of three leading dealers of commercial paper in The City of
New York, selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Company,
for commercial paper of the applicable Index Maturity, placed for industrial
issuers whose bond rating (as determined by a nationally recognized rating
agency) is "AA" or the equivalent; PROVIDED that, if the dealers selected as
aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting such rates, the interest rate
for the period commencing on the Interest Reset Date following such Interest
Determination Date shall be the interest rate borne by this Note on such
Interest Determination Date.

"MONEY MARKET YIELD" shall be a yield calculated in accordance with the
following formula:

Money Market Yield = D x 360 x 100
-------------
360 - (D x M)

where "D" refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper quoted on
a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, and "M" refers to the actual
number of days in the applicable period for which interest is being calculated.

Funds Rate shall be the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Composite Quotations under the heading
"Federal Funds/Effective Rate". If such rate is not published in Composite
Quotations by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date pertaining
to such Interest Determination Date, then the Federal Funds Rate for such
Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and
shall be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight
federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of federal funds transactions in
The City of New York, selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with
the Company, as of 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Interest Determination
Date; PROVIDED that, if the brokers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation

principal amount hereof or the portion thereof redeemed (or, if this Note is a
Discount Security, such lesser amount as is provided for below) multiplied by
the Initial Redemption Percentage set forth on the face hereof, together with
accrued interest to the Redemption Date. Such Initial Redemption Percentage
shall decline at each anniversary of the Initial Redemption Date by an amount

until the redemption price is 100% of such amount. The Company may exercise any
such option by causing the Trustee to mail a notice of such redemption at least
30 but not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. In the event of any
such redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes for the

of the maturity hereof, in lieu of the principal amount due at the Maturity
Date, shall be the Amortized Face Amount (as defined below) of this Note as of
