Item 5. Other Events.

Ashland Oil, Inc., and Saarbergwerke AG Agree to Sale of Class B
Preferred Stock

Ashland Oil, Inc. ("Ashland Oil") has announced that it has
signed an agreement with Saarbergwerke AG ("Saarberg") allowing
Ashland Oil the right to purchase all 150 shares of Ashland Coal,
Inc.("Company") Class B Preferred Stock held by Saarberg. The
Company understands the transaction is subject to certain
conditions, including appropriate government approvals.
According to Ashland Oil, it currently has no plans to purchase
additional Company stock.

The Class B Preferred Stock represents approximately 15% of
the voting stock of the Company, and the addition of such
Preferred Stock, in combination with Ashland Oil's other holdings
of Company common stock, would result in Ashland Oil holding
approximately 54% of the voting stock of the Company.
Approximately 10% of the Company's voting stock is held by
Carboex International, Ltd., a coal purchasing agency of the
Spanish Utility ENDESA. The remaining 36% of the voting stock is
held by the public.

The purchase of the Company's Class B Preferred Stock will
result in the consolidation of the Company in Ashland Oil's
financial statements.

Each share of Company Class B Preferred Stock is presently
convertible into 18,346 shares of Company Common Stock. This
conversion rate increases to 19,596 shares on August 18, 1998 and
to 20,846 shares on August 18, 2003. In addition, the Class B
Preferred Stock receives a special annual preferred dividend and
has special voting rights. Ashland Oil reported that the
purchase price for the Class B Preferred stock under the
agreement is $110 million.
