THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY, INC. REPORTS
------------------------------------------
87 CENTS SECOND QUARTER E.P.S., A 53% INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR
-------------------------------------------------------------

NEW YORK, N.Y., July 14, 1994 -- The Bank of New York Company, Inc. 
reported second quarter net income of $176 million, which compares with
net income of $118 million in the second quarter of 1993, a 49% increase. 
Fully diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 1994 were 87
cents compared with 57 cents per share in the same period last year, an
increase of 53%. The second quarter E.P.S. compares with 87 cents in the
first quarter, which included a special net gain of 6 cents per share.
All per share figures are adjusted for the 2-for-1 common stock split
that was paid on May 13, 1994.
Net income in the first half of 1994 was $355 million, a 41% increase
over the $252 million earned in the first six months of 1993. Net income
was $1.74 per fully diluted share, a 43% increase over the $1.22 earned
last year.

<PAGE> 2.

Net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, totaled $421
million in the second quarter, an all-time high and a $33 million or 9%
increase over the second quarter of last year. The net interest rate
spread of 3.26%, also a quarterly record, was 8 basis points higher than
in the first quarter and 6 basis points higher than the second quarter of
1993. The Company also noted increased loan demand and a continued shift
in asset mix toward higher yielding assets. Credit card outstandings
continued to show strong growth. A lower provision for loan losses,
substantially lower other real estate expenses, as well as good
performance in the Company's securities and other processing business also
contributed to earnings. Operating expenses remained under tight control. 
The Company's estimated Tier I capital and total capital ratios were 
8.31% and 12.79% at June 30, 1994 compared with 8.28% and 12.89% at March
31, 1994, and 8.24% and 13.34% one year ago. Tangible common equity as
a percent of total assets was 6.49% at June 30, 1994 compared with 6.84%
at March 31, 1994 and 6.49% at June 30, 1993. 
Return on average assets in the second quarter of 1994 was 1.42%,
slightly lower than the all-time high of 1.50% recorded in the first
quarter of 1994. Return on average assets was 1.03% in the second quarter
of 1993. Return on average common equity was 17.67% in the second quarter
of 1994, slightly lower than the record 18.55% achieved in the first
quarter of 1994. Return on average common equity was 12.65% in the second
quarter of 1993.

The allowance for loan losses was $885 million, or 2.68% of loans at June

In the second quarter of 1994, the Company charged-off $15 million of LDC
loans to Yugoslavia. 

NET INTEREST INCOME

On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income amounted to a
record $421 million in the second quarter of 1994, compared with $388
million in the same period of 1993, an increase of 9%. The net interest
rate spread was 3.26% in the second quarter of 1994 compared with 3.18%
in the first quarter of 1994 and 3.20% one year ago. The net yield on
interest earning assets was 3.98% in the second quarter of 1994 compared

<PAGE> 5.

with 3.89% in the first quarter of 1994 and 3.90% in the same period last
year. The spread and yield benefitted modestly from the return of a
portion of the Company's credit card securitization to its balance sheet. 
For the first six months of 1994, net interest income, on a taxable
equivalent basis, amounted to $817 million compared with $768 million in
the same period of 1993, an increase of 6%. The year-to-date net interest
rate spread was 3.21% in 1994 compared with 3.15% in 1993, while the net
yield on interest-earning assets was 3.94% in 1994 and 3.86% in 1993. 
The Company's credit card business continued its strong growth. 
Managed outstandings were up by 22% to $6.7 billion and the number of card
accounts increased by 28% to 5.5 million from one year ago. The credit
quality of the card portfolio continues to be excellent. Net charge-offs
as a percentage of managed average outstandings were 2.86% in the second
quarter of 1994, down significantly from 3.13% in the first quarter and
3.28% one year ago.

NONINTEREST INCOME

Noninterest income was $321 million and $671 million in the second
quarter and first six months of 1994, compared with $347 million and $677
million in the same periods last year. Securities gains and foreign
exchange and other trading activities were lower in the second quarter and
six month periods of 1994 compared with 1993. The first quarter of 1994
and the second quarter of 1993 included pre-tax gains of $22 million and
$24 million, respectively, from the sale of a portion of the Company's
interest in Wing Hang Bank, Ltd.
Securities processing fees increased 16% to $88 million for the
second quarter of 1994 from $76 million in the second quarter of 1993. 
Most areas contributed to the increase. Among the strongest were
corporate trust, government securities clearance, American depositary

<PAGE> 6.

receipts and mutual fund custody. Other processing fees, principally
funds transfer, deposit services, and trade finance, were $43 million for
the second quarter of 1994, compared with $39 million in the same period
last year, an increase of 10%.
For the first six months of 1994, securities processing fees
increased 15% to $175 million and other processing fees increased 10% to
$85 million, compared with $152 million and $77 million in the same period
of 1993.
Service charges and fees were $119 million in the second quarter of
1994, compared with $116 million in the second quarter of last year, an
increase of 3%. Areas of particular strength included syndications, trade
finance and factoring commissions. In the second quarter, noninterest
income attributable to the Company's credit card securitization was $6
million less than the comparable period of last year due to a portion of
these assets returning to the balance sheet. For the first half of 1994,
service charges and fees were $238 million compared with $229 million in
1993.
Securities gains were $4 million and $23 million in the second
quarters of 1994 and 1993; year-to-date securities gains totaled $16
million and $49 million in 1994 and 1993. Second quarter and year-to-date
foreign exchange profits and trading activities totaled $13 million and
$29 million in 1994, compared with $19 million and $42 million in 1993. 
Other noninterest income includes a pre-tax gain of $22 million in
the first quarter of 1994 and a pre-tax gain of $24 million in the second
quarter of 1993, from the sale of portions of the Company's interest in
Wing Hang Bank, Ltd.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES

Total noninterest expense decreased 7% to $410 million in the second
quarter from $441 million in 1993. Year-to-date total noninterest expense
was $812 million in 1994 compared with $832 million in 1993. 
Other real estate expense declined $29 million to $2 million in the
second quarter. 
The Company recorded restructuring charges related to its National
Community Division of $3 million in the first quarter of 1994 and $35
million in the second quarter of 1993.
Most noninterest expense categories were down from the second quarter
of 1993. Excluding restructuring charges and the effect of factoring and
corporate trust acquisitions, salaries increased 4% in the second quarter
from the same period of last year. Profit-sharing increased to $16
million from $13 million in last year's second quarter. Other employee
benefits -- primarily incentive compensation and health care expenses --
were equal to the $42 million recorded in the second quarter of last year. 

The effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six months
of 1994 was 37.4% in both periods compared with 39.5% and 38.1% for the
same periods last year.
