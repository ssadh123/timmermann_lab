Item 5. Other Events.

Bell Atlantic Corporation, Tele-Communications Inc. and Liberty Media
Corporation said last night that they have been unable to reach final agreement
on their proposed merger and have terminated negotiations.

The parties had resolved their major differences, but regulatory actions
announced this week made reaching agreement on a transaction of this magnitude
impossible. The parties are discussing other ways of working together,
including possible joint ventures to build full service networks, and joint
investment in programming.
