Item 5. Other Events.

Murphy, et al. v. Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, et al.
----------------------------------------------------------------
On September 27, 1994, plaintiffs filed this action in state court
in Texas against various defendants including Blockbuster 
Entertainment Corporation ("BEC"), which has been merged into
Viacom Inc. ("Viacom"), and Video Superstores Master Limited 
Partnership ("VSMLP"), a dissolved limited partnership that was 
indirectly wholly owned by BEC at the time of its dissolution.
Plaintiffs are the representatives of the two other limited 
partners of Charles D. Howell (See the Form 8-K of BEC dated 
August 18, 1994). Plaintiffs in this action assert the same basic
causes of action as in Howell, namely, breach of fiduciary duty, 
------
conspiracy, fraud, breach of contract and intentional interference 
with contractual relations, and rights under Texas partnership law. 
Viacom believes that it has substantial defenses to these claims, 
including, among other things, the claims being barred by the Statute
of Limitations and releases from the plaintiffs as to such claims. 
Viacom intends to vigorously defend the claims.
