ITEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT

Effective May 24, 1994, Registrant dismissed its prior independent
auditors, Kenneth Leventhal & Company ("KL") and retained as its new
independent auditors, Ernst & Young ("E&Y"). KL's Independent Auditor's Report
on Registrant's financial statements for fiscal years ended December 31, 1993
and December 31, 1992 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of
opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles. The decision to change independent auditors was
approved by the Audit Committee of the Trust Managers of the Registrant and by
the Trust Managers on May 24, 1994. During the fiscal years ended December 31,
1993 and 1992, and through May 24, 1994, there were no disagreements between
Registrant and KL on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which
disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KL, would have caused it
to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with
the report.

Effective May 24, 1994, Registrant engaged E&Y as its independent
auditors. During the last two fiscal years and through May 24, 1994,
Registrant did not consult Ernst & Young regarding any of the matters or events
set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
