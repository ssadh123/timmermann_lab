NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MARCH 31, 1994
(UNAUDITED)

________________________________________________________________________________

(1) GENERAL

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Liberty Media Corporation, those of all majority-owned
subsidiaries and entities for which there is a controlling voting
interest ("Liberty" or the "Company"). All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

On January 27, 1994, Liberty and TCI entered into a definitive merger
agreement (the "Merger Agreement"). Under the Merger Agreement, the
transaction will be structured as a tax-free exchange of shares of
Class A and Class B common stock of both companies and preferred stock
of Liberty for like shares of a newly formed holding company,
TCI/Liberty Holding Company ("TCI/Liberty"). TCI stockholders will
receive one share of TCI/Liberty common stock for each of their
shares. Liberty common stockholders will receive 0.975 of a share of
TCI/Liberty common stock for each of their shares. Holders of Liberty
Class E, 6% Cumulative Redeemable Exchangeable Junior Preferred Stock
(the "Class E Preferred Stock") will receive one share of a
substantially identical class of voting preferred stock of TCI/Liberty
for each of their shares. The transaction is subject to the approval
of both sets of shareholders as well as various regulatory approvals
and other customary conditions. Subject to timely receipt of such
approvals, which cannot be assured, it is anticipated the closing of
such transaction will take place during 1994.

The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements are
unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair
presentation of the results for such periods. The results of
operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of
results for the full year. These consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993, as amended.

Certain amounts have been reclassified for comparability with the 1994
presentation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

________________________________________________________________________________

In these notes to the consolidated financial statements, any reference
to TCI in connection with the issuance of the Company's preferred
stock includes subsidiaries of TCI.

(2) PRIMARY AND FULLY DILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON AND COMMON
EQUIVALENT SHARE

Primary and fully diluted earnings attributable to common shareholders
per common and common equivalent share for the three months ended
March 31, 1994 was computed by dividing net earnings attributable to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding (131,275,408).

Loss per common share attributable to common shareholders for the
three months ended March 31, 1993 was computed by dividing net loss
attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding (129,115,331). Common stock equivalents
were not included in the computation of weighted average shares
outstanding because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

(3) SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

Cash paid for interest was $2,592,000 and $5,538,000 for the three
months ended March 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Cash paid for
income taxes during the months ended March 31, 1994 and 1993 was
$1,611,000 and $3,453,000, respectively.

On November 11, 1993, Liberty entered into an agreement with the staff
of the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to which Liberty agreed to
divest all of its equity interests in QVC during an 18 month time period
if QVC was successful in its offer to buy Paramount Communications, Inc.
("Paramount") and not to vote or otherwise exercise or influence control
over QVC until such time as QVC withdrew its offer for Paramount.
Simultaneously, Liberty agreed to withdraw from a stockholders agreement
pursuant to which Liberty and certain other stockholders exercised
control over QVC (the "Stockholders' Agreement"). On February 15, 1994,
QVC terminated its offer for Paramount. Upon termination of such offer,
Liberty had the right to be reinstated as a party to the Stockholders'
Agreement so long as such option was exercised within 90 days after such
termination.

________________________________________________________________________________

On November 16, 1993, Liberty sold 1,690,041 shares of common stock of
QVC to Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") for aggregate consideration of
approximately $31,461,000. The sale to Comcast reduced Liberty's
interest in QVC common stock (on a fully diluted basis) from 21.6% to
18.5%. Liberty continued to account for its investment in QVC under the
equity method during the three months ended March 31, 1994, although it
no longer exercised significant control over such affiliate, due to the
pending determination of whether the Company would rejoin the control
group under the Stockholders' Agreement. As a result of the election by
Liberty to forego the exercise of its option to be reinstated as a party
to the Stockholders' Agreement, Liberty will now account for its
investment in QVC under the cost method.

Certain of the shares of stock of QVC owned by Liberty are subject to
repurchase by QVC in the event that commitments to carry its programming
are not met. Approximately 46% of the shares which the Company holds or
would hold upon exercise or conversion of convertible securities, are
"unvested" and are subject to such repurchase rights by QVC. QVC's
repurchase rights with respect to QVC securities held by the Company are
exercisable over a period of time, ending in the year 2004, if certain
carriage commitments made by Satellite Services, Inc., ("SSI"), an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of TCI, are not met. Under the terms
of a certain agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired from TCI a
substantial number of the QVC securities it now beneficially owns, TCI
has agreed to reimburse the Company in the event QVC exercises its right
to repurchase certain of the "unvested" shares. Such reimbursement will
be based on the value assigned such shares when the Company acquired
them from TCI, which is substantially below the current market price of
such shares. Pursuant to an agreement with Comcast and Mr. Barry Diller
("Diller"), Diller has the right, exercisable during a 30-day period
beginning in June 1994, to purchase approximately 1.63 million shares of
QVC common stock from Liberty. The purchase price under the Diller
purchase right is $34.082 per share.

On September 16, 1993, Liberty announced that one of its subsidiaries
received notice from Rainbow Program Enterprises ("Rainbow") that
Rainbow had elected to purchase Liberty's 50% partnership interest in
AMC under the terms of a buy/sell provision contained in the AMC
partnership agreement. Upon completion of the sale, Liberty would
receive net pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $170 million from the
sale and an additional $5 million from a buy-out of Liberty's consulting
agreement with AMC. The $170 million cash proceeds consist of $195
million sales price reduced by Liberty's

proportionate share of AMC's debt. On March 9, 1994 Liberty and Rainbow
agreed to a postponement of the closing of the sale until May 31, 1994.
Liberty and Rainbow are continuing their discussions regarding other
possible transactions which, if consummated, may result in the parties
amending or terminating the sale by Liberty of its AMC partnership
interest.

Certain of the Company's affiliates are general partnerships and any
subsidiary of the Company that is a general partner in a general
partnership is, as such, liable as a matter of partnership law for all
debts (other than non-recourse debts) of that partnership in the event
liabilities of that partnership were to exceed its assets.

(a) In December 1992, Home Shopping Network, Inc. ("HSN"), a cost
investment of the Company at that time and a consolidated
subsidiary of the Company at December 31, 1993, distributed the
capital stock of Silver King Communications, Inc. ("SKC"),
formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of HSN, to their stockholders
of record, including Liberty. This transaction was treated as a
stock dividend by

(continued)

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

_______________________________________________________________________________

HSN. At the time of said dividend, intercompany indebtedness in
an amount of approximately $135 million owed by SKC to HSN was
converted into a secured long-term senior loan to SKC (a cost
investment of the Company). Such loan is evidenced by a promissory
note, the terms of which are governed by a loan agreement and the
liability evidenced thereby is secured by substantially all of
SKC's assets, and bears interest on the unpaid principal amount at
9.5% per annum. The note is payable in equal monthly installments
of principal and interest over fifteen years.

Management of the Company estimates that the market value, calculated
utilizing a multiple of cash flow approach or publicly quoted market
prices, of all of the Company's other investments aggregated $383
million and $406 million at March 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993,
respectively. No independent external appraisals were conducted for
those assets which were valued utilizing a multiple of cash flow
approach.

In May 1993 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," ("Statement No. 115")
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. Under the
new rules, debt securities that the Company has both the positive intent
and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Debt
securities that the Company does not have the positive intent and
ability to hold to maturity and all marketable equity securities are
classified as available-for-sale or trading and carried at fair value.
Unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as
available-for-sale are carried as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as
trading are reported in earnings.

The Company applied the new rules beginning in the first quarter of
1994. Application of the new rules resulted in a net increase of
$44,392,000 to stockholders' equity, representing the recognition of
unrealized appreciation, net of taxes, for the Company's investment in
equity securities determined to be available-for-sale. However, the
unrealized holding gain does not include any unrealized gain associated
with the Company's investment in TCI common stock as such common stock
is deemed to be restricted stock. Restricted stock, under Statement No.
115, is not considered to have a readily determinable fair value. See
note 6. The Company holds no debt securities.

(6) INVESTMENT IN TCI COMMON STOCK

The Company holds 2,988,009 shares of TCI class A common stock and
3,537,712 shares of TCI class B common stock. At March 31, 1994 and
December 31, 1993, the market value of the Company's investment in TCI
amounted to $149,559,000 and $209,785,000, respectively, based on its
publicly quoted market price.

Certain of the TCI common stock is held in escrow for delivery upon
exchange of the Liberty Class B Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock
(the "Class B Preferred Stock"). Pending such exchange and provided
that the Company is not in default of its obligations to redeem,
exchange or purchase shares of the Class B Preferred Stock, the Company
has the right to vote the TCI common stock held in escrow on all matters
submitted for a vote to the holders of TCI common stock.

(c) Payable by LMC Chicago Sports, Inc.

This note, which bears interest at the prime rate, is payable on
December 31, 1996 and is secured by the Company's general
partnership interest in Sports.

(d) Payable by Command Cable of Eastern Illinois Limited Partnership
("Command").

This loan is payable in quarterly installments as defined in the
related loan agreement, with a final payment on September 30,
1994. The quarterly installments consist of a fixed amount per
quarter plus additional principal payments based on a percentage
of the previous quarter's cash flow. The loan agreement
contains provisions for the maintenance of certain financial
ratios and other matters. At December 31, 1993, Command was in
default of certain provisions of the loan agreement. On April
29, 1994, Command and the bank reached an agreement whereby the
bank waived the default subject to certain modifications to the
loan agreement. All of Command's cable television assets are
pledged as collateral under this loan agreement.

(e) Payable by US Cable of Paterson ("Paterson").

This term loan has quarterly principal payments in increasing
amounts through December 31, 1996. In addition to the scheduled
quarterly payments, an annual payment may be required based upon
the prior year's excess cash flow, as defined. The outstanding

compliance with certain financial ratios and limitations on 
capital expenditures and leases. The loan is secured and 
collateralized by the assets of Paterson, the franchise rights,
and the assignment of its various leases and contracts.

(f) Payable by CCT.

This revolving line of credit provides for borrowings of up to
$145,000,000 through March 31, 1995. Such facility provides for
mandatory commitment reduction payments through December 31,
1999. The revolving credit facility permits CCT to borrow from
the banks to fund acquisitions of cable television systems and
for other general purposes, subject to compliance with the
restrictive covenants (including ratios of debt to cash flow and
cash flow to interest expense) contained in the loan agreement
governing the facility.

(g) Payable by Affiliated Regional Communications, Ltd. ("ARC").

The liability represents the final payment obligation due on
April 30, 1994, under an "Earnout Rights" agreement. The

contingent upon the operations from ARC's "DBS Business," as
defined in the agreement. On April 29, 1994, a subsidiary of
ARC entered into a $30 million credit facility with a bank. A
portion of that facility was utilized to repay the "Earnout
Rights" obligation.

The revolving credit facility provides for yearly extension
options at the request of HSN and is subject to the approval of
participating banks. At March 31, 1994, $40 million of the
senior revolving credit facility remains available.
Restrictions contained in the senior term loans and revolving
credit agreement include, but are not limited to, limitations on
the encumbrance and disposition of assets and the maintenance of
various financial covenants and ratios.

(8) PROMISSORY NOTES

CCT has a note payable to TCI of approximately $59 million, including
accrued interest, due January 1, 2000. The note bears interest at 8% per
annum. The note, net of payments made, is reflected as an addition to
minority interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
due to its related party nature. Additionally, CCT has approximately
$37 million, including accrued interest, in notes receivable from TCI
due January 1, 2000. The notes receivable earn interest at 11.6% per
annum. These notes receivable are reflected as a reduction of minority

________________________________________________________________________________

STOCK OPTION

The Company has an employment agreement with an officer (who is also a
director). Pursuant to this agreement, such officer was granted an
option to acquire 100,000 shares of Liberty Class B common stock at a
purchase price of $256 per share (reflects actual shares issued). The
employment agreement was amended and the option was exercised with cash
and a $25,500,000 note. This note bears interest at 7.54% per annum.
During October 1991, such officer tendered to the Company in partial
payment of such note 800,000 shares of TCI Class B common stock,
resulting in a net reduction of $12,195,000 in the amount payable under
the note.

The 100,000 shares issued by Liberty upon exercise of this option,
together with all subsequent dividends and distributions thereon,
including shares issued in the Stock Splits (collectively totaling
16,000,000 shares of Liberty Class B common stock and 200,000 shares of
Class E Preferred Stock at December 31, 1993, the "Option Units"), are
subject to repurchase by the Company under certain circumstances. The
Company's repurchase right will terminate as to 20% of the Option Units
per year, commencing March 28, 1992, and will terminate as to all of the
Option Units in the event of death, disability or under certain other
circumstances.

On October 24, 1992, said officer of the Company entered into a letter
agreement with respect to the timing and method of payment under the
promissory note and the release of the 200,000 shares of Class E
Preferred Stock from the collateral securing the promissory note. The
remaining principal balance on the note is approximately $14,500,000.
The next scheduled payment will be on October 24, 1994 in the principal
amount of approximately $4,300,000 plus interest accrued from December
31, 1993 to the payment date.

STOCK PLAN

The Company has a Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan") in order to
provide a special incentive to officers and other persons. Under the
Stock Plan, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock
and other awards valued by reference to, or that are otherwise based on,
the value of Class A common stock may be granted in respect to a maximum
of 40,000,000 shares of Class A common stock. Shares to be delivered
under the Stock Plan will be available from authorized but unissued
shares of Class A common stock or from shares of Class A common stock
reacquired by the Company. Shares of

Class A common stock that are subject to options or other awards that
terminate or expire unexercised will return to the pool of such shares
available for grant under the Stock Plan.

In June 1993, the Company granted an aggregate of 56,000 non-qualified
stock options with stock appreciation rights to certain officers and key
employees under the Stock Plan. Each option is exercisable for one
share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $19.08. The
options vest in five equal annual installments commencing June 3, 1994
and expire in June 2003. Estimates of compensation relating to these
stock options with stock appreciation rights have been recorded through
March 31, 1994, but are subject to future adjustments based upon market
value and, ultimately, on the final determination of market value when
the rights are exercised.

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

The Company has granted to certain of its officers stock appreciation
rights with respect to 2,240,000 shares of Liberty Class A common stock.
These rights have an adjusted strike price of $0.80 per share, become
exercisable and vest evenly over seven years. Stock appreciation rights
expire on March 28, 2001. Estimates of compensation relating to these
stock appreciation rights have been recorded through March 31, 1994, but
are subject to future adjustment based upon market value and,
ultimately, on the final determination of market value when the rights
are exercised. Stock appreciation rights with respect to 780,000 shares
have been exercised.

In 1993, the President of HSN received stock appreciation rights with
respect to 984,876 shares of HSN's common stock at an exercise price of
$8.25 per share. These rights vest over a four year period and are
exercisable until February 23, 2003. The stock appreciation rights will
vest upon termination of employment other than for cause and will be
exercisable for up to one year following the termination of employment.
In the event of a change in ownership control of HSN, all unvested stock
appreciation rights will vest immediately prior to the change in control
and shall remain exercisable for a one year period. Stock appreciation
rights not exercised will expire to the extent not exercised. These
rights may be exercised for cash or, so long as HSN is a public company,
for shares of HSN's common stock equal to the excess of the fair market
value of each share of common stock over $8.25 at the exercise date.
The stock appreciation rights also will vest in the event of death or
disability.

(10) TRANSACTIONS WITH TCI

Certain subsidiaries of Liberty produce and/or distribute sports and
other programming to cable television operators (including TCI) and
others. Charges to TCI are based upon customary rates charged to
others.

Certain subsidiaries of Liberty purchase, at TCI's cost plus an
administrative fee, certain pay television and other programming through
a subsidiary of TCI. In addition, HSN pays a commission to TCI for
merchandise sales to customers who are subscribers of TCI's cable
systems. Aggregate commissions and charges to TCI were approximately
$3,361,000 and $1,305,000 for the three months ended March 31, 1994 and
1993, respectively.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, DUE TO/FROM TCI,
PREPAID EXPENSES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED LIABILITIES, SALES RETURNS 
AND INCOME TAXES PAYABLE

The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments.

DEBT AND DEBT DUE TCI

The carrying amount approximates fair value.

PREFERRED STOCKS, SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION REQUIREMENTS

The fair values of the Company's preferred stocks subject to mandatory
redemption requirements were based on management's estimates. These
estimates were made by reference to the market values of other similar
publicly traded instruments. Neither independent external appraisals
nor dealer quotes were obtained. The estimated fair value of the
Company's preferred stocks subject to mandatory redemption at March 31,
1994 was $162,757,000.

LIMITATIONS

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on
relevant market information and information about the financial
instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot
be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly
affect the estimates.

(12) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

In February of 1991, the Company entered into an agreement with certain
of its stockholders which provides the Company the right upon the
occurrence of a "call triggering event" to require such persons to sell
the shares of Liberty common stock owned by them, and would provide such
persons the right upon the occurrence of a "put triggering event" to
sell their shares of Liberty common stock, in a registered public
offering or to one or more third parties selected by the Company. A
"call triggering event" consists of the issuance or adoption of a decree
by a governmental authority and the determination by an independent
committee of the Board of Directors that divestiture by any or all of
such persons of his or its Liberty common stock is necessary in order to
comply with the decree or is in the best interest of the Company in
light of material restrictions that would be imposed on the Company's
business absent such divestiture. A "put triggering event" consists of
the issuance or adoption of a decree by a governmental authority
requiring any or all of such persons to divest his or its shares of
Liberty common stock or TCI common stock or rendering such person's
continued ownership thereof illegal or subject to fine or penalty or
imposing material restrictions on such person's full rights of ownership
of such shares, provided that one of the essential facts giving rise to
such decree or that renders such decree applicable to such person is the
dual ownership by such person of voting securities of both the Company
and TCI. In each case, the Company would guarantee the sale price for
certain of the shares to be sold. The Company believes that it would
not be required to make any material payments in such event as the
Company anticipates that the aggregate proceeds derived from any sale of
such stock to the public or other third parties would approximate the
guaranteed sales price, before giving effect to any required tax
adjustment.

The guaranteed sale price for shares of Liberty common stock that
constitute "Covered Shares" (as defined) would be determined on the
basis of the proportionate share that such shares represent of the fair
market value of the Company on a going concern or liquidation value
basis (whichever method yields a higher valuation), subject to an upward

adjustment for taxes. If income taxes are payable by such persons with
respect to such sales, the amount of the adjustment would be
approximately $7.59 per share (assuming an effective tax rate of 37%
based on Federal and state income tax rates in effect on March 31, 1994
and a sale price of $20.50 per share based on the last reported sale
price for the Class A common stock on that date). In the aggregate,
41,162,880 shares of Liberty common stock are currently covered by the
agreement. The Company believes that the likelihood of the occurrence
of a put triggering event is remote.

Liberty leases business offices, has entered into pole rental agreements
and transponder lease agreements, and uses certain equipment under lease
arrangements. In addition, as of March 31, 1994, the Company had
long-term sports program rights contracts which require payments through
1998 aggregating approximately $38,818,000.

The Company is obligated to pay fees for the license to exhibit certain
qualifying films that are released theatrically by various motion
picture studios through December 31, 2006 (the "Film License
Obligations"). As of March 31, 1994, these agreements require minimum
payments aggregating approximately $178 million. The aggregate amount
of the Film License Obligations is not currently estimable because such
amount is dependent upon the number of qualifying films produced by the
motion picture studios, the amount of United States theatrical film
rentals for such qualifying films, and certain other factors.
Nevertheless, the Company's aggregate payments under the Film License
Obligations could prove to be significant.

(unaudited)

The following unaudited condensed pro forma balance sheet of TCI,
dated as of March 31, 1994, assumes that the proposed mergers (the "Mergers"),
whereby TCI and Liberty will each become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
TCI/Liberty, had occurred as of such date (see note 1).

In addition, the unaudited condensed pro forma statements of
operations of TCI for the three months ended March 31, 1994 and the year ended
December 31, 1993 assume that the proposed Mergers had occurred prior to
January 1, 1993.

The unaudited pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the
results of operations that would have been obtained if the Mergers had occurred
prior to January 1, 1993. These condensed pro forma financial statements of TCI
should be read in conjunction with the condensed unaudited pro forma financial
statements of Liberty and TCI/Liberty and the related notes thereto included
elsewhere herein and the respective historical financial statements and the
related notes thereto of TCI and Liberty. The pro forma financial statements
of TCI/Liberty represent a combination of the separate pro forma statements of
TCI and Liberty in giving effect to the proposed Mergers.

(1) Pursuant to the TCI/Liberty Agreement, the Mergers will be structured
as a tax free exchange whereby the common stock of TCI and Liberty and
the preferred stock of Liberty would be exchanged for like shares of
TCI/Liberty. The TCI/Liberty Agreement provides that each share of
TCI's and Liberty's common stock (including shares held by TCI's or
Liberty's subsidiaries) would be converted into one share and 0.975 of
a share, respectively, of the corresponding class of TCI/Liberty's
common stock. Any shares of Liberty preferred stock held by
subsidiaries of TCI or its subsidiaries shall be converted into shares
of a class or series of TCI/Liberty preferred stock having an
equivalent value. Shares of preferred stock of Liberty not owned by
TCI or its subsidiaries would be converted into shares of a preferred
stock of TCI/Liberty having designations, preferences, rights and
qualifications, limitations and restrictions similar to the shares of
preferred stock being converted.

into an investment in TCI/Liberty common stock and the conversion of
TCI's investment in Liberty preferred stock into an investment in
TCI/Liberty preferred stock having an equivalent value. Such amount
is reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity due to its related
party nature. Such conversion of shares is reflected at the carryover
basis of TCI's investment in Liberty.

(unaudited)

The following unaudited condensed pro forma balance sheet of Liberty,
as of March 31, 1994, assumes Liberty had changed its accounting for its
investment in QVC, Inc. ("QVC") to the cost method and that the sale by Liberty
of the 50% partnership interest in American Movie Classics Company ("AMC") had
occurred as of such date. Additionally, such balance sheet also assumes that
the Mergers, whereby TCI and Liberty will each become wholly-owned subsidiaries
of TCI/Liberty, had occurred as of such date.

In addition, unaudited condensed pro forma combined statements of
operations of Liberty for the three months ended March 31, 1994 and for the
year ended December 31, 1993 are included which assume the following had
occurred prior to January 1, 1993:

(a) the change in accounting for Liberty's investment in QVC to
the cost method,

(b) the sale by Liberty of its 50% partnership interest in AMC,

(c) the Recapitalization Agreement, as defined in note 11,

(d) the acquisition of 20 million shares of Class B common stock
of Home Shopping Network, Inc. ("HSN"),

(e) the Tender, as defined in note 12,

(f) the acquisition of all general and limited partnership
interests in Mile Hi Cablevision Associates, Ltd. ("Mile Hi")
as described in note 13,

(g) the conversion of all the outstanding shares (10,974 shares)
of Liberty's Class A Convertible Preferred Stock ("Class A
Preferred Stock") into 4,405,678 shares of Liberty Class A
common stock and 55,070 shares of Class E, 6% Cumulative
Redeemable Exchangeable Junior Preferred Stock ("Class E
Preferred Stock"), and

(h) the Mergers.

The unaudited pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the
results of operations that would have been obtained if the foregoing events had
actually occurred prior to January 1, 1993. These condensed pro forma combined
financial statements of Liberty should be read in conjunction with the

(unaudited)

(1) On September 16, 1993, Liberty announced that one of its subsidiaries
received notice from Rainbow Program Enterprises that Rainbow Program
Enterprises had elected to purchase Liberty's 50% partnership interest
in AMC under the terms of a buy/sell provision contained in the AMC
partnership agreement. A subsidiary of Liberty had initiated the
buy/sell procedure on August 1, 1993. Liberty expects to receive net
pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $170 million from the sale and
an additional $5 million from a buy-out of Liberty's consulting
agreement with AMC.

(2) On November 11, 1993, Liberty entered into an agreement with the staff
of the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to which Liberty agreed to
divest all of its equity interests in QVC during an 18 month time
period if QVC was successful in its offer to buy Paramount
Communications, Inc. ("Paramount") and not to vote or otherwise
exercise or influence control over QVC until such time as QVC withdrew
its offer for Paramount. Simultaneously, Liberty agreed to withdraw
from a stockholders agreement pursuant to which Liberty and certain
other stockholders exercised control over QVC (the "Stockholders'
Agreement"). On February 15, 1994, QVC terminated its offer for
Paramount. Upon termination of such offer, Liberty had the right to
be reinstated as a party to the Stockholders' Agreement so long as
such option was exercised within 90 days after such termination.

On November 16, 1993, Liberty sold 1,690,041 shares of common stock of
QVC to Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") for aggregate consideration of
approximately $31,461,000. The sale to Comcast reduced Liberty's
interest in QVC common stock (on a fully diluted basis) from 21.6% to
18.5%. Liberty continued to account for its investment in QVC under
the equity method, although it no longer exercised significant control
over such affiliate, due to the pending determination of whether the
Company would rejoin the control group under the Stockholders'
Agreement. As a result of the election on May 13, 1994 by Liberty to
forego the exercise of its option to be reinstated as a party to the
Stockholders' Agreement, Liberty will now account for its investment
in QVC under the cost method.

(3) Represents assumed cash received from the sale of the 50% partnership
interest in AMC by Liberty, pursuant to the terms of the buy/sell
provision contained in the AMC partnership agreement (see note 1), and
the corresponding increase in investment in affiliates, payables and
accruals, and common stockholders' equity. Such increase in
investment in affiliates is due to a negative balance in Liberty's
carrying value due to distributions in excess of Liberty's basis in
such investment. The increase in payables and accruals represents the
estimated current income taxes payable on the sale. Increase in
deferred income taxes represents the reversal of the temporary
difference resulting from basis for income tax purposes in excess of
basis for financial statement purposes. The increase in common
stockholders' equity is due to the difference between Liberty's
carrying value of such investment and the purchase price of the same
reduced by the estimated income tax effect. Such assumed gain
($181,819,000) is not reflected in the pro forma combined statement of
operations due to its non-recurring nature.

(4) Pursuant to the TCI/Liberty Agreement, the Mergers will be structured
as a tax free exchange whereby the common stock of TCI and Liberty and
the preferred stock of Liberty would be exchanged for like shares of
TCI/Liberty. The TCI/Liberty Agreement provides that each share of
TCI's and Liberty's common stock (including shares held by TCI's and
Liberty's subsidiaries) would be converted into one share and 0.975 of
a share, respectively, of the corresponding class of TCI/Liberty's
common stock. Any shares of Liberty preferred stock held by TCI or
its subsidiaries shall be converted into shares of a class or series
of TCI/Liberty preferred stock having an equivalent value. Shares of
preferred stock of Liberty not owned by TCI, Liberty or their
respective subsidiaries would be converted into shares of a preferred
stock of TCI/Liberty having designations, preferences, rights and
qualifications, limitations and restrictions similar to the shares of
preferred stock being converted. Adjustment represents the conversion
of Liberty's investment in TCI common stock into an investment in
TCI/Liberty common stock. Such amount is reflected as a reduction of
stockholders' equity due to its related party nature. Such conversion
of shares is reflected at the carryover basis of Liberty's investment
in TCI.

(5) Represents the recognition of unrealized appreciation, net of taxes,
for Liberty's investment in QVC (an investment in equity securities
determined to be available-for-sale). See note 2.

(6) Reflects the elimination of the historical preferred stock of Liberty
held by TCI or its subsidiaries. Such historical preferred stock of
Liberty will be converted into TCI/Liberty preferred stock having an
equivalent value. See note 4.

(7) Elimination of share of earnings of QVC.

(8) Elimination of share of earnings of AMC.

(9) Estimated income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments.

(10) Reflects the elimination of the preferred stock dividend requirement
on Liberty preferred stock assumed to be converted into preferred
stock of TCI/Liberty. See note 4.

(11) On June 3, 1993, Liberty completed the transaction contemplated by the
Recapitalization Agreement entered into on March 26, 1993 with certain
subsidiaries of TCI (such transaction is included in the Liberty
historical column of the pro forma balance sheet). Pursuant to the
Recapitalization Agreement, Liberty purchased 100% of the outstanding
shares of its Class C Redeemable, Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the
"Class C Preferred Stock") and 927,900 shares of its Class A common
stock. Liberty paid a purchase price of approximately $175 million
for the Class C Preferred stock and approximately $19 million for the
Class A common stock. The aggregate purchase price of approximately
$194 million was satisfied by delivery of $12 million in cash and four
promissory notes totaling $182 million. In the accompanying unaudited
condensed pro forma statements of operations, the preferred stock
dividend requirement on such purchased preferred stock has been
eliminated.

(12) On February 11, 1993, Liberty acquired from RMS Limited Partnership
20,000,000 shares of Class B common stock (the "Class B Stock") of HSN
for an aggregate purchase price of $58 million in cash and 8,000,000
shares of the Class A common stock of Liberty. Additionally, on June
1, 1993, Liberty completed the purchase of approximately 16 million
shares of the common stock ("Common Stock") of HSN at a price of $7.00
per share (the "Tender"). In addition, Liberty had acquired Common
Stock of HSN previous to the acquisition of the Class B Stock (such
transactions are included in the Liberty historical column of the pro
forma balance sheet).

(13) On March 15, 1993, Mile Hi Cable Partners, L.P. ("New Mile Hi")
completed the acquisition (the "Acquisition") of all the general and
limited partnership interests in Mile Hi, the owner of the cable
television system serving Denver, Colorado (such acquisition is
included in the Liberty historical column of the pro forma balance
sheet). New Mile Hi is a limited partnership formed among Community
Cable Television ("CCT") (78% limited partnership interest), Daniels
Communications, Inc. ("DCI") (1% limited partnership interest) and P &
B Johnson Corp. (21% general partnership interest), a corporation
controlled by Robert L. Johnson, a member of the Board of Directors of
Liberty. CCT is a general partnership in which a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Liberty is a 50.001% partner and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of TCI is a 49.999% partner. New Mile Hi is a consolidated
subsidiary of Liberty for financial reporting purposes.

Prior to the Acquisition, Liberty, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
indirectly owned a 32.175% interest in Mile Hi through its ownership
of a limited partnership interest in Daniels & Associates Partners
Limited ("DAPL"), one of Mile Hi's general partners.

DAPL was liquidated on March 12, 1993, at which time a subsidiary of
Liberty (and partner in DAPL) received a liquidating distribution
consisting of a portion of DAPL's partnership interest in Mile Hi
representing the 32.175% interest in Mile Hi and a loan receivable of
approximately $50 million (the "Mile Hi Note").

Of the $110 million in cash required by New Mile Hi to complete the
transaction, $105 million was loaned to New Mile Hi by CCT and $5
million was provided by Mr. Johnson's corporation as a capital
contribution to New Mile Hi. Of the $5 million contributed by Mr.
Johnson's corporation, approximately $4 million was provided by CCT
through loans to Mr. Johnson and trusts for the benefit of his
children. CCT funded its loans to New Mile Hi and the Johnson
interests by drawing down $93 million under its revolving credit
facility and by borrowing $16 million from TCI in the form of a
subordinated note.
