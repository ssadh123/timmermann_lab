HASBRO, INC. ANNOUNCES REVENUES AND 
EARNINGS FOR SECOND QUARTER 1994

Pawtucket, RI (July 14, 1994) -- Hasbro, Inc. (HAS:ASE) today reported 
results for its second quarter ended June 26, 1994.

Revenues were $444,324,000, a decrease from the $515,551,000 reported in 
the second quarter of 1993. Net earnings for the quarter were $1,634,000, down 
from the $27,150,000 reported last year. Earnings per share were $.02 compared 
to $.30 a year ago. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
was 89,836,000 compared to 89,926,000 a year earlier. 

For the year to date, revenues totaled $933,457,000, a 7% decrease from 
the $1,002,587,000 in 1993. Earnings before accounting change for the six 
months were $28,351,000, or $.32 per share, compared to the $53,730,000, or 
$.60 per share a year ago. Net earnings and earnings per share for the six 
months, after an accounting change recorded in the first quarter of 1994, were 
$24,069,000 and $.27, respectively. The weighted average number of shares 
outstanding was 89,968,000 for the first six months of 1994 and 89,783,000 for 
the same period of 1993.

"Our results this quarter are consistent with those indicated on June 
16", said Alan G. Hassenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

"As anticipated, many of our international units grew from their second 
quarter 1993 levels despite being adversely impacted by the effect of the 
strengthened U.S. dollar", he continued. "Domestically, however, the record 
levels of 1993 revenues, helped by the mid-quarter introduction of our Jurassic 
Park(TM) and Barney(R) products, could not be sustained. As noted in our 
earlier announcement, data from several of our larger customers indicates that 
purchases of our products by consumers are ahead of 1993 levels which leads us 
to believe that retailers will place a greater percentage of their orders for 
immediate delivery during the second half of the year, specifically for 
shipment during the fourth quarter."

Mr. Hassenfeld concluded by noting, "With the new joint venture we are 
forming with Connector Set Limited Partnership to distribute the K'NEX(R) line 
of construction toys internationally, the soon to be completed acquisition of 
the game and puzzle business of Western Publishing and the new products and 
relationships which we have under contract and development, we are enthusiastic 
about 1995 and beyond."
