REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Grand Valley Gas Company and Subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Grand Valley 
Gas Company (a Utah corporation) and subsidiaries as of May 31, 1993 and 1992,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and 
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 1993. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of Grand Valley Gas Company and 
subsidiaries as of May 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations 
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 
1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Mesquite Pipeline Company (collectively, the "Company"). Mesquite Pipeline 
Company was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grand Valley Gathering 
Company during the year ended May 31, 1993. All significant intercompany 
account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company is primarily engaged in natural gas marketing. The Company also 
owns natural gas gathering and processing facilities and interests in 
developed oil and gas leaseholds.

The Company participates in various joint venture partnerships with ownership 
percentages ranging from 21 to 49 percent. The investments in these joint 
venture partnerships are accounted for using the equity method.

Property, Plant and Equipment
- - -----------------------------

Expenditures that materially increase asset lives are capitalized at cost 
while normal maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When assets are
retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income.

Property, plant and equipment (other than developed oil and gas leaseholds) 
are depreciated using accelerated and straight-line methods over the following
estimated useful lives:

<TABLE> 
<CAPTION> 
Years
-----
<S> <C> 
Gas gathering and compression equipment 7 to 10
Gas processing plant 10
Furniture and equipment 2 to 7
</TABLE> 

Depreciation and depletion of developed oil and gas leaseholds is based on the
units of production method using estimated proved oil and gas reserves.

Intangible Assets
- - -----------------

Cost in excess of fair market value of net assets acquired has been recorded 
in connection with the acquisition of Centennial and Burton Flats (see Note 
3). The amounts recorded are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 
periods of 20 and 10 years, respectively. Amortization for fiscal years 1993 
and 1992 was $197,733 and $156,060, respectively.

Notes Receivable from Related Parties
- - -------------------------------------

During the year ended May 31, 1993 in connection with the exercise of certain 
stock options, which provided the Company an income tax benefit (see Note 5) 
and positive cash flow, the Company loaned $499,000 to three officers and one 
key employee of the Company who are also stock-holders. The notes bear 
interest at an annual rate of nine percent, are due at the earlier of 90 days 
after termination of employment or January 15, 1995 and are secured by certain
shares of the Company's common stock.

Net Income Per Common Share
- - ---------------------------

Net income per common share is calculated using the weighted average number of
common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the years. Common 
equivalent shares consist of certain stock options, which have a dilutive 
effect when applying the treasury stock method. Total weighted average number
of shares were 6,383,803, 6,287,584 and 6,340,158 for fiscal years 1993, 1992 
and 1991, respectively.

Primary and fully diluted net income per share are essentially equivalent.

Revenue Recognition
- - -------------------

The Company recognizes revenue on gas sales when the market takes possession 
of gas delivered at the contracted point of delivery. Revenue for services is
recognized at the time the service is performed.

Cash Equivalents and Supplemental Noncash Investing Activities
- - --------------------------------------------------------------

For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company 
considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three 
months or less to be cash equivalents.

As discussed in Note 3, the Company acquired all of the common stock of 
Centennial during the year ended May 31, 1992. In conjunction with this 
acquisition, the Company paid $1,950,000 in cash, issued notes payable 
totaling $1,950,000, acquired assets totaling $4,768,014 and assumed 
liabilities totaling $4,316,285. During the year ended May 31, 1993, the 
Company received $2,712,014 of income tax benefit from the exercise of 
nonqualified stock options (see Note 5).

Income Taxes
- - ------------

The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") has issued Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income 
Taxes." SFAS No. 109 supersedes SFAS No. 96 and is required to be adopted in 
the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year 1994. The Company has 
previously adopted SFAS No. 96, and, therefore, the impact of adopting SFAS 
No. 109 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's 
consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with SFAS No. 96, the Company recognizes a liability or asset 
for the deferred tax consequences of all temporary differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated
financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in 
future years when the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities are 
recovered or settled.

Postretirement Benefits
- - -----------------------

SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than 
Pensions," was issued by the FASB in December 1990. The Company does not have
any obligation to pay postretirement benefits to its employees and therefore 
SFAS No. 106 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's 
consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications
- - -----------------

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' consolidated 
financial statements to conform with the current year's presentation.

(2) INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURE PARTNERSHIPS
-----------------------------------------

The Company accounts for its investments in joint venture partnerships using 
the equity method. During the year ended May 31, 1993, the Company recorded 
$120,372 of net earnings in excess of cash distributions received from these 
investments. During the year ended May 31, 1992, the Company received $12,110
of cash distributions in excess of net earnings of the investments as 
accounted for by the equity method.

$74,000.

Greenwood Gas Gathering System
- - ------------------------------

Effective December 1, 1991, the Company purchased a 25.7 percent interest in 
the Greenwood Gas Gathering System Joint Venture for $125,669. The joint 
venture operates a natural gas pipeline and gas gathering system located in 
Morton County, Kansas. During the year ended May 31, 1993, the Company's 
portion of the joint venture's net loss was $57,455. With the completion of 
the Richfield Gas Storage System, this system will become an integral part of 
the interconnect system with interstate pipelines.

Post Street Electric & Steam Company
- - ------------------------------------

In January 1992, the Company entered into a partnership agreement with two 
unrelated companies to develop, construct and operate a natural gas-fired, 
combined-cycle cogeneration power project to be located in Seattle, 
Washington. The Company acquired a 45 percent interest in the partnership for
$2,755.

As of May 31, 1993, the project is in the development stage and has not 
generated revenue since its inception. The Company has agreed to make cash 
capital contributions up to a maximum of $3.3 million at such times and in 
such amounts as determined by the partners. The Company has incurred certain 
expenditures in connection with the development of the project and is entitled
to be reimbursed for the expenditures by the partnership. As of May 31, 1993,
the Company had advanced a total of approximately $290,000, exclusive of 
interest, to fund its portion of the project. The Company has also 
established a reserve of $200,000 against its advances due to uncertainties 
related to the project. Accordingly, as of May 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company
has a net receivable of approximately $90,000 and $172,000, respectively, due 
from this partnership.

(3) ACQUISITIONS
------------

Centennial
- - ----------

Effective August 12, 1991, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares 
of common stock of Centennial.

Centennial's business includes natural gas marketing, gathering and 
processing. At the acquisition date, Centennial held interests in four natural
gas processing and/or gathering facilities with aggregate throughout capacity 
of more than 35 million cubic feet per day.

F-13
<PAGE>

- 7 -

These facilities are located in Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. Centennial is the
operator of three of the facilities and markets natural gas and natural gas 
liquids produced from the processing facilities.

The Company paid $3,900,000 for the Centennial shares by delivering $1,950,000
in cash, and promissory notes in the amount of $1,950,000, which bore interest
at the rate of eight percent per annum until they were paid on August 12, 1992
and December 30, 1992.

In conjunction with the acquisition of Centennial, the Company entered into 
employment agreements (subsequently amended) with existing employees and 
consultants of Centennial, and issued 30,000 common shares and granted options
to acquire up to an additional 126,000 common shares at an exercise price of 
$.0125 per share to these individuals. Deferred compensation expense of 
approximately $1,242,000 was recorded in connection with the granting of these
options. The expense related to the deferred compensation is being recognized 
ratably as the employees and consultants vest in the stock and as restrictions
lapse through fiscal year 1995. The right to fully exercise these options is 
dependent upon continued service to the Company.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the net
assets and liabilities of Centennial have been recorded at their estimated 
fair market value at the date of acquisition. The cost in excess of fair market
value of the net assets acquired of approximately $3,448,000 is being amortized
on a straight-line basis over 20 years. Centennial's results of operations are
included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of 
acquisition. 

Unaudited pro forma consolidated revenues, net income and net income per common
share of Grand Valley Gas Company and Centennial for the fiscal year ended May
31, 1991 are approximately $131,201,000, $3,600,000 and $.55, respectively. 
This information is presented as though the companies had combined their 
operations at the beginning of fiscal year 1991, after giving effect to certain
adjustments, including amortization of cost in excess of fair market value of 
net assets acquired, interest expense on acquisition debt, compensation expense
on stock grants, and the impact on net income per share related to the issuance
of stock options. The pro forma information does not necessarily represent the
results which would have occurred if the transaction had taken place on the date
assumed nor is it indicative of the results of future operations.

Acquisition of Assets of Burton Flats
- - -------------------------------------

Effective March 1, 1992, the Company acquired a gas gathering system, gas 
processing plant and treating facility located in New Mexico, collectively 
referred to as "Burton Flats." Burton Flats consists of 51 miles of pipeline 
and a 15 million cubic feet per day natural gas gathering and processing 
facility. The purchase price of these assets was $4,675,000. The cost in excess
of fair value of net assets acquired of approximately $253,000 is being 
amortized on a straight-line basis over ten years.

(4) CONVERTIBLE SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES PAYABLE
---------------------------------------------

On December 30, 1992, the Company sold $10 million of convertible senior 
subordinated notes in a private placement transaction. The notes bear interest
at a rate of nine percent per annum with interest payments due semiannually in
arrears and with principal payable in $1,250,000 annual installments beginning 
on December 15, 1997 and continuing through December 15, 2003. The entire 
unpaid principal amount of the notes is due on December 15, 2004. The Company 
may prepay the notes after December 15, 1997 by paying a premium approximately
equivalent to the difference in the present value of (1) the remaining cash 
stream from the notes and (2) the cash stream from the then current equivalent
maturity treasury obligation plus 0.50 percent. In the event the average of 
the bid and asked prices of the Company's common stock equals or exceeds 
$16.08 per share for twenty consecutive trading days, the Company may, at its 
option, prepay the notes with no premium.

The note agreements contain certain restrictive covenants with respect to the 
operations of the Company, including the maintenance of minimum net worth and 
debt service coverage. The Company is in compliance with all restrictive 
covenants. The notes are convertible at the option of the purchasers into an 
aggregate of 963,856 shares of the common stock of the Company (reflecting a 
conversion price of $10.375 per share). This conversion right also contains 
various antidilution provisions, including an adjustment to the conversion 
price of the Company's common stock if the Company issues shares at less than 
the then current market price. The Company has reserved and will keep 
available the appropriate number of authorized shares of common stock for 
purposes of this conversion.

During the year ended May 31, 1993, the Company received $2,712,014 of income 
tax benefit from the exercise of nonqualified stock options. The benefit has 
been recorded as a reduction in income taxes payable and an increase in 
additional paid-in capital.

The deferred tax provision results from temporary differences in the 
recognition of revenues and expenses for income tax and financial reporting 
purposes. The source of significant temporary differences and the tax effects of
each for fiscal years 1993, 1992 and 1991 are as follows:

The Company has a foreign tax credit carryforward for tax and financial 
reporting purposes of approximately $47,000 at May 31, 1993. This credit 
carryforward will expire May 31, 1997.

(6) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
-----------------------------

On April 16, 1993, TransMarketing Houston, Inc., a natural gas sales customer 
of the Company, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code.

The balance owed by this customer for gas purchases totaled approximately 
$889,000. The ultimate realization of this amount will be determined in the 
bankruptcy proceedings. However, in recognition of the uncertainty of 
collection and the Company's unsecured position as a creditor, the Company has
established an allowance for this doubtful account of $700,000.

F-17
<PAGE>

- 11 -

Revolving Credit Agreement 
- - -------------------------- 

The Company has a revolving credit agreement with a bank which provides a 
maximum total commitment of $15,000,000. The commitment includes working 
capital and letter of credit borrowing capacity of $10,000,000, and a 
borrowing capacity specifically designated for short-term financing of capital
expenditures of $5,000,000.

Loans under the $10,000,000 commitment bear interest at the bank's base rate 
plus 3/4 percent. Loans under the $5,000,000 commitment bear interest at the 
bank's base rate plus one percent. The bank's base rate was six percent at 
May 31, 1993. These commitments expire March 1, 1994, but provide for an 
additional two-year repayment schedule for amounts outstanding under the 
$5,000,000 commitment at the bank's base rate plus 1-3/8 percent. These loans
are collateralized by personal and real property of the Company. The Company 
is required to pay an annual fee of 1/2 percent on the unused commitment. 

The revolving credit agreement contains certain affirmative and negative 
covenants, including the maintenance of specific financial ratios. During 
fiscal year 1993, the Company was not in compliance with covenants relating to
the issuance of the Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes Payable and the 
purchase of treasury stock. However, the Company received timely waivers from
the bank related to these specific transactions.

During fiscal year 1993, the Company borrowed $2,500,000 under the credit 
agreement over a period of 75 days. As of May 31, 1993, no borrowings were 
outstanding under the credit agreement; however, there were 11 outstanding 
letters of credit totaling $5,688,912 guaranteeing performance to certain 
customers. 

Gas Purchase and Sales Contracts
- - ---------------------------------

The Company attempts to minimize the commodity risk of natural gas prices by 
obtaining matching commitments under its natural gas purchase contracts and 
natural gas sales contracts with terms greater than one month or by using 
natural gas futures and basis swaps to hedge what would otherwise be open 
price risks. In addition to numerous index based natural gas purchase/sales 
contracts, as of May 31, 1993 the Company has total fixed price purchase 
contracts for 44,520,000 MMBtu which includes 40,290,000 MMBtu of purchase 
contracts and 4,230,000 MMBtu under futures contracts. Total fixed price 
sales contracts as of May 31, 1993 amounted to 42,376,000 MMBtu including 
40,936,000 MMBtu of sales contracts and 1,440,000 MMBtu of futures contracts.

Federal and State Regulations
- - -----------------------------

The purchase and sale of natural gas and the fees received for gathering and 
processing by the Company generally are not subject to regulation. Many 
aspects of the production, transportation and marketing of natural gas, 
however, are subject to regulations that can have a significant impact upon 
the Company's overall operations.

F-18

<PAGE>

As a gatherer, processor and marketer of natural gas, the Company is dependent
on the transportation and storage services offered by various pipeline 
companies. Both the performance of transportation and storage services by 
these pipeline companies and the rates charged for their services are subject 
to the jurisdiction of FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, and the Natural
Gas Policy Act of 1978. The availability of interstate transportation and
storage services necessary to enable the Company to make deliveries or sales
of gas at times may be preempted by other system users in accordance with FERC-
approved methods for allocating the system capacity of "open-access"
pipelines. Moreover, the rates charged by pipeline companies for such services
are often subject to negotiation within FERC-established ranges and
periodically vary depending upon a variety of factors. Any inability to obtain
transportation or storage services at competitive rates could hinder the
Company's marketing operations.

Operating Leases
- - ----------------

The Company leases various facilities under long-term noncancellable operating
leases with minimum annual lease commitments as follows:

Year Ending May 31, Amount
------------------- ---------- 

1994 $244,592
1995 235,825
1996 232,315
1997 168,009
--------

$880,741
========

Rental expense from operating leases totaled approximately $219,000, $118,000
and $76,000 during fiscal years 1993, 1992 and 1991.

Employment Agreements
- - ---------------------

The Company has entered into employment agreements with the president, executive
vice president and vice presidents of the Company which expire at various dates
through August 1996. The agreements set forth base salaries and other benefits
for the period of employment.

The Company has also entered into employment agreements with key employees and
consultants of Centennial (see Note 3). These agreements have terms ranging
from four to six years. The agreements set forth base salaries and other
benefits, and contain noncompetition clauses for the period of employment as
well as two years subsequent thereto.

(7) STOCK OPTIONS AND INCENTIVE STOCK AWARDS
----------------------------------------

During fiscal year 1992, the Company established the 1992 Stock Option Plan 
(the "Plan"). Options granted under the Plan may be either incentive or 
nonincentive as designated by the Plan Committee.

F-19

<PAGE>

- 13 -

Incentive stock options must be granted at not less than 100 percent of the 
market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Nonincentive stock 
options are granted at prices determined by the Plan Committee.

The Plan provides for the issuance of options for a total of 200,000 shares of
common stock. Incentive stock options may not be exercised after ten years 
from the date of grant. Nonincentive stock options are subject to exercise 
terms as determined by the Plan Committee at the date granted. Previous to the
establishment of the Plan, the Company granted nonincentive stock options to 
officers, directors, key employees and consultants. Stock option activity for 
fiscal years 1993, 1992 and 1991 consisted of the following:

<TABLE>

--------- ---------------
<S> <C> <C> 
Options outstanding at May 31, 1990 1,068,000 $0.125 to $1.00

Granted 16,800 $8.50 to $8.63
Exercised (86,125) $0.013 to $6.88
Canceled (875) $6.88
---------

Options outstanding at May 31, 1993 98,800 $ 0.013 to $8.63
=========
</TABLE> 

As of May 31, 1993, options to purchase 14,900 shares of common stock were 
exercisable. The remaining options become exercisable at various dates and in 
varying amounts through November 1996.

Compensation expense (the difference between the fair market value and the 
exercise price at the date of grant) is deferred and amortized over the future
periods to be benefited. Certain of these option agreements include 
restrictions which allow the Company to repurchase shares at the exercise 
price if the employee terminates employment prior to a specified item period 
ranging from 24 to 48 months from the exercise date.

At May 31, 1993, 180,100 common shares are subject to such restrictions. These
restrictions lapse at various dates and in varying amounts through October 
1996. Options to purchase 71,000 common shares at May 31, 1993 are subject to 
similar restrictions once exercised.

The Company has agreed to issue up to 45,000 shares of common stock as 
incentive stock awards to its employees in connection with certain

F-20
<PAGE>

- 14 -

asset acquisitions. The shares are issued in part upon acquisition of assets 
and the remaining shares are to be issued when the assets acquired achieve 
payout. In connection with the above agreements, as of May 31, 1993, the 
Company has issued 6,446 shares as incentive stock awards.

(8) SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND FOREIGN REVENUES
------------------------------------------

During fiscal years 1993, 1992 and 1991, sales to a single customer accounted 
for approximately 11 percent, 11 percent and 15 percent of total revenues, 
respectively. No other single customer accounted for more than ten percent of 
total revenues during any of the three fiscal years presented.

During fiscal years 1993, 1992 and 1991, revenues from foreign sources 
(Canada) were approximately $23,889,000, $23,023,000 and $24,050,000, 
respectively.

(9) PENSION PLAN
------------

The Company sponsors a Simplified Employee Pension Plan (the "Plan"). 
Employees who have completed nine months of service are eligible to 
participate in the Plan. As approved by the Board of Directors, the Plan 
provides for contributions equal to three percent of income before taxes and 
bonuses. During fiscal years 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company made 
contributions of $187,013, $178,094 and $141,614.

(10) BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

GRAND VALLEY GAS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

1. Description of Business and Operations
--------------------------------------

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Grand Valley Gas
Company and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (Grand Valley 
Gathering Company, Centennial Storage Corporation, GV Power Corporation and 
Mesquite Pipeline Company) and an indirect majority-owned joint venture 
(Richfield Gas Storage System). Collectively, these entities are referred to 
as the "Company". On July 1, 1993, Centennial Storage Corporation acquired an
additional interest in Richfield Gas Storage System ("Richfield") bringing 
total ownership to 51.5 percent. As a result, Richfield has been consolidated
with the Company's financial statements as of July 1, 1993.

The Company is primarily engaged in natural gas marketing. The Company also 
owns natural gas gathering, processing, and storage facilities and interests 
in developed oil and gas leaseholds.

The Company participates in various joint venture partnerships with ownership 
percentages ranging from 21 percent to 37 percent. The investments in these 
joint venture partnerships are accounted for using the equity method.

2. Financial Statements
--------------------

The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 1993,
and the condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the 
three months ended August 31, 1993 and 1992 have been prepared by the Company,
and are not audited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary 
for fair presentation have been included. These financial statements are 
condensed and therefore, do not include all disclosures normally required by 
generally accepted accounting principles.

These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual 
financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 1993. The accompanying 
consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the 
results to be generated for the remainder of fiscal year 1994.

<PAGE>

3. Net Income Per Common Share
---------------------------

Net income per common share is calculated based on the weighted average number
of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during the periods. 
Common equivalent shares consist of certain stock options which have a 
dilutive effect when applying the treasury stock method.

Primary and fully diluted net income per common share are essentially the 
same.

4. Stock Options and Incentive Stock Awards
----------------------------------------

During the three months ended August 31, 1993, the Company issued to certain 
employees qualified stock options to purchase a total of 125,000 common 
shares. These options are exercisable at prices ranging from $5.25 to $6.00 
per share.

During the three months ended August 31, 1992, the Company issued to an 
employee qualified stock options to purchase a total of 3,000 common shares. 
These options are exercisable at $8.50 per share.

During the three months ended August 31, 1992, options to purchase 42,800 
common shares were exercised at prices ranging from $.0125 to $1.00 per share.

No options were exercised during the three months ended August 31, 1993.

5. Reclassifications
-----------------

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period's condensed 
consolidated financial statements to conform with the current period's 
presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income, total 
assets, total liabilities or stockholders' equity.

6. Income Taxes
------------

For the three months ended August 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company provided for 
income taxes based upon the estimated annualized effective tax rate.

Effective June 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109"). The 
adoption of SFAS No. 109 had no effect on pretax income or net income for the 
three months ended August 31, 1993. The Company has classified the net 
current and noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with 
SFAS No. 109 which at August 31, 1993 included a current deferred tax asset of
$458,127 and a deferred tax liability of $597,829.

The components of and the changes in the net deferred tax assets and 
liabilities for the period ended August 31, 1993 are as follows:

======== ======== ========
</TABLE> 

7. Acquisitions
------------

On July 1, 1993, the Company increased its ownership in Richfield from 48.5 
percent to 51.5 percent. The Company paid $100,000 in cash and assumed an 
obligation to Richfield for $209,096. The accounts of Richfield have been 
consolidated with those of the Company since July 1, 1993. Prior to that 
time, the investment in Richfield was accounted for under the equity method. 
Pro forma financial information assuming Richfield had been consolidated are 
as follows:

<TABLE>

Noncurrent liabilities 14,584,315 

</TABLE> 

For the three month period ended August 31, 1992, Richfield was under 
construction and did not generate income or expense and thus, there is no 
change in revenues or expenses on a pro forma basis.

8. Contingency
-----------

The Company has contracted for firm transportation capacity of 12,560 MMBtu 
per day on the interstate pipeline operated by Northwest Pipeline Corporation 
("Northwest"). This transportation commitment was obtained in conjunction 
with an expansion of Northwest's existing facilities.

In a June 1992 order authorizing the Northwest expansion, the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission ("FERC") stipulated that the mechanism for establishing 
transportation rates on the expansion capacity would be based on "rolled-in" 
rate base treatment. This treatment would require the cost of the expansion 
and additional operating costs to be accumulated with those of the 
pre-existing facilities to establish a blended cost of service for all 
shippers. The FERC further stipulated that Northwest must provide a showing in
its next general rate case that would substantiate the applicability of 
"rolled-in" rate treatment to Northwest's specific circumstance.

Northwest established transportation rates, subject to refund, pursuant to 
its general rate case filed on October 1, 1992, that became effective on April
1, 1993. Several parties, primarily natural gas producers with production in 
the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, intervened in the rate case proceedings
opposing the "rolled-in" rate treatment on the bases that (1) Northwest had 
failed to make a proper showing as to the applicability of this treatment, and
(2)"rolled-in" treatment provides a subsidy by traditional shippers to those 
shippers obtaining the newer expansion capacity. Additionally, the staff of 
the FERC took the position that Northwest failed to substantiate the 
applicability of "rolled-in" rate treatment to its specific circumstance. 

Settlement conferences were convened in the months of May, July, August and 
September of 1993 in an attempt to settle the rate case. The staff of the 
FERC stated during these settlement conferences that it would not oppose a 
settlement that included rolled-in rates as long as no intervening party 
objected. Additionally, the intervening San Juan Basin natural gas producers 
withdrew their entire testimony opposing "rolled-in" treatment.

Nonetheless, the parties in the rate case failed to reach a settlement and the
case went to hearing on September 28, 1993. The FERC will make a decision as 
to the appropriate rate design for the Northwest system expansion based on the
outcome of this hearing and will determine whether the rate treatment will be 
applied retroactively or prospectively. 

Management believes that it is probable that a "rolled-in" rate design will 
ultimately be approved with no adverse impact to the Company. The financial 
impact of an unfavorable rate determination by the FERC would depend on 
whether the resulting rates are applied retroactively or prospectively. In 
the event that the FERC were to rule against "rolled-in" rate treatment and 
take what appears to be unprecedented action to apply this type of ruling 
retroactively, management estimates that additional expense would total 
approximately $50,000 to $80,000 per month for the period April 1, 1993 
through August 31, 1993.

GRAND VALLEY GAS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

1. Description of Business and Operations
--------------------------------------

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Grand Valley Gas
Company and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (Grand Valley 
Gathering Company, Centennial Storage Corporation, GV Power Corporation and 
Mesquite Pipeline Company) and an indirect majority-owned joint venture 
(Richfield Gas Storage System)("Richfield"). Collectively, these entities are
referred to as the "Company". On July 1, 1993, Centennial Storage Corporation 
acquired an additional interest in Richfield bringing total ownership to 51.5 
percent. On October 21, 1993, Grand Valley Gathering Company acquired all 
remaining interests in GQ Joint Venture ("GQ") retroactively effective to July
1, 1993. As a result, the accounts of Richfield and GQ have been consolidated
with the Company's financial statements as of July 1, 1993.

The Company is primarily engaged in natural gas marketing. The Company also 
owns natural gas gathering, processing, and storage facilities and interests 
in developed oil and gas leaseholds.

The Company has a 37 percent ownership interest in the Tecumseh joint venture 
partnership. The investment in this joint venture partnership is accounted 
for using the equity method.

2. Financial Statements
--------------------

The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 1993,
and the condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the 
three and six months ended November 30, 1993 and 1992 have been prepared by 
the Company, and are not audited. In the opinion of management, all 
adjustments necessary for fair presentation have been included. These 
financial statements are condensed and therefore, do not include all 
disclosures normally required by generally accepted accounting principles.

7
<PAGE>

These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual 
financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 1993. The accompanying 
consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the 
results to be generated for the remainder of fiscal year 1994.

3. Net Income Per Common Share
---------------------------

Net income per common share is calculated based on the weighted average 
number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during the 
periods. Common equivalent shares consist of certain stock options which have
a dilutive effect when applying the treasury stock method. 

Primary and fully diluted net income per common share are essentially the 
same.

4. Stock Options and Incentive Stock Awards
----------------------------------------

During the six months ended November 30, 1993, the Company granted to certain 
employees qualified stock options to purchase a total of 125,000 common 
shares. These options are exercisable at prices ranging from $5.25 to $6.00 
per share, which prices were equivalent to the quoted market price of the 
Company's stock on the grant dates.

During the six months ended November 30, 1993, the Company granted 16,840 
shares of common stock to directors and employees which resulted in $107,000 
of compensation to be expensed over the applicable service period.

During the six months ended November 30, 1993, options to purchase 31,681 
shares were exercised at a price of $.0125.

During the six months ended November 30, 1992, the Company issued to certain 
employees qualified stock options to purchase a total of 16,800 common shares 
exercisable at prices ranging from $8.50 to $8.625 per share, which prices 
were equivalent to the quoted market price of the Company's stock on the grant 
dates.

During the six months ended November 30, 1992, options to purchase 42,800 
common shares were exercised at prices ranging from $.0125 to $1.00 per share.

During the six months ended November 30, 1992, the Company granted 4,006 
shares of common stock to directors, officers and employees, which resulted in
$37,000 of compensation to be expensed over the applicable service period.

5. Reclassifications
-----------------

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period's condensed 
consolidated financial statements to conform with the current period's 
presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income, total 
assets, total liabilities or stockholders' equity.

6. Income Taxes
------------

For the six months ended November 30, 1993 and 1992,the Company provided for 
income taxes based upon the estimated annualized effective tax rate.

Effective June 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for income Taxes" ("SFAS NO. 109"}. The
adoption of SFAS NO. 109 had no effect on pretax income or net for the six 
months ended November 30, 1993. The Company has classified the net current and 
noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with SFAS No. 109 
which at November 30, 1993 included a current deferred tax asset of $408,643 
and a defferred tax liability of $628,124.

The components of and the changes in the net deferred tax assets and 
liabilities for the six months ended November 30, 1993 are as follows:

7. Acquisitions
------------

On July 1, 1993, the Company increased its ownership in Richfield from 48.5 
percent to 51.5 percent. The Company paid $100,000 in cash and assumed an 
obligation to Richfield for $209,096. The accounts of Richfield have been 
consolidated with those of the Company since July 1, 1993. Prior to that time,
the investment in Richfield was accounted for under the equity method.

On October 21, 1993, the Company acquired all remaining interests (78.52%) in 
GQ retroactively effective to July 1, 1993. The Company paid $1,117,000 in 
cash and assumed $685,000 of liabilities. The purchase price of $1,802,000 was
allocated to the assets acquired based on their relative fair market values. 
As a result of this acquisition, the partnership was terminated and the 
operations of GQ have been consolidated with those of the Company since July 
1, 1993. In consolidation, the investment in GQ of $104,000 was eliminated 
with gross assets and liabilities recorded as follows:

</TABLE> 

8. Contingency
-----------

The Company has contracted for firm transportation capacity of 12,560 MMBtu 
per day on the interstate pipeline operated by Northwest Pipeline Corporation 
("Northwest"). This transportation commitment was obtained in conjuction with 
an expansion of Northwest's existing facilities.

In a June 1992 order authorizing the Northwest expansion, the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission ("FERC") stipulated that the mechanism for establishing 
transportation rates on the expansion capacity would be based on "rolled-in" 
rate base treatment. This treatment would require the cost of the expansion 
and additional operating costs to be accumulated with those of the preexisting
facilities to establish a blended cost of service for all shippers. The FERC 
further stipulated that Northwest must provide a showing in its next general 
rate case that would substantiate the applicability of "rolled-in" rate 
treatment to Northwest's specific circumstance.

10
<PAGE>

Northwest established transportation rates, subject to refund, pursuant to its
general rate case filed on October 1, 1992, that became effective on April 1, 
1993. Several parties, primarily natural gas producers with production in the 
San Juan Basin of New Mexico, intervened in the rate case proceedings opposing
the "rolled-in" rate treatment on the bases that (1) Northwest had failed to 
make a proper showing as to the applicability of this treatment, and (2) 
"rolled-in" treatment provides a subsidy by traditional shippers to those 
shippers obtaining the newer expansion capacity. Additionally, the staff of 
the FERC took the position that Northwest failed to substantiate the 
applicability of "rolled-in" rate treatment to its specific circumstance.

Settlement conferences were convened in the months of May, July, August and 
September of 1993 in an attempt to settle the rate case. The staff of the 
FERC stated during these settlement conferences that the FERC would not oppose
a settlement that included rolled-in rates as long as no intervening party 
objected. Additionally, the intervening San Juan Basin natural gas producers 
withdrew their entire testimony opposing "rolled-in" treatment.

Nonetheless, the parties in the rate case failed to reach a settlement and the
case went to hearing on September 28, 1993 and concluded November 10, 1993. 
The FERC will make a decision as to the appropriate rate design for the 
Northwest system expansion based on the outcome of this hearing and will 
determine whether the rate treatment will be applied retroactively or 
prospectively. It is expected this decision will be made in late calendar 
1994 or early calendar 1995.

Management believes that it is probable that a "rolled-in" rate design will 
ultimately be approved with no adverse impact to the Company. The financial 
impact of an unfavorable rate determination by the FERC would depend on 
whether the resulting rates are applied retroactively or prospectively. In 
the event that the FERC were to rule against "rolled-in" rate treatment and 
take what appears to be unprecedented action to apply this type of ruling 
retroactively, management estimates that additional expense would approximate 
$50,000 to $80,000 per month for the period April 1, 1993 (inception of the 
contract) through November 30, 1993.

9. Line of Credit
--------------

On September 24, 1993, the Company increased its line of credit facility with
the First National Bank of Boston from $15 to $20 million. The line of credit
provides working capital funding capacity of $15 million and interim funding 
capacity for capital expenditures of $5 million.

GRAND VALLEY GAS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

1. Description of Business and Operations
--------------------------------------
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Grand Valley Gas
Company and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (Grand Valley 
Gathering Company, Centennial Storage Corporation, GV Power Corporation, GV 
Power Corporation II and Mesquite Pipeline Company) and a majority-owned joint
venture (Richfield Gas Storage System ("Richfield")). Collectively, these 
entities are referred to as the "Company". On July 1, 1993, Centennial Storage
Corporation acquired an additional interest in Richfield bringing total 
ownership to 51.5 percent. On October 21, 1993, Grand Valley Gathering Company
acquired all remaining interests in GQ Joint Venture ("GQ") retroactively 
effective to July 1, 1993. As a result, the accounts of Richfield and GQ have 
been consolidated with the Company's financial statements as of July 1, 1993.

The Company is primarily engaged in natural gas marketing. The Company also 
owns natural gas gathering, processing, and storage facilities and interests in
developed oil and gas leaseholds.

The Company participates in various joint venture partnerships with ownership 
percentages ranging form 24.5 percent to 45 percent. Investments in these 
joint venture partnerships are accounted for using the equity method.

2. Financial Statements
--------------------
The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 1994,
and the condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the 
three and nine months ended February 28, 1994 and 1993 have been prepared by 
the Company, and are not audited. In the opinion of management, all 
adjustments necessary for fair presentation have been included. These 
financial statements are condensed and therefore, do not include all 
disclosures normally required by generally accepted accounting principles.

7
<PAGE>

These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual 
financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 1993. The accompanying 
consolidated financial results are not necessarily indicative of the results 
to be generated for the remainder of fiscal year 1994.

3. Net Income Per Common Share
---------------------------

Net income per common share is calculated based on the weighted average number
of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during the periods. 
Common equivalent shares consist of certain stock options which have a 
dilutive effect when applying the treasury stock method.

The fully diluted per share computation, for the three months ended February 
28, 1994, reflects the effect of common shares contingently issuable upon the 
conversion of the convertible senior subordinated notes payable. For all other
periods, primary and fully diluted net income per common share are essentially 
the same.

4. Stock Options and Incentive Stock Awards
----------------------------------------

On December 9, 1993 the stockholders of the Company approved the adoption of 
the 1993 Stock Option Plan and the reservation of 400,000 shares of the 
Company's common stock for issuance thereunder.

During the nine months ended February 28, 1994, in accordance with the new 
1993 Stock Option Plan, the Company granted to certain officers qualified 
stock options to purchase a total of 201,900 common shares. These options are 
exercisable at a price $5.50 per share, which price was equivalent to the 
closing sales price of the Company's stock on the grant date.

In addition, the Company granted to certain officers and employees qualified 
stock options pursuant to the 1992 Stock Option Plan, options to purchase a 
total of 155,000 common shares. These options are exercisable at prices 
ranging from $5.125 to $7.125 per share, which prices were equivalent to the 
closing sales price of the Company's stock on the grant dates.

During the nine months ended February 28, 1994, the Company granted 26,390 
shares of common stock to directors and employees which resulted in $107,000 of
compensation to be expensed over the applicable service period and $51,000 of 
compensation expensed in the current period.

8
<PAGE>

During the nine months ended February 28, 1994, options to purchases 33,000 
shares of common stock were exercised at a price of $.0125.

During the nine months ended February 28, 1993, the Company granted 4,006 
shares of common stock to directors, officers, and employees, which resulted 
in $37,000 of compensation to be expensed over the applicable service period. 
During the same period, options to purchase 80,125 common shares were 
exercised at prices ranging form $.0125 to $6.875 per share.

5. Reclassifications
-----------------

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods, condensed 
consolidated financial statements to conform with the current periods' 
presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income, total 
assets, total liabilities or stockholders' equity.

6. Income Taxes
------------

For the nine months ended February 28, 1994 and 1993, the Company provided for
income taxes based upon the estimated annualized effective tax rate.

Effective June 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109"). The 
adoption of SFAS No. 109 had no effect on pretax income or net income for the 
nine months ended February 28, 1994. The Company has classified the net 
current and noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with 
SFAS No. 109 which at February 28, 1994 included a current deferred tax asset 
of $408,871 and a deferred tax liability of $711,974.

The components of and the changes in the net deferred tax assets and 
liabilities for the nine months ended February 28, 1994 are a follows:

</TABLE> 

7. Acquisitions

On July 1, 1993, the Company increased its ownership in Richfield from 48.5
percent to 51.5 percent. The Company paid $100,000 in cash and assumed an
obligation to Richfield for $209,096. The accounts of Richfield have been
consolidated with those of the Company since July 1, 1993. Prior to that time,
the investment in Richfield was accounted for under the equity method.

On October 21, 1993, the Company acquired all remaining interests (78.52%) in
GQ retroactively effective to July 1, 1993. The Company paid $1,117,000 in
cash and assumed $685,000 of liabilities. The purchase price of $1,802,000 was
allocated to the assets acquired based on their relative fair market values. As
a result of this acquisition, the partnership was terminated and the operations
of GQ have been consolidated with those of the Company since July 1, 1993. In
consolidation, the investment in GQ of $104,000 was eliminated with gross
assets and liabilities recorded as follows:

Current Assets $ 423,000
Net Property and Equipment 1,671,000
Current Liabilities 143,000
Non current Liabilities 730,000

In January 1994, the Company purchased a 24.5 percent interest in the 
Klickitat Energy Project Partnership. This 42.5 megawatt gas turbine 
co-generation project is scheduled for commercial operation in August 1995. 
The project has an estimated total cost of $42 million with eighty percent 
expected to be funded with non-recourse debt financing. As of February 28, 
1994, the Company has invested approximately $250,000.

8. Contingencies
-------------

Rolled-in Versus Incremental Rate Case
- - --------------------------------------

The Company has contracted for firm transportation capacity of 12,560 MMBtu 
per day on the interstate pipeline operated by Northwest Pipeline Corporation 
("Northwest"). This transportation commitment was obtained in conjunction 
with an expansion of Northwest's existing facilities.

In a June 1992 order authorizing the Northwest expansion, the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission ("FERC") stipulated that the mechanism for establishing 
transportation rates on the expansion capacity would be based on "rolled-in" 
rate base treatment. This treatment would require the cost of the expansion 
and additional operating costs to be accumulated with those of the 
pre-existing facilities to establish a blended cost of service for all 
shippers. The FERC further stipulated that Northwest must provide a showing 
in its next general rate case that would substantiate the applicability of 
"rolled-in" rate treatment to Northwest's specific circumstance.

Management believes that it is probable that a "rolled-in" rate design will 
ultimately be approved with no adverse impact to the Company. However 
management estimates that the monthly impact due to an adverse determination 
relative to incremental rate treatment would result in additional expense of 
approximately $85,000 per month on a prospective basis. Management believes 
that, under this adverse determination scenario, it is unlikely the FERC would
apply incremental rate treatment retroactively to April 1, 1993 (inception of 
the contract).

Environmental Remediation Costs
- - -------------------------------

In an effort to adhere to evolving environmental regulations, costs incurred to
investigate and remediate sites, caused primarily by normal operations of 
natural gas processing facilities, are expensed or capitalized in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. Liabilities for these types of
costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and
the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these 
accruals coincides with the completion of a site assessment or the Company's 
determination, on another basis, that expenditures are necessary in order to 
remain in compliance with applicable environmental standards. An environmental 
site assessment conducted during the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 1994, 
indicates that the Company is subject to probable remediation costs at a gas 
processing facility, for which $100,000 has been accrued and charged to 
income.

11
<PAGE>

In the opinion of management, after taking into consideration the accrued 
amount, the ultimate amount to be paid for environmental remediation costs 
will not have a material impact on the financial position or results of 
operations of the Company.

9. Line of Credit 
--------------

On September 24, 1993, the Company increased its line of credit facility with 
the First National Bank of Boston from $15 to $20 million. The line of credit
provides working capital funding capacity of $15 million and interim funding 
capacity for capital expenditures of $5 million.

10. Proposed Merger
---------------

On February 21, 1994, the Company signed a definitive agreement to merge with a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Associated Natural Gas Corporation (ANGC). 
Consummation of the transaction is conditioned on, among other things, the 
approval of the Company's shareholders and approval of certain regulatory 
authorities. Terms of the agreement call for the exchange of .25 shares of 
ANGC common stock for each share of the Company.

CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

On February 21, 1994, ANGC and Grand Valley entered into an agreement that
provides for the merger of Grand Valley with a subsidiary of ANGC. Under the
terms of the Merger Agreement, Grand Valley shareholders will receive 0.25
shares of ANGC Common Stock in exchange for each of their shares of Grand
Valley Common Stock. The business combination is to be accounted for as a
pooling of interests. ANGC's fiscal year ends September 30 and Grand Valley's
fiscal year ends May 31.

The following unaudited condensed pro forma combined balance sheet as of
March 31, 1994 assumes that the Merger occurred as of that date and reflects
the combination of the historical balance sheet of ANGC as of March 31, 1994
with the historical balance sheet of Grand Valley as of February 28, 1994, with
pro forma adjustments to give effect to the issuance of 1,584,106 ANGC shares
in exchange for 6,336,422 shares of Grand Valley Common Stock outstanding as of
that date and the subsequent retirement of the Grand Valley Common Stock and
235,098 shares held in treasury.

The following unaudited condensed pro forma combined statements of operations
for the six months ended March 31, 1994 and for the years ended September 30,
1993, 1992 and 1991 assume that the Merger occurred as of the respective dates
presented, and combines the historical results of ANGC for the six months ended
March 31, 1994 and the years ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991 with the
historical results of operations of Grand Valley for the six months ended
February 28, 1994 and the years ended May 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. Grand Valley's historical statement of income has not been
brought up to August 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 as the effect on the condensed pro
forma combined statement of operations for the years ended September 30, 1993,
1992 and 1991 would not be material. In addition, this presentation of the pro
forma balance sheet as of March 31, 1994 and the pro forma results of
operations for the six months ended March 31, 1994 and for the years ended
September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991 conforms to the presentation that will be
reported subsequent to the Merger.

The pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the
results of operations that would have been obtained if the Merger had occurred
as of the beginning of the periods presented nor are they indicative of future
operating results of the combined companies. These unaudited condensed pro
forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
historical financial statements and related notes of ANGC and Grand Valley.

NOTES TO CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) On February 21, 1994, ANGC and Grand Valley entered into an agreement that
provides for the merger of Grand Valley with a subsidiary of ANGC. Under the
terms of the Merger Agreement, Grand Valley shareholders will receive 0.25
shares of ANGC Common Stock in exchange for each of their shares of Grand
Valley Common Stock. The business combination is to be accounted for as a
pooling of interests. The condensed pro forma combined balance sheet as of
March 31, 1994 includes pro forma adjustments to give effect to the issuance of
1,584,106 shares of ANGC Common Stock in exchange for 6,336,422 shares of Grand
Valley Common Stock outstanding as of that date and the subsequent retirement
of the Grand Valley Common Stock and 235,098 shares held in treasury. Upon
consummation of the Merger, ANGC expects to issue approximately 58,500
additional shares of ANGC Common Stock in exchange for Grand Valley Common
Stock to be issued upon the exercise of certain stock options that are expected
to be exercised upon consummation of the Merger.

(2) Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical financial
statements of Grand Valley to conform with ANGC's presentation.

(3) Pro forma earnings per share have been computed based on the pro forma net
earnings and the pro forma weighted average common shares outstanding for the
periods presented. The pro forma weighted average common shares outstanding
have been computed by adjusting the historical weighted average common shares
outstanding for ANGC by the effect of the shares to be issued in exchange for
the Grand Valley Common Stock. The dilutive effect of options outstanding on
the calculation of pro forma earnings per share was not material.

(4) The pro forma unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not
include estimated merger expenses, which are not expected to exceed $1.5
million. These expenses, which primarily consist of financial advisory fees,
outside legal, accounting and professional fees and one-time costs of
consolidating certain operational and administrative functions of the
companies, will be expensed in 1994. The pro forma statements also do not
include any cost savings expected to occur as a result of the Merger, as well
as the deferral of a portion of Grand Valley's current income taxes.
