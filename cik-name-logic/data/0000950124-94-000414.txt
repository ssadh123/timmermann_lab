Net Sales for 1993 were $3,886 million, a 10 percent increase from
1992. Net income increased 21 percent to $221 million from $183 million in
1992, with earnings per share increasing to $1.45 from $1.21.

Net sales of $1,010 million in the fourth quarter of 1993 increased 11
percent from the 1992 fourth quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 34
percent to $58 million, with earnings per share increasing to $.38, compared
with $.29 in 1992.

Income in the fourth quarter of 1993 included an $18 million after-tax
gain from the redemption by MascoTech, Inc. of its $100 million of preferred
stock. This gain was principally offset by the Registrant's approximate $10
million after-tax equity share of MascoTech's loss provision for the
disposition of its energy-related businesses, as well as by charges related to
certain restructurings of Company operations.

For all of 1993, building and home improvement products achieved sales
and operating profit of $2,188 million and $412 million, respectively.

Sales of home furnishings products in 1993 were $1,698 million. 
Operating profit was $69 million, a 15 percent increase over 1992 results.

Registrant is filing herewith certain financial information as follows: 
(i) audited consolidated financial statements of the Registrant and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and for the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993 and (ii) the separate audited consolidated
financial statements of the Registrant's 50 percent-or-less owned significant

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of Masco Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Masco
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Masco
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

MASCO CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Masco Corporation and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Average Shares Outstanding. The average number of common shares outstanding
in 1993, 1992 and 1991 approximated 152.7 million, 151.7 million and 149.9
million, respectively.

Cash and Cash Investments. The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash
investments.

Receivables. Accounts and notes receivable are presented net of allowances
for doubtful accounts of $19.1 million at December 31, 1993 and $16.3 million at
December 31, 1992.

Property and Equipment. Property and equipment, including significant
betterments to existing facilities, are recorded at cost. Upon retirement or
disposal, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any gain or loss is included in income. Maintenance and repair costs are
charged to expense as incurred.

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is computed principally using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Annual
depreciation rates are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 to 10
percent, and machinery and equipment, 5 to 33 percent. Depreciation was $82.1
million, $79.4 million and $70.2 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

The excess of cost over net assets of acquired companies is being amortized
using the straight-line method over periods not exceeding 40 years; at December
31, 1993 and 1992, such accumulated amortization totalled $127.2 million and
$107.3 million, respectively. At each balance sheet date management assesses
whether there has been an impairment in the carrying value of excess of cost
over net assets of acquired companies primarily by comparing current and
projected sales, operating income and annual cash flows with the related annual
amortization expense. Purchase costs of patents are being amortized using the
straight-line method over their remaining lives. Amortization of intangible
assets was $33.9 million, $35.1 million and $32.5 million in 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying value of financial
instruments reported in the balance sheet for current assets and current
liabilities approximates fair value. The fair value of financial instruments
that are carried as long-term investments (other than those accounted for by the
equity method) was based principally on quoted market prices for those or
similar investments or by discounting future cash flows using a discount rate
that approximates the risk of the investments. The fair value of the Company's
long-term debt instruments was based principally on quoted market prices for the
same or similar issues or the current rates offered to the Company for debt with
similar terms and remaining maturities. The aggregate market value of the
Company's long-term investments and long-term debt at December 31, 1993 was
approximately $230 million and $1,471 million, as compared with the Company's
carrying value of $200 million and $1,418 million, respectively. The aggregate
market value of the Company's long-term investments and long-term debt at
December 31, 1992 was approximately $530 million and $1,508 million, as compared
with the Company's carrying value of $537 million and $1,487 million,
respectively.

Recently Issued Professional Accounting Standards. Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits, SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan and
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,
which become effective in 1994 and 1995, will not have a material impact on the
Company's financial statements.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES:

Equity investments in affiliates consist primarily of the following equity
and partnership interests:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
AT DECEMBER 31
--------------------
1993 1992 1991
---- ---- ----
<S> <C> <C> <C>
MascoTech, Inc.............................................. 42% 47% 47%

TriMas Corporation.......................................... 5% 7% 8%
Emco Limited, a Canadian company............................ -- 44% 44%
Mechanical Technology Inc................................... -- -- 49%
</TABLE>

Excluding the partnership interest in Hans Grohe, for which there is no
quoted market value, the aggregate market value of the Company's equity
investments at December 31, 1993 (which may differ from the amounts that could
then have been realized upon disposition), based upon quoted market prices at
that date, was $889 million, as compared with the Company's related aggregate
carrying value of $315 million.

The Company's carrying value in the common stock of MascoTech, Inc.
(formerly Masco Industries, Inc.) exceeds its equity in the underlying net book
value by approximately $63 million at December 31, 1993. This excess,
substantially all of which resulted from repurchases by MascoTech of its common
stock, is being amortized over a period not to exceed 40 years. The Company's
carrying value in the common stock of TriMas Corporation exceeds its equity in
the underlying net book value by approximately $8 million at December 31, 1993.
The Company's carrying value of its investment in Hans Grohe at December 31,
1993 approximates the Company's equity in the underlying net book value in this
affiliate.

In March 1993, the Company and MascoTech partially restructured their
affiliate relationships through transactions that reduced the Company's common
equity interest in MascoTech from 47 percent to approximately 35 percent and
resulted in MascoTech's acquisition of the Company's investments in Emco
Limited. The Company received $87.5 million in cash, $100 million of 10%
exchangeable preferred stock and seven-year warrants to purchase 10 million
common shares of MascoTech at $13 per share. MascoTech received 10 million of
its common shares, $77.5 million of its 12% exchangeable preferred stock, the
Company's investments in Emco Limited and a modified option expiring in 1997 to
require the Company to purchase up to $200 million aggregate amount of debt
securities in MascoTech.

In November 1993, MascoTech redeemed for cash its $100 million of 10%
exchangeable preferred stock issued in March 1993. As a result of this
redemption, the Company realized a $28.3 million pre-tax gain.

In December 1993, following MascoTech's call for redemption, the Company
converted the 6% debentures due 2011 into MascoTech common stock, thereby
increasing the Company's common equity interest in MascoTech from approximately
35 percent to 42 percent.

MASCO CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

As part of the Company's efforts to de-emphasize equity investments, in
addition to its disposition of its investments in Emco Limited, in July 1992 the
Company sold its 49 percent equity interest in Mechanical Technology Inc. at
approximate carrying value.

Approximate combined condensed financial data of the above companies,
excluding data subsequent to 1991 of Emco Limited and Mechanical Technology Inc.
as to which the equity method was discontinued as of January 1, 1992, are

The Company sponsors defined-benefit pension plans for most of its
employees. In addition, substantially all salaried employees participate in
noncontributory profit-sharing plans, to which payments are determined annually
by the Directors. Aggregate charges to income under the pension and
profit-sharing plans were $19.2 million in 1993, $16.9 million in 1992 and $15.9
million in 1991. At December 31, 1993, the combined assets of the Company's

The effective tax rate differs from the United States federal statutory
rate principally due to: equity earnings (1 percent in 1992 and -7 percent in
1991), higher tax rate applicable to foreign earnings (-1 percent in 1993, -2
percent in 1992 and -5 percent in 1991), amortization in excess of tax, net (-1
percent in 1993, -2 percent in 1992 and -6 percent in 1991), dividends-received
deduction (1 percent in 1993 and 1992 and 2 percent in 1991), state income tax
and other (-2 percent in 1993 and -4 percent in 1992 and 1991), and -1 percent
in 1993 to record the effect on deferred tax liabilities caused by the increase
in the tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent.

Income taxes paid were approximately $135 million, $97 million and $54
million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, which requires the use of an asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes, became effective in January 1993.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of MascoTech, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of MascoTech,
Inc. and subsidiaries (formerly Masco Industries, Inc.) as of December 31, 1993
and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of income and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of MascoTech, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

MASCOTECH, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Corporations that are 20 to 50
percent owned are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Capital
transactions by equity affiliates at amounts differing from the Company's
carrying amount are reflected in other income or expense and the investment in
affiliates account.

Certain amounts for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991 have been
reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in 1993. The statements of
income and cash flows for 1993, 1992 and 1991 and related notes have been
reclassified to present the Energy-related segment as discontinued operations.
In addition, the balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 reflects the
Energy-related segment as discontinued operations (see "Discontinued Operations"
note). The balance sheet as of December 31, 1992 has not been reclassified for
discontinued operations. Effective June 23, 1993 the Company changed its name to
MascoTech, Inc. from Masco Industries, Inc.

The Company has a corporate services agreement with Masco Corporation,
which at December 31, 1993 owned approximately 42 percent of the Company's
Common Stock. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company pays fees to Masco
Corporation for various corporate staff support and administrative services,
research and development and facilities. Such fees, which are determined
principally as a percentage of net sales, including net sales related to
discontinued operations, aggregated approximately $11 million in each of 1993,
1992 and 1991.

Cash and Cash Investments. The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash
investments. The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash
investments approximates fair value. At December 31, 1993, the Company has $33
million on deposit with a German bank that is subject to currency exchange rate
fluctuations.

Receivables. Receivables are presented net of allowances for doubtful
accounts of $5.1 million and $7.2 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable
value, with cost determined principally by use of the first-in, first-out
method.

Property and Equipment, Net. Property and equipment additions, including
significant betterments, are recorded at cost. Upon retirement or disposal of
property and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts, and any gain or loss is included in income. Repair and maintenance
costs are charged to expense as incurred.

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is computed principally using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Annual
depreciation rates are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 1/2 to 10
percent, and machinery and equipment, 6 2/3 to 33 1/3 percent. Deferred
financing costs are amortized over the lives of the related debt securities. The
excess of cost over net assets of acquired companies is amortized using the
straight-line method over the period estimated to be benefitted, not exceeding
40 years. At each balance sheet date management assesses whether there has been
a permanent impairment of the excess of cost over net assets of acquired
companies by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operating
activities with the carrying amount of the excess of cost over net assets of
acquired companies. The factors considered by management in performing this
assessment include current operating results, business prospects, market trends,
potential product obsolescence, competitive activities and other economic
factors. Based on this assessment there was no permanent impairment related to
excess of cost over net assets of acquired companies at December 31, 1993.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, accumulated amortization of the excess of
cost over net assets of acquired companies and patents was $98.4 million and
$105.1 million, respectively. Amortization expense was

27

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

$22.2 million, $22.8 million and $21.2 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, including amortization expense of approximately $1.6 million in
each year related to discontinued operations.

Income Taxes. In January, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS No. 109"), "Accounting for Income Taxes."
SFAS No. 109 is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax
returns. In estimating future tax consequences, SFAS No. 109 generally allows
consideration of all expected future events other than enactments of changes in
the tax law or tax rates. Previously, the Company used the SFAS No. 96 asset and
liability approach that gave no recognition to future events other than the
recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities at their carrying amounts.
There was no income statement impact from the adoption of SFAS No. 109 and the
required balance sheet reclassification was immaterial. Provision is made for
U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless
such earnings are considered permanently reinvested.

Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share. Primary earnings (loss) per common share
are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common
stock equivalents outstanding (including the dilutive effect of options and
warrants, utilizing the treasury stock method) of 57.4 million, 60.9 million and
59.7 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, and earnings (loss) after
deducting preferred stock dividends of $14.9 million, $9.3 million and $9.6
million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Fully diluted earnings (loss) per common share are only presented when the
assumed conversion of convertible debentures is dilutive. Fully diluted earnings
per share in 1993 were calculated based on 68.8 million weighted average common
shares outstanding. Convertible securities did not have a dilutive effect on
earnings (loss) in 1992 or 1991. The shares of Dividend Enhanced Convertible
Stock DECSSM (the "DECS") issued in 1993 (see "Shareholders' Equity" note) are
common stock equivalents, but are not included in the calculation of primary or
fully diluted shares outstanding as such inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

In late 1993, approximately 10.4 million shares were issued as a result of
the conversion of the 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures (see "Shareholders'
Equity" note). If such conversion had taken place at the beginning of 1993, the
primary earnings per common and common equivalent share amounts would have
approximated the amounts presented for earnings per common and common equivalent
share, assuming full dilution, for the year ended December 31, 1993.

Adoption of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards. The Company
expects that the adoption of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", SFAS No.
114 "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" and SFAS No. 115
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" will not have
a material impact on the financial position or the results of operations of the
Company when adopted in 1994 and 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY CASH FLOWS INFORMATION:

Significant transactions not affecting cash were: in 1993: in addition to
the payment by the Company of $87.5 million, the non-cash portion of the
issuance of Company Preferred Stock and warrants in exchange for Company Common
Stock, Company Preferred Stock and Masco Corporation's holdings of Emco Limited
common stock and convertible debentures (see "Shareholders' Equity" note);
conversion of $187 million of convertible debentures into Company Common Stock
(see "Shareholders' Equity" note); and conversion of the Company's TriMas
Corporation ("TriMas") convertible preferred stock holdings into TriMas common
stock (see "Equity and Other Investments in Affiliates" note); and in 1991: an
exchange of certain operating assets (see "Dispositions of Other Operations"
note); and the assumption of liabilities of $18 million in partial exchange for
the acquisition of Creative Industries Group (see "Equity and Other Investments
in Affiliates" note).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Income taxes paid were $32 million in 1993 and $23 million in 1992. Income
tax refunds of $8 million were received in 1991. Interest paid was $82 million,
$91 million and $115 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS:

In late November, 1993, the Company adopted a formal plan to divest its
Energy-related business segment, which consisted of seven business units.
Accordingly, the consolidated statements of income and cash flows and related
notes have been reclassified to present such Energy-related segment as
discontinued operations. During 1993, two such business units were sold for
approximately $93 million, including the sale of one business unit to the
Company's equity affiliate, TriMas for $60 million cash. The expected loss from
the planned disposition of the Company's Energy-related segment resulted in a
fourth quarter 1993 pre-tax charge of approximately $41 million (approximately
$22 million after-tax), including a provision for the businesses not yet sold
and the deferral of a portion of the gain (approximately $6 million after-tax)
related to the sale of the business to TriMas. The Company expects to sell the
remaining business units in privately negotiated transactions in 1994.

Selected financial information for discontinued operations is as follows as
at December 31, 1993 and for the period up to the decision to discontinue in
1993 and for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991:

The unusual relationship of income taxes to pre-tax income in 1992 results
principally from foreign losses for which no tax benefit was recorded. Operating
and pre-tax income include charges of $6 million in 1991, principally related to
the discontinuance of product lines and the cost of restructuring several
businesses.

DISPOSITIONS OF OTHER OPERATIONS:

In separate transactions from late 1989 to early 1991, the Company divested
itself of three subsidiaries and received consideration of approximately $160
million, of which $108 million was received in 1990. The remaining $52 million
was received in 1991. In addition, in 1991 the Company disposed of certain
equity affiliates, and exchanged operating assets aggregating approximately $27
million.

These transactions, including the disposition of Masco Capital Corporation
(see "Equity and Other Investments in Affiliates" note), resulted in an
approximate $22 million pre-tax gain in 1991.

In 1988, the Company transferred several businesses to TriMas, a publicly
traded, diversified manufacturer of commercial, industrial and consumer
products. In exchange, the Company received $128 million principal amount of 14%
Subordinated Debentures (which were subsequently redeemed resulting in
prepayment premium income to the Company of $9 million in 1992 and $4 million in
1991), $70 million (liquidation value) of 10% Convertible Participating
Preferred Stock and 9.3 million shares of TriMas common stock.

During the second quarter of 1992, TriMas sold 9.2 million shares of newly
issued common stock at $9.75 per share in a public offering, which reduced the
Company's common equity ownership interest in TriMas to

30
<PAGE> 32

MASCOTECH, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

28 percent from 41 percent. As a result, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain
of $16.7 million from the change in the Company's common equity ownership
interest in TriMas. In late 1993, the TriMas 10% Convertible Participating
Preferred Stock held by the Company was converted at a conversion price of $9
per share into 7.8 million shares of TriMas common stock, increasing the
Company's common equity ownership interest in TriMas to 43 percent.

In 1993, the Company sold a business unit to TriMas for $60 million cash
(see "Discontinued Operations" note).

Included in notes receivable are approximately $10.7 million of notes which
resulted from the sale by the Company of one million shares of its TriMas common
stock holdings to members of the Company's executive management group in
mid-1989. The notes have an effective interest rate of nine percent, payable at
maturity in mid-1994. Ownership and resale of certain of such shares is
restricted and subject to the continuing employment of these executives.

TriMas' Board of Directors declared a 100 percent stock distribution (one
additional share for every share held) to its shareholders effective July 19,
1993. TriMas share amounts and per share prices have been restated to reflect
this distribution.

The Company's holdings in Emco Limited ("Emco") were acquired from Masco
Corporation in 1993 (see "Shareholders' Equity" note). Emco is a major, publicly
traded, Canadian based manufacturer and distributor of building and other
industrial products with annual sales of approximately $800 million.

At December 31, 1992, the Company had an approximate 47 percent common
equity ownership interest in Titan Wheel International, Inc. ("Titan"), a
manufacturer of wheels and other products for agricultural, construction and
other off-highway equipment markets. In May, 1993, Titan completed an initial
public offering of three million shares of common stock at $15 per share
(including 292,000 shares held by the Company), reducing the Company's common
equity ownership interest in Titan to 24 percent. The Company's ownership
interest was further reduced in late 1993 to 21 percent as a result of the
issuance of additional common shares by Titan in connection with an acquisition
by Titan. These transactions resulted in 1993 gains aggregating approximately
$12.8 million pre-tax (principally in the second quarter) as a result of the
sale of shares held by the Company and from the change in the Company's common
equity ownership interest in Titan.

During the second quarter of 1991, the Company acquired the remaining 50
percent equity ownership interest of Creative Industries Group, which had sales
in 1990 of approximately $150 million.

In 1991, Masco Capital Corporation ("Masco Capital") sold its principal
asset and used the proceeds to repay its outstanding bank borrowings and to make
loan repayments and distributions to its shareholders, whereby the Company
received approximately $65 million (including repayment of $44 million advanced
during 1991). In addition, the Company subsequently sold its 50 percent equity
ownership interest in Masco Capital to the other shareholder, Masco Corporation,
for approximately $50 million (which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately
$5 million) and contingent amounts based on the future value of certain assets
held by Masco Capital.

In addition to its equity and other investments in publicly traded
affiliates, the Company retains interests in privately held manufacturers of
automotive components, including the Company's 50 percent common equity
ownership interests in Autostyle, Inc., a manufacturer of reaction injection
molded automotive components, and Elbi-Hi Ram, Inc., a manufacturer of
electrical and electronic automotive components.

In 1993, the Company entered into a new $675 million revolving credit
agreement with a group of banks, replacing its prior bank credit agreement
(which had consisted of a revolving credit facility and a bank term loan at
December 31, 1992). Amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement are
due in January, 1997; however, under certain circumstances, the due date may be
extended to July, 1998. The interest rates applicable to the revolving credit
agreement are principally at alternative floating rates provided for in the
agreement (approximately four percent at December 31, 1993).

The revolving credit agreement requires the maintenance of a specified
level of shareholders' equity, with limitations on the ratio of senior debt to
earnings, long-term debt (at December 31, 1993 additional borrowing capacity of
approximately $380 million was available under this agreement), intangible
assets and the acquisition of Company Capital Stock. Under the most restrictive
of these provisions, $120 million of retained earnings was available at December
31, 1993 for the payment of cash dividends and the acquisition of Company
Capital Stock.

The 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures were converted into Company
Common Stock in late 1993 (see "Shareholders' Equity" note).

The senior subordinated notes contain limitations on the payment of cash
dividends and the acquisition of Company Capital Stock. In late 1993, the
Company called for redemption, on February 1, 1994, the $250 million of 10 1/4%
Senior Subordinated Notes. During 1992, the Company repurchased, in open-market
transactions, approximately $67 million of its 10% Senior Subordinated Notes at
prices approximating face value.

In early 1994, the Company issued, in a public offering, $345 million of
4 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due December 15, 2003. These
debentures are convertible into Company Common Stock at $31 per share. The net
proceeds were used to redeem the $250 million of 10 1/4% Subordinated Notes
(called in late 1993 for redemption on February 1, 1994) and to reduce other
indebtedness. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recognized a $5.8
million pre-tax extraordinary charge ($3.7 million after-tax) related to the
call premium (1.25%) and unamortized prepaid debenture expense associated with
the call for early extinguishment of the $250 million of 10 1/4% Subordinated
Notes. The 10 1/4% Subordinated Notes are classified as non-current as the
Company had the intent and the ability to maintain these borrowings on a
long-term basis (due to the issuance of the 4 1/2% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures). The maturities of long-term debt during the next five years are as
follows (in millions): 1994 -- $3; 1995 -- $234; 1996 -- $1; 1997 -- $303; and
1998 -- $0.

seven-year warrants to purchase 10 million shares of Company Common Stock at $13
per share, recorded at $70.8 million, and $87.5 million in cash. The
transferable warrants are not exercisable by Masco Corporation if an exercise
would increase Masco Corporation's common equity ownership interest in the
Company above 35 percent. The cash portion of this transaction is included in
the accompanying statement of cash flows as cash used for investing activities
of $87.5 million. As part of this transaction, as modified in late 1993, Masco
Corporation agreed to purchase from the Company, at the Company's option through
March, 1997, up to $200 million of subordinated debentures. In late 1993, the
Company redeemed the 10% Exchangeable Preferred Stock for its $100 million
liquidation value.

In July, 1993, the Company issued 10.8 million shares of 6% Dividend
Enhanced Convertible Stock (DECS) at $20 per share ($216 million aggregate
liquidation amount) in a public offering (classified as

35
<PAGE> 37

MASCOTECH, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Convertible Preferred Stock). The net proceeds from this issuance were used to
reduce the Company's indebtedness. On July 1, 1997, each of the then outstanding
shares of the DECS will convert into one share of Company Common Stock, if not
previously redeemed by the Company or converted at the option of the holder, in
both cases for Company Common Stock.

Each share of the DECS is convertible at the option of the holder anytime
prior to July 1, 1997 into .806 of a share of Company Common Stock, equivalent
to a conversion price of $24.81 per share of Company Common Stock. Dividends are
cumulative and each share of the DECS has 4/5 of a vote, voting together as one
class with holders of Company Common Stock.

Beginning July 1, 1996, the Company, at its option, may redeem the DECS at
a call price payable in shares of Company Common Stock principally determined by
a formula based on the then current market price of Company Common Stock.
Redemption by the Company, as a practical matter, will generally not result in a
call price that exceeds one share of Company Common Stock or is less than .806
of a share of Company Common Stock (resulting from the holder's conversion
option).

The Company's 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures were called for
redemption in late 1993. Substantially all holders, including Masco Corporation,
exercised their right to convert these debentures into Company Common Stock (at
a conversion price of $18 per share), resulting in the issuance of approximately
10.4 million shares of Company Common Stock.

The Company's consideration for a 1987 acquisition included two million
shares of Company Common Stock which were subject to a stock value guarantee
agreement. During the second quarter of 1993, the Company's stock value
guarantee obligation was settled, resulting in no material financial impact to
the Company.

The Company commenced paying cash dividends on its Common Stock in August,
1993 and declared three and paid two quarterly dividends in 1993, each in the
amount of $.02 per common share.

STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS:

For the three years ended December 31, 1993, stock option data pertaining
to stock option plans for key employees of the Company and affiliated companies

Pursuant to restricted stock incentive plans, the Company granted long-term
incentive awards, net, for 202,000, 251,000 and 675,000 shares of Company Common
Stock during 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, to key employees of the Company
and affiliated companies. The unamortized costs of incentive awards,

aggregating approximately $20 million at December 31, 1993, are being amortized
over the ten-year vesting periods.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, a combined total of 5,631,000 and 5,759,000
shares, respectively, of Company Common Stock were available for the granting of
options and incentive awards under the above plans.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

Pension and Profit-Sharing Benefits. The Company sponsors defined-benefit
pension plans for most of its employees. In addition, substantially all salaried
employees participate in noncontributory profit-sharing plans, to which payments
are approved annually by the Directors. Aggregate charges to income under these
plans were $10.9 million in 1993, $10.3 million in 1992 and $8.3 million in
1991, including approximately $.9 million in each year related to discontinued
operations.

Net periodic pension cost for the Company's defined-benefit pension plans
includes the following components for the three years ended December 31, 1993:

Postretirement Benefits. The Company provides postretirement medical and
life insurance benefits for certain of its active and retired employees.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions" ("SFAS 106") for its postretirement benefit plans. This
statement requires the accrual method of accounting for postretirement health
care and life insurance based on actuarially determined costs to be recognized
over the period from the date of hire to the full eligibility date of employees
who are expected to qualify for such benefits. In conjunction with the adoption
of SFAS 106, the Company elected to recognize the transition obligation on a
prospective basis and accordingly, the net transition obligation is being
amortized over 20 years. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost includes the
following components for the year ended December 31, 1993:

</TABLE>

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation was seven percent. The assumed health care cost trend rate in
1993 was 12 percent, decreasing to an ultimate rate in the year 2000 of seven
percent. If the assumed medical cost trend rates were increased by one percent,
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would increase by $2.6 million
and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost would increase by $.2 million.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," the following methods
were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments:

Notes Receivable and Other Assets. Fair values of financial instruments
included in notes receivable and other assets were estimated using various
methods including quoted market prices and discounted future cash flows based on
the incremental borrowing rates for similar types of investments. In addition,
for variable-rate notes receivable that fluctuate with the prime rate, the
carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Long-Term Debt. The carrying amount of bank debt and certain other
long-term debt instruments approximate fair value as the floating rates inherent
in this debt reflect changes in overall market interest rates. The fair values
of the Company's subordinated debt instruments are based on quoted market
prices. The fair values of certain other debt instruments are estimated by
discounting future cash flows based on the Company's incremental borrowing rate
for similar types of debt instruments.

The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments
at December 31, 1993 and 1992 are as follows:

reduction initiatives, the restructuring of certain operations and product
lines, adjustments to the carrying value of certain long-term assets, and other
costs and expenses.

Results for the third quarter of 1993 were reduced by a charge of
approximately $.04 per common share reflecting the recently increased 1993
federal corporate income tax rate.

The fourth quarter of 1993 net income includes the effect of a $5.8 million
pre-tax extraordinary charge ($3.7 million after-tax or $.06 per common share)
related to the early extinguishment of subordinated debt (see "Long-Term Debt"
note). The fourth quarter of 1993 net loss also includes an after-tax charge of
approximately $22 million ($.38 per common share) related to the disposition of
a segment of the Company's business (see "Discontinued Operations" note).

The 1993 results include the benefit of approximately $11.5 million pre-tax
income ($6.7 million after-tax or $.12 per common share), primarily in the third
and fourth quarters, resulting from net gains from sales of marketable
securities.

The 1992 results include the benefit of approximately $4 million pre-tax
income ($2 million after-tax or $.04 per common share), primarily in the fourth
quarter, resulting from net gains from sales of marketable securities.

The 1993 income (loss) per common share amounts for the quarters do not
total to the full year amounts due to the changes in the number of common shares
outstanding during the year and the dilutive effect of first, second and third
quarter 1993 results.

The calculation of earnings per common and common equivalent share for the
fourth quarter of 1993 results in dilution for income from continuing
operations, assuming full dilution. Therefore, the fully diluted earnings per
share computation is used for all computations, even though the result is
anti-dilutive for one of the per share amounts.

BYLAWS
OF
MASCO CORPORATION
(A DELAWARE CORPORATION)
(AS AMENDED MAY 19, 1993)

ARTICLE I
Meetings of Stockholders

Section 1.01. Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of stockholders
for the election of Directors and for the transaction of such other proper
business, notice of which was given in the notice of the meeting, shall be held
on a date (other than a legal holiday) in May or June of each year which shall
be designated by the Board of Directors, or on such other date to which a
meeting may be adjourned or re-scheduled, at such time and place within or
without the State of Delaware as shall be designated in the notice of such
meeting.

Section 1.02. Special Meetings. Except as otherwise required by law,
special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by the
Chairman of the Board, the President or a majority of the Board of Directors,
subject to the rights of holders of any one or more classes or series of
preferred stock or any other class of stock issued by the Corporation which
shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect Directors.
Special meetings shall be held at such place within or without the State of
Delaware and at such hour as may be designated in the notice of such meeting
and the business transacted shall be confined to the object stated in the
notice of the meeting.

Section 1.03. Re-scheduling and Adjournment of Meetings.
Notwithstanding Sections 1.01 and 1.02 of this Article, the Board of Directors
may postpone and re-schedule any previously scheduled annual or special meeting
of stockholders. The person presiding at any meeting is empowered to adjourn
the meeting at any time after it has been convened.

Section 1.04. Notice of Stockholders' Meetings. The notice of all
meetings of stockholders shall be in writing and shall state the place, date
and hour of the meeting. The notice of an annual meeting shall state that the
meeting is called for the election of the Directors to be elected at such
meeting and for the transaction of such other business as is stated in the
notice of the meeting. The notice of a special meeting shall state the purpose
or purposes for which the meeting is called and shall also indicate that it is
being issued by or at the direction of the person or persons calling the
meeting. If, at any meeting, action is proposed to be taken which would, if
taken, entitle stockholders fulfilling the requirements of the General
Corporation Law to receive payment for their shares, the notice of such meeting
shall include a statement to that effect.

A copy of the notice of each meeting of stockholders shall be given,
personally or by mail, not less than ten days nor more than sixty days before
the date of the meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting
at his record address or at such other address as he may have furnished by
request in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. If a meeting is
adjourned to another time or place, and, if any announcement 

<PAGE> 2
of the adjourned time or place is made at the meeting, it shall not be
necessary to give notice of the adjourned meeting unless the adjournment is for
more than thirty days or the Directors, after adjournment, fix a new record
date for the adjourned meeting.

Notice of a meeting need not be given to any stockholder who submits a
signed waiver of notice, in person or by proxy, whether before or after the
meeting. The attendance of a stockholder at a meeting, in person or by proxy,
without protesting prior to the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting.

Section 1.05. Business to be Considered. Only those matters stated
to be considered in the notice of the meeting, or of which written notice has
been given to the Corporation either by personal delivery to the Chairman of
the Board or the Secretary or by U.S. mail, postage prepaid, of a stockholder's
intent to bring the matter before the meeting, may be considered at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders. Such notice shall be received no later than 120 days
in advance of the date on which the Corporation's proxy statement was released
to stockholders in connection with the previous year's Annual Meeting.

Only that business brought before a special meeting pursuant to the
notice of the meeting may be conducted or considered at such meeting.

Only such business brought before an annual or special meeting of
stockholders pursuant to these bylaws shall be eligible to be conducted or
considered at such meetings.

Section 1.06. Quorum. Except as otherwise required by law, by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by these bylaws, the presence, in person or by
proxy, of stockholders holding a majority of the stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders.
In case a quorum shall not be present at any meeting, a majority in interest of
the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall
have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until the requisite amount of stock entitled to
vote shall be present. At any such adjourned meeting at which the requisite
amount of stock entitled to vote shall be represented, any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
noticed; but only those stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting as
originally noticed shall be entitled to vote at any adjournment or adjournments
thereof.

Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a
meeting of stockholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote in the
election. Whenever any corporate action, other than the election of Directors,
is to be taken by vote of the stockholders, except as otherwise required by the

General Corporation Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, it
shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast on the proposal by the
holders of shares entitled to vote thereon at a meeting of stockholders.

Section 1.07. Inspectors at Stockholders' Meetings. The Board of
Directors, in advance of any stockholders' meeting, shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a
written report thereof. In case any inspector or alternate appointed is unable
to act, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the
discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the
duties of inspector 

<PAGE> 3
at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to
the best of his ability.

The inspectors shall determine the number of shares outstanding and
the voting power of each, and shares represented at the meeting, the existence
of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes,
ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in
connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or
consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the
election or vote the fairness to all stockholders. On request of the person
presiding at the meeting or any stockholder entitled to vote thereat, the
inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter
determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact found by them. Any
report or certificate made by them shall be prima facie evidence of the facts
stated and of the vote as certified by them.

Section 1.08. Presiding Officer at Stockholders' Meetings. The
Chairman, or the President, shall preside at Stockholders' Meetings as more
particularly provided in Article III hereof. In the event that both the
Chairman and the President shall be absent or otherwise unable to preside, then
a majority of the Directors present at the meeting shall appoint one of the
Directors or some other appropriate person to preside.

<PAGE> 4
ARTICLE II
Directors

Section 2.01. Qualifications and Number; Term; Vacancies. A Director
need not be a stockholder, a citizen of the United States, or a resident of the
State of Delaware. The number of Directors constituting the entire Board shall
be not less than five nor more than twelve, the exact number of Directors to be
determined from time to time by resolution adopted by affirmative vote of a
majority of the entire Board of Directors. The Directors shall be divided into
three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall
consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of
Directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. Directors shall be
nominated and serve for such terms, and vacancies shall be filled, as provided
in the Certificate of Incorporation. Directors may be removed only for cause.

Section 2.02. Place and Time of Meetings of the Board. Regular and
special meetings of the Board shall be held at such places (within or without
the State of Delaware) and at such times as may be fixed by the Board or upon
call of the Chairman of the Board or of the executive committee or of any two
Directors, provided that the Board of Directors shall hold at least four
meetings a year.

Section 2.03. Quorum and Manner of Acting. A majority of the entire
Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business,
but if there shall be less than a quorum at any meeting of the Board, a
majority of those present (or if only one be present, then that one) may
adjourn the meeting from time to time and the meeting may be held as adjourned
without further notice. Except as provided to the contrary by the General
Corporation Law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these bylaws, at all
meetings of Directors, a quorum being present, all matters shall be decided by
the vote of a majority of the Directors present at the time of the vote.

Section 2.04. Remuneration of Directors. In addition to
reimbursement for his reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings or
otherwise in connection with his attention to the affairs of the Corporation,
each Director as such, and as a member of any committee of the Board, shall be
entitled to receive such remuneration as may be fixed from time to time by the
Board.

Section 2.05. Notice of Meetings of the Board. Regular meetings of
the Board may be held without notice if the time and place of such meetings are
fixed by the Board. All regular meetings of the Board, the time and place of
which have not been fixed by the Board, and all special meetings of the Board
shall be held upon twenty-four hours' notice to the Directors given by letter
or telegraph. No notice need specify the purpose of the meeting. Any
requirement of notice shall be effectively waived by any Director who signs a
waiver of notice before or after the meeting or who attends the meeting without
protesting (prior thereto or at its commencement) the lack of notice to him;
provided, however, that a regular meeting of the Board may be held without
notice immediately following the annual meeting of the stockholders at the same
place as such meeting was held, for the purpose of electing officers and a
Chairman of the Board for the ensuing year.

Section 2.06. Executive Committee and Other Committees. The Board of
Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, may
designate from among its members an Executive Committee and other committees to
serve at the pleasure of the Board. Each Committee shall consist of such
number of Directors as shall be specified by the Board in the resolution
designating the Committee. Except as set forth below, the Executive Committee
shall have all of the authority of the Board of Directors. Each other

<PAGE> 5

committee shall be empowered to perform such functions, as may, by resolution,
be delegated to it by the Board.

The Board of Directors may designate one or more Directors as
alternate members of any such committee, who may replace any absent member or
members at any meetings of such committee. Vacancies in any committee, whether
caused by resignation or by increase in the number of members constituting said
committee, shall be filled by a majority of the entire Board of Directors. The
Executive Committee may fix its own quorum and elect its own Chairman. In the
absence or disqualification of any member of any such committee, the member or
members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting whether
or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member
of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or
disqualified member.

Section 2.07. Action Without Meeting. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any
committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting, if prior to such action a
written consent thereto is signed by all members of the Board, or of such
committee as the case may be, and such written consent if filed with the
minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee.

ARTICLE III
Officers

Section 3.01. Officers. The Board of Directors, at its first meeting
held after the annual meeting of stockholders in each year shall elect a
Chairman of the Board, a President, one or more Vice Presidents, a Secretary, a
Treasurer and a Controller, and may, in its discretion, also appoint from time
to time, such other officers or agents as it may deem proper. The Chairman
shall be elected from among the members of the Board of Directors.

Any two or more offices may be held by the same person.

Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of election or

Section 3.03. Chairman Emeritus. If the Board shall elect a Chairman
Emeritus, he or she shall, at the request of the Chairman of the Board or in
his absence or inability to act if the Board shall not designate another
member, preside at the meetings of the Board. The Chairman Emeritus shall also
perform such duties

<PAGE> 6
which may be assigned to him by the Chairman of the Board.

Section 3.04. President. At the request of the Chairman of the Board

papers of the corporation, and shall perform all duties incident to his office.
In case of the absence or disability of the Secretary, his duties and powers
may be exercised by such person as may be appointed by the Board of Directors
or the Executive Committee.

Section 3.06. Treasurer. The Treasurer shall receive all the monies
belonging to the Corporation, and shall forthwith deposit the same to the

the Board of Directors or the Executive Committee. He shall keep books of

other duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or Executive
Committee or the President and in case of the absence or disability of the
