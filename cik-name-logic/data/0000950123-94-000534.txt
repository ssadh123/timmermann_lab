Recent Developments

Set forth below is some important information regarding 
Hecla Mining Company which should be carefully considered 
by the shareholders of Equinox Resources Ltd. in deciding 
how to vote with respect to the Arrangement. Information 
contained herein should be read together with Equinox's 
Management Information Circular dated January 17, 1994.

New York Stock Exchange Approval

On February 16, 1994, Hecla received notice from the New 
York Stock Exchange that the shares of Hecla Common Stock 
to be issued to Equinox shareholders in the Arrangement had 
been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, 
subject to approval of the Arrangement by the Equinox 
shareholders and the Ontario Court of Justice (General 
Division).

Recent Results

On February 3, 1994, Hecla reported its fourth quarter and 
year-end results for 1993. A copy of Hecla's press release 
announcing these results is enclosed for your information.

Granduc Mines

On January 24, 1994, Hecla sold its entire share holdings in 
Granduc Mines Limited, a Vancouver British Columbia based 
company, by selling a total of 2,815,300 Granduc Mines 
Limited shares to two Toronto based companies.

Sale of Grouse Creek Joint Venture Interest

On February 8, 1994, Great Lakes Minerals Inc. of Toronto 
purchased for US$13,280,857 a 20% undivided interest in 
Hecla's Grouse Creek Gold Project. Pursuant to the 
acquisition and joint venture agreements Great Lakes entered 
into with Hecla, Great Lakes is required to fund its 20% pro 
rata portion of capital expenditures required to bring the 
Grouse Creek Gold Project to commercial production (including 
its portion of capital expenditures incurred to date). In 
addition, these agreements provide that Great Lakes has the 
option at any time prior to 12 months following the 
commencement of commercial production at the Grouse Creek 
Gold Project to purchase up to an additional 10% undivided 
interest in the Project. Under its agreements with Hecla, 
Great Lakes would pay Hecla an amount estimated at 
approximately US$277,000 for each additional 1% undivided 
interest in the Grouse Creek Gold Project, and in addition 
fund its increased share of capital expenditures.

Great Lakes funded the purchase of its 20% interest in the 
Grouse Creek Gold Project from the sale in an underwritten 
public offering of 17,500,000 Great Lakes Common Shares at 
a price of C$2.00 per Common Share for gross proceeds of 
C$35,000,000. Great Lakes is required to fund its portion 
of the capital expenditure requirements for the Grouse Creek 
Gold Project with the net proceeds of this offering. 
Pursuant to its agreements with Great Lakes, Hecla purchased 
825,000 Great Lakes Common Shares at the offering price of 
C$2.00 per Common Share, using US$1,229,875 of the proceeds 
received by Hecla for the purchase of Great Lakes' interest 
in the Grouse Creek Gold Project. In addition, as part of 
this transaction, Great Lakes issued Hecla a warrant 
entitling Hecla to acquire up to 500,000 additional Great 
Lakes Common Shares at C$2.50 per share, subject to 
adjustment in certain circumstances.

Common Stock Issuances Related to Hecla LYONs

As described on pages A-29 to A-30 and page A-36 of 
Equinox's Management Information Circular, Hecla currently 
has outstanding US$109,950,000 aggregate principal amount of 
Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2004 ("LYONs"), which are 
currently convertible into 20.824 shares of Hecla Common 
Stock per US$1,000 principal amount of LYONs. Pursuant to 
the terms of the indenture governing the LYONs, on June 14, 
1994, holders of LYONs may require Hecla to purchase LYONs 
held by them (the "Put Feature") at a purchase price of 
US$456.39 per US$1,000 principal amount of LYONs. The 
purchase price may be paid, at the option of Hecla, in cash, 
in shares of Hecla Common Stock (valued at the market price 
of the Common Stock) or in Hecla Subordinated Extension 
Notes due 2004. Due to Hecla's need to utilize cash for 
planned capital expenditures, it is probable that, absent 
any action by Hecla, Hecla will pay for any LYONs delivered 
to it pursuant to the Put Feature by issuing Hecla Common 
Stock. Hecla is unable to predict how many LYONs it may be 
required to purchase pursuant to the Put Feature and Hecla 
cannot predict what effect the Put Feature will have on the 
market price of Hecla Common Stock.

Hecla, with the assistance of its financial and legal 
advisors, is currently considering several alternatives 
with respect to how to best deal with the Put Feature. 
Among the alternatives being examined by Hecla are the sale 
of additional shares of Hecla Common Stock (or other Hecla 
securities) with the proceeds of such an offering being used 
to pay cash for LYONs delivered to Hecla pursuant to the Put 
Feature (and any remaining proceeds would be used for Hecla 
capital expenditures). Hecla is also considering amending 
certain terms of the LYONs in order to make it less likely 
that the Put Feature will be exercised on June 14, 1994, 
including changing the conversion ratio to increase the 
number of shares of Hecla Common Stock that would be issuable 
upon conversion of each LYON. If either of these 
alternatives is pursued, then additional shares of Hecla 
Common Stock could be issued, although Hecla's intent with 
respect to these alternatives is to issue less shares of 
Hecla Common Stock (other than any securities sold to raise 
additional funds for capital expenditures) than would be the 
case if Hecla was required to repurchase all of the 
outstanding LYONs pursuant to the Put Feature on June 14, 
1994. However, as described on page A-36 of the Equinox 
Management Information Circular, if Hecla takes no action 
with respect to the Put Feature and Hecla is required to 
purchase all of the outstanding LYONs on June 14, 1994, 
based upon current market prices (US$12.25 on February 15, 
1994), Hecla would have to issue approximately 4,100,000 
shares of Hecla Common Stock. There can be no assurance 
that Hecla will determine to pursue, or be successful in 
pursuing, any alternative (including and in addition to the 
alternatives discussed above) to reduce the likelihood that 
the Put Feature will result in the issuance of a significant 
amount of Hecla Common Stock.

For additional information with respect to the Put Feature, 
see pages A-29 to A-30 and A-36 of Equinox's Management 
Information Circular.

[HECLA MINING COMPANY LETTERHEAD]

FOURTH QUARTER REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS
FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31, 1993

FEBRUARY 3, 1994
HECLA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS

COEUR D'ALENE, IDAHO -- Hecla Mining Company (HL:NYSE) today reported a
net loss of $3.8 million on revenue of $19.5 million for the fourth quarter of
1993. After a $2 million dividend to preferred shareholders, the Company's
loss for the 1993 quarter amounted to $5.8 million, or 17 cents per common
share. This is in contrast to a net loss of $51.1 million, or $1.65 per common
share, for the same period of 1992.

For the year, Hecla reported a net loss of $11.7 million on revenue of
$84.8 million. After preferred dividends of $4.1 million, the Company's loss
for 1993 amounted to $15.8 million, or 48 cents per common share. This
compares with a loss of $49.3 million, or $1.60 a share, on revenue of $113.1
million for 1992. In 1992, noncash asset write-downs and reclamation accruals
of $41 million made up the bulk of the loss. In 1993, similar charges to
earnings accounted for $2.5 million of the loss. Total revenue for 1993
declined 25 percent compared with 1992 mainly as the result of curtailed metals
production at the silver operations and lower grade ore being mined at the
Republic mine. Lead and zinc, important byproducts of Hecla's silver
operations, were affected by severely depressed prices with lead at an
eight-year low. Reduced production and low lead and zinc prices offset the
fourth quarter improvement in precious metals prices. "We are encouraged by
the recent strength of the precious metals market, and that lead and zinc
prices have also begun to trend upward," said Arthur Brown, chairman, president
and chief executive officer.

On December 29, 1993, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire
Equinox Resources Ltd. (EQX:TSE) of Vancouver, British Columbia, for 0.3 of a
share of Hecla common stock for each share of Equinox's outstanding common
stock. Due diligence by both parties has been satisfactorily completed. The
agreement will be presented for approval at a meeting of Equinox shareholders
on February 25, 1994. The acquisition immediately brings Hecla 30,000 ounces
of annual gold production from the American Girl mine in southern California,
plus a suite of promising gold and silver exploration projects. Equinox's
Rosebud deposit in northern Nevada has the potential to add more than 70,000
ounces of annual gold production to Hecla's account.

Hecla's first operation outside the United States and Canada began
production early in 1994. The La Choya mine, located in Sonora, Mexico, is
expected to produce 63,000 ounces of gold in 1994. "This area of Mexico is
drawing intense interest from other gold companies, and we believe our presence
there positions Hecla well to participate in the future growth of mining in
that country," Brown said.

During the fourth quarter, Hecla exchanged 655,000 common shares for all
the outstanding common shares of Mountain West Products in Rexburg, Idaho. The
acquisition will strengthen the Company's position in the landscape products
market with volcanic scoria, pumice and soil additives.

Hecla Mining Company has its headquarters in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. During
its 103-year history, Hecla has been a leading U.S. producer of silver and
lead, and more recently a significant supplier of gold and industrial minerals.
