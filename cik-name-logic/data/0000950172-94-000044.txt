For immediate release March 7, 1994

The Federal Reserve Board today announced it will defer

action on a petition by the Shawmut National Corporation seeking

reconsideration of the Board's decision dated November 15, 1993,

the results of the most recent fair lending examinations and a

Reserve Bank audit of data reported under the Home Mortgage

Disclosure Act for Shawmut's subsidiary banks and its mortgage

The Board is also providing an opportunity for public

comment on Shawmut's request for reconsideration. Comments must

be received no later than March 31, 1994.

The Board expects to consider the petition no later than

May 2, 1994.
