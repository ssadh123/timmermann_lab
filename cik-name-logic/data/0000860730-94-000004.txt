Columbia Healthcare Corporation and HCA - Hospital Corporation of America
Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial 
statements supplement the pro forma information included in the 
Registration Statement on Form S-4 (No. 33-50735), as amended, 
filed by Columbia on December 14, 1993 in connection with the Merger. 

These pro forma financial statements are presented using the pooling of 
interests method of accounting, and reflect the combination of the 
historical consolidated financial data of Columbia and HCA as if the 
Merger had been consummated at the beginning of the earliest period 
presented. 

The pro forma financial statements should be read in 
conjunction with the pro forma financial information included in the 
aforementioned Registration Statement and the related historical 
consolidated financial statements of Columbia and HCA. 

Note 2 - Earnings per Common and Common Equivalent Share 

For all applicable periods presented in the pro forma condensed 
combined statements of income, shares used in the computation of 
earnings per common and common equivalent share give effect to the 
issuance of 1.05 shares of Columbia common stock in exchange for each 
share of HCA common stock held. 

Shares used in the computation of earnings per common and common 
equivalent share totaled 328,563,900 for the year ended December 31, 1992, 
and 338,744,300 and 324,874,000 for the nine months ended 
September 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Earnings per common and 
common equivalent share are not presented for periods prior to the 
initial public offering of HCA Class A Common Stock in March 1992. 

Note 3 - Income Taxes 

Prior to the Merger, both Columbia and HCA had adopted the provisions of 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for 
Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"), as of January 1, 1992, the cumulative effect 
of which increased 1992 net income by $51 million. On April 1, 1989, HCA 
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 
96, "Accounting for Income Taxes," in connection with the acquisition of 
the common stock of then publicly held Hospital Corporation of America by 
a management-led investor group. 

Had the provisions of SFAS 109 been adopted in 1989, provision for income 
taxes for subsequent periods would not have been materially affected.
