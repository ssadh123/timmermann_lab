Exhibit 99

LEAPS & BOUNDS MERGES WITH DISCOVERY ZONE; MCDONALD'S, BLOCKBUSTER AND
DISCOVERY ZONE JOIN FORCES IN FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT

CHICAGO, IL (July 18, 1994) -- Discovery Zone, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZONE) and
McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) today announced that they have reached an
agreement in principle by which Discovery Zone will acquire all of the
outstanding capital stock of Leaps & Bounds, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
McDonald's. Discovery Zone will issue to McDonald's 5,500,000 shares of
Discovery Zone common stock for the acquisition, which shares will be subject
to restrictions on resale and to adjustment under certain circumstances
customary in transactions of this type. Further terms of the transaction were
not disclosed. Leaps & Bounds owns and operates 49 children's indoor
entertainment and fitness facilities and certain related real estate across the
United States.

Discovery Zone also reported that Blockbuster Entertainment
Corporation (NYSE: BV) reached an agreement in principle to exercise its option
to increase its equity interest in Discovery Zone to 50.1 percent. Blockbuster
currently owns approximately 20 percent of Discovery Zone's common stock.
Blockbuster will acquire most of the additional shares of Discovery Zone from
DKB Investments, L.P., which is currently Discovery Zone's largest stockholder.

Separately, Discovery Zone and Blockbuster announced that they have
reached an agreement in principle whereby Discovery Zone will acquire all of
the franchised Discovery Zone FunCenters and territories currently owned by
Blockbuster. Discovery Zone will issue to Blockbuster 4,500,000 shares of
Discovery Zone common stock for the acquisition, which shares will be subject
to adjustment under certain circumstances customary in transactions of this
type. Blockbuster currently owns and operates 57 FunCenters.

Donald F. Flynn, Discovery Zone's Chairman and CEO, said, "Today marks
the beginning of a cooperative venture among Discovery Zone, Blockbuster and
McDonald's that results in a winning combination in children's entertainment.
The merger of the two pioneers in the industry -- Discovery Zone and Leaps &
Bounds -- combined with the ideas and resources of McDonald's and Blockbuster,
will produce a formidable company of enormous value to our customers and our
stockholders.

"Blockbuster was an early supporter of our concept, and has been an
outstanding partner in developing it. The exercise of their option is further
evidence of that support. Our acquisition of their FunCenters and territories
allows us to more efficiently develop our business and combine our resources.

"We welcome McDonald's as an equity investor in Discovery Zone, and we
look forward to a mutually beneficial relationship."

Michael R. Quinlan, Chairman and CEO of McDonald's Corporation, said,
"Combining Leaps & Bounds with Discovery Zone allows McDonald's to share in the
future growth in this dynamic industry, while also enabling us to stay sharply
focused on our global foodservice business."

Quinlan added that he expects the transaction to have an insignificant
impact on 1994 financial results.

H. Wayne Huizenga, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Blockbuster, commented that "the combination of Discovery Zone and Leaps &
Bounds creates a preeminent children's entertainment company. Out-of-home
entertainment for children is a rapidly expanding industry both domestically
and internationally. Our increased ownership of Discovery Zone will enable us
to capitalize on these growth opportunities while at the same time realizing
the benefits of cross-promoting these businesses with our video and music
stores."

Consummation of all three transactions is expected to occur in August
1994 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including expiration of
the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.
