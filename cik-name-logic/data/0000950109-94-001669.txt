BOATMEN'S BANCSHARES SIGNS AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE
WORTHEN

LITTLE ROCK, AR, AUGUST 18, 1994-- Worthen Banking Corporation (ASE:WOR)
announced that it has agreed to be acquired by Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.
(NASDAQ;BOAT), headquartered in St. Louis, in a stock transaction valued at
approximately $595 million.

Under terms of the agreement, Boatmen's will exchange one share of its
common stock for each share of Worthen's. As of August 18, 1994, Worthen had
17.033 million shares issued and outstanding. Fully diluted to recognize
outstanding options, the number of Worthen shares would be approximately 17.34
million shares.

Curt Bradbury, chairman and chief executive officer of Worthen Banking
Corporation, commented, "Based on Worthen's strong record of performance, a
number of strategic alternatives have been considered by Worthen over the past
year. We are pleased with this agreement because it provides attractive rewards
for our shareholders and the financial strength of Boatmen's will significantly
expand the quality and convenience of service to customers in Arkansas and
Texas. Boatmen's has a long, proud tradition: Founded in 1847, it is the
oldest banking organization west of the Mississippi River." Bradbury continued,
"Boatmen's brings to us the resources of a $28 billion company."

Andrew B. Craig, III, chairman and chief executive officer of Boatmen's
Bancshares, pointed out, "We are extremely pleased with the opportunity to
significantly expand our existing franchise in Arkansas. Worthen fits our
acquisition criteria perfectly, with superior asset quality and an excellent
management team." Craig added, "Through our Superior Federal subsidiary we are
quite familiar with Arkansas and know that this is an excellent state in which
to do business. Our philosophy has always been that the vast majority of loan
decisions are made at the local level and we look forward to serving the needs
of the consumer and commercial markets."

Superior Federal, based in Fort Smith, has 39 locations in Arkansas and 18
locations in Oklahoma. As of June 30, 1994, Superior Federal's assets were
about $1.2 billion.

The transaction is expected to close by the first quarter of 1995, subject
to regulatory approvals and approval by Worthen shareholders.

Both companies reported strong financial results for the first half of
1994. Worthen earned $23.8 million, an increase of 16 percent over year-ago
results, excluding nonrecurring items, while Boatmen's posted record net income
of $173.6 million, representing an increase of 9 percent over the comparable
year-earlier period.

Worthen is the second largest bank holding company in Arkansas, with
approximately $3.5 billion in assets and $3.0 billion in deposits as of June 30,
1994. The company operates 112 retail banking offices in Arkansas and six
offices in the Austin, Texas area.

Boatmen's Bancshares, with assets of approximately $28 billion, is one of
the 30 largest U. S. bank holding companies, operating more than 400 locations
in nine states -- Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas.
