Item 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On March 14, 1994, a proposed settlement of the pending class
action securities litigation against Western Digital Corporation (the
"Company") which had been previously agreed to by all parties received
preliminary court approval. This litigation was initiated in July 1991 and
consolidated in federal district court in Santa Ana, California on September 4,
1991 (In re Western Digital Securities Litigation, Master File No. SA CV 91-375
GLT (RWRx)). In the litigation, brought by plaintiffs' representatives on
behalf of persons who purchased the Company's securities between April 20, 1990
and February 8, 1991, it was alleged that the Company and its former chief
executive officer made false and misleading statements about the Company in
violation of federal securities laws. The class period was later extended
through and including March 18, 1993. Pursuant to the proposed settlement,
subject to final approval by the federal district court, the Company and its
insurance carrier will make available on a claims made basis up to $6.75
million, comprised of $3.5 million in cash and the balance in shares of the
Company's common stock, to be used for settlement payments to eligible class
members who submit appropriate proofs of claim, and to pay class notification
costs, attorneys' fees of plaintiffs' counsel and any other costs of
administering the settlement. The Company has the right, at its option, to pay
its portion of the settlement in cash in lieu of making any stock distribution.
Detailed information concerning settlement procedures will be published in the
near future.

Although the Company and its former chief executive officer
deny all charges of wrongdoing and do not concede any liability, the Company
believes the settlement is appropriate to put to rest all further controversy
and to avoid substantial expenses and the inconvenience and distraction of
burdensome and protracted litigation.

Based upon the agreed upon contribution by the Company's
insurance carrier as well as reserves previously provided by the Company, the
settlement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial
condition or future operating results.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND
