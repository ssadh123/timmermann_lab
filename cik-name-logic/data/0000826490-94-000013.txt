COLUMBIA/HCA HEALTHCARE CORPORATION
AND HEALTHTRUST, INC.
ANNOUNCE PLANNED MERGER TO CREATE 
$15 BILLION COMPANY

LOUISVILLE, Ky., and NASHVILLE, Tenn., 
Oct. 4, 1994 - In a merger creating a 
$15 billion healthcare provider, Columbia/HCA 
Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:COL) and 
HealthTrust, Inc. - The Hospital Company 
(NYSE:HTI) today jointly announced the 
signing of a definitive agreement to merge 
in a tax-free, stock-for- stock transaction.

Under the terms of the merger agreement 
approved today by the boards of both 
companies, HTI shareholders would receive 
0.88 of a share of Columbia common stock 
in exchange for each HTI share held. 
Following the merger, there will be 
approximately 452 million shares of 
Columbia common stock outstanding. It 
is anticipated that the proposed merger 
will be tax-free to HTI shareholders and 
accounted for as a pooling- of-interests.

After the merger, Columbia will own and 
operate 311 hospitals with approximately 
60,000 licensed beds and 125 outpatient 
centers in 37 states and 2 foreign countries. 
The combined companies have approximately 
170,000 employees and total assets and 
annual revenues of over $15 billion.

The companies anticipate annual savings 
of approximately $125 million from cost 
reductions and improved efficiencies 
resulting from this consolidation. By 
leveraging their economies of scale and 
collective strengths and efficiencies, 
the companies believe they can greatly 
control healthcare costs while maintaining 
quality patient care.

"We have heard the nation's call to reform, 
and we are responding to improve the 
system for patients, physicians and 
purchasers. Our continued growth is 
generating dramatic changes in the delivery 
of healthcare services in this country, and 
they are changes for the better," said 
Richard L. Scott, President and Chief Executive 
Officer of Columbia. "Healthcare historically 
has been a fragmented industry, lacking 
accountability and quality standards. As 
we bring providers together into an 
integrated system, we can improve quality 
and efficiency and realize within this 
industry the benefits that size has 
created within other American industries," 
Scott added.

R. Clayton McWhorter, HealthTrust's Chairman, 
President and Chief Executive Officer said, 
"The combination of these two companies 
represents a marketplace response to 
the rapidly changing healthcare 
environment. This consolidation will 
enhance our efforts with physicians 
and managed care organizations as we 
together seek cost- efficient, quality 
results."

When the merger is consummated, 
R. Clayton McWhorter will be Chairman 
of the Board, Thomas F. Frist, Jr., M.D. 
will be Vice Chairman, Richard L. Scott 
will be President and Chief Executive 
Officer, David T. Vandewater will be 
Chief Operating Officer and David C. 
Colby will be Chief Financial Officer. 
Subject to stockholder approval, the 
combined entity's board of directors 
will consist of 15 current Columbia 
directors and 3 of the current HealthTrust 
directors. It is anticipated that 
Columbia will continue its existing 
dividend policy of $0.03 per share 
per quarter.

The transaction is conditioned upon 
confirmation that the transaction 
qualifies as a pooling-of-interests, 
approval by shareholders of both 
companies, approval under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and 
other customary conditions. Shareholders 
meetings to vote on the proposed merger 
transaction are anticipated during the 
first quarter of 1995.

Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated is 
serving as financial advisor to Columbia 
and has rendered a fairness opinion to the
Columbia board of directors. Merrill Lynch & Co. 
is serving in the same capacity to 
HealthTrust and has rendered a fairness 
opinion to HealthTrust's board of directors 
with respect to the proposed combination.

Columbia currently operates 195 
hospitals with 44,000 beds and 125 
outpatient centers. Columbia provided 
$700 million in uncompensated patient 
care and paid $711 million in federal, 
state and local taxes in 1993. 
HealthTrust currently operates 116 
hospitals with 16,000 beds through 
which it provides a variety of inpatient 
and outpatient services. HealthTrust 
provided $240 million in uncompensated 
patient care and paid $230 million in 
taxes in 1993.
