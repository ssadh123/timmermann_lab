Registrant has been notified by the U.S. Environmental

subsidiary of Registrant now in receivership of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, "from its list
of potentially responsible parties" for the Silresim

notification stated that it does not intend to take
further steps to hold Registrant, State Street Bank

the Site or for the cleanup costs associated with the
Site; the EPA did reserve its rights to reassess this
determination if new facts are discovered in the 
future.
