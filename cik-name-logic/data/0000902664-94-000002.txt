Toys "R" US ANNOUNCES EXPANSION PLANS FOR 1994

--Company Also Creates Franchise Division To 
Further Accelerate Growth--

BOARD AUTHORIZES $1 BILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

PARAMUS, NJ, January ll, l994 -- Toys "R" Us, Inc. today
announced the largest expansion program in the company's
history. During l994, Toys "R" Us expects to open ll5 new
company-owned toy stores and in addition it will franchise
other stores in select international markets. 

Charles Lazarus, Chairman said, "We see a tremendous
opportunity for Toys "R" Us to build world market share over
the next few years and we intend to aggressively build our
worldwide toy retailing business, capitalizing on
opportunities to strengthen our presence in current markets
and to enter new markets."

Mr. Lazarus said that Toys "R" Us recently created a
franchising division to enable the company to accelerate the
expansion of the Toys "R" Us concept throughout the world. 
<PAGE>
In that regard, the company announced that it had entered
into a franchise agreement with Al Futtaim Sons Co., an
experienced entrepreneurial family, in the United Arab
Emirates, under which Al Futtaim Sons will operate Toys "R"
Us stores in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman,
and Kuwait. 

Another franchise agreement has been signed with a major
Saudi Arabian group for the development of toy stores in
Saudi Arabia. 

"Through these franchise agreements, we will be using the
resources of highly respected and successful local business
people throughout parts of the world that would not normally
be developed by Toys "R" Us itself for many years," Mr.
Lazarus said. "All of the franchise stores will be operated
in accordance with Toys "R" Us standards."

Mr. Lazarus said that under the terms of the first two
agreements, Toys "R" Us will receive significant royalty and
other related service fees over the initial l2 year franchise
period. These fees are anticipated to provide meaningful
cash flow and earnings for our international division. 
<PAGE>
"We believe that the franchising concept will enable us to
bring additional countries into the Toys "R" Us family on an
accelerated basis," Mr. Lazarus concluded. 

These franchise stores are in addition to 45 new toy stores
that will be opened in the United States and 70 new Toys "R"
Us stores that will be opened in other countries during l994.

Toys "R" Us also announced that its Board of Directors has
authorized the investment of up to $l billion to buy back
shares of the Company's outstanding common stock over the
next several years. 

Mr. Lazarus said, "Despite the aggressive expansion plans in
l994, Toys "R" Us is generating substantial excess cash flow. 
We believe that in addition to investing in our on-going
business, the repurchase of Toys "R" Us common stock, from
time to time in the open market or in negotiated
transactions, will increase shareholder value."

Toys "R" Us is the world's largest and fastest growing
children's specialty retailing chain currently operating 58l
toy stores in the United States, 234 international toy stores
and 2l7 Kids "R" Us children's clothing stores.
