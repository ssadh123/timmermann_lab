BORDEN TO RESTATE FINANCIAL RESULTS RELATING TO 1992 RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1993 Restructuring Charge Unaffected
Restatement To Have No Impact on 1994 Financial Results

NEW YORK, March 21, 1994 -- Borden, Inc. (NYSE: BN) today announced that
it will restate net income and other financial results for 1992 and 1993, as a
result of reversing and reclassifying certain expenses and accruals that had
been included in its 1992 restructuring charge.
The net loss for 1992 will decrease by $75.2 million, or $0.53 per
share, to a restated $364.4 million, or $2.54 per share. Partly offsetting
this, the net loss for 1993 will increase by $37.1 million, or $0.26 per
share, to a restated $630.7 million, or $4.47 per share.
For the two years taken together, the Company's restated net loss will
be less than originally reported by $38.1 million, or $0.27 per share.
Borden's decision to restate followed comments from and discussions with
the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In response to the
views expressed by the SEC staff, Borden will classify certain expenses and
accruals as cost of goods sold or as marketing, general and administrative
expenses in the years incurred, instead of as restructuring charges in 1992.
The 1992 and 1993 restatements will have no impact on 1994 financial
results, nor are they related to Borden's charge in the fourth quarter of
1993, which included provisions for restructuring and the planned divestment
of businesses accounting for nearly 20 percent of the Company's annual sales.

1992 and 1993 Restatements
- --------------------------
Borden originally reported a 1992 pretax restructuring charge of $642.0
million. After reclassifications and reversals, the restated 1992 charge will
be reduced by $264.8 million to $377.2 million.
A $145.5 million portion of the reduction will be reclassified as 1992
operating expenses, as they were incurred during the year, with no effect on
full-year income. The reclassified amounts principally include promotional
accruals, asset writedowns, and environmental and litigation charges.
The $119.3 million balance of the reduction will be reversed, which will
decrease the Company's restated net loss for 1992 to $364.4 million. The
reversed amount includes accruals for projects canceled subsequent to
recording of the 1992 charge and promotional accruals.
Certain of the canceled projects and promotional accruals will represent
additional 1993 operating expenses of $59.8 million, causing the 1993 net loss
to increase to $630.7 million.
