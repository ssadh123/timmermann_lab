THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC. ANNOUNCES
RECORD YEAR;
REPORTS RESULTS FOR FOURTH QUARTER

New York, New York -- July 26, 1994 -- The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.
(NYSE:BSC) announced today earnings for the company's fiscal year and for
its fourth quarter ended June 30, 1994. The company reported record
earnings for fiscal 1994 despite difficult conditions impacting the fourth
quarter results.

Net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 was $387.0
million, an increase of 7% from the $362.4 million earned during the
twelve months ended June 30, 1993. Earnings per share for fiscal 1994
were $2.89, versus $2.86 last year. Revenues, net of interest expense,
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 were $2.4 billion, versus $2.1
billion last year.

Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 fell 74% to $32.4
million, or 21 cents per share, versus $124.8 million, or 97 cents per
share for the comparable quarter last year. Revenues, net of interest
expense, for the fourth quarter ended June 30, 1994 were $429.9 million,
versus $679.9 million for the fourth quarter a year ago.

The company said that lower results for the fourth quarter
reflected the difficult operating environment and uncertain interest rate
levels. Both principal transactions and investment banking revenues were
down from the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993. Commission revenues
increased slightly from the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, attributable
to increased clearance, futures and institutional activity.

Commenting on the results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter,
President and Chief Executive Officer James E. Cayne said "We are very
proud of the high level of performance of all our associates during the
difficult operating environment late in the year. Despite the challenges
of unsettled equity and fixed income markets, we achieved our second
consecutive record year with a pre-tax return on equity of 38.7%."

"Our correspondent clearing business remains robust and was a
significant contributor to the record results for the year. In contrast
to the volatile conditions that confronted other segments of our business
during the fourth quarter, this area provided tremendous stability."

"We continue to invest in Bear Stearns' future. Domestic and
international expansion remains a priority with the goal of further
enhancing the firm's powerful franchise. The synergy and growth of the
company has led to a third consecutive record year in investment banking
where revenues increased 41% from fiscal 1993. Commission revenues were
also at a record high, up 15% from fiscal 1993, primarily due to increased
activity."

of Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., a leading worldwide investment banking and
