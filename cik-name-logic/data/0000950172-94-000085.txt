FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SHAWMUT NATIONAL SCHEDULED TO COMPLETE ACQUISITION
OF PEOPLES BANCORP OF WORCESTER ON MAY 23

BOSTON, Mass. and HARTFORD, Conn., May 9, 1994 - Shawmut
National Corporation (NYSE: SNC) today said that it has
scheduled its acquisition of Peoples Bancorp of Worcester
Inc. (NASDAQ: PEBW) to close on May 23, following
notification that the Federal Reserve had waived
jurisdiction over the matter,

In connection with the acquisition, each outstanding
share of common stock of Peoples will be exchanged for
2.444 shares of Shawmut National common stock. Peoples
had 3,376,636 common shares outstanding, as of May 6.

The receipt of a waiver of jurisdiction from the Federal
Reserve made the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency the primary regulator for the transaction. The
OCC previously approved Shawmut's application on March
30. Peoples shareholders approved the transaction on May
4.

Peoples Bancorp has assets of $870 million and 23
branches of Peoples Savings Bank in central
Massachusetts.

With assets of $27 billion, Shawmut National serves
consumers, businesses, institutions, and government in
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island through a
network of about 270 branches and 450 ATM's.
