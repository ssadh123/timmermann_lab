ITEM 5. OTHER MATERIALLY IMPORTANT EVENTS
======================================================
On Tuesday, November 8, 1994, the Interstate Commerce Commission (the "ICC")
voted to grant a petition by CSX Transportation Company seeking removal of
certain conditions which governed the merger of the Seaboard Airline Company
and the Atlantic CoastLine Railroad. The Florida East Coast Railway Company
(the "Company") opposed the petition on the ground that the requested action
would be anti-competitive and would be detrimental to the Company.

While the Company continues to believe that the merger conditions promoted
rail competition in Florida, at this time it cannot state with any certainty
what impact the action of the ICC will have upon the Company. The Company
has the right to appeal the final order of the ICC and will reserve its
determination as to further action until the ICC issues its decision and
order. The ICC did not indicate the date on which the decision and order
will be issued.

SIGNATURE
=========

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
