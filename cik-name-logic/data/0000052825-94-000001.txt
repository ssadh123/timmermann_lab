Item 5. Other Events.

(a) On December 22, 1993, one of Registrant's wholly owned subsidiaries,
ITT Commercial Finance Corp. ("ITTCMF"), sold approximately $ 2.4 billion in
floorplan receivables to a master trust which it had created for the purpose of
securitizing those receivables. The trust issued certificates to private
investors which represented undivided interests in the trust assets totalling
$1 billion. The trust also issued a certificate to an affiliate of the
Registrant representing an undivided interest in the remaining assets in the
trust of approximately $ 1.4 billion. From time to time ITTCMF intends to sell
additional receivables to the trust and may issue additional certificates with
respect thereto. ITTCMF continues to service the receivables included in the
trust's assets. Proceeds of the transaction were used to reduce the
Registrant's debt incurred in the ordinary course of its financing operations.

(b) In an unrelated transaction, during December, 1993 the Registrant's
indirect wholly owned subsidiary, ITT Federal Bank, fsb, sold approximately
$1.1 billion in mortgage receivables to an unaffiliated trust in exchange for
mortgage pass-through certificates in a like amount. 

Registrant's management anticipates that securitization of various assets of
Registrant's operating units will continue in the future as transactions in the
ordinary course of its financing activities and will be reflected in its
financial statements included in Forms 10-Q and 10-K.
