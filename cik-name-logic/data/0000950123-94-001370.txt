Whitehouse Station, N.J. August 16, 1994 -- Merck & Co., Inc.
announced today its intention to sell its specialty chemical units, Kelco and
Calgon Vestal Laboratories. The decision was made despite the fact that the
operating performances of both Kelco and Calgon Vestal have been and continue
to be excellent.
Merck President and CEO Ray Gilmartin said that the decision reflects
the Company's intention to focus its resources on its integrated pharmaceutical
and pharmacy benefits management business.
"We believe that by concentrating our resources on these areas, we can
remain a research-driven, premier-growth company, even in the face of the
challenging market conditions and government pressures on the pharmaceutical
industry," Mr. Gilmartin said. "By remaining a premier-growth company, one
whose performance puts it in the top tier of U.S. companies, Merck can continue
to fund the innovative research that serves patients, physicians, customers and
society."
Over the coming weeks, Merck and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., which is
assisting in the sales, will contact a limited number of prospective buyers and
begin a process that will lead to negotiations and the sale of the businesses.
Merck anticipates that this process will be completed by the end of the year.
Merck hopes to find buyers with strategic interests in focusing on the
continued growth and success of Kelco's and Calgon Vestal's businesses.
