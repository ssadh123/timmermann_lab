TEXACO INC. CLOSES SALE OF TEXACO CHEMICAL COMPANY
--------------------------------------------------
TO HUNTSMAN CORPORATION
-----------------------

FOR RELEASE: THURSDAY, APRIL 21, 1994.
- --------------------------------------
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., April 21 - Texaco Inc. announced today that it has
received $850 million as part of the previously announced sale of its wholly 
owned subsidiary, Texaco Chemical Company, and substantially all of its 
worldwide chemical operations, other than Texaco's lubricant additives 
business, to Huntsman Corporation, an affiliate of the Jon M. Huntsman Group 
of Companies.
The $850 million consists of $650 million in cash and $200 million in 
11-year subordinated notes. Not included in today's transaction is Texaco's
worldwide lubricant additives business, which Texaco is working in cooperation
with Huntsman Financial Corporation to sell to a third party. In the absence
of such a third-party sale, Huntsman Financial Corporation will acquire 
Texaco's lubricant additives business by September 30, 1994.
Texaco also granted today to Huntsman, for an additional $10 million in
cash, a two-year option to purchase either 50 percent or 100 percent of a
Texaco facility currently under construction in Port Neches, Texas, which will
produce 400 million pounds per year of propylene oxide and 14,000 barrels per
day of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE).
Texaco is retaining its fuel additives business, which is key to the
production of the company's advanced New CleanSystem3 gasolines. Texaco also
is retaining its solvent and intermediate chemicals operations at its El
Dorado, Kan., refinery and Star Enterprise's Delaware City refinery.
Commenting on the sale, Texaco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Alfred C. DeCrane, Jr., stated, "Texaco has improved its financial strength 
by monetizing assets which no longer fit the company's current business
strategies. The sale of these assets to Huntsman further enhances Texaco's
ability to provide greater value and return to its shareholders and under-
scores the company's program to focus on its core oil, gas and related
businesses."
Texaco Chemical Company markets a wide range of chemical commodities,
including ethylene, propylene and ethylene glycol. The company also produces
derivative specialty chemicals, particularly surfactants.

TEXACO REPORTS RESULTS
----------------------
FOR THE FIRST QUARTER 1994
--------------------------

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: MONDAY, APRIL 25, 1994.
- ----------------------------------------------
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., April 25 - Texaco Inc. announced today that 
consolidated worldwide net income from continuing operations for the first 
quarter of 1994 was $202 million, or $0.69 per share, as compared with $281 
million, or $0.98 per share, for the first quarter of 1993.
Prior to the restatement for the now discontinued chemical operations, 
results for the first quarter 1993 were $278 million, or $0.97 per share. 
In commenting on 1994's first quarter performance Alfred C. DeCrane, 
Jr., Texaco's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, stated, 
"Continued benefits from business process improvements, cost containment 
programs and increased international crude oil production levels were not 
enough to offset the impact of significantly reduced crude oil prices, which 
prevailed throughout the quarter. These prices were more than $4 per barrel 
below the U.S. prices of last year, and more than $3 per barrel lower inter-
nationally. The downstream business experienced strong operational perform-
ance, which included improved U.S. results on the East and Gulf Coasts. 
Natural gas prices in the U.S. were $0.33 per thousand cubic feet higher than 
in the first quarter 1993."

OPERATING EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS
PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS
UNITED STATES

Exploration and production earnings for the first quarter of 1994 were 
$75 million, as compared to $133 million for the first quarter 1993. The 
results for 1994 reflect crude oil prices that have declined sharply since 
last summer. Crude oil prices realized in the first quarter 1994 were $4.44 
per barrel lower than in the first quarter of 1993. However, upstream 
earnings benefitted somewhat from an increase in natural gas prices over the 
first quarter of last year. U.S. production for the 1994 quarter decreased, 
in part, as a result of sales and joint venturing of selected gas properties 
in late 1993.
Manufacturing and marketing results were $78 million for the first 
quarter of 1994, as compared to $49 million for the first quarter of 1993. 
Earnings for 1994 benefitted from higher margins, mainly on the East and Gulf 
Coasts, as a result of lower refinery feedstock costs. Partially offsetting 
the improved margins was scheduled maintenance in 1994, principally at the 
Puget Sound refinery in Washington state. Sales of branded gasoline showed a 
strong increase in March of 1994, reflecting the successful introduction of 
Texaco's New CleanSystem3 gasoline throughout the United States.

INTERNATIONAL

Exploration and production earnings were $45 million for the first 
quarter of 1994, as compared to $79 million for the first quarter of 1993. 
The decline in the comparative first quarter results is due to the substan-
tial drop in crude oil prices, partly offset by enhanced and new production. 
Production was up 28 percent mainly as a result of increases in the U.K. and 
Danish sectors of the North Sea, Indonesia and Partitioned Neutral Zone 
between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
Manufacturing and marketing results were $125 million for the first 
quarter of 1994, as compared to $122 million for the first quarter of 1993. 
Increased sales in Latin America benefitted the comparative first quarter 
earnings, as did slightly higher margins in Brazil. Higher margins in the 
U.K. were offset by lower margins in the remainder of Europe and West Africa.

CORPORATE/NONOPERATING RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

Corporate/nonoperating expenses for the first quarter of 1994 were $120 
million, as compared to expenses of $99 million for the first quarter of 1993.
This increase was mainly due to higher after tax interest expense, partly 
offset by lower corporate overhead.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

Capital and exploratory expenditures for continuing operations, 
including equity in such expenditures of affiliates, were $624 million for 
the first quarter of 1994, as compared with $534 million for the same period 
in 1993.

Upstream expenditures increased in the United States, reflecting 
additional drilling activities, with particular emphasis on developmental gas 
projects. Internationally, increased upstream activities in Indonesia and 
Australia were more than offset by lower expenditures in the U.K. North Sea 
where successful project completions continue to result in higher production 
volumes.
Downstream expenditures increased in 1994, principally as a result of a 
refinery upgrade project in Panama. In the United States, expenditures 
declined somewhat due to the completion of refinery upgrade projects underway 
in 1993 by Texaco's affiliate, Star Enterprise.

DISCONTINUED CHEMICAL OPERATIONS

The sale of Texaco Chemical Company (other than Texaco's lubricant 
additives business) was consummated with Huntsman Corporation on April 21, 
1994. Final events related to the closing will result in further net charges 
projected at less than $50 million. Texaco continues to cooperate with 
Huntsman Financial Corporation to explore the sale of the lubricant additives 
business to a third party. In the absence of such a third party sale, 
Huntsman Financial Corporation is scheduled to acquire this business by 
September 30, 1994.
