Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") dated February

organized and existing under the laws of the State of Texas (the "REIT") and
The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company ("Manulife"), a corporation duly
organized and existing under the laws of Canada, REIT and Manulife hereby agree
upon the following:

1. A semi-annual interest payment in the amount of $1,974,164 is due on May

- if paid by June 27, 1994: $974,164;
- if paid after June 27, 1994, $974,164 plus interest at 11.7%
per annum. 

In no event shall payment of the balance owing, plus interest if any, be made
later than August 26, 1994.

2. If REIT makes the payments as set forth above, such deferral of a portion
of the interest payment due May 27, 1994 will not constitute an Event of

will require full compliance with, all of the other terms and conditions of the
Agreement, that all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement not
