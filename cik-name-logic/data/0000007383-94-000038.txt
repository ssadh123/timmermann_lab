Item 5. Other Events.

Effective September 15, 1994, Armco Inc. ("Armco") sold most of its 
interest in North American Stainless ("NAS"), a Delaware partnership, for 
$73 million to Acerinox S.A. of Spain, its partner in the venture. NAS is a 
stainless steel processing facility located in Carrollton, Kentucky. 

Armco, through its subsidiary, First Stainless, Inc., will retain a 
five percent limited partnership interest in NAS and Armco will supply NAS 
with chrome nickel stainless steel coils on an annual contract basis. As a 
result of the sale, Armco will record a gain of approximately $26 million in 
the third quarter of 1994.

Armco and Acerinox S. A. formed NAS as a general partnership in April 
of 1990 to produce 48-inch and 60-inch wide commodity chrome nickel 
stainless steel and strip for domestic steel service centers and other end 
users. The processing facility was completed in December of 1992 and began 
shipping to customers in mid-1993.
