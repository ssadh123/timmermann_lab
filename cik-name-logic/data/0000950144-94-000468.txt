(a) The Corporation had previously acquired 17.93% of the common stock of
BOET ($3.4 million), and on January 1, 1993 purchased an additional
43.93% of the common stock of BOET in exchange for 331,741 shares of
the Corporation's Series E Preferred Stock ($11.1 million). Effective
May 3, 1993, the Corporation acquired the remaining outstanding common
stock of BOET for 317,045 shares of the Corporation's Series E
Preferred Stock ($10.8 million).

(b) The Corporation acquired Maryville, a mutual savings bank, which
pursuant to a conversion/acquisition converted to a federal stock
charter, all of the stock of which was acquired by the Corporation in
exchange for a capital contribution equalling approximately $14.1
million derived in part from the proceeds of an offering of the
Corporation's Common Stock made in connection with the
conversion/acquisition.

(c) The recording of the acquisition of Maryville using the purchase
method of accounting resulted in negative goodwill of approximately
$9.4 million, $8.1 million of which was deducted from noncurrent,
nonmonetary assets (premises and equipment, fair value adjustment of
loans, prepaid software and mortgage servicing rights). The remaining
negative goodwill of $1.3 million was recorded in other liabilities
and is being amortized over 7 years.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 10
<PAGE> 17
Board of Directors of BFC, to make any revision to the structure of the
Reorganization which (i) changes the amount of Consideration which the BFC
Record Holders are entitled to receive (determined in the manner provided in

Reorganization Agreement which Notice shall be in the form of an amendment to
this Reorganization Agreement or in the form of an Amended and Restated
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization.

2.6 Holding Period of UPC Common Stock. BFC and BFSB hereby
----------------------------------
acknowledge and agree that, in order to qualify the Merger under the Internal
Revenue Code as a tax-free reorganization and for accounting purposes as a
pooling of interests under the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC,
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 and GAAP, any BFC Record Holder who
would be deemed an Affiliate of BFC at the time of Closing under the Securities
Laws and who accepts shares of UPC Common Stock as Consideration for the
cancellation, exchange and conversion of his shares of BFC Common Stock in
connection with the Merger, shall not pledge, assign, sell, transfer, devise,
otherwise alienate or take any action which would eliminate or diminish the
risk of owning or holding the shares of UPC Common Stock to be received by such
BFC Record Holder upon consummation of the Merger, nor enter into any formal or
informal agreement to pledge, assign, sell or transfer, devise, or otherwise
alienate his right, title and interests in any of the shares of BFC Common
Stock held prior to the Merger or UPC Common Stock to be delivered by UPC to
such BFC Record Holder in connection with the Merger for a period of thirty
(30) days prior to Closing and until such time as UPC shall have publicly
released a statement of UPC's earnings reflecting the combined financial
results of operations of UPC and BFC for a period of not less than thirty (30)
days subsequent to the Effective Time of the Merger. BFC further acknowledges
and agrees that any UPC Common Stock Certificates issued in connection with the
Merger to BFC Record Holders who would be deemed Affiliates of BFC or UPC at
the time of Closing under the Securities Laws shall be subject to and bear a
restrictive legend substantially in the form as follows:

THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE HELD SUBJECT
TO ALL APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES ACT

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 11
<PAGE> 18
OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND THE RULES AND
REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
("SEC") THEREUNDER. NO SALES, TRANSFERS OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF THESE
SHARES MAY BE MADE EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (OTHER THAN A REGISTRATION
STATEMENT ON SEC FORM S-4) OR UPON THE PRIOR DELIVERY TO UNION
PLANTERS CORPORATION ("UPC") OF AN OPINION FROM LEGAL COUNSEL,
SATISFACTORY TO UPC, IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE SATISFACTORY TO UPC AND ITS
LEGAL COUNSEL, STATING THAT SUCH SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION IS BEING
MADE PURSUANT TO AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SEC RULES
144 AND 145 OR IS OTHERWISE EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT, AND THAT SUCH SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION WILL NOT
AFFECT THE "POOLING OF INTERESTS" ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER
WHICH RESULTED IN THESE SHARES BEING ISSUED. NO SALE, TRANSFER, OR
OTHER DISPOSITION OF THESE SHARES MAY BE MADE UNTIL AFTER THE
PUBLICATION OF FINANCIAL RESULTS COVERING AT LEAST 30 DAYS OF POST
MERGER COMBINED OPERATIONS OF UPC AND BANCFIRST CORPORATION. NO
AGREEMENT MAY BE ENTERED INTO BY THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE WHICH
WOULD ALLOW OR REQUIRE THE SALE, TRANSFER, OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF
THESE SHARES DURING THE TIME PERIOD MENTIONED ABOVE OR WHICH WOULD
OTHERWISE REDUCE THE RISK BORNE BY THE SHAREHOLDER NAMED ON THE
REVERSE SIDE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SUBSEQUENT TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE
MERGER.

2.7 BFC Stock Options and Treasury Stock. Except as
------------------------------------
described in Schedule 2.7 hereto, as of the date of this Reorganization
Agreement, there are 121,487 validly issued and outstanding options to purchase
shares of BFC Common Stock, 95,237 of which were issued by BFC to certain
officers of BFC in connection with BFC's 1986 Stock Option and Incentive Plan
and 26,250 of which were issued by BFC to outside directors of BFC in
connection with the BFC Non-Incentive Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors;
and no other options, rights, warrants, scrip or similar rights to purchase
shares of BFC Common Stock (collectively, the "BFC Stock Options") are (or have
been) issued and outstanding by BFC. It is contemplated by the Parties hereto
that all validly issued and outstanding BFC Stock Options outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing would be automatically converted at the
Effective Time of the Merger into options to purchase shares of UPC Common
Stock based on the Exchange Ratio. Therefore, in the event and to the extent
that there are any BFC Stock Options validly issued and outstanding at the time
of Closing, such BFC Stock Options shall at the Effective Time of the Merger
automatically and without further action on the part of anyone be converted
into options to purchase shares of UPC Common Stock on the same terms and
conditions attributable to the BFC Stock Options to purchase

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 12
<PAGE> 19
shares of BFC Common Stock in effect as of the date of this Reorganization
Agreement adjusted in all respects by and in accordance with the Exchange Ratio
(i.e. if an existing BFC Stock Option for the purchase of 1,000 shares of BFC
Common Stock were exercisable at $6.35 per share of BFC Common Stock and the
Exchange Ratio were 1.078, then at the Effective Time of the Merger such
unexercised BFC Stock Option would automatically convert into an option to
purchase 1,078 shares of UPC Common Stock at an exercise price of $6.35 per
share). As of the date of this Reorganization Agreement, BFC has not
repurchased or accelerated the purchase rights of any BFC Stock Options, nor
will it repurchase or accelerate the purchase rights of any BFC Stock Options,
and BFC has not repurchased any shares of its capital stock. Therefore, as of
the date of this Reorganization Agreement, there are no shares of BFC Common
Stock held by BFC as Treasury Stock, nor will there be any such shares at the
Effective Time of the Merger.

ARTICLE 3

DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

3.1 Terms of the Merger.
-------------------
(a) Satisfaction of Conditions to Closing. After
-------------------------------------
the transactions contemplated herein have been approved by the shareholders of
BFC and INTERIM, and each other condition to the obligations of the Parties
hereto, other than those conditions which are to be satisfied by delivery of
documents by any Party to any other Party, has been satisfied or, if lawfully
permitted, waived by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefits thereof, a
closing (the "Closing") will be held on the date (the "Closing Date") and at
the time of day and place referred to in Section 3.2 of this Reorganization
Agreement. At the Closing the Parties shall use their respective best efforts
to deliver the certificates, letters and opinions which constitute conditions
to effecting the Merger and each Party will provide the other Parties with such
proof or indication of satisfaction of the conditions to the obligations of
such other Parties to consummate the Merger as such other Parties may
reasonably require. If all conditions to the obligations of each of the
Parties shall have been satisfied or lawfully waived by the Party entitled to
the benefits thereof, the Parties shall, at the Closing, duly execute a
Certificate of Merger for filing with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and promptly thereafter BFC and INTERIM shall take all steps necessary
or desirable to consummate the Merger in accordance with all applicable laws,
rules and regulations and the Plan of Merger which is attached hereto as
Exhibit A and incorporated by reference as part of this

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 13
<PAGE> 20
Reorganization Agreement. The Parties shall thereupon take such other and
further actions as UPC shall direct or as may be required by law or this
Reorganization Agreement to consummate the transactions contemplated herein.

(b) Effective Time of the Merger. Upon the
----------------------------
satisfaction of all conditions to Closing (except those conditions waived by
the Parties), the Merger shall become effective on the date and at the time of
filing of a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date and/or time as may be agreed upon by the Parties
and set forth in the Certificate of Merger so filed (the "Effective Time of the
Merger").

(c) Conversion of Shares of INTERIM. At the
-------------------------------
Effective Time of the Merger, each share of $.01 par value common stock of
INTERIM (the "INTERIM Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time of The Merger shall, by virtue of the Merger becoming
effective and without any further action on the part of anyone, be converted
into and become one share of the issued and outstanding common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) Conversion and Cancellation of Shares of BFC.
--------------------------------------------
At the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of $.01 par value common stock
of BFC (the "BFC Common Stock") validly issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall, by virtue of the Merger
becoming effective and without any further action on the part of anyone, be
converted, exchanged and cancelled as provided in Section 3.1(e) hereof.

(e) Conversion and Exchange of BFC Shares;
-------------------------------------
Exchange Ratio. At the Effective Time of the Merger, the outstanding shares of
- --------------
BFC Common Stock held by the BFC Record Holders immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger shall, without any further action on the part of
anyone, cease to represent any interest (equity, shareholder or otherwise) in
BFC and shall automatically be converted exclusively into, and constitute only
the right of the BFC Record Holders to receive in exchange for their shares of
BFC Common Stock, whole shares of UPC Common Stock and a cash payment in
settlement of any remaining fractional share of UPC Common Stock in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Section 3.1(e). The shares of UPC Common
Stock and the cash settlement of any remaining fractional share of UPC Common
Stock deliverable by UPC to the BFC Record Holders pursuant to the terms of
this Reorganization Agreement are sometimes collectively referred to herein as
the "Consideration."

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 14
<PAGE> 21
The number of shares of UPC Common Stock to be exchanged for each share of BFC
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger shall be based on an exchange ratio (the "Exchange Ratio") as
determined and set forth in this Section 3.1(e). The Exchange Ratio shall be
determined as follows:

(A) In the event the Current Market Price
Per Share of UPC Common Stock should be greater than or equal to
$24.00 per share of UPC Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be
based on a fixed Exchange Ratio of 1.078 shares of UPC Common Stock
for each share of BFC Common validly issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger; and

(B) In the event the Current Market Price
Per Share of UPC Common Stock should be less than $24.00 per share of
UPC Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at 1.078 shares of
UPC Common Stock for each share or BFC Common Stock; provided, however,
-------- -------
BFC shall have the right to either accept the fixed Exchange Ratio of
1.078 or terminate the transaction in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Reorganization Agreement, provided, further, in the
-------- -------
event BFC should elect to terminate this Reorganization Agreement in
accordance with this Section 3.1(e)(B), UPC may, in its sole
discretion, reinstate this Reorganization Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein by increasing the number of shares of
UPC Common Stock to be delivered by UPC to the BFC Record Holders
hereunder (i.e. the Exchange Ratio) based on a fixed price of $25.87
per share of BFC Common Stock divided by the Current Market Price Per
------- --
Share of UPC Common Stock.

The Exchange Ratio as determined in this Section 3.1(e) shall be based on an
aggregate of no more than 1,905,680 shares of BFC Common Stock validly issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and, for
purposes of this paragraph, counting all unexercised BFC Stock Options issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger as shares
of BFC Common Stock so converted and exchanged; provided, however, that no
-------- -------
fractional shares of UPC Common Stock shall be issued and if, after aggregating
all of the shares of UPC Common Stock to which a BFC Record Holder is entitled
based upon the Exchange Ratio, there shall be a fractional share of UPC Common
Stock remaining, such fractional share shall be settled by a cash payment
therefor pursuant to the Mechanics of Payment of the Purchase Price set forth
in Section 3.1(f) hereof, which shall be calculated based upon the Current
Market Price Per Share of one (1) full share of UPC Common Stock.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 15
<PAGE> 22
(i) DEFINITION OF "CURRENT MARKET PRICE
PER SHARE." The "Current Market Price Per Share" shall be the average
closing price per share of the "last" real time trades (i.e., closing
price) of the UPC Common Stock on the NYSE (as published in The Wall
--------
Street Journal) for each of the ten (10) NYSE general market trading
--------------
days next preceding the Closing Date on which the NYSE was open for
business (the "Pricing Period"). In the event the UPC Common Stock
does not trade on one or more of the trading days during the Pricing
Period (a "No Trade Date"), any such No Trade Date shall be
disregarded in computing the average closing price per share of UPC
Common Stock and the average shall be based upon the "last" real time
trades and number of days on which the UPC Common Stock actually
traded during the Pricing Period.

(ii) EFFECTS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS ON THE
EXCHANGE RATIO. The Exchange Ratio shall be unaffected by Appraisal
Rights as granted under Delaware law because the BFC Common Stock is
listed for trading on the AMEX, which is a "national securities
exchange" as defined in rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the
1934 Act, and therefore, pursuant to Delaware Code Section 8-503-262,
no BFC Record Holder may assert Appraisal Rights in connection with
the Merger or the transactions contemplated in this Reorganization
Agreement.

(iii) EFFECT OF STOCK SPLITS, REVERSE STOCK
SPLITS, STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SIMILAR CHANGES IN THE CAPITAL OF BFC.
Should BFC effect any stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock
dividends or similar changes in its respective capital accounts
subsequent to the date of this Reorganization Agreement but prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
in such a manner as the Board of Directors of UPC shall deem in good
faith to be fair and reasonable in order to give effect to such
changes subject to BFC Board of Directors approval.

(f) Mechanics of Payment of Consideration. As
-------------------------------------
soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event no more than five (5) Business
Days after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Corporate Trust Department of
Union Planters National Bank, Memphis, Tennessee (the "Exchange Agent") shall
deliver to each of the BFC Record Holders such materials and information deemed
necessary by the Exchange Agent to advise the BFC Record Holders of the
procedures required for proper surrender of their certificates evidencing and
representing shares of the BFC Common Stock in order for the BFC Record Holders
to receive the Consideration. Such materials shall include, without
limitation, a Letter of Transmittal, an Instruction Sheet, and a return

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 16
<PAGE> 23
mailing envelope addressed to the Exchange Agent (collectively the "Shareholder
Materials"). All Shareholder Materials shall be sent by United States mail to
the BFC Record Holders at the addresses set forth on a certified shareholder
list to be delivered by BFC to UPC at the Closing (the "Shareholder List") and
shall also be made available at the Corporate Trust Department offices of the
Exchange Agent. As soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, the BFC Record
Holders of all of the outstanding shares of BFC Common Stock, shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, by United States Postal Service, hand delivery or any
other means of delivery selected by such BFC Record Holders, to the Exchange
Agent, pursuant to the Shareholder Materials, the certificates formerly
evidencing and representing all of the shares of BFC Common Stock which were
validly issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger, and the Exchange Agent shall take prompt action to process such
certificates formerly evidencing and representing shares of BFC Common Stock
received by it (including the prompt return of any defective submissions with
instructions as to those actions which may be necessary to remedy any defects).
Upon receipt of the proper submission of the certificate(s) formerly
representing and evidencing ownership of the shares of BFC Common Stock, the
Exchange Agent shall, on or prior to the 30th day after the Effective Time of
the Merger, mail to the former BFC Record Holders in exchange for the
certificate(s) surrendered by them, the Consideration to be paid for each such
BFC Record Holder's shares of BFC Common Stock evidenced by the certificate or
certificates which were cancelled and converted exclusively into the right to
receive the Consideration upon the Merger becoming effective. After the
Effective Time of the Merger and until properly surrendered to the Exchange
Agent, each outstanding certificate or certificates which formerly evidenced
and represented the shares of BFC Common Stock of a BFC Record Holder, subject
to the provisions of this Section, shall be deemed for all corporate purposes
to represent and evidence only the right to receive the Consideration into
which such BFC Record Holder's shares of BFC Common Stock were converted and
aggregated at the Effective Time of the Merger. Unless and until the
outstanding certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger evidenced and represented the BFC Record Holder's
BFC Common Stock shall have been properly surrendered as provided above, the
Consideration payable to the BFC Record Holder(s) of the cancelled shares as of
any time after the Effective Date shall not be paid to the BFC Record Holder(s)
of such certificate(s) until such certificates shall have been surrendered in
the manner required. Each BFC Record Holder will be responsible for all
federal, state and local taxes which may be incurred by him on account of his
receipt of the Consideration to be paid in the Merger. The BFC Record
Holder(s) of any certificate(s) which shall have been lost or destroyed may

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 17
<PAGE> 24
nevertheless, subject to the provisions of this Section, receive the
Consideration to which each such BFC Record Holder is entitled, provided that
each such BFC Record Holder shall deliver to UPC and to the Exchange Agent: (i)
a sworn statement certifying such loss or destruction and specifying the
circumstances thereof and (ii) a lost instrument bond in form satisfactory to
UPC and the Exchange Agent which has been duly executed by a corporate surety
satisfactory to UPC and the Exchange Agent, indemnifying the Surviving
Corporation, UPC, the Exchange Agent (and their respective successors) to their
satisfaction against any loss or expense which any of them may incur as a
result of such lost or destroyed certificates being thereafter presented. Any
costs or expenses which may arise from such replacement procedure, including
the premium on the lost instrument bond, shall be for the account of the BFC
Record Holder.

(g) Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time
--------------------
of the Merger, the stock transfer books of BFC shall be closed and no transfer
of shares of BFC Common Stock shall be made thereafter.

(h) Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time
---------------------
of the Merger, the separate existence of INTERIM shall cease, and INTERIM shall
be merged with and into BFC which, as the Surviving Corporation, shall
thereupon and thereafter possess all of the assets, rights, privileges,
appointments, powers, licenses, permits and franchises of the two merged
corporations, whether of a public or a private nature, and shall be subject to
all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of both BFC and
INTERIM.

(i) Transfer of Assets. At the Effective Time of
------------------
the Merger, all rights, assets, licenses, permits, franchises and interests of
BFC and INTERIM in and to every type of property, whether real, personal, or
mixed, whether tangible or intangible, and to choses in action shall be deemed
to be vested in BFC as the Surviving Corporation by virtue of the Merger
becoming effective and without any deed or other instrument or act of transfer
whatsoever.

(j) Assumption of Liabilities. At the Effective
-------------------------
Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall become and be liable for
all debts, liabilities, obligations and contracts of BFC as well as those of
INTERIM, whether the same shall be matured or unmatured; whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise; and whether or not reflected or reserved
against in the balance sheets, other financial statements, books of account or
records of BFC or INTERIM.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 18
<PAGE> 25
(k) Appraisal Rights of BFC Shareholders.
------------------------------------
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 8-503-262 of the Delaware Code, BFC
Shareholders shall not be entitled to assert Appraisal Rights in connection
with the Merger or to seek those appraisal remedies afforded by the Delaware
Code because the BFC Common Stock is listed for trading on the AMEX, which is a
"national securities exchange" as defined in rules promulgated by the SEC
pursuant to the 1934 Act, and therefore, pursuant to Delaware Code Section
8-503-262, no BFC Record Holder may assert Appraisal Rights in connection with
the Merger or the transactions contemplated in this Reorganization Agreement.

(l) Reservation, Registration and Listing of
----------------------------------------
shares of UPC Common Stock. UPC shall reserve for issuance, register under the
- --------------------------
Securities Laws and apply for listing for trading on the NYSE a sufficient
number of shares of UPC Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of UPC
Common Stock to the BFC Record Holders in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Section 3.1.

3.2 Time and Place of Closing. The Closing shall take
-------------------------
place at 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day next preceding the date on which the
Effective Time of the Merger is expected to occur, or at such other time as the
Parties, acting through their chief executive officers, presidents or chief
financial officers, may mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). The place of
Closing shall be at Union Planters Administrative Center, Union Planters
Corporation Executive Offices (Fourth Floor), 7130 Goodlett Farms Parkway,
Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee 38018. The Closing may be held at such other
time and place as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties.

properties are insured against fire, casualty, theft, liability, loss,

obligation of any party thereto. Neither BFC nor any BFC Subsidiary has

<PAGE> 46

whole, and BFC and each BFC Subsidiary have withheld and paid to the
appropriate governmental authorities or are holding for payment not yet due to
such authorities, all amounts required to be withheld from the employees of BFC
and each BFC Subsidiary and are not liable for any arrears of wages, taxes,
penalties or other sums for failure to comply with any of the foregoing.
Except as set forth in Schedule 5.17, there is no: unfair labor practice

Relations Board or any state or local agency; pending labor strike or other
labor trouble affecting BFC or any BFC Subsidiary; labor grievance pending

a claim may be made under any collective bargaining agreement to which BFC or
any BFC Subsidiary is a party.

5.18 Records and Documents. The Records of BFSB are and will
---------------------

business.

1,784,193 shares of BFC Common Stock were issued and outstanding, no shares of

Schedule 5.19 hereto, as of the date hereof, there are no outstanding
securities or other obligations which are convertible into BFC Common Stock or
into any other equity or debt security of BFC, and there are no outstanding
options, warrants, rights, scrip, rights to subscribe to, calls or other
commitments of any nature which would entitle the holder, upon exercise
thereof, to be issued BFC Common Stock or any other equity or debt security of
BFC. Accordingly, immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, there
will be not more than 1,905,680 shares of BFC Common Stock issued and
outstanding. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.19 hereto, BFC

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 40

owns and is the beneficial record holder of, and has good and freely
transferable title to, all of the 1,000 shares of BFSB Common Stock
outstanding, and recorded on the books and Records of BFSB as being held in its
name, free and clear of all liens, charges or encumbrances, and such stock is
not subject to any voting trusts, agreements or similar arrangements or other
claims which could effect the ability of BFC to freely vote such stock in
support of the transactions contemplated herein.

BFSB, nor any Subsidiary of either has been or is a party to: any letter of
intent or agreement to merge, to consolidate, to sell or purchase assets (other
than in the normal course of its business) or to any other agreement which
contemplates the involvement of BFC or BFSB or any Subsidiary of either (or any
of their assets) in any business combination of any kind; or any agreement
obligating BFC or BFSB to issue or sell or authorize the sale or transfer of
BFC Common Stock or the capital stock of BFSB. Except as described in Schedule

BFSB, or contracts, commitments, understandings, or arrangements by which BFC
or BFSB is or may be bound to issue additional shares of their capital stock or
options, warrants, or rights to purchase or acquire any additional shares of
their capital stock. There are no (nor will there be at the Effective Time of
the Merger any) contracts, commitments, understandings, or arrangements by
which BFC or any BFC Subsidiary is or may be bound to transfer or issue to any
third party any shares of the capital stock of any BFC Subsidiary, and there
are no (nor will there be at the Effective Time of the Merger any) contracts,
agreements, understandings or commitments relating to the right of BFC to vote
or to dispose of any such shares.

5.21 Disclosure. The information concerning, and
----------
representations and warranties made by, BFC and BFSB set forth in this

any untrue statement of a material fact or omit and will not omit to state a
material fact required to be stated herein or therein necessary

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 41
<PAGE> 48
to make the statements and facts contained herein or therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were or are made, not false or misleading. Copies
of all documents heretofore or hereafter delivered or made available to UPC or
INTERIM by BFC or BFSB pursuant hereto were or will be complete and accurate
copies of such documents.

5.22 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as described
----------------------------------
in Schedule 5.22 hereto, to the best of the knowledge, information and belief
of BFC and BFSB neither BFC nor any BFC Subsidiary has any obligation or
liability (contingent or otherwise) that is material to the financial condition
or operations of BFC or any BFC Subsidiary, or that, when combined with all
similar obligations or liabilities, would be material to the financial
condition or operations of BFC or any BFC Subsidiary (i) except as disclosed in
the Audited Financial Statements of BFC delivered to UPC prior to the date of
this Reorganization Agreement or (ii) except obligations or liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of its business consistent with past practices
or (iii) except as contemplated under this Reorganization Agreement. Since
September 30, 1993, neither BFC nor any BFC Subsidiary has incurred or paid any
obligation or liability which would be material to the financial condition or
operations of BFC or such BFC Subsidiary, except for obligations paid by BFC or
BFSB under the terms of this Reorganization Agreement (all such obligations or
payments are fully described by BFC in Schedule 5.22 hereto) or in connection
with transactions made by it in the ordinary course of its business consistent
with past practices, laws and regulations applicable to BFC or any BFC
Subsidiary.

5.23 Allowance for Possible Loan or ORE Losses. To the best
-----------------------------------------
of the knowledge, information and belief of BFC and BFSB, the allowance for
possible loan losses shown on the Audited Financial Statements of BFC is (with
respect to periods ended on or before September 30, 1993) or will be (with
respect to periods ending subsequent to September 30, 1993) adequate in all
respects to provide for anticipated losses inherent in Loans outstanding or for
commitments to extend credit or similar off-balance-sheet items (including
accrued interest receivable) as of the dates thereof. Except as disclosed in
Schedule 5.23 hereto, as of the date thereof, neither BFC nor BFSB has any Loan
which has been criticized or classified by bank examiners representing any
Regulatory Authority or by its independent auditors as "Other Assets Especially
Mentioned," "Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss" or as a "Potential Problem
Loan."

The allowance for possible losses on other real estate ("ORE") shown
on the Audited Financial Statements of BFC is (with

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 42
<PAGE> 49
respect to periods ended on or before September 30, 1993) or will be (with
respect to periods ending subsequent to September 30, 1993) adequate in all
respects to provide for anticipated losses inherent in ORE owned or held by BFC
or any BFC Subsidiary and the net book value of ORE on the Balance Sheet of the
Audited Financial Statements of BFC is the fair value of the ORE in accordance
with Statement of Position 92-3.

5.24 Compliance with Laws. BFC and each BFC Subsidiary:
--------------------
(a) To the best of the knowledge, information and
belief of the management of BFC and each BFC Subsidiary, is in compliance with
all laws, rules, regulations, reporting and licensing requirements, and orders
applicable to its business or employees conducting its business (including, but
not limited to, those relating to consumer disclosure and currency transaction
reporting) the breach or violation of which would or could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
operations of BFC or any BFC Subsidiary, or which would or could reasonably be
expected to subject BFC or any BFC Subsidiary or any of its directors or
officers to civil money penalties; and

(b) Has received no notification or communication
from any agency or department of federal, state, or local government or any of
the Regulatory Authorities, or the staff thereof (i) asserting that BFC or any
BFC Subsidiary is not in compliance with any of the statutes, rules,
regulations, or ordinances which such governmental authority or Regulatory
Authority enforces, which, as a result of such noncompliance, would result in a
material adverse impact on BFC or any BFC Subsidiary, (ii) threatening to
revoke any license, franchise, permit, or governmental authorization which is
material to the financial condition or operations of BFC or any BFC Subsidiary,
or (iii) requiring BFC or any BFC Subsidiary to enter into a cease and desist
order, consent, agreement, or memorandum of understanding.

5.25 Employee Benefit Plans.
----------------------
(a) BFC has previously provided to UPC true and
complete copies of each "employee pension benefit plan," as defined in Section
3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") which, to
the best of its knowledge, is subject to any provision of ERISA and covers any
employee, whether active or retired, of BFC or any BFC Subsidiary or any other
entity which is a member of a controlled group or is under common control with
BFC or its Subsidiaries in the manner defined and further described in Section
414(b), (c), or (m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"). Such
plans are

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 43
<PAGE> 50
hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Employee Pension Benefit Plans",
and each such Employee Pension Benefit Plan is listed in Schedule 5.25(a)
hereto. BFC has also provided to UPC true and complete copies of all trust
agreements, collective bargaining agreements, and insurance contracts related
to such Employee Pension Benefit Plans.

To the best knowledge of BFC and its Subsidiaries,
each Employee Pension Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and each trust forming a part
thereof is exempt from tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code. Copies of
the latest determination letters concerning the qualified status of each
Employee Pension Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code have been provided to UPC. Requests for determination
letters relating to amendments required to cause such Employee Pension Benefit
Plans to be in compliance with the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of
1982, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 and the Retirement Equity Act of 1984
were timely filed and have been received by BFC and its Subsidiaries. Requests
for determination letters relating to any subsequent amendments to such plans
which are currently pending have been provided to UPC. All such requests were
timely and properly filed and appropriate notice of any such filing was timely
and properly provided to affected plan participants and beneficiaries.

To the best of the knowledge, information and belief
of BFC and BFSB, each of the Employee Pension Benefit Plans has been operated
in substantial conformity with the written provisions of the applicable plan
documents which have been delivered to UPC and in compliance with the
requirements prescribed by all statutes, orders, rules, and regulations
including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such
Employee Pension Benefit Plans. To the extent that the operation of an
Employee Pension Benefit Plan has deviated from the written provisions of the
plan, such operational deviations have been disclosed in Schedule 5.25(a)
hereto. All such deviations have been made in conformity with applicable laws,
including ERISA and the Code.

With respect to Employee Pension Benefit Plans which
are subject to the annual report requirement of ERISA Section 103 or to the
annual return requirement of Code Section 6047, all required annual reports and
annual returns, or such other documents as may have been required as
alternative means of compliance with the annual report requirement, have been
timely filed. Copies of all such annual returns/reports, including all
attachments and Schedules, for the three (3) plan years immediately preceding
the current date have been delivered

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 44

<PAGE> 51
to UPC. With respect to Employee Pension Benefit Plans which complied with the
annual return requirement by satisfaction of an alternate compliance method,
any documents required to be filed with the Department of Labor in satisfaction
of such requirements have been provided to UPC.

With respect to all Employee Pension Benefit Plans
which are subject to the summary plan description requirement of ERISA Section
102, all such summary plan descriptions as were required to be filed with the
Department of Labor and distributed to participants and beneficiaries have been
timely filed and distributed. Copies of all such summary plan descriptions
have been delivered to UPC. No Employee Pension Benefit Plan constitutes a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.

No Employee Pension Benefit Plan subject to Part III
of Subtitle B of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or both, has incurred an
"accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of Code Section 412,
whether or not waived. All required contributions to all Employee Pension
Benefit Plans have been timely made. Any penalties or taxes which have been
incurred by BFC or its subsidiaries or by any Employee Pension Benefit Plan
with respect to the timing or amount of payment of any contribution to an
Employee Pension Benefit Plan have been timely paid. The limitations of Code
Section 415 have not been exceeded with respect to any Employee Pension Benefit
Plan or combination of such plans to which such limitations apply.

No "reportable event" (as described in Section
4043(b) of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any Employee Pension Benefit
Plan. No Employee Pension Benefit Plan or any trust created thereunder, nor
any "disqualified person" with respect to the plan (as defined in Section 4975
of the Code), has engaged in a "prohibited transaction", as such term is
defined in Section 4975 of the Code, which could subject such Employee Pension
Benefit Plan, any such trust or any such disqualified person (other than a
person for whom neither BFC nor any BFC Subsidiary is directly or indirectly
responsible) to liability under Title I of ERISA or to the imposition of any
tax under Section 4975 of the Code.

No condition exists with regard to any Employee
Pension Benefit Plan which constitutes grounds for the termination of such plan
pursuant to Section 4042 of ERISA.

The fair market value of the assets of any Employee
Pension Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA (excluding for these
purposes any accrued but unpaid contributions) exceeded the present value of
all benefits accrued

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 45

<PAGE> 52
under any such plan, determined on a termination basis using the assumptions
established by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as in effect on such
date. Neither BFC nor its Subsidiaries have incurred any liability under Title
IV of ERISA arising in connection with the termination of, or complete or
partial withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of
ERISA. The termination of any Code Section 401(a) qualified Employee Pension
Benefit Plan previously terminated by BFC or any BFC Subsidiary did not
adversely affect the qualification of such Employee Pension Benefit Plan. The
distribution of the assets of any such Employee Pension Benefit Plan was made
or is currently being made in conformity with the requirements of that Employee
Pension Benefit Plan and of applicable legal requirements and has not resulted
in, will not result in, and is reasonably not anticipated to result in the
assessment of any tax, penalty, or excise tax against such pension plan, its
related trusts, the fiduciary and administrators of the Employee Pension
Benefit Plan, BFC or its Subsidiaries, or any disqualified person (as defined
in Code Section 4975) with respect to the Employee Pension Benefit Plan.

Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(a) hereto, all
Employee Pension Benefit Plans were in effect for substantially all of calendar
year 1992. There has been no material amendment of any such plans (other than
amendments required to comply with applicable law) or material increase in the
cost of maintaining such plans or providing benefits thereunder on or after the
last day of the plan year which ended in calendar year 1992 for each such
Employee Pension Benefit Plan.

BFC has provided to UPC copies of the annual
actuarial valuation or allocation report for each Employee Pension Benefit Plan
for the three (3) plan years for such plan immediately preceding the current
date. With regard to Employee Pension Benefit Plans which are not intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, copies of financial statements
or reports containing information regarding the expense of maintaining any such
Employee Pension Benefit Plan for the three (3) plan years preceding the
current date have been delivered to UPC.

(b) BFC has furnished to UPC true and complete copies of
each "Employee Welfare Benefit Plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA,
which, to the best of its knowledge, is subject to any provision of ERISA and
covers any employee, whether active or retired, of BFC or any BFC Subsidiary or
members of a controlled group or entities under common control with BFC or its
Subsidiaries in the manner defined and further described in Section 414(b),
(c), or (m) of the Code. Such plans

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 46
<PAGE> 53
are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Employee Welfare Benefit
Plans", and each such Employee Welfare Benefit Plan is listed in Schedule
5.25(b) hereto.

BFC has also provided to UPC true and complete copies
of documents establishing all funding instruments for such Employee Welfare
Benefit Plans, including but not limited to, trust agreements, cafeteria plans
(pursuant to Code Section 125), and voluntary employee beneficiary associations
(pursuant to Code Section 501(c)(9)). Each of the Employee Welfare Benefit
Plans has been operated in substantial conformity with the written provisions
of the plan documents which have been delivered to UPC and in compliance with
the requirements prescribed by all statutes, orders, rules, and regulations
including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such
Employee Welfare Benefit Plans. Any deviation in the operation of such plans
from the requirements of the plan documents or of applicable laws have been
listed in Schedule 5.25(b) hereto. BFC has provided any notification required
by law to any participant covered under any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan which
has failed to comply with the requirements of any Code section which results in
the imposition of a tax on benefits provided to such participants under such
plan.

With respect to all Employee Welfare Benefit Plans
which are subject to the annual report requirement of ERISA Section 103 or to
the annual return requirement of Code Section 6039D, all annual reports and
annual returns as were required to be filed pursuant to such sections have been
timely filed. Copies of all such annual returns/reports, including all
attachments and Schedules, for the three (3) plan years immediately preceding
the current date for all plans subject to such requirements have been delivered
to UPC. With respect to all Employee Welfare Benefit Plans which are subject
to the summary plan description requirement of ERISA Section 102, all such
summary plan descriptions as were required to be filed with the Department of
Labor and distributed to participants and beneficiaries have been timely filed
and distributed. Copies of all such summary plan descriptions have been
delivered to UPC.

Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(b) hereto, all
Employee Welfare Benefit Plans which are in effect were in effect for
substantially all of calendar year 1992. Except as disclosed in Schedule
5.25(b) hereto, there has been with respect to such Employee Welfare Benefit
Plans no material amendment thereof or material increase in the cost thereof or
benefits payable thereunder on or after January 1, 1993.

To the best of the knowledge, information and belief
of BFC and BFSB, no Employee Welfare Benefit Plan or any

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 47
<PAGE> 54
trust created thereunder, nor any "party in interest" with respect to the plan
(as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA), has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction", as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA, which could
subject such Employee Welfare Benefit Plan, any such trust, or any party in
interest (other than a person for whom neither BFC nor any BFC Subsidiary is
directly or indirectly responsible) to the imposition of a penalty for such
prohibited transaction under Section 502(i) of ERISA. The Department of Labor
has not assessed any such penalty or served notice to BFC or any of its
Subsidiaries that such a penalty may be imposed upon any Employee Welfare
Benefit Plan.

Neither BFC nor any BFC Subsidiary has failed to make
any contribution to, or pay any amount due and owing by BFC or an BFC
Subsidiary under the terms of, an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan. Except as
disclosed in Section 5.25(b) hereto, no claims have been incurred with respect
to any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan which may, to the best knowledge,
information and belief of BFC, constitute a liability for BFC or any BFC
Subsidiary after the application of any insurance, trust or other funds which
are applicable to the payment of such claims.

Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(b) hereto, to
the best knowledge, information and belief of BFC, no condition exists that
could subject any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan or any person (other than a
person for whom neither BFC or any BFC Subsidiary is directly or indirectly
responsible) to liabilities, damages, losses, taxes, or sanctions that arise
under Section 4980B of the Code or Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA for
failure to comply with the continuation health care coverage requirements of
ERISA Sections 601 through 608 and Code Section 4980B with respect to any
current or former employee of BFC or any BFC Subsidiary, or the beneficiaries
of such employee.

(c) BFC has furnished to UPC true and complete copies
and/or descriptions of each plan or arrangement maintained or otherwise
contributed to by BFC or any BFC Subsidiary which is not an Employee Pension
Benefit Plan and is not an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan and which (exclusive
of base salary and base wages) provides for any form of current or deferred
compensation, bonus, stock option, profit sharing, retirement, group health or
insurance, welfare benefits, fringe benefits, or similar plan or arrangement
for the benefit of any employee or class of employees, whether active or
retired, or independent contractors of BFC or any BFC subsidiary. Such plans
and arrangements shall collectively be referred to herein as "Benefit
Arrangements" and all such Benefit Arrangements of BFC and BFC's Subsidiaries
are listed on Schedule 5.25(c) hereto. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(c)
hereto, there are no other benefit arrangements of the BFC companies and all
Benefit Arrangements which are in

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 48
<PAGE> 55
effect were in effect for substantially all of calendar year 1992. Except as
disclosed in Schedule 5.25(c) hereto, there has been with respect to Benefit
Arrangements no material amendment thereof or material increase in the cost
thereof or benefits payable thereunder on or after January 1, 1993. There has
been no material increase in the base salary and wage levels of BFC or any BFC
Subsidiary and, except in the ordinary course of business, no change in the
terms or conditions of employment (including severance benefits) compared, in
each case, to those prevailing for substantially all of calendar year 1992.
Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(c) hereto, there has been no material
increase in the compensation of, or benefits payable to, any senior executive
employee of BFC or any BFC subsidiary on or after January 1, 1993, nor has any
employment, severance, or similar contract been entered into with any such
employee, nor has any amendment to any such contract been made on or after
January 1, 1993.

With respect to all Benefit Arrangements which are
subject to the annual return requirement of Code Section 6039D, all annual
returns as were required to be filed have been timely filed. Copies of all
such annual returns for the three (3) plan years immediately preceding the
current date have been delivered to UPC.

(d) Listed on Schedule 5.25(d) hereto are all Employee
Pension Benefit Plans, Employee Welfare Benefit Plans, and Benefit Arrangements
which provide compensation or benefits which become effective upon a change in
control of BFC or any BFC Subsidiary, including, but not limited to, additional
compensation or benefits, or acceleration in the amount or timing of payment of
compensation or benefits which had become effective prior to the date of such
acceleration. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(d) hereto, there is no
Employee Pension Benefit Plan, Employee Welfare Benefit Plan, or Benefit
Arrangement covering any employee of BFC or any BFC Subsidiary which
individually or collectively could give rise to the payment of any amount which
would constitute an "excess parachute payment", as such term is defined in
Section 280G of the Code and Regulations proposed pursuant to that section.

(e) Except as described in Schedule 5.25(e) hereto, each
Employee Pension Benefit Plan, Employee Welfare Benefit Plan, or Benefit
Arrangement and each personal services contract, fringe benefit, consulting
contract or similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any officer,
director, employee, or other person may be terminated by BFC (or by BFC as the
Surviving Corporation) within a period of no more than thirty (30) days
following the effective time of the merger, without payment of any amount as a
penalty, bonus, premium, severance pay, or other

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 49
<PAGE> 56
compensation for such termination. No limitation on the right to terminate any
such plan has been communicated by BFC or its Subsidiaries to employees, former
employees, or retirees who are or may be participants in or beneficiaries of
such plans or arrangements. Each Employee Pension Benefit Plan which is
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code as a qualified defined benefit
pension plan permits the reversion of excess assets to the employer maintaining
the plan or its successors or assigns upon a plan termination and such
provision has been included in the Employee Pension Benefit Plan for the period
required under ERISA Section 4044(d).

(f) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(f) hereto,
neither BFC nor any BFC Subsidiary has received notice from any governmental
agency of any alleged violation of applicable laws or of any prospective audit
or other investigation for the purpose of reviewing compliance with applicable
laws with respect to any Employee Pension Benefit Plan, Employee Welfare
Benefit Plan or Benefit Arrangement.

Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.25(f) hereto, no
suits, actions, or claims have been filed in any court of law or with any
governmental agency regarding the operation of any Employee Pension Benefit
Plan, Employee Welfare Benefit Plan, or Benefit Arrangement and no such
additional suits, actions, or claims are, to the best information, knowledge
and belief of BFC, anticipated to be filed.

5.26 Material Contracts. Except as reflected in the Audited
------------------
Financial Statements of BFC, or as described in Schedule 5.26 hereto, neither
BFC nor any BFC Subsidiary, nor any of their respective assets, businesses, or
operations, is as of the date of this Reorganization Agreement a party to, or
is bound or obligated by, or receives benefits under any contract or agreement
or amendment thereto that in each case would (assuming that each were a
reporting company under the 1934 Act, whether or not it is so registered) be
required to be filed as an exhibit to an Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by
BFC as of the date of this Reorganization Agreement that has not already been
filed as an exhibit to BFC's Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1993, or in any other SEC Document filed prior to the date of
this Reorganization Agreement.

5.27 Material Contract Defaults. To the best of the
--------------------------
knowledge, information and belief of BFC and BFSB, neither BFC nor any BFC
Subsidiary is in default in any respect under any contract, agreement,
commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy, or other instrument to which
it is a party or by which its respective assets, business, or

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 50
<PAGE> 57
operations may be bound or affected or under which it or its respective assets,
business, or operations receives benefits, and which default is reasonably
expected to have either individually or in the aggregate a material adverse
effect on BFC or any BFC Subsidiary on a consolidated basis, and there has not
occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute such a default.

5.28 Reports. Since September 30, 1989, or in the case of
-------
BFC the date of the organization of BFC as a savings and loan holding company,
BFC and BFSB have filed all reports and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required to
file with (i) the ASBD; (ii) the OTS; (iii) the Federal Reserve, (iv) the FDIC,
(v) the SEC, including, but not limited to, Annual Reports on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Reports on Forms 2900 and FFIEC 034 and
proxy statements; and (vi) any other applicable federal or state securities or
banking authorities (except, in the case of federal or state securities
authorities, filings that are not material). As of their respective dates,
each of such reports and documents, including the financial statements,
exhibits, and schedules thereto, complied in all material respects with all of
the requirements of their respective forms and all of the statutes, rules, and
regulations enforced or promulgated by the Regulatory Authority with which they
were filed. All such reports were true and complete in all material respects
and did not contain any untrue statement as stated including any amendments
thereto of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. BFC has previously
provided to UPC true and correct copies of all such reports filed by BFC or
BFSB after September 30, 1989.

the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act and BFC has filed with the SEC all material
forms and reports required by law to be filed by BFC with the SEC, which forms

and do not misstate a material fact or omit to state a material fact required

which they were made, not misleading.

5.30 Statements True and Correct. None of the information

prepared by, or on behalf of, BFC or any BFC Subsidiary regarding BFC, BFSB or
any other BFC Subsidiary included or to be included in the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to BFC's shareholders in connection with the Shareholders Meeting,
and any other documents to be filed with the SEC, or any other Regulatory
Authority in connection with the transaction contemplated herein, at the
respective times such documents are filed, and, with respect to the Proxy

ARTICLE 6

COVENANTS OF UPC

6.1 Regulatory Approvals. Within sixty (60) days after
--------------------
execution of this Reorganization Agreement, UPC shall file any and all
applications with the appropriate government Regulatory Authorities in order to
obtain the Government Approvals and shall take such other actions as may be
reasonably required to consummate the transactions contemplated in this
Reorganization Agreement and the Plan of Merger with reasonable promptness.
UPC shall pay all fees and expenses arising in connection with such
applications for regulatory approval. UPC agrees to provide the appropriate
Regulatory Authorities with the information required by such authorities in
connection with UPC's applications for regulatory approval and UPC agrees to
use its best efforts to obtain such regulatory approvals, and any other

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 52
<PAGE> 59
approvals and consents as may be required for the Closing, as promptly as
practicable; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.1 shall be
-------- -------
construed to obligate UPC to take any action to meet any condition required to
obtain prior regulatory approval if UPC shall, in UPC's reasonable judgement,
deem such condition to be unreasonable or inconsistent with previous regulatory
approvals received by UPC in transactions of this type and to constitute a
significant impediment upon UPC's ability to carry on its business or
acquisition programs or to require UPC to increase UPC's capital ratios to
amounts in excess of the Federal Reserve's minimum capital ratio guidelines
which may be in effect from time to time. UPC shall not knowingly take any
action, or omit to take any action during the term of this Reorganization
Agreement which would adversely affect the receipt by UPC of the Government
Approvals or adversely affect the ability of UPC to perform its obligations
under this Reorganization Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Reorganization Agreement, UPC and INTERIM agree to use all reasonable
efforts and to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective, with reasonable
promptness after the date of this Reorganization Agreement, the transaction
contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement, including, without limitation,
using reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining or
other order adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the
transaction contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement. UPC shall use, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its best efforts to obtain
consents of all third parties and Regulatory Authorities necessary or desirable
for the consummation of each of the transactions contemplated by this
Reorganization Agreement.

6.2 Reservation, Listing and Registration of UPC Common Stock
----------------------------------------------------------
under the Securities Laws. UPC shall reserve for issuance that number of
- -------------------------
shares of UPC Common Stock necessary to satisfy the Consideration to be paid to
the BFC Record Holders at the Effective Time of the Merger. UPC shall
cooperate with BFC in the preparation of the BFC Proxy Statement to be used at
the Shareholders Meeting (and which shall serve also as UPC's prospectus with
respect to UPC's issuance of shares of the UPC Common Stock) and shall cause a
registration statement on the appropriate form of the SEC to be prepared and
filed so as to cause any shares of UPC Common Stock which may be delivered to
the BFC Record Holders in payment of the Consideration to be registered under
the 1933 Act and to be duly qualified under appropriate state securities laws.
UPC shall also list for trading on the NYSE the shares of UPC Common Stock so
delivered. Such reservation, registration, qualification and listing shall be
effected prior to the Closing.

<PAGE> 60
6.3 Employee Benefits. Following the consummation of the
-----------------
transactions contemplated herein, UPC shall not be obligated to make further
contributions to any of the Employee Plans or Benefit Arrangements of BFC or
the BFC Subsidiaries and all employees of BFC and the BFC Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger who shall continue as
employees of BFC as the Surviving Corporation or as employees of any other UPC
Subsidiary will be afforded the opportunity to participate in any employee
benefit plans maintained by UPC or UPC's Subsidiaries, including but not
limited to any "employee benefit plan," as that term is defined in ERISA, on an
equal basis with employees of UPC or any UPC Subsidiaries with comparable
positions, compensation, and tenure. Service with BFC or with any BFC
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time of the Merger by such former BFC Company
employees will be deemed service with UPC for purposes of determining
eligibility for participation and vesting in such employee benefit plans of UPC
and UPC's Subsidiaries. In its sole discretion, UPC may elect to postpone
until the first day of January next following the Effective Time of the Merger
the participation of the employees of BFC and BFC's Subsidiaries in the
employee benefit plans maintained by UPC or UPC's Subsidiaries; provided,
--------
however, during any such postponement period, the BFC Employee Plans and all
- -------
related employee benefit plans shall continue in full force and effect,
(including the continued receipt of all customary corporate contributions in
accordance with the past practice of BFC and BFSB for the period prior to the
termination of the plans), except as expressly modified or amended by the terms
of this Reorganization Agreement, or until such time as the plans are replaced
by benefit plans maintained by UPC.

6.4 Conduct of Business; Notice of Adverse Change. UPC shall
---------------------------------------------
not knowingly engage in any activity which in the opinion of the management of
UPC would prohibit UPC or INTERIM from delivering the Consideration to the
Exchange Agent at Closing or consummating the transactions contemplated in this
Reorganization Agreement. UPC shall notify BFC in writing immediately upon
becoming aware of any material adverse change in the financial condition or
prospects of UPC or any event which would prohibit UPC's performance under the
terms of this Reorganization Agreement.

7.4 Conduct of Business -- Certain Actions.
--------------------------------------
(a) Except to the extent necessary to consummate the
transactions specifically contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement, BFC
and BFSB shall not, and shall use their respective best efforts to ensure that
their respective directors, officers, employees, and advisors do not, directly
or indirectly, institute, solicit, or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing any information not legally required to be furnished) any inquiry,
discussion, or proposal, or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any confidential or non-public information to, any corporate,
partnership, person or

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 60
<PAGE> 67
other entity or group (other than to UPC or any UPC Subsidiary) concerning any
"Acquisition Proposal" (as defined below), except for actions reasonably
considered by the Board of Directors of BFC, based upon the advice of outside
legal counsel, to be required in order to fulfill its fiduciary obligations.
BFC shall notify UPC immediately if any Acquisition Proposal has been or should
hereafter be received by BFC or BFSB, such notice to contain, at a minimum, the
identity of such persons, and, subject to disclosure being consistent with the
fiduciary obligations of BFC's Board of Directors, a copy of any written
inquiry, the terms of any proposal or inquiry, any information requested or
discussions sought to be initiated, and the status of any reports, negotiations
or expressions of interest. For purposes of this Section, "Acquisition
Proposal" means any tender offer, agreement, understanding or other proposal
pursuant to which any corporation, partnership, person or other entity or
group, other than UPC or any UPC Subsidiary, would directly or indirectly (i)
acquire or participate in a merger, share exchange, consolidation or any other
business combination involving BFC or BFSB; (ii) acquire the right to vote ten
percent (10%) or more of the BFC Common Stock or BFSB Common Stock; (iii)
acquire a significant portion of the assets or earning power of BFC or of BFSB;
or (iv) acquire in excess of ten percent (10%) of the outstanding BFC Common
Stock or BFSB Common Stock.

(b) As a condition of and as an inducement to UPC's
entering into this Reorganization Agreement, BFC and BFSB covenant,
acknowledge, and agree that it shall be a specific, absolute, and
unconditionally binding condition precedent to either BFC's or BFSB's entering
into a letter of intent, agreement in principle, or definitive agreement
(whether or not considered binding, non-binding, conditional or unconditional)
with any third-party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or supporting or
indicating an intent to support an Acquisition Proposal, other than this
Reorganization Agreement and the transactions contemplated in this
Reorganization Agreement, regardless of whether BFC or BFSB has otherwise
complied with the provisions of Section 7.4(a) hereof, that BFC or such
third-party which is a party to any Acquisition Proposal shall have paid UPC
the sum of Three Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($3,500,000),
which sum represents the (i) direct costs and expenses (including, but not
limited to, fees and expenses incurred by UPC's financial or other consultants,
printing costs, investment bankers, accountants, and counsel) incurred by or on
behalf of UPC in negotiating and undertaking to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 61
<PAGE> 68
Reorganization Agreement; (ii) indirect costs and expenses of UPC in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement, including
UPC's management time devoted to negotiation and preparation for the
transactions contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement; and (iii) UPC's
loss as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Reorganization
Agreement not being consummated. Accordingly, BFC and BFSB hereby jointly and
severally stipulate and covenant that prior to BFC's or BFSB's entering into a
letter of intent, agreement in principle, or definitive agreement, (whether
binding or non-binding, conditional or unconditional) with any third-party with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or supporting or indicating an intent to
support an Acquisition Proposal, either BFC or such third-party shall have paid
to UPC the amount set forth above in immediately available funds to satisfy the
specific, absolute, and unconditionally binding condition precedent imposed by
this Section 7.4. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.4(b) to the
contrary, in the event such Acquisition Proposal should be the result of an
unsolicited offer or takeover of BFC or BFSB, any sums due UPC by BFC pursuant
to the terms of this Section 7.4 shall be paid by BFC to UPC at the closing of
the transactions set forth in such Acquisition Proposal and all obligations of
UPC to hold the Closing by the Target Date shall be tolled until such time as
the transactions set forth in any such Acquisition Proposal shall have been
consummated or until such time as the Acquisition Proposal shall have expired
plus such reasonable time as UPC shall require. UPC and INTERIM each
acknowledges that under no circumstances shall any officer or director of BFC
or BFSB (unless such officer or director shall have an interest in a potential
acquiring party in any Acquisition Proposal) be held personally liable to UPC
or INTERIM for any amount of the foregoing payment. On payment of such amount
to UPC, UPC and INTERIM shall have no cause of action or claim (either in law
or equity) whatsoever against BFC or BFSB, or any officer or director of BFC or
BFSB, with respect to or in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, this
Reorganization Agreement or the Plan of Merger.

(c) The requirements, conditions, and obligations
imposed by this Section 7.4 shall continue in full force and effect from the
date of this Reorganization Agreement until October 1, 1994, unless and until
the earlier of any of the following events shall occur, in which event,
thereafter neither BFC nor BFSB shall be obligated to pay the amount required
by this Section 7.4 as a condition precedent to such transaction:

(1) This Reorganization Agreement shall have been terminated (i)
mutually by the Parties pursuant to Section 9.1(a) of this
Reorganization Agreement; (ii) by UPC and INTERIM pursuant to

respective obligations as required by the provisions
of Section 8.1(a) of this Reorganization Agreement;

(iii) The failure by UPC or INTERIM to effect all
corporate action necessary on their respective parts
as required by the provisions of Section 8.1 of this
Reorganization Agreement or to satisfy the conditions

Reorganization Agreement;

shall have issued or granted since September 30, 1993, through the Closing Date
any additional BFC Stock Options, and all validly issued and outstanding BFC
Stock Options shall have been fully exercised prior to the Closing or tendered
to BFC for conversion into options to purchase shares of UPC Common Stock as
contemplated in Section 2.7 of this Reorganization Agreement and none shall
have been repurchased by BFC or BFSB prior to the Closing; (vi) from the date
hereof, BFC shall not have declared or paid any cash dividends except its
customary and historical quarterly cash dividend (which may be increased by One
Cent ($.01) per share) prior to Closing; provided, however, in the event the
-------- -------
Closing shall not have occurred by October 1, 1994 (the "Target Date"), BFC may
increase its quarterly cash dividend for any quarter subsequent to the Target
Date and prior to Closing to an amount not to exceed the cash dividend ratio
paid by UPC on shares of UPC Common Stock adjusted by the Exchange Ratio; and
(vii) the Merger can be accounted for as a "pooling of interests" on the
financial statements of UPC. The criteria and calculations set forth above
shall be determined in accordance with GAAP assuming that BFC and BFSB shall
have been operated consistently in the normal course of their business;
provided, however, that the effects of any balance sheet expansion through
abnormal, unusual, nonrecurring or out of the ordinary borrowings or by the
realization of extraordinary or nonrecurring gains or other income from the
disposition of assets or liabilities or through similar transactions shall be
eliminated from the calculations;

(j) Non-Compete Agreements. Each member of the
----------------------
Board of Directors of BFC shall have entered into a non-compete agreement with
UPC and BFC substantially in the form of UPC's standard form of non-compete
agreement, a copy which is annexed hereto as Exhibit 8.2(j), providing for a
term of not less than two (2) years and covering the general geographic
region(s) in which BFC and BFSB currently operate and do business in or have a
present intention to do business in;

(k) Tax Opinion. UPC shall have received a
-----------
written opinion from counsel to the effect that the transactions contemplated
by this Reorganization Agreement and the Plan of Merger will constitute one or
more tax-free reorganizations under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code
and that the BFC Record Holders will not recognize any gain or loss to the
extent that such BFC Record Holders exchange shares of BFC Common Stock for
shares of UPC Common Stock as contemplated by this Reorganization Agreement and
the Plan of Merger assuming that the shares of BFC Common Stock so exchanged by
such BFC Record Holders are held by them as capital assets at the time of such
exchange;

<PAGE> 78
(l) Pooling of Interests Accounting Treatment.
-----------------------------------------
UPC shall have received (i) from Price Waterhouse, or other independent
accountants acceptable to UPC, a letter dated within five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date, in form and substance acceptable to UPC, stating the accountants'
opinion that, based upon the information furnished to them, the Reorganization
and Merger should be accounted for by UPC as a "pooling of interests" for
financial statement purposes and that such accounting treatment is in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and (ii) from BFC's
regularly retained independent accountants or other independent accountants
acceptable to UPC, a letter dated within five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date stating that, upon a review of BFC's books and records, the accountants
are aware of no reason why a business combination, such as the one contemplated
in this Reorganization Agreement, to which BFC is a party should not be
accounted for as a "pooling of interests" under generally accepted accounting
principles;

(m) Receipt of Affiliate Letters. Pursuant to
----------------------------
the provisions of Section 6.2 of this Reorganization Agreement, UPC shall have
received a written commitment in form and substance satisfactory to UPC and its
counsel (an "Affiliate Letter") from each BFC Record Holder who would be deemed
an Affiliate of BFC at the time of Closing under the Securities Laws and who
accepts shares of UPC Common Stock as Consideration for the cancellation,
exchange and conversion of his shares of BFC Common Stock pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Reorganization Agreement, committing to UPC that such
BFC Record Holder shall not pledge, assign, sell, transfer, devise, otherwise
alienate or take any action which would eliminate or diminish the risk of
owning or holding the shares of UPC Common Stock to be received by such BFC
Record Holder upon consummation of the Merger, nor enter into any formal or
informal agreement to pledge, assign, sell or transfer, devise, or otherwise
alienate his right, title and interests in any of the shares of UPC Common
Stock to be delivered by UPC to such BFC Record Holder pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Reorganization Agreement until such time as UPC shall
have publicly released a statement of UPC's consolidated earnings reflecting
the combined financial results of operations of UPC and BFC for a period of not
less than thirty (30) days subsequent to the Effective Time of the Merger;

(n) Employment Agreements. Mr. William D.
---------------------
Powell, President and Chief Executive Officer of BFC, and Mr. C. Raymond
Duncan, Senior Vice-President and Treasurer of BFC, shall each have entered
into an Employment Agreement with UPC or BFC substantially in the form of the
Employment Agreement annexed hereto as Exhibit 8.2(n), and in consideration for
entering into such Employment Agreements each shall have waived all rights

<PAGE> 79
under any existing employment agreements with BFC or BFSB except as provided in
Certain Post Merger Agreements; and

(o) Fairness Opinion. UPC shall have received a
----------------
"fairness opinion" letter from its independent financial adviser to the effect
that, in the opinion of such adviser the Consideration to be received by the
BFC Record Holders is fair to the shareholders of UPC from a financial point of
view, and such "fairness opinion" shall not have been withdrawn prior to the
Closing Date, and UPC shall have received an updated "fairness opinion" letter
from such advisers within five (5) days prior to the Closing Date reinforcing
the opinions provided in the initial "fairness opinion" letter.

8.3 Conditions to Obligations of All Parties. The
----------------------------------------
obligation of each party to effect the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be subject to the fulfillment, at or prior to the Closing, of the following
conditions:

(a) No Pending or Threatened Claims. That no claim,

in connection therewith;

---------------------------------------
Obtained. The Parties hereto shall have received all applicable Governmental

been appealed within ten (10) business days of the receipt thereof;

(e) By UPC or INTERIM in the event the conditions
set forth in Sections 8.2 or 8.3 are not satisfied in all material respects as

failure has not been waived prior to the Closing;

shall have been, in UPC's good faith opinion, a material adverse change in the
business, property, assets (including loan portfolios), liabilities (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 74
<PAGE> 81
or otherwise), prospects, operations, liquidity, income, condition (financial
or otherwise) or net worth of BFC or BFSB taken as a whole, or upon the

registered holders of the BFC Common Stock which are the subject of the instant
transaction;

(g) By UPC, INTERIM or BFC in the event that
there shall have been a material breach of any obligation of the other Party

its assets or to be acquired in any other manner by any other Person or to
acquire a material amount of assets or a material equity position in any other
Person, whether financial or otherwise;

(i) By UPC or INTERIM should BFC or BFSB or any BFC
Subsidiary enter into any formal agreement, letter of understanding, memorandum
or other similar arrangement with any bank regulatory authority establishing a

sell a substantial portion of its assets; or

(j) By BFC or BFSB in the event the Current Market

manner prescribed in Section 10.1 ("Notices") of this Reorganization Agreement.

9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event that this
---------------------
Reorganization Agreement should be terminated pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof,
all further obligations of the Parties under this Reorganization Agreement
shall terminate without further liability of any Party to another; provided,
--------
however, that a termination under Section 9.1 hereof shall not relieve any
- -------
Party of any liability for a breach of this Reorganization Agreement or for any
misstatement or misrepresentation made hereunder prior to such termination, or
be deemed to constitute a waiver of any

10.10 Interpretation. The headings contained in this
--------------
Reorganization Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Reorganization Agreement.

10.11 Payment of Expenses. Except as set forth herein, UPC
-------------------
and BFC shall each pay its own fees and expenses (including, without
limitation, legal fees and expenses) incurred by it in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereunder.

-------------------
represent and warrant to each other that they have employed no broker or finder

or finder as a result of the execution of this Reorganization Agreement or the
closing of the transactions contemplated herein. This section shall survive
the termination of this Reorganization Agreement.

10.13 Equitable Remedies. The Parties hereto agree that, in
------------------
the event of a breach of this Reorganization Agreement by BFC or BFSB, UPC and
INTERIM will be without an adequate remedy at law by reason of the unique
nature of BFC and BFSB. In recognition thereof, in addition to (and not in
lieu of) any remedies at law which may be available to UPC and INTERIM, UPC,
and INTERIM shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief, including the
remedies of specific performance and injunction, in the event of a breach of
this Reorganization Agreement by BFC or BFSB, and no attempt on the part of UPC
or INTERIM to obtain such equitable relief shall be deemed to constitute an
election of remedies by UPC or INTERIM which would preclude UPC or INTERIM from
obtaining any remedies at law to which it would otherwise be entitled. BFC and
BFSB covenant that they shall not contend in any such proceeding that UPC or
INTERIM is not entitled to a decree of specific performance by reason of having
an adequate remedy at law.

10.14 Attorneys' Fees. If any Party hereto shall bring an
---------------
action at law or in equity to enforce its rights under this Reorganization
Agreement (including an action based upon a misrepresentation or the breach of
any warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein), the
prevailing Party in such action shall be entitled to recover from the other
Party its reasonable costs and expenses necessarily incurred in connection with
such action (including fees, disbursements and expenses of attorneys and costs
of investigation).

or document furnished in connection herewith,

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION - PAGE 79
<PAGE> 86
shall survive the Closing and any investigation at any time made by or on
behalf of the Parties hereto and shall expire at the Effective Time of the
Merger except as to any matter which is based upon willful fraud with respect
to which the representations and warranties set forth in this Reorganization
Agreement shall expire on the earlier of six months from the Effective Time of
the Merger or the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation. Nothing
in this Section 10.15 shall limit BFC's, BFSB's, UPC's or INTERIM's rights or
remedies for misrepresentations, breaches of this Reorganization Agreement or
any other improper action or inaction by the other Party hereto prior to the
its termination. All obligations, agreements, covenants and undertakings of
the Parties hereto or to the Certain Post Merger Agreements to be performed
either in whole or in part after the Effective Time of the Merger shall survive
the Closing and shall not expire at the Effective Time of the Merger.

10.16 No Waiver. No failure, delay or omission of or by any
---------
Party in exercising any right, power or remedy upon any breach or default of
any other Party shall impair any such rights, powers or remedies of the Party
not in breach or default, nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such
right, power or remedy, or an acquiescence in any similar breach or default;
nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any
other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver,
permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any Party
of any provisions of this Reorganization Agreement must be in writing and must
be executed by the Parties to this Reorganization Agreement and shall be
effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.

or such other name as BFC shall adopt.

ARTICLE 4
DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSACTION

4.1 Conversion of the INTERIM Common Stock. At the Effective Time 
--------------------------------------
of the Merger, each share of $.01 par value common stock of INTERIM (the 
"INTERIM Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the 
Effective Time of The Merger shall, by virtue of the Merger becoming effective 
and without any further action on the part of anyone, be converted into and 
become one share of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Surviving 
Corporation.

4.2 Conversion and Cancellation of Shares of BFC. At the 
--------------------------------------------
Effective Time of the Merger, each share of $.01 par value common stock 
of BFC issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the 
Merger shall, by virtue of the Merger becoming effective and without any further
action on the part of anyone, be converted, exchanged and cancelled as provided
in Section 4.3 hereof.

4.3 Exchange of BFC Shares; Exchange Ratio. At the Effective Time
--------------------------------------
of the Merger, the outstanding shares of BFC Common Stock held by the BFC 
Record Holders immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall, 
without any further action on the part of anyone, cease to represent any 
interest (equity, shareholder or otherwise) in BFC and shall automatically be 
converted exclusively into, and constitute only the right of the BFC Record 
Holders to receive in exchange for their shares of BFC Common Stock, whole 
shares of UPC Common Stock and a cash payment in settlement of any remaining 
fractional share of UPC

PLAN OF MERGER - EXHIBIT A TO AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

PAGE 86
<PAGE> 93
Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 4.3.
The shares of UPC Common Stock and the cash settlement of any remaining
fractional share of UPC Common Stock deliverable by UPC to the BFC Record
Holders pursuant to the terms of this Reorganization Agreement are sometimes
collectively referred to herein as the "Consideration."

The number of shares of UPC Common Stock to be exchanged for each share of BFC
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger shall be based on an exchange ratio (the "Exchange Ratio") as
determined and set forth in this Section 4.3. The Exchange Ratio shall be
determined as follows:

(A) In the event the Current Market Price
Per Share of UPC Common Stock should be greater than or equal to
$24.00 per share of UPC Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be
based on a fixed Exchange Ratio of 1.078 shares of UPC Common Stock
for each share of BFC Common validly issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger; and

(B) In the event the Current Market Price
Per Share of UPC Common Stock should be less than $24.00 per share of
UPC Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be fixed at 1.078 shares of
UPC Common Stock for each share or BFC Common Stock; provided, however,
-------- -------
BFC shall have the right to either accept the fixed Exchange Ratio of
1.078 or terminate the transaction in accordance with the terms and
provisions of the Reorganization Agreement and this Plan of Merger,
provided, further, in the event BFC should elect to terminate the
-------- -------
Reorganization Agreement and this Plan of Merger in accordance with
this Section 4.3, UPC may, in its sole discretion, reinstate the
Reorganization Agreement and this Plan of Merger and the transactions
contemplated herein by increasing the number of shares of UPC Common
Stock to be delivered by UPC to the BFC Record Holders hereunder (i.e.
the Exchange Ratio) based on a fixed price of $25.87 per share of BFC
Common Stock divided by the Current Market Price Per Share of UPC
------- --
Common Stock.

The Exchange Ratio as determined in this Section 4.3 shall be based on an
aggregate of no more than 1,905,680 shares of BFC Common Stock validly issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and, for
purposes of this paragraph, counting all unexercised BFC Stock Options issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger as shares
of BFC Common Stock so converted and exchanged; provided, however, that no
-------- -------
fractional shares of UPC Common Stock shall be issued and if, after aggregating
all of the shares of

PLAN OF MERGER - EXHIBIT A TO AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

PAGE 87
<PAGE> 94
UPC Common Stock to which a BFC Record Holder is entitled based upon the
Exchange Ratio, there shall be a fractional share of UPC Common Stock
remaining, such fractional share shall be settled by a cash payment therefor
pursuant to the Mechanics of Payment of the Consideration set forth in Section
4.4 hereof, which shall be calculated based upon the Current Market Price Per
Share of one (1) full share of UPC Common Stock.

(i) DEFINITION OF "CURRENT MARKET PRICE
PER SHARE." The "Current Market Price Per Share" shall be the average
closing price per share of the "last" real time trades (i.e., closing
price) of the UPC Common Stock on the NYSE (as published in The Wall
---------
Street Journal) for each of the ten (10) NYSE general market trading
--------------
days next preceding the Closing Date on which the NYSE was open for
business (the "Pricing Period"). In the event the UPC Common Stock
does not trade on one or more of the trading days during the Pricing
Period (a "No Trade Date"), any such No Trade Date shall be
disregarded in computing the average closing price per share of UPC
Common Stock and the average shall be based upon the "last" real time
trades and number of days on which the UPC Common Stock actually
traded during the Pricing Period.

(ii) EFFECTS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS ON THE
EXCHANGE RATIO. The Exchange Ratio shall be unaffected by Appraisal
Rights as granted under Delaware law because the BFC Common Stock is
listed for trading on the AMEX, which is a "national securities
exchange" as defined in rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the
1934 Act, and therefore, pursuant to Delaware Code Section 8-503-262,
no BFC Record Holder may assert Appraisal Rights in connection with
the Merger or the transactions contemplated in this Reorganization
Agreement.

(iii) EFFECT OF STOCK SPLITS, REVERSE STOCK
SPLITS, STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SIMILAR CHANGES IN THE CAPITAL OF BFC.
Should BFC effect any stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock
dividends or similar changes in its respective capital accounts
subsequent to the date of this Reorganization Agreement but prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
in such a manner as the Board of Directors of UPC shall deem in good
faith to be fair and reasonable in order to give effect to such
changes subject to BFC Board of Directors approval.

4.4 Mechanics of Payment of the Consideration. As soon as
------------------------------------------
reasonably practicable, but in any event no more than five (5) Business Days
after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Corporate Trust Department of Union
Planters National Bank,

PLAN OF MERGER - EXHIBIT A TO AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REOGRANIZATION

PAGE 88
<PAGE> 95
Memphis, Tennessee (the "Exchange Agent") shall deliver to each of the BFC
Record Holders such materials and information as may be deemed necessary by the
Exchange Agent to advise the BFC Record Holders of the procedures required for
proper surrender of their certificates evidencing and representing shares of
the BFC Common Stock in order for the BFC Record Holders to receive the
Consideration. Such materials shall include, without limitation, a Letter of
Transmittal, an Instruction Sheet, and a return mailing envelope addressed to
the Exchange Agent (collectively the "Shareholder Materials"). All Shareholder
Materials shall be sent by United States mail to the BFC Record Holders at the
addresses set forth on a certified shareholder list to be delivered by BFC to
UPC at the Closing (the "Shareholder List") and shall also be made available at
the Corporate Trust Department offices of the Exchange Agent. As soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter, the BFC Record Holders of all of the
outstanding shares of BFC Common Stock, shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered, by United States Postal Service, hand delivery or any other means of
delivery selected by such BFC Record Holders, to the Exchange Agent, pursuant
to the Shareholder Materials, the certificates evidencing and representing all
of the shares of BFC Common Stock which were validly issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and the Exchange Agent
shall take prompt action to process such certificates formerly evidencing and
representing shares of BFC Common Stock received by it (including the prompt
return of any defective submissions with instructions as to those actions which
may be necessary to remedy any defects). Upon receipt of the proper submission
of the certificate(s) formerly representing and evidencing ownership of the
shares of BFC Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall, on or prior to the 30th
day after the Effective Time of the Merger, mail to the former BFC Shareholders
in exchange for the certificate(s) surrendered by them, the Consideration to be
paid for each such BFC Shareholder's shares of BFC Common Stock evidenced by
the certificate or certificates which were cancelled and converted exclusively
into the right to receive the Consideration upon the Merger becoming effective.
After the Effective Time of the Merger and until properly surrendered to the
Exchange Agent, each outstanding certificate or certificates which formerly
evidenced and represented the shares of BFC Common Stock of a BFC Record
Holder, subject to the provisions of this Section 4.4, shall be deemed for all
corporate purposes to represent and evidence only the right to receive the
Consideration into which such BFC Record Holder's shares of BFC Common Stock
were converted and aggregated at the Effective Time of the Merger. Unless and
until the outstanding certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger evidenced and represented the BFC Record
Holder's BFC Common Stock shall have been surrendered as provided above, the
Consideration payable to the BFC Record

PLAN OF MERGER - EXHIBIT A TO AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANINZATION

PAGE 89
<PAGE> 96
Holder(s) of the cancelled shares as of any time after the Effective Date shall
not be paid to the BFC Record Holder(s) of such certificate(s) until such
certificates shall have been surrendered in the manner required. Each BFC
Shareholder will be responsible for all federal, state and local taxes which
may be incurred by him on account of his receipt of the Consideration to be
paid in the Merger. The BFC Record Holder(s) of any certificate(s) which shall
have been lost or destroyed may nevertheless, subject to the provisions of this
Section, receive the Consideration to which each such BFC Record Holder is
entitled, provided that each such BFC Record Holder shall deliver to UPC and to
the Exchange Agent: (i) a sworn statement certifying such loss or destruction
and specifying the circumstances thereof and (ii) a lost instrument bond in
form satisfactory to UPC and the Exchange Agent which has been duly executed by
a corporate surety satisfactory to UPC and the Exchange Agent, indemnifying the
Surviving Corporation, UPC, the Exchange Agent (and their respective
successors) to their satisfaction against any loss or expense which any of them
may incur as a result of such lost or destroyed certificates being thereafter
presented. Any costs or expenses which may arise from such replacement
procedure, including the premium on the lost instrument bond, shall be for the
account of the BFC Shareholder.

4.5 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time of the Merger,
--------------------
the stock transfer books of BFC shall be closed and no transfer of shares of
BFC Common Stock shall be made thereafter.

4.6 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time of the Merger,
---------------------
the separate existence of INTERIM shall cease, and INTERIM shall be merged with
and into BFC which, as the Surviving Corporation, shall thereupon and
thereafter possess all of the assets, rights, privileges, appointments, powers,
licenses, permits and franchises of the two merged corporations, whether of a
public or a private nature, and shall be subject to all of the liabilities,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of both BFC and INTERIM.

4.7 Transfer of Assets. At the Effective Time of the Merger, all
------------------
rights, assets, licenses, permits, franchises and interests of BFC and INTERIM
in and to every type of property, whether real, personal, or mixed, whether
tangible or intangible, and to choses in action shall be deemed to be vested in
BFC as the Surviving Corporation by virtue of the Merger and without any deed
or other instrument or act of transfer whatsoever.

4.8 Assumption of Liabilities. At the Effective Time of the
-------------------------
Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall become and be liable for all debts,
liabilities, obligations and contracts of INTERIM as well as those of the
Surviving Corporation, whether the same

PLAN OF MERGER - EXHIBIT A TO AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

PAGE 90
<PAGE> 97
shall be matured or unmatured; whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise; and whether or not reflected or reserved against in the balance
sheets, other financial statements, books of account or records of INTERIM or
the Surviving Corporation.

4.9 Appraisal Rights of BFC Shareholders. Pursuant to the
------------------------------------
provisions of Section 8-503-262 of the Delaware Code, BFC Shareholders shall
not be entitled to assert Appraisal Rights in connection with the Merger or to
seek those appraisal remedies afforded by the Delaware Code because the BFC
Common Stock is listed for trading on the AMEX, which is a "national securities
exchange" as defined in rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act,
and therefore, pursuant to Delaware Code Section 8- 503-262, no BFC Record
Holder may assert Appraisal Rights in connection with the Merger or the
transactions contemplated in this Reorganization Agreement.

4.10 Approvals of Shareholders of BFC and INTERIM. In order to
--------------------------------------------
become effective, the Merger must be approved by the respective shareholders of
BFC and of INTERIM at meetings to be called for that purpose by their
respective Boards of Directors, or by their unanimous action by written consent
complying fully with the laws of Delaware.

4.11 BFC Stock Options. In the event and to the extent that there
-----------------
are any BFC Stock Options validly issued and outstanding at the time of
Closing, such BFC Stock Options shall at the Effective Time of the Merger
automatically and without further action on the part of anyone be converted
into options to purchase shares of UPC Common Stock on the same terms and
conditions attributable to the BFC Stock Options to purchase shares of BFC
Common Stock adjusted by and in accordance with the Exchange Ratio.

ARTICLE 5

AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS

5.1 AMENDMENTS. To the extent permitted by law, this Plan of
Merger may be amended unilaterally by UPC and INTERIM as set forth in Section
10.9(d) of the Reorganization Agreement; provided, however, that the provisions
-------- -------
of Section 4.3 of this Plan of Merger relating to the manner or basis upon
which shares of BFC Common Stock will be converted into the exclusive right to
receive the Consideration from UPC shall not be amended in such a manner as to
reduce the amount of the Consideration payable to the BFC Record Holders
determined as provided in Section 4.3 of this Plan of Merger nor shall this
Plan of Merger be amended to permit UPC to utilize assets other than cash or
good funds to

Reorganization Agreement at any time after the Shareholders' Meeting without

that no amendment to this Plan of Merger shall modify the requirements of
regulatory approval as set forth in Section 8.3(b) of the Reorganization
Agreement.

5.2 AUTHORITY FOR AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. Prior to the

time of filing of the Plan of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, to

to waive or extend the time for the compliance or fulfillment by BFC of any and
all of its obligations under this Plan of Merger, and to waive any or all of

chief executive officer or president or other authorized officer, shall have
the right to amend this Plan of Merger to postpone the Effective Time of the
Merger to a date and time subsequent to the time of filing of the Plan of
Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, to waive any default in the
performance of any term of this Plan of Merger by UPC or INTERIM, to waive or
extend the time for the compliance or fulfillment by UPC or INTERIM of any and
all of their obligations under this Plan of Merger, and to waive any or all of
the conditions precedent to the obligations of BFC under this Plan of Merger
except any condition that, if not satisfied, would result in the violation of

BANCFIRST Corporation
255 Grant Street, S.E.
Decatur, Alabama 35602

Gentlemen:

We have today entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
(the "Agreement") between Union Planters Corporation ("UPC"); BFC Acquisition
Company, Inc., a wholly owned acquisition subsidiary of UPC; BANCFIRST
Corporation ("BFC"); and BANKFIRST, a federal savings bank ("BFSB"). This
letter is intended to set forth certain additional agreements and undertakings
of each of the above parties and each of such parties agrees that this letter
is an integral part of the Agreement (as referred to in Section 10.7 thereof)
and is being entered into separately solely as an accommodation to UPC. All
terms used herein without definition shall have the same meaning as ascribed in
the Agreement.

Accordingly, in consideration of the parties having entered into the
Agreement and for other good and valuable considerations, the receipt of which
is hereby acknowledged, it is hereby further agreed that:

A. Employees.
---------

1. Following the effective date of eligibility of BFC and BFSB
employees to participate in all employee benefit plans of UPC, including all
qualified pension, profit sharing, and stock bonus, and employee stock
ownership plans and all employee welfare benefit plans, BFC and BFSB shall take
such steps as are necessary to terminate the BFSB pension plan, provide for the
merger of the BFSB 401(k) profit sharing plan with and into the UPC 401(k)
profit sharing plan, and terminate its existing employee welfare benefit plans.
Upon the termination of the BFSB pension plan, employees of BFC and BFSB who
are participants in such pension plan will, to the extent provided by under the
plan and by applicable law, become fully vested in and eligible to receive
benefits under the plan and such plan will be fully funded by BFC or BFSB prior
to termination to the extent required by applicable law. To the extent
permitted by the plan and applicable law, BFC shall distribute all vested
accrued benefits to plan participants as soon as reasonably practicable
following the termination of the BFSB pension plan in the manner required by
applicable law. BFC and BFSB shall obtain such regulatory determinations
regarding the termination or merger of any
<PAGE> 102
BANCFIRST Corporation
January 27, 1994
Page 2

tax-qualified plan as may be appropriate to insure the qualified status of such
plans (and related trusts) under the Internal Revenue Code. Upon the election
of any participant, any vested accrued benefit under any retirement plan
sponsored by BFC may be transferred to UPC's 401(k) profit sharing plan or, at
the election of the participant, to any other plan of UPC that is permitted to
accept a transfer from another qualified retirement plan.

Following the Merger and, in any event, no later than January
1, 1995, employees of BFC or BFSB shall be eligible to receive group
hospitalization, medical, life, disability, and other employee welfare benefits
no less than those provided to other employees of UPC holding comparable
positions.

Following the Merger and, in any event, no later than January
1, 1995, employees of BFC and BFSB shall be entitled to participate, to the
same extent and on the same terms as the employees of UPC, in any qualified
pension, profit sharing, stock bonus plans, and employee stock ownership plans
in effect at such time for employees of UPC. Employees of BFC and BFSB shall
receive service credit from their hire date of employment at BFC and BFSB for
purposes of eligibility and vesting requirements under UPC's employee benefit
plans. UPC shall provide full coverage under its group medical, disability,
and life insurance plans for pre-existing medical conditions (to the extent
such condition is currently covered under the BFC or BFSB plan, and such
condition would be covered under UPC's plan if it were not preexisting).

Following the Merger, all previously accrued vacation,
holiday, sick, personal or other leave of BFC or BFSB employees shall be
credited to such employees and be available for use upon such terms as local
management may provide.

Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph A(1) to the
contrary, no rights or vesting in any stock plan of BFC or BFSB, including any
stock option plan, shall be accelerated or modified in contravention of the
accounting rules necessary to account for the Merger under the "pooling of
interests" method of accounting.

2. Any changes in personnel within one year of the Merger will be
subject to the approval of BFSB's current Chief Executive Officer, Mr. William
D. Powell. Subject to the provisions of paragraph A(3), all employees who are
continued in the employ of BFC or BFSB shall retain their current titles and
position with BFC or BFSB during any period of service with BFC or BFSB
following the Merger, except as otherwise provided for herein. Following the
Merger, the salary and bonus of all employees, other than Mr. Powell, shall be
determined annually or as otherwise determined by the local management or board
of directors of BFC or BFSB, as appropriate, without prior approval by UPC.
Mr. Powell's initial salary shall be determined in accordance with the terms of
his employment agreement with UPC. Thereafter, Mr. Powell's salary and bonus
shall be determined no less frequently than annually by the management of UPC.
Following the Merger, all perquisites or similar
<PAGE> 103
BANCFIRST Corporation
January 27, 1994
Page 3

benefits currently provided to Mr. Powell and other employees of BFC or BFSB,
including, but not limited to, the use of employer-owned automobiles (as
assigned to employees by the Chief Executive Officer of BFSB), expense
accounts, free checking, professional or club memberships or dues, vacation
leave, sick leave, incentive bonuses and personal leave, shall continue to be
provided at the discretion of, and to the extent authorized by the Board of
Directors of BFC and BFSB, respectively, without prior approval by UPC.
Following the Merger, all matters relating to personnel, including the hiring
of, assignment of positions and titles to, and retention of, employees in the
normal course of business, shall be determined by the local management of BFC
or BFSB, as appropriate, without prior approval by UPC.

3. UPC will provide severance payments to employees of BFC and
BFSB (other than employees whose severance benefits are provided for in written
employment agreements) whose employment is terminated within two years (2)
years after the Effective Date due to job reductions initiated at the request
of UPC and not in the ordinary course of business by BFC or BFSB consistent
with the severance policies of UPC as set forth in Exhibit I attached hereto.
All years of service of a terminated employee with BFC or BFSB prior to the
Merger shall be counted for purposes of computing "Service" under the UPC
severance schedule. Any employee terminated pursuant to this paragraph shall
also be paid for all accrued but unused vacation days.

B. Existing Employment Agreement. UPC will cause BFC and BFSB to
-----------------------------
honor its existing employment contracts with Mr. Powell and Mr. C. Raymond
Duncan, Senior Vice President/Treasurer of BFC and BFSB, and UPC acknowledges
and agrees that the Merger constitutes a Change of Control under the existing
Employment Agreements. The payments due to Mr. Powell and Mr. Duncan upon the
Closing Date are $389,774 and $230,765, respectively. In addition, following
the Merger, Messrs. Powell and Duncan will continue to serve in their present
capacities with BFC and BFSB and will be provided with new employment contracts
in the form attached as Exhibit II. BFC, BFSB, and UPC will enter into
separate agreements to provide for the payment of supplemental retirement
benefits to Messrs. Powell and Duncan in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
III.

C. Stock Options.
-------------

1. In connection with the Merger, Messrs. Powell and Mr.
Duncan shall receive 10,000 and 5,000 options, respectively, to purchase shares
of UPC's common stock upon the terms set forth in their respective employment
agreements with UPC and the UPC 1992 Nonqualified Stock Plan. Senior Vice
Presidents Wallace Terry, Miles Wright, and Richard Gowan will each receive
stock options to purchase 1,500 shares of UPC's common stock, subject to the
terms and conditions of the UPC 1992 Nonqualified Stock Plan.

BANCFIRST Corporation

2. Following the merger, management personnel of BFC and
BFSB shall be reviewed for possible grants of options to purchase UPC stock at
such times and to the same extent and on the same conditions as management
personnel at other affiliates of UPC, as determined by the Stock Option
Committee of the Board of Directors of UPC.

D. Indemnification
---------------

1. From and after the Effective Time of the Merger, UPC
(including its successors) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, an officer, director or
employee of BFC or BFSB (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses (including attorney's fees), liabilities or judgments
or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (each a "Claim") in which an
Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or a witness based
in whole of in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer or employee of BFC or BFSB or any BFC
subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing or
occurring prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (including, without
limitation, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Agreement),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, or at or
after, the Effective Time of the Merger (the "Indemnified Liabilities") to the
full extent permitted under applicable state or federal law in effect as of the
date hereof or as amended applicable to a time prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger and under BFC's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the
BFSB's Federal Stock Charter and Bylaws (and UPC shall pay expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified
Party to the full extent permitted by applicable state or federal law in effect
as of the date hereof or as amended applicable to a time prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law).
Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification hereunder upon learning
of any Claim shall notify UPC (but the failure to notify UPC shall not relieve
UPC from any liability which they may have hereunder except to the extent such
failure prejudices UPC) and shall deliver to UPC the undertaking, if any,
required by applicable law. The obligations of UPC hereunder shall continue in
full force and effect, without any amendment thereto, for a period of not less
than six years from the Effective Time of the Merger; provided, however, that
all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within
such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

2. From and after the Effective Time of the Merger, the
directors, officers and employees of BFC or the BFSB who become directors,
officers or employees of UPC or any of subsidiaries, (i) except for the
indemnification rights set forth in paragraph (1) hereunder, shall have
indemnification rights having prospective application only and (ii) shall be
covered on a prospective basis by UPC's directors and officers liability
insurance policy on a basis at least equal to the coverage provided to persons
in similar positions at UPC and
<PAGE> 105
BANCFIRST Corporation
January 27, 1994
Page 5

its subsidiaries. The prospective indemnification rights shall consist of such
rights to which directors, officers and employees of UPC or its subsidiaries

successors and assigns of UPC.

------------------------
corporate existence and corporate name of BFC (or such corporate name as BFC
may assume prior to, or upon, the Effective Time of the Merger) and BFSB as
subsidiaries of UPC for a period of three (3) years and provide the operation
of BFC and BFSB as community banks within UPC's corporate structure. Further,

elected in accordance with law and the BFC's and BFSB's Charter and Bylaws.
Thereafter, UPC agrees that each such person shall be reelected director for at

7. Benefits Payable Upon Disability.
--------------------------------
(a) Primary Disability Benefits. In the event of the
---------------------------
Disability (as hereinafter defined) of the Executive, the Bank shall continue
to pay the Executive the monthly compensation provided in paragraph 4 hereof
during the period of his disability provided, however, that in the event the
Executive is disabled for a continuous period exceeding eighteen (18) calendar
months, the Bank may, at its election, terminate the Agreement, in which event
the Executive shall be entitled to receive the benefits described in paragraph
7(b).

As used in this Agreement, the term "disability"
shall mean the complete inability of the Executive to perform his duties under
this Agreement as determined by an independent physician selected with the
approval of the Bank and the Executive.

(b) Secondary Disability Benefits. In the event that the
-----------------------------
Bank elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7(a), then in lieu
of any other benefits the Executive would have been entitled to hereunder, the
Bank shall pay to the Executive a monthly disability benefit equal to seventy
(70) percent of his monthly salary at the time he became disabled. Payment of
such disability benefit shall commence on the last day of the month following
the month for which the final payment under paragraph 7(a) was made and cease
with the earlier of (i) the payment for the month in which the Executive dies
or (ii) the payment for the month preceding the month in which the Executive
attains age 65.

(c) Disability Benefit Offset. Any amounts payable under
-------------------------
paragraph 7(a) or 7(b) shall be reduced by any amounts paid to the Executive
under any other disability program maintained by UPC in which the Executive
participates; however, such payments shall not be reduced by the amount of any
payments pursuant to social security and workmen's compensation.

(d) Service During Disability. During the period the
-------------------------
Executive is entitled to receive payments under paragraphs 7(a) and

-4-
<PAGE> 112
(b), the Executive shall, to the extent that he is physically and mentally able
to do so, furnish information and assistance to the Bank and UPC.

8. Grant of Stock Options. Upon the effective date of this
----------------------
Agreement, the Executive shall be granted 10,000 options to purchase UPC Stock
(at the fair market value on such date) under the 1992 UPC Nonqualified Stock
Plan ("Stock Plan") or any similar plan then maintained by UPC. Such options
shall be issued in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plan and shall be
exercisable over a five-year period as provided under the Stock Plan, but in
any event, such options shall be fully exercisable no later than the date of
the Executive's retirement. Following the Executive's retirement, such options
shall remain exercisable for a period equal to the greater of (a) ninety (90)
days from the date of the Executive's retirement or (b) the period specified by
the Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors of UPC.

9. Payments to the Executive Upon Termination of Employment.
--------------------------------------------------------
(a) Event of Termination. Upon the occurrence of an
--------------------
Event of Termination (as hereinafter defined) during the period of the
Executive's employment under this Agreement, the provisions of this paragraph 9
shall apply. As used in this Agreement, an "Event of Termination" shall mean
the termination of the Executive's employment hereunder for any reason other
than "cause" or retirement at or after the normal retirement age under any
qualified retirement plan(s) maintained by UPC or termination pursuant to
Paragraph 7. A termination for "cause" shall include termination because of
the Executive's personal dishonesty, breach of fiduciary duty involving
personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful
violation of any law, rule or regulation (other than traffic violations or
similar offenses) or final cease-and-desist order, or material breach or any
provision of this Agreement. In the event of termination for cause the
Executive shall have no right to receive compensation or other benefits for any
period after such termination; provided, however, that, the Executive shall be
entitled to receive all vested benefits as of the date of such termination.

(b) Event of Termination Without Change of Control. Upon
----------------------------------------------
the occurrence of an Event of Termination other than after a Change of Control
(as hereinafter defined), the Bank shall pay to the Executive monthly, or in
the event of his subsequent death, to his designated beneficiary or
beneficiaries, or to his estate, as the case may be, as severance pay or
liquidated damages, or both, during the period below described a sum equal to
the highest monthly rate of salary paid to the Executive at any time under this
Agreement. Such payments shall commence on the last day of the month following
the date of said Event of Termination and shall continue until the date this
Agreement would have expired but for

-5-
<PAGE> 113
said occurrence, with such occurrence being viewed as a determination by the
Bank not to extend the Agreement as provided for in paragraph 3.

(c) Event of Termination After Change of Control. If,
--------------------------------------------
after a "Change of Control" (as hereinafter defined) of UPC, BFC, or the Bank,
any of the parties hereto, or their successors or assigns, shall terminate the
employment of the Executive during the period of employment under this
Agreement for any reason other than "cause," as defined in paragraph 9(a),
retirement at or after the normal retirement age under any tax-qualified
retirement plan(s) maintained by UPC, termination pursuant to paragraph 7, or
nonrenewal, or otherwise change the present capacity or circumstances in which
the Executive is employed as set forth in paragraph 2 of this Agreement or
cause a reduction in the Executive's responsibilities or authority or
compensation or other benefits provided under this Agreement without the
Executive's written consent, then the Executive, or his beneficiaries,
dependents and estate, as the case may be, shall be entitled to the following:

(i) The Executive shall receive a sum equal to
the total amount of the present value of 2.99 times the average annual
compensation payable under this Agreement and includible by the Executive in
gross income for the most recent five taxable years ending before the date on
which the ownership or control of UPC, BFC, or the Bank changed. Such amount
shall be payable to the Executive in a lump sum within ten (10) days of the
occurrence of an Event of Termination under this paragraph 9(c).

(ii) During a period of thirty-six (36)
calendar months beginning with the Event of Termination, the Executive, his
dependents, beneficiaries and estate shall continue to be covered under all
employee benefit plans of the Bank, BFC, or UPC, including, without limitation,
any UPC tax-qualified retirement plans, as if the Executive was still employed
during such period under this Agreement.

(iii) If and to the extent that benefits or service
credit for benefits provided by paragraph 9(c)(ii) shall not be payable or
provided under any such plans to the Executive, his dependents, beneficiaries
and estate, by reason of his no longer being an employee of the Bank, as a
result of termination of employment, UPC shall itself pay or provide for
payment of such benefits and service credit for benefits to the Executive, his
dependents, beneficiaries and estate. Any such payment relating to retirement
shall commence on a date selected by the Executive which must be a date on
which payments under any UPC tax-qualified retirement plan(s) may commence.

-6-
<PAGE> 114
(iv) The Executive shall not be required to mitigate
the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other
employment or otherwise nor shall any amounts received from other employment or
otherwise by the Executive offset in any manner the obligations of UPC
hereunder.

(d) Change of Control. Paragraph 9(c) shall become
-----------------
operative upon the occurrence of a Change of Control of UPC, BFC, or the Bank.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Change of Control" means the sale of
substantially all of the assets of UPC, BFC, or the Bank, or the acquisition,

more in the aggregate voting power of UPC's, BFC's, or the Bank's
then-outstanding Common Stock by any "person" (within the meaning of Sections
13(d) and 14(d) of the Act), including any corporation or group of associated
persons acting in concert, other than (i) UPC or its subsidiaries and/or (ii)
any tax-qualified employee stock ownership plan of UPC or its subsidiaries,
including a trust established pursuant to any such plan; provided, that a
Change of Control will not result from (A) a transfer of voting securities of
UPC, BFC, or the Bank by a person who is the beneficial owner, directly or
indirectly, of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the voting securities of
the UPC, BFC, or the Bank (a "25 Percent Owner") to (i) a member of such 25
Percent Owner's lifetime or by will or the laws of descent and distribution;
(ii) any trust as to which the 25 Percent Owner or a member (or members) of his
immediate family (within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(e) of the Act) is the
beneficiary; (iii) any trust as to which the 25 Percent Owner is the settlor
with sole power to revoke; (iv) any entity over which such 25 Percent Owner has
the power, directly or in directly, to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of the entity, whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract or otherwise; or (v) any charitable trust, foundation
or corporation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code which is funded by the 25
Percent Owner; or (B) the acquisition of voting securities of UPC, BFC, or the
Bank, by either (i) a person who was a 25 Percent Owner on the effective date
of the Agreement or (ii) a person, trust or other entity described in the

the order; however, no vested rights of the Executive shall be affected by such
termination.

(iii) If the Bank is in default (as defined in
section 3(x)(1) of the FDI Act), all obligations under this Agreement shall
terminate as of the date of default; however, no vested rights of the Executive
shall be affected by such termination.

terminated, except to the extent that it may be determined that continuation of
this Agreement is necessary for the continued operation of the Bank, (1) by the
Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") or his or her designee at

Trust Corporation enters into an agreement to provide assistance to or on
behalf of the Bank under the authority contained in Section 13(c) of the FDI
Act; or (2) the Director of OTS or his or her designee at any time the Director

related to the operation of the Bank or when the Bank is determined by the OTS
to be in an unsafe or unsound condition. No vested rights of the Executive
shall be affected by such action.

Employers. The Executive shall not otherwise knowingly act or conduct himself
(i) to the material detriment of the Bank, or (ii) in a manner which is
inimical or contrary to the interests thereof.

12. Federal Income Tax Withholding. The Bank or UPC may withhold

right or interest hereunder shall be assignable by the Executive, his
beneficiaries, or legal representatives without the Employers' prior written
consent; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph 16(a) shall preclude

age (65) and (ii) the cumulative earnings attributable to the Executive's

options shall be issued in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plan and
shall be exercisable over a five-year period as provided under the Stock Plan,

shall apply. As used in this Agreement, an "Event of Termination" shall mean

than "cause" or

-3-
<PAGE> 128
retirement at or after the normal retirement age under any tax-retirement plan
maintained by UPC, or termination pursuant to paragraph 9. A termination for
"cause" shall include termination because of the Executive's personal
dishonesty, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional
failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule or
regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final
cease-and-desist order, or material breach or any provision of this Agreement.
In the event of termination for cause the Executive shall have no right to
receive compensation or other benefits for any period after such termination;
provided, however, that, the Executive shall be entitled to receive all vested
benefits as of the date of such termination.

(b) Event of Termination Without Change of Control. Upon
----------------------------------------------
the occurrence of an Event of Termination other than after a Change of Control
(as hereinafter defined), the Bank shall pay to the Executive monthly, or in
the event of his subsequent death, to his designated beneficiary or
beneficiaries, or to his estate, as the case may be, as severance pay or
liquidated damages, or both, during the period below described a sum equal to
the highest monthly rate of salary paid to the Executive at any time under this
Agreement. Such payments shall commence on the last day of the month following
the date of said Event of Termination and shall continue until the date this
Agreement would have expired but for said occurrence, with such occurrence
being viewed as a determination by the Bank not to extend the Agreement as
provided for in paragraph 3.

(c) Event of Termination After Change of Control. If,
--------------------------------------------
after a "Change of Control" (as hereinafter defined) of UPC, BFC, or the Bank,
any of the parties hereto, or their successors or assigns, shall terminate the
employment of the Executive during the period of employment under this
Agreement for any reason other than "cause," as defined in paragraph 8(a),
retirement at or after the normal retirement age under any tax-qualified
retirement plan(s) maintained by UPC, termination pursuant to paragraph 9, or
otherwise change the present capacity or circumstances in which the Executive
is employed as set forth in paragraph 2 of this Agreement or cause a reduction
in the Executive's responsibilities or authority or compensation or other
benefits provided under this Agreement without the Executive's written consent,
then the Executive, or his beneficiaries, dependents and estate, as the case
may be, shall be entitled to the following:

(i) The Executive shall receive a sum equal to
the total amount of the present value of 2.99 times the average annual
compensation payable under this Agreement and includible by the Executive in
gross income for the most recent five taxable years ending before the date on
which the ownership or control of UPC, BFC, or the Bank changed. Such amount
shall be payable to the

-4-
<PAGE> 129
Executive in a lump sum within ten (10) days of the occurrence of an Event of
Termination under this paragraph 9(c).

(ii) During a period of thirty-six (36)
calendar months beginning with the Event of Termination, the Executive, his
dependents, beneficiaries and estate shall continue to be covered under all
employee benefit plans of the Bank, BFC, or UPC, including without limitation,
any UPC tax-qualified retirement plans, as if the Executive was still employed
during such period under this Agreement.

(iii) If and to the extent that benefits or 
service credit for benefits provided by paragraph 8(c)(ii) shall not be 
payable or provided under any such plans to the Executive, his dependents, 
beneficiaries and estate, by reason of his no longer being an employee of the 
Bank as a result of termination of employment, UPC shall itself pay or 
provide for payment of such benefits and service credit for benefits to the 
Executive, his dependents, beneficiaries and estate. Any such payment 
relating to retirement shall commence on a date selected by the Executive 
which must be a date on which payments under any UPC tax-qualified retirement 
plan may commence.

(iv) The Executive shall not be required to 
mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking 
other employment or otherwise nor shall any amounts received from other 
employment or otherwise by the Executive offset in any manner the obligations 
of the Bank hereunder.

(d) Change of Control. Paragraph 8(c) shall become 
----------------- 
operative upon the occurrence of a Change of Control of UPC, BFC, or the Bank.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Change of Control" means the sale of
substantially all of the assets of UPC, BFC, or the Bank, or the acquisition,
whether directly, indirectly, beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act")), or of record, of
securities of UPC, BFC, or the Bank representing twenty- five percent (25%) or
more in the aggregate voting power of UPC's, BFC's, or the Bank's
then-outstanding Common Stock by any "person" (within the meaning of Sections
13(d) and 14(d) of the Act), including any corporation or group of associated
persons acting in concert, other than (i) the UPC or its subsidiaries and/or
(ii) any tax-qualified employee stock ownership plan of UPC or of its
subsidiaries, including a trust established pursuant to any such plan;
provided, that a Change of Control will not result from (A) a transfer of
voting securities of UPC, BFC, or the Bank by a person who is the beneficial
owner, directly or indirectly, of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
voting securities of the UPC, BFC, or the Bank (a "25 Percent Owner") to (i) a
member of such 25 Percent Owner's lifetime or by will or the laws of descent
and distribution; (ii) any trust as to which the 25 Percent Owner

-5-

<PAGE> 130
or a member (or members) of his immediate family (within the meaning of Rule
16a-1(e) of the Act) is the beneficiary; (iii) any trust as to which the 25
Percent Owner is the settlor with sole power to revoke; (iv) any entity over
which such 25 Percent Owner has the power, directly or in directly, to direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies of the entity, whether
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; or (v)
any charitable trust, foundation or corporation under Section 501(c)(3) of the
Code which is funded by the 25 Percent Owner; or (B) the acquisition of voting
securities of UPC, BFC, or the Bank, by either (i) a person who was a 25
Percent Owner on the effective date of the Agreement or (ii) a person, trust or
other entity described in the foregoing clauses (A)(i)-(v) of this subsection;
or (C) the spin-off or other distribution by UPC to its shareholders of the
capital stock or assets of BFC or the Bank.

(e) Suspension and Special Regulatory Rules.
---------------------------------------
(i) If the Executive is suspended and/or temporarily
prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Bank's affairs by a notice
served under section 8(e)(3) or section (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act ("FDI Act"), the Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended
as of the date of service of such notice, unless stayed by appropriate
proceedings. If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the Bank shall (i)
pay the Executive all or part of the compensation withheld while its contract
obligations were suspended and (ii) reinstate in whole or in part any of its
obligations which were suspended.

(ii) If the Executive is removed and/or permanently
prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Bank's affairs by an order
issued under section 8(e)(4) or section (g)(1) of the FDI Act, all obligations
of the Bank under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of
the order; however, no vested rights of the Executive shall be affected by such
termination.

(iii) If the Bank is in default (as defined in
section 3(x)(1) of the FDI Act), all obligations under this Agreement shall
terminate as of the date of default; however, no vested rights of the Executive
shall be affected by such termination.

(iv) All obligations under this Agreement shall be
terminated, except to the extent that it may be determined that continuation of
this Agreement is necessary for the continued operation of the Bank, (1) by the
Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") or his or her designee at
the time the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") or the Resolution
Trust Corporation enters into an agreement to provide assistance to or on
behalf of the Bank under the authority contained in Section 13(c)

-6-
<PAGE> 131
of the FDI Act; or (2) the Director of OTS or his or her designee at any time
the Director of OTS or his or her designee approves a supervisory merger to
resolve problems related to the operation of the Bank or when the Bank is
determined by the OTS to be in an unsafe or unsound condition. No vested
rights of the Executive shall be affected by such action.

(f) Termination of Employment of, or by, the Executive.
--------------------------------------------------
The Board of Directors of the Bank may terminate the employment of the
Executive at any time; in the event of such termination, the provisions of this
paragraph 8 shall fully apply. The Executive may terminate his service under
this Agreement at any time upon three (3) months written notice to the Bank.
In the event of the Executive's voluntary termination of employment under this
paragraph 8(f), the provisions of this paragraph 8(a)-(e) shall not apply, and
the Executive shall be entitled to receive his salary, bonus, and other
employee benefits through his date of termination and such termination shall be

Vice President/Treasurer, he shall nevertheless continue to receive the
following percentages of his compensation under Paragraph 2 of this Amended
Agreement for the following periods of his disability: 100% for up to eighteen
(18) months, less any amount paid to the Executive under any other disability
program maintained by the Bank. Upon returning to active full-time employment,
the Executive's full compensation as set forth in this Agreement shall be
reinstated. In the event that said Executive returns to active employment on
other than a full-time basis, then his compensation (as set forth in Paragraph
2 of this Agreement) shall be reduced in proportion to the time spent in said
employment. However, if the Executive is again unable to perform the duties of
his position hereunder due to illness or other incapacity, he must have been
engaged in active full-time employment for at least twelve (12) consecutive
months immediately prior to such later absence or inability in order to qualify
for the full or partial continuance of his salary under this Paragraph 10. If
the Executive is disabled for a continuous period exceeding eighteen (18)
calendar months, the Bank may, at its election, terminate the Agreement.

10. Confidential Information. The Executive shall not, to the
------------------------
detriment of the Employers, knowingly disclose or reveal to any authorized
person any confidential information relating to the Bank, its subsidiaries or
affiliates, or to any of the businesses operated by them, and the Executive
confirms that such information constitutes the exclusive property of the
Employers. The Executive shall not otherwise knowingly act or conduct himself
(i) to the material detriment of the Employers, their subsidiaries, or

-7-
<PAGE> 132
affiliates, or (ii) in a manner which is inimical or contrary to the interests
thereof.

11. Federal Income Tax Withholding. The Bank may withhold from
------------------------------
any benefits payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or other
taxes as shall be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or
ruling.

12. Effect of Prior Agreements. This Agreement contains the
--------------------------
entire understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes any prior
employment agreement between the Bank or any predecessor of the Bank and the
Executive; provided, however, that the Executive's right to payment under
section 8(c) of that certain agreement between the Executive and the Bank dated
February 15, 1991 following the effective date of the merger of UPC and BFC is
hereby acknowledged by UPC and shall not be affected by any provision of this
Agreement.

13. Payment of Legal Expenses. The Bank shall pay all legal fees
-------------------------
and expenses which the Executive may incur (as such fees and expenses are
incurred) as a result of any action ultimately found in favor of the Executive
contesting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement and the Executive
shall be entitled to receive interest thereon for the period of any delay in
payment from the date such payment was due at the rate determined by adding two
hundred basis points to the six month Treasury Bill rate.

14. Consolidation, Merger, or Sale of Assets. Nothing in this
----------------------------------------
Agreement shall preclude UPC from consolidating or merging into or with, or
transferring all or substantially all of its assets or the assets of BFC or the
Bank to another corporation which assumes this Agreement and all obligations
and undertakings of the UPC, BFC, and the Bank hereunder.

15. General Provisions.
------------------
(a) Nonassignability. Neither this Agreement nor any
----------------
right or interest hereunder shall be assignable by the Executive, his
beneficiaries, or legal representatives without the Employers' prior written
consent; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph 15(a) shall preclude
(i) the Executive from designating a beneficiary to receive any benefits
payable hereunder upon his death, or (ii) the Executors, administrators, or
other legal representatives of the Executive or his estate from assigning any
rights hereunder to the person or persons entitled thereto.

(b) No Attachment. Except as required by law, no right
-------------
to receive payments under this Agreement shall be subject to anticipation,
commutation, alienation, sale, assignment, encumbrance, charge, pledge, or
hypothecation or to execution, attachment, levy, or similar process of
assignment by operation of

-8-
<PAGE> 133
law, and any attempt, voluntary or involuntary, to effect any such action shall
be null, void and of no effect.

(c) Binding Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding

upon, and inure to the benefit of, the Executive and the Bank and their
respective permitted successors and assigns.

----------------------
modified or amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties
hereto.

------
be deemed to have been waived, nor shall there be an estoppel against the
enforcement of any provision of this Agreement, except by written instrument of
the party charged with such waiver or estoppel. No such written waiver shall
be deemed a continuing waiver unless specifically stated therein, and each
waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or condition waived and shall

---------------------------------
THIS AGREEMENT entered into as of this day of , 1994,
---- ------------
by and between BANCFIRST CORPORATION ("BFC"); BANKFIRST, A FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK
("BFSB"); UNION PLANTERS CORPORATION ("UPC"); and C. RAYMOND DUNCAN (the
"Executive"). (All references to BFSB shall include BFC, unless otherwise
indicated.)

WHEREAS, effective as of the date of this Agreement, BFC, and its
subsidiaries, including BFSB, will be acquired by UPC pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization between UPC and BFC dated
, 1994 (the "Merger") and continue as subsidiaries of UPC; and
- ---------------

WHEREAS, the Executive has been employed in the capacity of Senior
Vice President/Treasurer of BFC and BFSB and is expected to continue to serve
in these capacities following the Merger; and

WHEREAS, the Executive's extensive knowledge and experience in the
savings and loan industry is such that BFC, BFSB, and UPC wish to seek
assurance of his continued service; and

WHEREAS, the Merger will result in the termination of the Plan and the
Executive's accrual of benefits thereunder will cease as of the date of such
termination; and

WHEREAS, BFC, BFSB, and UPC wish to establish this Agreement to
provide the Executive with certain benefits upon his retirement or other
termination of employment in recognition of the Executive's loss of retirement
income as a result of the premature termination of the Plan;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual
covenants and agreements hereinafter contained, and other good and valuable
consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree to this Agreement as follows:

SECTION I

DEFINITIONS

"Agreement" shall mean this agreement between the Executive, BFC, BFSB
and UPC.

"Early Termination Benefit" shall mean the sum of (i) the vested
accrued lump-sum benefit distributable to the Executive in the event of the
termination of the Plan at any time prior to the Executive's normal retirement
age (65) and (ii) the cumulative earnings attributable to the Executive's
investment of the amount determined under clause (i) (assuming the transfer of
such amount to an Individual Retirement Account and a six percent annual rate
of return) during the period beginning on the date of distribution of such
amount to the Executive following termination of the Plan and ending on the
date the Executive attains age 65.

"Employment Agreement" shall mean the Executive's employment agreement
dated , 1994, by and between, the Executive, UPC, BANCFIRST,
------------------
and BANKFIRST.

"Lump Sum Amount" shall mean a sum equal to the Executive's estimated
lump-sum benefit at normal retirement age under the Plan determined as of the
date of Plan termination. Such sum shall be calculated by assuming that the
Plan had not terminated prior to the Executive's normal retirement age under
the Plan (age 65) and using (i) the assumptions stated in the Plan regarding
the calculation of actuarially equivalent benefit forms and (ii) the salary
scale assumption used in connection with the preparation of the Plan actuarial
report prepared for the plan year beginning prior to the date of termination.

"Plan" shall mean the BANKFIRST Pension Plan and Trust.
<PAGE> 136
"Surviving Spouse" shall mean the Executive's spouse on the date of
his death, but shall not include a spouse from whom he is legally separated or
divorced at the time of his death.

"UPC Plan Benefits" shall mean the lump-sum amount distributable to
the Executive upon termination of employment with BFSB under all tax-qualified
retirement plans of UPC ("UPC Plans") in which the Executive is a participant
following the Merger.

SECTION II

BENEFITS
--------
(a) In the event of the termination of the Plan prior to the date the
Executive attains age 65, then (i) in the event of the Executive's termination
of employment with BFSB on or after the date the Executive attains age 65, BFSB
shall pay the Executive the following sum at the time specified in Section
2(c):

(1) The Executive's Lump Sum Amount less the sum of the
Executive's Early Termination Benefit and the
Executive's UPC Plan Benefits;

and

(2) an amount determined as follows:

$D times (R/(1-R)) = amount of payment

For purposes of this formula, "D" shall
equal the amount determined under Section
2(a)(1), and "R" shall equal the sum of
the highest marginal federal, state,
local, and withholding tax rates
applicable to the Executive during the
calendar year in which benefits are paid
to the Executive under this Agreement.

Any determination regarding the calculation of the Executive's Lump
Sum or Early Termination Benefits shall be made by the Plan's actuary (as
retained by BFSB or the Plan for the year in which such determination is made).
Such determination shall be binding upon the parties to this Agreement.

(b) In the event of the Executive's termination of employment with
BFSB prior to age 65, the amount determined under Section 2(a)(1) shall be
reduced by 6.7 percent for each full year that the Executive's age at
termination of employment is less than age 65 for the first five such years and
3.3% for each year thereafter.

(c) The amount determined under Section 2(a) shall be payable within
thirty (30) days after the date of the Executive's termination of employment
with BFSB. In the event of the Executive's death prior to the date any payment
is due under this Agreement, such amount shall be payable to the Executive's
Surviving Spouse or, if none, his estate.

SECTION III

SOURCE OF BENEFITS
------------------
All payments hereunder shall constitute an unfunded, unsecured promise
by BFSB to provide such payments in the future, as and to the extent such
benefits become payable. Benefits shall be paid from the general assets of
BFSB, and no person shall, by virtue of this Agreement, have any interest in
such assets (other than an unsecured creditor of BFSB). The obligation of BFSB
to make any payments or provide any benefits under this Agreement

-2-
<PAGE> 137
shall, in all events and without limitation, be guaranteed by UPC and its
successors and assigns and such guarantee shall inure to the benefit of the
Executive and his successors and assigns. In the event BFC or UPC elect in
their sole option to purchase life insurance on Executive payable to UPC to
assist UPC in funding its obligations hereunder, Executive agrees to cooperate
with UPC in obtaining life insurance payable to UPC to cover any or all of the
benefits to be provided hereunder.

SECTION IV

ASSIGNMENT
----------
Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, it is agreed that
neither the Executive nor his Surviving Spouse (if any) shall have any right to

are expressly declared to be nonassignable and nontransferable.

SECTION V

NO RETENTION OF SERVICES

in addition to, any other employment agreement that may exist from time to time
between the parties hereto, or any other compensation payable by BFSB to the
Executive, whether salary, bonus, retirement income under employee benefit
plans sponsored or maintained by UPC or BFSB, or otherwise, except for those
benefits received by Executive under the UPC Plan Benefits. This Agreement
shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment between the parties
hereto.

SECTION VI

--------------
BFSB and UPC further agree that neither party will cease its business
activities or terminate its existence without having made adequate provision
for the fulfillment of its obligation hereunder.

SECTION VII

by a writing signed by all the parties hereto.

SECTION VIII

GOVERNING LAW
-------------

unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be fully
effective.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors of BANCFIRST Corporation
Decatur, Alabama

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition
of BANCFIRST Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, BANKFIRST, a federal
savings bank, as of September 30, 1993 and 1992 and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years ended September 30, 1993. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of BANCFIRST Corporation and
subsidiary as of September 30, 1993 and 1992 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years ended September 30,
1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

BANCFIRST CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Holding Company Formation and Principles of Consolidation - On January 24,
---------------------------------------------------------
1991, stockholders of BANKFIRST approved the formation of a holding
company. On April 25, 1991, BANKFIRST became the wholly-owned subsidiary
of this holding company, BANCFIRST Corporation (formerly ALAFIRST
Bancshares, Inc.), a Delaware Corporation. Each outstanding share of
BANKFIRST's common stock was converted into one share of common stock of
BANCFIRST Corporation.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
BANCFIRST Corporation and BANKFIRST. BANKFIRST's accounts include its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Sunbelt Financial Services, Inc., which was
incorporated in July, 1981. Balances and activity reflected in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for the period prior to the
formation of BANCFIRST Corporation (through April 24, 1991 of fiscal year
1991) are those of BANKFIRST only. The operations of BANCFIRST Corporation
and BANKFIRST are collectively referred to herein as "the Bank." All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

See Note 17 for separate condensed financial information for BANCFIRST
Corporation only.

Basis of Financial Statements Presentation - The Bank's consolidated
------------------------------------------
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and with general practice within the savings
institutions industry. In preparing such financial statements, Management
is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and
revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to
significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan
losses and the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with
foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans. In connection with the
determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of real
estate owned, Management obtains independent appraisals for significant
properties.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents are cash on hand,
-------------------------
cash in banks and due from banks, and overnight deposits in the FHLB.

Investments and Mortgage-Backed Securities - Certain investments and
------------------------------------------
mortgage-backed securities that Management has both the ability and intent
to hold to maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, which are recognized as interest

- 9 -
<PAGE> 13
income using a method which approximates the interest method over the period
to maturity. Other investments and mortgage-backed securities that may be
held for indefinite periods of time, including securities that will be used
as a part of Management's asset/liability management strategy or those
securities that may be sold in response to changing interest rates,
prepayment risks, or similar economic factors, are classified as held for
sale. Such securities classified as "held for sale" are carried at lower of
cost or market. Sales of such securities are recognized based on the
specific identification method. Maturities of mortgage-backed securities
are determined by contract life.

During fiscal 1993, the Bank transferred a significant portion of its
investment and mortgage-backed securities to the held for sale category.
These transfers were the result of criteria set forth in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115 Accounting for Investments
--------------------------
in Certain Debt and Equity Securities issued in May 1993 (discussed later
-------------------------------------
in Note 1) and a change in the Bank's intent with regard to holding certain
securities because of the anticipated adoption of this statement.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale - The Bank classifies its current originations
----------------------------
of 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage loans as held for sale. These loans are
carried at lower of cost or market.

Allowance for Possible Loan Losses - The allowance for loan losses is
----------------------------------
increased by charges to income and decreased by charge- offs (net of
recoveries). Management's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowance is based on the Bank's past loan loss experience, known and
inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the
borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying
collateral, and current economic conditions.

Non-Accrual Loans - Loans are reviewed by Management on a regular basis and
-----------------
are placed on non-accrual status generally when contractually more than 90
days past due or when, in the opinion of Management, the collection of
additional interest is doubtful.

Real Estate Owned - Real estate owned acquired through, or in lieu of, loan
-----------------
foreclosure is initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure.
Costs relating to development and improvement are capitalized, whereas
costs relating to the holding of property are expensed. Valuations are
periodically performed by management, and an allowance for losses is
established by a charge to net income if the carrying value of a property
exceeds its net realizable value.

- 10 -
<PAGE> 14
Premises and Equipment - Office properties and equipment are carried at
----------------------
cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided by the
straight-line method at rates intended to distribute the cost of buildings
and equipment over their estimated service lives of five to forty years and
three to ten years, respectively.

Loan Origination Fees and Related Costs - Loan fees are accounted for in
---------------------------------------
accordance with SFAS No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs
-------------------------------------------
Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leases. Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred,
------
and the net fee or cost is recognized as an adjustment to interest income
using a method which approximates the interest method over the contractual
life of the loans, adjusted for estimated prepayments based on the Bank's
historical prepayment experience.

Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided on elements of income
------------
that are recognized for financial accounting purposes in periods different
than such items are recognized for income tax purposes. The principal
elements of deferred income taxes are provisions relating to different
accounting and tax treatment of accrued income and expenses (see Note 10).

In February 1992, SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, was issued.
---------------------------
The principal changes required by SFAS 109 are the adoption of the
liability method of accounting for deferred taxes and revision of the
criteria for recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets. The Bank
adopted this standard for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1992.
Because the effect on the consolidated financial statements was immaterial,
the cumulative effect of applying the new accounting method was reflected
as of October 1, 1992 as a charge to income tax expense of approximately
$32,000, and is included in the accompanying 1993 consolidated statement of
income.

Earnings Per Share - Earnings per share is based on the weighted average
------------------
number of shares plus equivalent shares outstanding. The dilutive effect
of shares issuable under stock options is immaterial.

Reclassifications - Reclassifications of certain prior period amounts were
-----------------
made for comparative purposes.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted - In May, 1993, SFAS No. 114,
---------------------------------------------
Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, was issued. SFAS No. 114
------------------------------------------------
provides guidance on recognition of impairment of a loan as well as methods
for measurement of impairment. The Bank will be required to adopt SFAS No.
114 for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1995. The impact of this
adoption on the Bank's consolidated financial statements is not presently
determinable.

- 11 -
<PAGE> 15
Also in May, 1993, SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
------------------------------------------
and Equity Securities, was issued. SFAS No. 115 requires management to
---------------------
classify its investment portfolio into three categories: (i)
held-to-maturity, (ii) available-for-sale and (iii) trading securities, and
sets forth specific criteria for making these classifications. Under SFAS
No. 115 unrealized holding gains and losses for trading securities are
included in earnings while unrealized holding gains and losses for
available-for-sale securities are reported as a separate component of
stockholders' equity, net of tax effects, until realized. Held-to-maturity
securities continue to be recorded at their amortized cost. Portfolio
additions beyond the date of adoption of this statement are to be
classified into the appropriate category when purchased. The Bank will be
required to adopt SFAS No. 115 for the fiscal year beginning October 1,
1994. Early adoption is permitted and Management is evaluating that
option. The impact of adoption is not presently determinable due to the
potential for changes in the market values of the affected securities.

The weighted average yield for all loans was 8.75% and 9.68% for the years
ended September 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Periodically, the Bank originates or purchases commercial and construction
loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans, which totaled $32,916,000
at September 30, 1993. These loans are of somewhat greater risk of
uncollectibility due to the dependency on income production or future
development of the real estate. Of these loans, $18,625,000 are
collateralized by single and multi-family residential property, $9,381,000
by offices and commercial buildings, $1,163,000 by land, and $3,747,000 in
commercial business loans.

Under the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of
1989 ("FIRREA"), a Federally-chartered savings bank's aggregate commercial
mortgage loans may not exceed 400% of its capital as determined under the
capital standards provisions of FIRREA. BANKFIRST is subject to this
limitation. Further, BANKFIRST is subject to regulations limiting its
maximum loans outstanding to one borrower. As of September 30, 1993, 
BANKFIRST is well within each of these limitations.

8. RETIREMENT PLAN

The Bank has a noncontributory defined-benefit retirement plan covering
substantially all of its employees. Benefits are generally based upon the
employee's highest average compensation for a consecutive three year
period during the last ten years preceding retirement. It is the Bank's
policy to make contributions to the Plan sufficient to meet minimum
funding requirements of applicable laws and regulations. Plan assets
consist of certificates of deposit and a savings deposit with BANKFIRST.

The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts
recognized in the Bank's consolidated statements of financial condition:

Retained income at September 30, 1993 and 1992 includes approximately
$4,900,000, and $6,200,000, respectively, representing bad debt deductions
for which no deferred taxes have been provided. These amounts represent
an allocation of income to bad- debt deductions for tax purposes only.
Reduction of amounts so allocated for purposes other than tax bad-debt
losses or adjustments arising from carryback of net operating losses would
create income for tax purposes only, which would be subject to the then
current corporate income tax rate. The unrecorded deferred income tax
liability on these amounts was approximately $1,800,000 and $2,275,000 at
September 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

15. INTEREST RATE RISK

The Bank is engaged principally in providing first mortgage loans to
individuals and commercial enterprises. At September 30, 1993, the Bank's
assets consist partly of assets that earned interest at fixed interest
rates. Those assets were funded primarily with short-term liabilities
that have interest rates that vary with market rates over time. The
shorter duration of the interest-sensitive liabilities indicates that the
Bank is exposed to interest rate risk because, in a rising rate
environment, liabilities will be repricing faster at higher interest
rates, thereby reducing the market value of long-term assets and net
interest income. Conversely,in a decreasing rate environment, the Bank's
asset value and net interest income will show improvement.

16. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of the Bank's financial instruments:

Cash and Cash Equivalents - For these short-term instruments, the carrying
amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Investment Securities and Mortgage-Backed Securities - Fair values of
these securities are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes.

Loans - The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future
cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to
borrowers for the same remaining maturities.

Deposits - The fair value of NOW accounts, money market deposits and
passbook savings is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date.
The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by
discounting future cash flows using the rates currently offered for
deposits of similar maturities.

Borrowed Funds - The fair value of borrowed funds is estimated by
discounting future cash flows using the rates currently available when
obtaining such funds.

The estimated fair values of the Bank's financial instruments at September
30, 1993 are as follows (In thousands):
