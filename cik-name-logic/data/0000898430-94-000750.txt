accordance with its normal procedures.

operation of a sinking fund or otherwise) at the option of the Holder or the
Company prior to its Stated Maturity.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security

have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security

(REVERSE OF SECURITY)

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the
Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more
series under an Indenture, dated as of March 1, 1994 (herein called the
"Indenture"), between the Company and The First National Bank of Chicago, as
Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee
under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto
reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations
of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the
Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and
are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series
designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to One
Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000).

The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the
entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and Events
of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with
certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.

This Global Security shall be exchangeable for Securities registered
in the names of Persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only if (i) the
Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
the Depositary or if at any time such Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency
registered under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, at a time
when such Depositary is required to be so registered in order to act as a
Depositary, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company
Order that the Global Security shall be so exchangeable or (iii) there shall
have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default, or an event which, with the
giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both, would constitute an Event of
Default, with respect to the Securities. To the extent that the Global Security
is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for
Securities registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.

Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Global Security may
not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of such
Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another
nominee of such Depositary.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall
occur and be continuing, the principal of the

-4-
<PAGE>

Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with
the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of 66 2/3% in principal amount of the Securities at the
time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains
provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount
of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the
Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company
with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the
Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of
this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration
of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not
notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the
Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding
with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or
for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given
the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the
Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount
of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written
request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of
Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee
shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with
such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60
days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The
foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security
for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or
interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this
Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein
prescribed.

-5-
<PAGE>

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registerable in the Security
Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the
office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest
on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security
Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like
tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount,
will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal
amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized
denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither
the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
