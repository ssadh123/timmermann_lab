Item 5. OTHER EVENTS

On January 28, 1994, the Board of Directors of Snap-on Tools
Corporation (the "Company") adopted amendments to the Rights Agreement,
dated October 23, 1987 (the "Agreement") and amended May 21, 1992, between
the Company and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as rights agent (the "Rights
Agent"). The terms of the amendments are set forth below. The Agreement
contains a description and terms of the Rights (the "Rights") of holders of
the Company's common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Common Stock"),
to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of Series A
Junior Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $125, subject to adjustment.

The following amendments have been adopted:

1. Amend the definition of "Acquiring Person" to read:

(a) "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person (as such term
is hereinafter defined) who or which, together with all
Affiliates (as hereinafter defined) and Associates (as
hereinafter defined) of such Person, shall be the Beneficial
Owner (as hereinafter defined) of 15% or more of the shares
of Common Stock then outstanding and shall include all
Affiliates and Associates of such Person, but shall not
include (i) the Company, (ii) any Subsidiary of the Company,
(iii) any employee benefit plan of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or any entity holding shares of
Common Stock organized, appointed or established by the
Company for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or
(iv) any such Person who has reported or is required to
report such ownership (but less than 25%) on Schedule 13G
under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor
report) or on Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or any
comparable or successor report) which Schedule 13D does not
state any intention to or reserve the right to control or
influence the management or policies of the Company or
engage in any of the actions specified in Item 4 of such
Schedule (other than the disposition of the Common Stock)
and, within 10 Business Days of being requested by the
Company to advise it regarding the same, certifies to the
Company that such Person acquired shares of Common Stock in
excess of 14.9% inadvertently or without knowledge of the
terms of the Rights and who, together with all Affiliates
and Associates, thereafter does not acquire additional
shares of Common Stock while the Beneficial Owner of 15% or
more of the shares of Common

Stock then outstanding; provided, however, that if the Person
requested to go certify fails to do so within 10 Business Days,
then such Person shall become an Acquiring Person immediately after
such 10 Business Day period.

2. Amend the definition of "Stock Acquisition Date" to read:

(r) "Stock Acquisition Date" shall mean the first date of
public announcement by the Company (or an Acquiring Person)
that an Acquiring Person has become such.

3. Amend Section 11(a) (ii), the "Flip In," to read:

(ii) any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or of
any Subsidiary of the Company, or any entity organized,
appointed or established pursuant to the terms of such plan)
shall become an Acquiring Person (except pursuant to an
offer for all outstanding shares of Common Stock at a price
and upon such terms and conditions as a majority of the
Continuing Directors determine to be in the best interest of
the Company and its stockholders, other than such Acquiring
Person), or

Item 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS.

Agreement, dated as of October 23, 1987, and amended as of May
