Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

Koger Equity, Inc. (the "Company") through itself and its wholly
owned subsidiary Southeast Properties Holding Corporation, Inc. ("Southeast")
has acquired substantially all of the assets of Koger Properties, Inc. ("KPI").

(a) Effective December 21, 1993, KPI was merged with and into the
Company, with the Company acquiring all of the assets of KPI except for the
latters interest in The Koger Partnership, Ltd. ("TKPL") which interest was
acquired by Southeast which has become the managing general partner of TKPL, a
publicly-held limited partnership. The Merger was the culmination of a plan of
reorganization (the "Plan") of KPI in its Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Case which was
jointly proposed by the Company and KPI and was approved by the shareholders of
the Company at their annual meeting of shareholders on August 11, 1993. In
exchange for the assets of KPI, the Merger provided for the issuance of shares
of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share, (the "Shares") to
certain creditors of KPI and the issuance of warrants to purchase Shares (the
"Warrants") to shareholders of KPI and holders of certain securities law claims
against KPI and the settlement of the Company's claim (approximately
$116,000,000) against KPI. Pursuant to the Merger 6,158,977 Shares, or
approximately 35% of the Shares outstanding after the Merger were issued to
certain unsecured creditors of KPI and the KPI common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger was converted into the right to receive one
Warrant for every 50 Shares of KPI common stock. Holders of certain securities
law claims against KPI also received Warrants. Each Warrant gave the holder
the right to purchase one Share at a price of $8.00 per Share, such rights are
exercisable until June 30, 1999. The Warrants are subject to redemption at the
option of the Company at prices ranging between $1.84 to $5.24 per Warrant.
Warrants to purchase approximately 644,000 Shares (3.5% of the currently
outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis) were issued in connection with the
Merger. For further information concerning the Merger, reference is made to
the Company's Proxy Statement dated June 30, 1993, which solicited the approval
of the Merger by the Shareholders of the Company at their annual meeting held
on August 11, 1993 (Securities Exchange Act File No. 1-9997).

(b) With the Merger the Company succeeded to substantially all of
the assets of KPI, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, except
encumbrances relating to certain secured indebtedness of KPI (aggregating
approximately $177 million) which was restructured pursuant to the Plan. KPI's
assets acquired by the Company in the Merger included 93 buildings containing
approximately 3,848,130 net rentable square feet together with approximately
296 acres of unimproved land suitable for development, all of which buildings
are located in 20 Koger Centers in 16 metropolitan areas and 1,781,419 Shares
(13.5% of the shares outstanding prior to the Merger). As a result of the
Merger, the Company assumed all of the leasing and other management
responsibilities of its properties including those acquired in the Merger. In
addition, immediately prior to the Merger KPI transferred all of its debt and

2
<PAGE> 3
equity interests in TKPL to the Company's newly formed subsidiary, Southeast,
which became the managing general partner of TKPL. The assets acquired in the
Merger consist of buildings which are primarily located in Koger Office Centers
wherein the Company already owned buildings. The Company intends to hold these
buildings for rent as office space and manage them in the same manner as the
buildings which it currently owns. The Company through its subsidiary,
Southeast, intends to continue the management of the properties owned by TKPL.
Also in connection with the Merger, the Company will succeed to the management
of 24 buildings owned by third parties which buildings were heretofore managed
by KPI.

With the Merger the Company now owns 219 office buildings containing
approximately 7.9 million net rentable square feet in 21 office centers located
in 16 suburban metropolitan areas. For further information in regard to the
description of the properties acquired by the Company in the Merger, reference
is made to the Company's Proxy Statement dated June 30, 1993, which was used in
connection with soliciting shareholder approval of the Merger at their annual
meeting held on August 11, 1993, which Proxy Statement was filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. (Securities Exchange Act File No. 1-9997).
