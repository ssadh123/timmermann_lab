Re: Purchase of Assets

Dear Mark:

This letter incorporates by reference that certain discussion
document entitled "Notes of Conversation for Proposed Homeland and
Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc. Transaction" (a copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference)
(referred to herein as the "Outline") and further sets forth the
general structure of a proposed purchase agreement ("Purchase
Agreement") between Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc. ("AWG"), as
buyer, and Homeland Stores, Inc. ("Homeland"), as seller. This
letter represents only our current good-faith intention to
negotiate and enter into the definitive Purchase Agreement and to
consummate the transaction contemplated in the Outline, subject to
complete due diligence.

The Purchase Agreement will address the following provisions, due
diligence, and conditions precedent and other terms and conditions
as follows: 

1. The parties hereto shall enter into the Purchase Agreement
which will enumerate and identify with specificity (a) ongoing
transactions and relationships among the parties, (b) transactions
and relationships involving third parties and (c) the assets
("Assets") to be purchased and otherwise be dealt with thereunder. 
All are generally contemplated in the Outline.

2. The Purchase Agreement will: (a) have schedules attached
detailing all of the Assets to be owned by Homeland as of the date
of the closing hereof ("Closing"); (b) contain the normal and usual
warranties relating to organization, affiliate or subsidiary
status, authorization, execution and delivery, audited financial
statements, absence of conflicts and litigation, compliance with
laws, payment of taxes, insurable and marketable title, absence of
material changes, existence and status of contracts, maintenance of
insurance coverage, broker's fees, breaches of representations and
warranties, and breaches of the Purchase Agreement; (c) contain a
provision whereby Homeland will not compete with AWG relating to
wholesale operations; (d) contain the normal and usual covenants
pertaining to investigative rights regarding the Assets,
acquisition review, required corporate action, assignments and
transfers, compliance with laws, maintenance of insurance, conduct
of business in the ordinary course and no changes in business or
financial structure, in each case, to the extent it adversely
affects the Assets or Supply Agreement (as described in the
Outline); (e) contain mutually agreeable provisions regarding
discharge by Homeland of liabilities encumbering the Assets prior
to or at the Closing; (f) contain mutually acceptable provisions
concerning any contingent or unidentifiable liabilities; (g)
contain mutually agreeable provisions concerning any union
contracts and other agreements pertaining to employees and/or
managers employed in connection with any Asset (except as described
in the Outline, AWG contemplates that it shall have no liability
under any of the foregoing unless specifically assumed by AWG at
Closing) and (h) not be signed without approval by both of AWG's
and Homeland's Board of Directors. AWG's obligation to consummate
the transaction shall not be conditioned upon or subject to the
purchase of any of the Assets by any third party. Homeland
understands that AWG intends to transfer certain of the Assets to
its retail members and that a contemporaneous closing of all of
these related transactions is imperative to AWG to insure
continuity of operations and Homeland agrees to use its best
efforts to coordinate the timing of the Closing and other Closing
mechanics with AWG so as to permit the transfer of such Assets to
its retail members. In addition, the Purchase Agreement will
contain further appropriate terms and conditions as any party may
determine necessary and are acceptable to the other parties. 
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as a comprehensive
description of the provisions in the Purchase Agreement, nor a
limitation upon AWG or Homeland in respect to the Purchase
Agreement.

3. The following must be completed prior to the execution of the
Purchase Agreement:

a) Except as provided in paragraph 4.(k), AWG conducting a
physical inspection of all Assets to be purchased and performing
all tests and acts deemed necessary by AWG, including without
limitation, mechanical inspections, engineering and soil borings,
such activities to be conducted at AWG's expense. The foregoing is
in addition to (and not in lieu of) a physical inventory of all
FFE, as defined in the Outline. To the extent such inspections are
not completed prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement or
reveal unsatisfactory conditions, the Purchase Agreement will
contain appropriate provisions relating to the foregoing, which are
mutually acceptable to the parties. 
b) AWG's review of complete, true and correct copies of all
leases and AWG's conclusion that such leases do not contain
commercially unreasonable terms, in AWG's sole discretion.

c) Receipt by AWG of Homeland's proforma opening balance sheet
and profit and loss statement showing projections of Homeland's
operation after Closing.

d) AWG's review of complete, true and correct copies of all
contracts referred to in paragraph 7 of the Outline.

e) Mutually acceptable Supply Agreement.

The foregoing shall not preclude AWG from making provisions in
the Purchase Agreement for factual matters relating to any of the
foregoing which are not disclosed to AWG until after the execution
of the Purchase Agreement.

4. The Purchase Agreement shall also provide that the
obligations of AWG thereunder are expressly subject to the
following, without limitation, conditions precedent to Closing:

a) The Assets shall be owned by Homeland at Closing.

b) Satisfactory evidence of insurability, marketability and
transferability of title of all leasehold interests and real
property.

c) Satisfactory evidence of marketability and transferability of
title of all Assets including an acceptable UCC search on all
leased premises, furniture, fixtures, equipment, inventory and
supplies.

d) The existence of no material misrepresentations,
misstatements or adverse changes relating to the Assets or any
other material matter.

e) Payment by the appropriate party of any transfer taxes and/or
charges incurred in connection with the transfer of Assets to AWG.

f) If applicable, compliance with Bulk Sales Law or such other
arrangement mutually agreed to by the parties.

g) Receipt by AWG of all audited financial statements of
Homeland Holding Corporation available from time to time, along
with all consolidating detailed financial statements.

h) Except as provided otherwise, transfer of the Assets free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances.

i) If required, the consent and/or nondisturbance and attornment
agreement of the landlord/lessor of any leasehold interest in
connection with the assignment of any leasehold interests. 
Homeland will not be required to give economic incentives in
connection with obtaining the foregoing.

j) AWG's receipt of an estoppel certificate acceptable to AWG
from all landlords and/or lessors on any lease being assumed by
AWG, except where the failure to obtain any such certificate or
certificates would not have a material adverse effect on the Assets
in connection with the 29 Stores and Warehouse Complex taken as a
whole. AWG's receipt of an estoppel certificate acceptable to AWG
from all third parties to any material contract being assumed by
AWG, except where the failure to obtain any such certificate or
certificates would not have a material adverse effect on the Assets
taken as a whole. In the event an estoppel certificate reveals a
non-material but significant economic discrepancy (as defined in
the Purchase Agreement) previously unknown to the parties, the
parties will equitably resolve such discrepancy prior to or at
Closing. Homeland will not be required to give economic incentives
in connection with obtaining the foregoing.

k) AWG conducting prior to Closing surveys and environmental
audits. Such activities to be conducted at AWG's expense.

l) AWG conducting in concert with Homeland prior to Closing a
detailed physical inventory of all inventories and FFE described in
the Outline.

m) Satisfaction of AWG's credit requirements as set forth in
Paragraph 9d of the Outline.

n) Satisfactory evidence of compliance by Homeland with all
requirements of Homeland's lender/debt/lien/security documents to
the extent necessary so that the transactions contemplated do not
constitute a default under such documents.

o) Performance by Homeland of all obligations required by the
Purchase Agreement.

p) Receipt by AWG of a satisfactory fair market value
opinion/appraisal, and an auditor's review report from appropriate
experts. HL will engage experts reasonably acceptable to AWG;
provided, however, such activities will be at AWG's expense. Such
appraisal or report shall be reasonably satisfactory to AWG in all
material respects.

q) Receipt by AWG of a report regarding the solvency of Homeland
(whether solvent or not) from an appropriate expert. HL will
engage experts reasonably acceptable to AWG; provided however, such
activities will be at AWG's expense. For purposes hereof, The
Manufactures' Appraisal Company ("MAC") will be an independent
expert acceptable to AWG.

5. The Purchase Agreement shall also provide that the
obligations of Homeland and AWG thereunder are expressly subject to
the following, without limitation, conditions precedent to Closing:

a) All requirements, which in the reasonable opinion of legal
counsel, need to be satisfied relating to the Anti-Trust
Improvements Act of 1976, Department of Justice, Federal Trade
Commission, Securities Exchange Commission and any other approval
by any applicable regulatory authority required or requested to
rule on this transaction.

b) Receipt of satisfactory opinions from the other party's legal
counsel.

c) Compliance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act and all related laws, regulations or ordinances in
respect to plant closings.

d) Compliance with laws relating to transfer of any inventory

e) Mutual acceptable allocations of the purchase price to the
components of the Assets. The form of the allocation certificate

time pursuant to the formula set forth in paragraph 9 of the
Outline is consideration solely for the Supply Agreement.

6. The Purchase Agreement shall also provide that the
obligations of Homeland are expressly subject to the following,
without limitation, conditions precedent to the closing:

those of lessors, landlords, lenders and security holders.

b) The existence of no material misrepresentations,
misstatements or adverse changes relating to AWG.

c) Performance by AWG of all obligations required by the
Purchase Agreement.

7. After the full execution of this letter of intent, AWG is to
begin due diligence in earnest and shall be permitted to make a
full and complete investigation of the Assets to be purchased, the
leases and contracts to be assumed and all other documents which
control the transactions or relationships addressed by the Outline. 
In addition, as soon as reasonably possible following the execution
of this letter of intent by AWG and Homeland, Homeland will provide
to AWG the documents described on Exhibit B attached hereto and
incorporated herein. Upon execution of this letter of intent by
both parties, AWG agrees to immediately commence and diligently
pursue (i) the review of the documents on Exhibit B upon receipt by
AWG thereof, and (ii) all investigations, inspections and due
diligence contemplated hereunder and to use its reasonable efforts
to complete all such due diligence as soon as practicable prior to
the signing of the Purchase Agreement. AWG will use its best
efforts to reduce the number and scope of conditions precedent to
its obligations to close the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Purchase Agreement shall also provide that upon reasonable request
prior to the Closing Date, AWG and its representatives shall have,
at all reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, access to any
other records of Homeland pertaining to the Assets and the premises
relating to any of the leases described herein and such other
information or access as AWG shall, from time to time, reasonably
request. 

8. In consideration of the substantial expenditures of time,
effort and expense to be undertaken by AWG in connection with the
preparation and execution of the Purchase Agreement, and the
various investigations and review referred to above, Homeland
undertakes and agrees that during the period from execution of this
letter of intent through December 1, 1994 (or shorter period if AWG
or Homeland terminates its good faith intent to proceed with the
transaction) Homeland shall not actively solicit any other
prospective purchaser of the Assets which are the subject of this
letter agreement, other than dispositions of Assets in the ordinary
course of business.

9. Other than any commission owed to Lazard Freres & Co. which
will be paid by Homeland, AWG and Homeland warrant each to the
other that there are no claims for brokerage commissions or
finders' fees in connection with this transaction.

10. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this letter
agreement are consummated, except as otherwise expressly stated
herein, AWG and Homeland will bear their own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with such transactions. Transfer taxes
and/or charges incurred in connection with the transfer of the
Assets to AWG will be split by the parties, unless otherwise
required by applicable law.

11. Except as required by law and except for a press release
which has been agreed to by Homeland and AWG and which will be
issued upon execution of this letter of intent, no public
announcement regarding the execution of this letter of intent or
the transaction contemplated hereby shall be made without the
mutual consent of AWG and Homeland. In that regard, the partes
agree that neither party will make statements for the other party. 
The parties will carefully coordinate all communication with any
third party. The foregoing shall not prohibit or restrict Homeland
from discussing the transaction with its lenders or security
holders. AWG shall not communicate with any Homeland employee or
employee representative without the prior verbal consent of a
designated representative of Homeland and Homeland may condition
its consent upon its participation in any such communication.

12. (a) The Confidentiality Agreement heretofore executed by
the parties on or about April 12, 1994 shall remain in full force
and effect. In addition, it is hereby agreed that operational
information supplied by any party shall be included as either
"Homeland Confidential Information" or "AWG Confidential
Information" as the case may be. To the extent that any party
believes that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement need to be
further expanded (or further defined) to protect their interests in
proprietary information, all other parties shall agree to such
modifications as are commercially reasonable under the
circumstances.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Homeland acknowledges
and agrees that AWG does not operate retail grocery stores. 
Consequently, it is recognized that all of the Assets and
obligations contemplated by the Outline which pertain to the
operation of retail locations will be sold to and/or assumed by
current or future AWG retail members contemporaneously with the
Closing of the Purchase Agreement. Toward that end, AWG has
already (with the permission of Homeland) provided certain
information to its retail members and third parties interested in
retail grocery stores to be purchased by AWG. In addition, with
Homeland's prior written approval which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, AWG may forward to its shareholders and such third
parties additional information with respect to the Assets,
including the location and size of stores. If an approved AWG
shareholder or third party requests additional information on one
or more stores, such information may be provided to said
shareholder by AWG with Homeland's prior written approval which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. AWG shall obtain or have
obtained an executed confidentiality agreement by said shareholder
or third parties receiving such information containing
substantially the same terms and provisions as this paragraph and
the Confidentiality Agreement.

AWG considers that time is of the essence in consummating the
proposed transaction. Accordingly, we have instructed our counsel
to work with your counsel after the execution of this letter of
intent to prepare the Purchase Agreement which will contain
provisions in accordance with the foregoing, together with such
further appropriate terms and conditions as counsel may mutually
determine, in addition to such ancillary documents as may be
necessary to implement the foregoing. The Purchase Agreement and
such additional documents shall be subject, in all respects, to the
approval of all parties thereto. It is, of course, understood (i)
that this letter is intended to be, and shall be construed only as,
a letter of intent, summarizing and evidencing AWG's proposal and
not as an offer to purchase the above-described Assets or an
agreement with respect thereto; (ii) that the respective rights and
obligations of AWG and Homeland remain to be defined in the
definitive Purchase Agreement, into which this letter of intent and
all prior discussions shall merge; and (iii) in the event the
definitive Purchase Agreement is not fully executed within thirty
(30) days after execution by the last party to sign this letter of
intent for any reason whatsoever, then neither AWG nor Homeland
shall have any rights or obligations hereunder; provided, however,
that the obligation of Homeland and AWG under paragraphs 7, 8, 11
and 12 shall be binding upon Homeland and AWG when this letter of
intent is executed and delivered by you. If the parties do not
execute a Purchase Agreement within thirty (30) days after
execution by the last party to sign this letter of intent, then the
provisions of paragraphs 7 and 8, shall no longer be binding upon
Homeland or AWG.
<PAGE>
The intentions expressed in this letter shall be null and void
unless Homeland accepts and executes this letter and AWG receives
the executed letter on or before December 1, 1994. If the
foregoing meets with the approval of Homeland, please sign and
return the enclosed duplicate copy of this letter at your earliest
convenience.

Very truly yours,

NOTES OF CONVERSATION
FOR PROPOSED
HOMELAND STORES, INC. ("HL") AND
ASSOCIATED WHOLESALE GROCERS, INC. ("AWG")
TRANSACTION

1. AWG agrees to purchase certain assets of HL.
AWG to purchase 29 of the 111 stores (See list on Ex A).
AWG to supply 67 of the remaining stores and the Edmond Store.

2. The Assets included in the Purchase Price are as follows:

a. The 29 Stores listed on Exhibit A, includes:

(i) Leases ("Store Leases");

(ii) Real estate owned (6 properties);

(iii) Furniture, fixtures, equipment and supplies which do
not bear the HL name or logo ("FFE");

(iv) Inventory in the stores (other than Edmond);

(1) Edmond, OK (Store 777) - AWG agrees to grant HL the
option to sublease back this store (and FFE) after
Closing, subject to all of the terms and conditions
contained in the existing lease and the consent of
the landlord thereunder, if required, at the lease
rates specified in the lease from time to time for
a term from Closing to June 1, 1995 and thereafter
on a month-to-month basis (at HL's election) but in
no event later than January 1, 1996. FFE will be
leased at $110,826 per annum. Upon the termination
of such sublease, AWG will pay HL for the Edmond
inventory at a price to be calculated pursuant to
the formula described in Section 6 below.

b. The warehouse complexes and associated offices, (including
all leases ("Warehouse Leases") and real estate owned
relating thereto), including:

(i) Grocery Warehouse Lease;

(ii) Produce Warehouse Lease;

(iii) Annex Lease;

EXHIBIT A
TO LETTER OF INTENT
(iv) Repack/Variety Lease;

(v) HL's Corporate Office Lease.

(vi) Dairy and Ice Cream property and improvements held
in fee;

(vii) FFE relating to the foregoing, other than FFE
relating to HL's corporate headquarters' ongoing
operations; however, prior to finalizing the
definitive agreement, as to FFE relating to HL's
corporate headquarters' ongoing operations, the
parties will analyze certain shared items involved
and mutually agree on such items' inclusion or
exclusion with the intent that HL will be able to
retain or have access to all FFE necessary to
continue its business operations; and

(viii) Inventory in the warehouse(s);

3. AWG will pay to HL a Purchase Price of $45 million for the
above Assets, other than inventory.

4. Inventory at the warehouses.

a) AWG will purchase all good saleable inventory.

b) The purchase price for the inventory (other than perishable
inventory) will be calculated at HL's last System Cost, as
further described in paragraph 4(d) below (acquisition
cost), less certain off-invoice allowances and excluding
cash discounts.

c) Perishable inventory will be calculated at dead net cost,
i.e., HL's book cost.

d) HL will maintain costing until closing which is consistent
with HL's past practice as set forth in HL's Listing of
Warehouse Inventory dated September 20, 1994 heretofore
provided to AWG ("System Cost").

5. Open Purchase Orders

AWG will assume HL's obligations under purchase orders for
warehouse inventory which are open at the time of closing.

6. Inventory in the 29 stores

a) AWG will purchase all good saleable inventory.

b) The inventory will be identified by HL's categories. The
purchase price for such inventory will be an amount equal
to the calculation below:

Cost of inventory at Retail X Inventory Factor.

For purposes herein, the Inventory Factor is calculated as
follows:

(HL's Going-In Gross) + (W/T Expense/Realized Sales) =
Inventory Factor.

For purposes herein, HL's Going-In Gross is defined as the
calculation described as "Percent Spread" on Exhibit B attached
hereto. Warehouse Expenses, Transportation Expense and
Realized Sales will be defined as set forth on Exhibit B. The
W/T Expense is defined as the Warehouse Expenses, plus the
Transportation expense.

When calculating the Going-In Gross, the parties will use the
average of the Going-In Gross from January 1, 1995 through
Closing.

c) The inventory relating to Pharmacy, which AWG is legally
permitted to purchase, will be calculated at HL's
acquisition cost. Any Pharmacy product with less than a
three-month shelf life will either be returned to the
supplier by HL; or if return is restricted, the purchase
price for such inventory will be HL's acquisition cost
times 50%. HL will also have the option to transfer such
product with less than a three-month shelf life to another
HL store.

7. Existing Contracts. (Subject to AWG review, AWG approval and
required third party consents.)

a) HL will provide AWG with a complete list of all existing
supply, service and equipment and other contracts
(excluding union contracts), as well as copies thereof to
the extent requested by AWG. With respect to any
equipment, service, supply or other contract, the parties
shall enter into an undertaking whereby the burdens and
benefits of such agreements are equitably apportioned
between the parties. [AWG will not be responsible for or
enter into undertakings in connection with any contracts
relating to the 29 Stores (as described below) or HL's
distribution center to which HL enters after the execution
of the letter of intent, unless mutually agreed to
otherwise by the parties.]

b) For purposes hereof, it is agreed that contracts which
affect all stores ("ASC") shall be subject to the following
apportionments:

(i) Except as set forth below, AWG will undertake to be
responsible for 25% of the obligations set forth in
each ASC, as such undertaking relates to the 29
stores listed on Exhibit A to the Outline ("29
Stores").

(ii) With respect to obligations, if any, to repay, buy
back or otherwise compensate ("Repayment") the other
party to an ASC due to a default (the parties will
mutually agree upon what constitutes an appropriate
level of default):

A. If AWG's actions or omissions (or the actions or
omissions of any AWG member or purchaser of any of
the 29 Stores) trigger a Repayment, AWG shall be
responsible for all of such Repayment.

B. If the Repayment is triggered by any event not
covered by subparagraphs A or C, AWG shall be
responsible for 25% of the Repayment and HL shall be
responsible for the remainder.

C. If the Repayment is triggered by HL in connection
with the 82 remaining stores and such trigger is not
related to the 29 Stores sold to AWG, HL shall be
responsible for all of such Repayment.

(iii) With respect to obligations to deal exclusively,
obligations to meet certain performance levels and
promotional obligations under an ASC, AWG will cause
its retail members or any purchasers which operate
the 29 Stores to carry the required products and/or
to otherwise comply with the required performance
levels and promotional obligations and AWG will be
responsible for any breach.

(iv) Any benefits, monetary or otherwise, relating to the
ASC contracts received by HL on an ongoing basis
after Closing will be prorated in a manner
consistent with the allocation of obligations as set
forth above.

c) With respect to any contracts exclusively relating to the
warehouse (other than collective bargaining agreements),
AWG will assume all such contracts.

d) With respect to any contracts which exclusively relate to
one or more of the 29 Stores or which any such Store is a
party, AWG will cause the applicable retail member or
purchaser of such Store(s) to assume such contract or enter
into an agreement whereby such retailer agrees to be
responsible for such liability and AWG will be responsible
for any damages or liabilities resulting from any breach,
non-performance or non-assumption.

e) With respect to the Corrugated Service contract, AWG will
assume the contract.

f) The K-C Computer Services, Inc. ("K-CCS") contract will be
handled in the following manner:

(i) HL shall analyze its ongoing needs to operate the
segment of its business which is not being sold to
AWG at this time. HL shall advise AWG of its
requirements for services under the K-CCS contract.

(ii) AWG will undertake to satisfy and will be
responsible for all obligations (including any
payments) under the K-CCS contract which are above
and beyond HL's ongoing requirements.

g) The Drake Refrigerated Lines, Inc. ("Drake") contract
relating to HL's fleet will be assumed by AWG.

h) Both parties will cooperate to avoid and/or minimize
Teamster pension withdrawal liability ("TPWL"). If any
TPWL is triggered by any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or otherwise subsequent to the Closing, AWG will
reimburse HL for such TPWL up to $3,471,000. If HL and AWG
agree to alternative arrangements for the avoidance of
TPWL, AWG will reimburse HL the costs associated with such
alternative arrangements, if any, up to $3,471,000.

8. Office Sharing.

a) During a transition period while HL is relocating its
headquarters and office space to service their remaining
stores, AWG will lease space to HL (at zero rental cost) in
the current HL Corporate Offices, which will be
reconfigured to accommodate AWG's and HL's respective
needs.

b) The transition period will be the nine-month period after
the Closing date.

9. HL will enter into a Supply Agreement with AWG and AWG will be
HL's primary supplier. Subject to the provisions of paragraph
7 above and subparagraph 9(f) below, HL will agree to buy the
products offered for sale in HL stores from AWG, which are
available from AWG's warehouse from time to time, and AWG
agrees to sell to HL products available from AWG's warehouse
at the lowest prices and best terms available to other AWG
retailer/members. HL shall have available to it all cost
saving mechanisms available to other AWG members, including
AWG's Concentrated Purchase Allowance Program ("CPA"). The
schedule relating to AWG's current CPA program is attached as
Exhibit "C".

a. As consideration for the Supply Agreement, AWG will pay to
HL an amount calculated as follows each AWG fiscal quarter
for a period of seven (7) years: 

Quarterly Payment = Target Payment X Operative Fraction.

(i) For purposes of the foregoing calculation, the
Target Payment amounts shall be as set forth on the
quarterly payment schedule ("QPS"), attached hereto
as Exhibit "D" and the Operative Fraction shall be
a function of the Purchase Percentage as set forth
below. The Purchase Percentage shall be determined
from a fraction the numerator of which is the actual
purchases through AWG's warehouse by HL during the
quarter in question and the denominator of which is
$72,500,000 [$290,000,000/4]. The Operative
Fraction to be utilized is reflected in the
following table:

If the Purchase The Operative
Percentage is: Fraction shall be:

100 - 90.01% 100%
90 - 80.01% 90%
80 - 70.01% 80%
70 - 60.01% 70%
60 - 50.01% 60%
50 - 40.01% 50%
40 - 30.01% 40%
30% or below 0%

(ii) For reference purposes, the QPS sets forth the
dollar amounts of the Quarterly Payments associated
with the foregoing; provided, however, the Quarterly
Payments made for the first three quarters of any
fiscal year during the term of the Supply Agreement
shall be subject to a year-end adjustment such that
the Purchase Percentage and the Operative Fraction
shall be calculated as to HL's cumulative purchases
at fiscal year-end.

(iii) In the event that HL sells any of its remaining
stores to one or more current or future AWG retail
members, the purchases by such AWG retail member
shall be credited to HL's benefit for purposes of
the Operative Fraction and Purchase Percentage;
provided, however, that the amount of such credit
shall be equal to the purchases of each such sold
store for the prior four fiscal quarters as an HL
store.

b. Failures to perform by either party under the terms of the
Supply Agreement will be addressed in the definitive
agreement.

(i) Force Majeure will be addressed in the Supply
Agreement, and such provision will address, among
other things, if AWG does not or cannot supply HL
due to force majeure-type events or the levels for
out of stock products exceeds 10% in the aggregate
subsequent to notice by HL and a reasonable time
period thereafter, (all of which will be defined in
the Supply Agreement), HL will be able to seek
alternative suppliers until such condition is cured
by AWG and such purchases shall be treated as
purchases through AWG's warehouse for purposes of
computing the Operative Fraction and Purchase
Percentage. 

c. AWG will agree to supply HL with certain items, including,
without limitation, cross docked merchandise, requested by
HL on terms and conditions acceptable to both parties;
provided, however, such items must meet reasonable minimum
volume requirements.

d. HL will provide the hard collateral required of AWG Members
to secure the Open Account for HL to receive credit terms
from AWG. [AWG has provided to HL credit options and
associated collateral requirements from which HL may
choose.] HL understands that such collateral is a
condition precedent to AWG's consummation of this
transaction. Any HL patronage with AWG will be acceptable
hard collateral toward meeting the foregoing collateral
requirements. HL is to provide a proforma opening balance
sheet and profit and loss statement showing projections of
HL's operation after the Closing. 

e. HL's obligation to purchase goods from AWG under the Supply
Agreement and AWG's obligation to make required quarterly
payments will be for 7 years.

f. While it is the intent of the parties for AWG to be HL's
primary supplier of products, Homeland will be permitted to
purchase products from other suppliers from time to time
and products commonly categorized as "DSD" items, such as
soft drinks, milk and bread.
g. For purposes of the Supply Agreement, purchases by HL
through AWG's warehouse will include purchases that are
billed or sold through AWG warehouses in connection with
products which are carried in AWG's warehouses. For
purposes herein, the word "carried" includes products upon
which AWG is able to realize a gross margin in contrast to
products which may be handled on its docks for a handling
fee on a cost recovery basis. The Supply Agreement will
detail various types of transactions, such as SOLOS and
continuities, which qualify as "billed or sold". 
(Notwithstanding the foregoing, qualifying purchases for
purposes of calculating year-end patronage shall be
calculated pursuant to AWG's policy then in effect during
the terms of the Supply Agreement.)

h. The Supply Agreement will include all HL stores now owned
or hereafter acquired or opened (excluding 29 Stores sold
to AWG).

i. HL will be given credit for unsalable products and pricing
adjustments on best terms available to other AWG members or
retailers, where applicable.

j. AWG will pass-through promotional and advertising
allowances and rebates from manufacturers and vendors to HL
on the same basis as any other AWG member and as
appropriate for HL's level of purchases.

k. HL will receive seasonal, special promotions and
advertising programs on the best terms available to other
AWG members and as appropriate for HL's level of purchases.

l. The quality relating to goods will be consistent with other
wholesalers within market area.

m. The activities of AWG will meet all applicable legal and
regulatory requirements.

n. AWG will provide to HL a service level commensurate with
all other members.

(i) AWG will make timely deliveries.

o. AWG will make available to HL all information and reports
which are available to other members at a cost, if any,
equal to that charged to other members (Note: any such
charge is based on a cost recovery for AWG.)

p. HL to provide copies to AWG of all SEC filings and reports.

q. The term of the Supply Agreement will be 7 years.

r. The Supply Agreement will address the rights of either
party upon material breach of agreement.

s. The specific events of defaults will be addressed in the
Supply Agreement.

t. Remedies will be addressed in detail in the Supply
Agreement and will address those matters described in
paragraphs 9(v) and 9(w) below.

u. AWG will provide HL evidence of products liability and
comprehensive liability insurance.

v. The Supply Agreement will provide that there will be no
cross-defaults between the Supply Agreement and the
Purchase Agreement.

w. During the first two (2) years of the term of the Supply
Agreement in the event there is a material breach of the
right of first offer or non-compete provisions of the
Supply Agreement by HL (or permitted successors), then
AWG's obligations with respect to the Drake and K-CCS
contracts will cease and HL will be liable for such
obligations. Such a material breach of the Supply
Agreement will not change the obligations of the parties
with respect to any other existing contracts or other
obligations described in paragraph 7 above and AWG's
obligations in connection with such existing contracts or
other obligations will continue notwithstanding such
breach. In addition, breaches of the Supply Agreement
other than such a material breach will not change the
obligations of the parties with respect to any existing
contracts or other obligations described in paragraph 7
above and AWG's obligations in connection with such
existing contracts or other obligations will continue
notwithstanding such breaches. If following a material
breach of the right of first offer or non-compete
provisions of the Supply Agreement terminating AWG's
obligations with respect to the Drake and K-CCS contracts,
AWG brings suit against HL for damages resulting from such
breach, AWG will not seek and will not be entitled to
receive damages in respect of any liabilities under such
contracts originally assumed by AWG but for which AWG's
responsibility has terminated.

10. This provision is subject to approval by AWG's Board of
Directors. HL will grant a Right of First Offer to AWG on the
remaining 67 stores. In the event HL decides to sell any
store, HL must give notice to AWG of any desired sale (which
notice would include the desired sales price and the general
terms). AWG would have 45 days to accept the offer of sale
described in such notice and to enter into a definitive sale
agreement. AWG and HL would negotiate in good faith to enter
into a definitive sale agreement. If AWG does not accept the
offer of sale described in such notice and enter into such sale
agreement within such forty-five day period, HL may sell such
store to any other party for a price that is not less than 90%
of the proposed sales price, and on other general terms that
are not more favorable in the aggregate than the terms
contained in the notice described above. Sales to "affiliates"
shall not be subject to the foregoing; provided, however, (i)
affiliates shall include only entities which are wholly owned
by HL or Homeland Holding Corporation; (ii) the affiliate must
agree in writing prior to such sale to use AWG as the
affiliate's wholesale supplier in accordance with the terms of
the Supply Agreement between the parties, (iii) the affiliate
must agree in writing that any subsequent sale by such
affiliate is subject to the foregoing Right of First Offer,
(iv) such sale to an affiliate shall not be an event of default
under any of HL's then outstanding loans, indebtedness or other
material contracts, and (v) such transfer shall not result in
the insolvency of either HL or the affiliate. 

11. HL will become a member/retailer of AWG.

a. Purchase 15 shares of AWG Class A Voting Stock at $1,055
per share.

12. Summary - AWG will pay to HL a Purchase Price of:

a. $45 Million for the Assets listed in paragraph 2;

b. Plus, the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph 4 above
for inventory in the warehouses;

c. Plus, the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph 6 above,
for inventory in 28 of the 29 Stores and the Edmond store
upon termination of the lease thereof;

d. Plus, assume liability under the Store Leases;

e. Plus, assume liability under the Warehouse Leases; and

f. Plus, the undertakings and liabilities described in
connection with the contracts and other obligations in
paragraph 7.

The foregoing is subject to further discussions, normal
documentation, due diligence and definition of terms.

HOMELAND REACHED TENTATIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL
29 STORES AND WAREHOUSE OPERATIONS TO
ASSOCIATED WHOLESALE GROCERS, KANSAS CITY

---------------

Homeland to Join Wholesale Cooperative

---------------

James A. Demme Named President and CEO

OKLAHOMA CITY, OK, November 30, 1994---Homeland Stores, Inc. today
announced that it has reached an Agreement in Principle to sell 29
of its stores and its warehouse complex to Associated Wholesale
Grocers, Kansas City ("AWG") -- a major retail-owned buying
cooperative with [735] member stores in a nine state region. As
part of the agreement, Homeland will enter into a seven-year supply
agreement with AWG for its remaining stores that provides Homeland
the lowest prices and best possible terms available through the AWG
system on the purchase of products and services.

Also under the agreement, which is scheduled to close during the
second quarter of 1995, AWG will pay Homeland $45 million plus
value of inventory in the warehouse and 29 stores. Homeland
expects that proceeds from the sale would be used to improve the
Company's financial position by paying down the Company's trade
payables and other liabilities and reducing its outstanding
indebtedness.

Homeland officials said that the Agreement in Principle was an
essential first step in the Company's effort to complete an
operational restructuring that will allow the Company to reduce its
debt burden and fixed operating costs and improve its performance. 
Homeland's performance in recent years has been under pressure as
a result of difficult economic conditions and the entry of
aggressive competition into its key markets.

"The recent influx of large national competitors into Oklahoma and
surrounding markets has hurt independents and regional chains like
Homeland," said Chuck Ames, Chairman of Homeland. "We believe a
strategic partnership with AWG will benefit Homeland by allowing us
to increase our buying power, reduce both our debt and fixed
operating costs and focus our operations on a core of profitable
stores."

The Company also announced that as part of the restructuring, Max
Raydon has resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer.

"With this Agreement we have taken a major step towards
implementing an operational restructuring that will improve
Homeland's ability to compete, and I feel it is time for me to
pursue other opportunities," said Raydon.

The Company announced that James A. Demme has been appointed
President and Chief Executive Officer effective immediately and
that Raydon will serve as a consultant to the Company to assist
with the transition.

"Jim Demme brings senior management experience in both retail and
wholesale to Homeland. That experience will be key to the success
of our transformation from an independent regional chain to a
member of the AWG wholesale cooperative," said Ames.

Demme has 35 years experience in the wholesale/retail food
industry, most recently as Executive Vice-President of Retail
Operations for Scrivner, Inc. Prior to its recent acquisition by
Fleming Companies, Inc., Scrivner was the third largest wholesale
food distribution company in the nation with sales in excess of $6
billion. Previously, Demme also held the positions of President
and Chief Operating Officer at Shaws Supermarkets, a large retail
chain based in Massachusetts with sales of more than $1.7 billion.

"I'm looking forward to working with the management and employees
of Homeland to revitalize the Company. The Homeland name has
strong consumer appeal in this market, and the restructuring will
give us more balance and consistency in store size and `look' in
our core stores -- allowing us to improve in consistency of
marketing strategy and consumer offering," Demme said.

AWG is the fifth largest wholesale distributor in the country with
more than $2.5 billion in revenues and buying power six times
greater than Homeland. AWG has 735 independent retail stores as
members of its supply cooperative. The acquisition of 29 Homeland
stores and Homeland's joining of the AWG cooperative will bring
that total to 846.

With 111 stores, Homeland is the leading supermarket chain in
Oklahoma, southern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle region with an
estimated overall market share of 27 percent.

Financial Information

The unaudited summary financial data set forth below
should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" contained in the Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the period ended September 10, 1994 of Holding.

The projected 1994 financial information represents
actual operating data for the 44 weeks ended November 5, 1994 and
projected performance for the 8 weeks ending December 31, 1994,
without, in each case, giving effect to the Transaction. The
adjusted projected 1994 financial information was prepared by
Homeland to illustrate the estimated effects of the Transaction and
certain related transactions as if the Transaction and related
transactions had occurred as of January 2, 1994.

The financial information set forth below (including the
projected 1994 financial information) has been prepared by Homeland
to present the effects of the Transaction and related transactions,
but is not factual and should not be relied upon as being
representative of future results. The estimates and assumptions
underlying such information are inherently uncertain, being based
upon events that have not taken place, are subject to economic,
competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies beyond
Homeland's control and involve judgments based upon past
performance and industry trends which may not necessarily be
indicative of future performance or trends. Consequently, there
may be no assurance that (a) the assumptions underlying such
information will prove correct, (b) the results reflected in such
information can be realized, or (c) the actual results will not be
higher or lower than those projected. However, Homeland believes
that the basis for such information is reasonable, taking into
account the purpose for which it has been prepared.

The financial information set forth below was not
prepared with a view towards public disclosure or compliance with
the published guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission
or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or
generally accepted accounting principles. The independent auditors
of Homeland have not examined, reviewed or compiled such
information and, accordingly, do not express an opinion or any
other form of assurance on it.

Homeland does not intend to update or otherwise revise
the financial information set forth below to reflect circumstances
existing after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events, even in the event any or all of the
underlying assumptions are shown to be in error. Furthermore,
Homeland does not intend to update or revise such information to
reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions. 
However, upon the consummation of the Transaction, Homeland intends
to file a Current Report on Form 8-K that would include the
information required by Items (2) and (7) of Form 8-K.

HOMELAND HOLDING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PROJECTED SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA

1. Projected 1994:

The projected 1994 financial information represents actual
operating data for the 44 weeks ended November 5, 1994 and 
projected performance for the 8 weeks ending December 31, 1994
without, in each case, giving effect to the Transaction or to the
closing of certain stores. The balance shown for the Revolving
Credit Loans includes outstanding letters of credit of $9.5
million.

2. Projected Equity:

Reflects the early adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" during the fourth quarter of fiscal
1994. The impact of adoption has resulted in a one-time charge
against equity of $1.9 million.

3. Sales and Gross Profit:

Net sales and gross profit represents actual operating data for the
44 weeks ended November 5, 1994 and projected performance for the
8 weeks ending December 31, 1994 for the continuing stores. Gross
profit has been impacted by the following: 

(a) A reduction by 0.5% to reflect the anticipated initial
increase in inventory costs during the Company's transition to
AWG's purchasing programs and procedures. Management believes
that the impact of the transition will be reduced over time.

(b) An increase by 1.0% to reflect the purchase rebates offered
pursuant to the Transaction as set forth in the Letter of
Intent.

4. Selling and Administrative:

Includes management's estimates of certain anticipated corporate
cost reductions, such as reduced headcount and other administrative
expenses, likely to arise from the Transaction. The adjusted
projected results also give effect to the estimated cost impact of
senior ranking union employees employed in the stores to be sold to
AWG or closed, replacing junior union employees in the continuing
stores as provided for in the United Food and Commercial Workers of
North America collective bargaining agreement.

5. Depreciation, Amortization and Non-Cash Items:

Includes certain anticipated corporate asset disposals resulting
from the Transaction.
HOMELAND HOLDING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PROJECTED SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA

6. Debt:

Debt repayments are based on an estimate of the net cash proceeds
to be received from the Transaction and sale of certain assets
relating to closed stores allocated on a pro rata basis to the
projected outstanding debt as of December 31, 1994. The effect of
such pro rata allocation of proceeds may not be consistent with the
requirements set forth under the Company's Revolving Credit
Agreement and Senior Note Indenture. Capital leases are reduced by
$9.1 million resulting from the assumption of some leases and the
termination of others in conjunction with the Transaction and
closing of certain stores.

7. Interest Expense:

Interest expense for the year is estimated based on the rates in
effect during fiscal 1994 applied to the outstanding debt during
the fiscal year assuming the estimated pro rata debt repayments
described in Note 6 above were made as of January 2, 1994.

8. Cash Capital Expenditures:

Represents projected cash capital expenditures to be incurred
during fiscal 1995 for the continuing stores.

9. Adjusted Projected Equity:

Represents the impact of the Transaction on equity and includes the
following:

(a) Estimated net book loss resulting from the Transaction.

(b) Estimated net loss resulting from closing certain stores.

(c) Estimated costs of debt restructuring and other Transaction
related expenses.
