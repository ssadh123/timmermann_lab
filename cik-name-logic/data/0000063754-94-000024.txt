FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

McCORMICK ANNOUNCES MAJOR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

SPARKS, MD, OCT. 11 -- McCormick & Company, Incorporated today
announced a comprehensive restructuring of its business operations,
including plant consolidations, functional and departmental
consolidations, and staff reductions. The Company expects to
record a one-time, pre-tax charge of up to $66 million.

Included in the charge is a reduction of approximately 600
positions, or 7% of McCormick's worldwide workforce.

A large percentage of the workforce reductions will result
from plant consolidations and the sale of one business unit. 
Included are the following:

Closing of the McCormick Flavor Group's production
facility in Hayward, Calif. 

Products manufactured at Hayward will be produced at
McCormick's facility in Salinas, Calif.

Closing of McCormick's Food Service Division's spice
production operation in Hunt Valley, Md. Products manufactured at
the Food Service spice plant will be produced at the Company's
consumer products plant in Hunt Valley.

Realignment of some of McCormick's operations in the
United Kingdom.

Sale of McCormick's Golden West Foods subsidiary in
Bedford, Va.

The Company also announced the following:

Some functional activities will be consolidated,
primarily in the Company's Hunt Valley operations.

Some staff reductions will occur within and between
functions And departments throughout the Company.

A Voluntary Special Retirement Program will be
offered.

"The decision to take these actions is an investment for the
future," stated H. Eugene Blattman, President and Chief Executive
Officer. "These actions are being undertaken during a period of
solid financial performance in order to continue building
shareholder value.

"We are committed to enhancing our worldwide leadership
position. We will meet our financial objectives by growing the
McCormick brands, ensuring our low cost producer status, and
supporting our global expansion strategies."

Plant closings will occur during the next 24 months. Staff
reductions will begin no earlier than February 1, 1995. Affected
employees will be notified immediately.

Concluded Mr. Blattman, "We have taken these steps after
thorough evaluation and planning. Strong consideration has been
given to the impact on our employees. The Voluntary Special
Retirement Program should create openings to absorb some displaced
employees. We will also provide enhanced severance benefits as
well as transition and outplacement services.

"These actions are designed to generate continued long-term
growth and profitability, meet the competitive challenges of the
future, and enhance shareholder and employee value as an
independent company."

McCormick is the international producer of spices, seasonings,
flavorings, and specialty foods.
