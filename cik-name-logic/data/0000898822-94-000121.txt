EXHIBIT 1

AMENDMENT TO RIGHTS AGREEMENT

AMENDMENT, dated as of December 9, 1994, to the

Rights Agreement, dated as of June 30, 1988 (the "Rights

Agreement"), between Avery International Corporation (now Avery

Dennison Corporation), a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),

and Security Pacific National Bank (now First Interstate Bank

of California as successor to Security Pacific National Bank,

by amendment), as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").

The Company and the Rights Agent have heretofore

executed and entered into the Rights Agreement. Pursuant to

Section 27 of the Rights Agreement, the Company and the Rights

Agent may from time to time supplement or amend the Rights

Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 27

thereof. All acts and things necessary to make this Amendment

a valid agreement, enforceable according to its terms, have

been done and performed, and the execution and delivery of this

Amendment by the Company and the Rights Agent have been in all

respects duly authorized by the Company and the Rights Agent.

In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual

agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as fol-

lows:<PAGE>

1. Section 1(a) of the Rights Agreement is hereby

modified and amended by adding the following sentence to the

end thereof:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board of Directors

of the Company determines in good faith that a Person who

would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person", as defined

pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph

(a), has become such inadvertently, and such Person di-

vests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of

Common Shares so that such Person would no longer be an

"Acquiring Person", as defined pursuant to the foregoing

provisions of this paragraph (a), then such Person shall

not be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes

of this Agreement.

2. Section 1 of the Rights Agreement is hereby

modified and amended by deleting paragraph (n) thereof (and all

cross references thereto in the Rights Agreement) in its en-

tirety.

3. Section 11(a) of the Rights Agreement is hereby

modified and amended by deleting subparagraph (iii) thereof in

its entirety, renumbering subparagraph (iv) thereof as sub-

paragraph (iii), and amending and modifying subparagraph (ii)

thereof to read in its entirety as follows:

-2-<PAGE>

(ii) Subject to Section 24 of this Agreement, in the

event any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder

of a Right shall thereafter have a right to receive, upon

exercise thereof at a price equal to the then current

Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one-hundredths

of a Preferred Share for which a Right is then exercis-

able, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and

in lieu of Preferred Shares, such number of Common Shares

of the Company as shall equal the result obtained by (x)

multiplying the then current Purchase Price by the number

of one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right

is then exercisable and dividing that product by (y) 50%

of the then current per share market price of the Com-

pany's Common Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)

hereof) on the date of the occurrence of such event. In

the event that any Person shall become an Acquiring Person

and the Rights shall then be outstanding, the Company

shall not take any action which would eliminate or di-

minish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.

From and after the occurrence of such event, any

Rights that are or were acquired or beneficially owned by

any Acquiring Person (or any Associate or Affiliate of

such Acquiring Person) shall be void and any holder of

such Rights shall thereafter have no right to exercise

such Rights under any provision of this Agreement. No

-3-<PAGE>

Right Certificate shall be issued pursuant to Section 3

that represents Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring

Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the preced-

ing sentence or any Associate or Affiliate thereof; no

Right Certificate shall be issued at any time upon the

transfer of any Rights to an Acquiring Person whose Rights

would be void pursuant to the preceding sentence or any

Associate or Affiliate thereof or to any nominee of such

Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate; and any Right

Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent for transfer to

an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to

the preceding sentence shall be cancelled.

4. Section 11(a) of the Rights Agreement is hereby

further modified and amended by adding to the end of newly

renumbered subparagraph (iii) thereof the following sentence:

In the event the Company shall, after good faith effort,

be unable to take all such action as may be necessary to

authorize such additional Common Shares, the Company shall

substitute, for each Common Share that would otherwise be

issuable upon exercise of a Right, a number of Preferred

Shares or fraction thereof such that the current per share

market price of one Preferred Share multiplied by such

number or fraction is equal to the current per share

-4-<PAGE>

market price of one Common Share as of the date of issu-

ance of such Preferred Shares or fraction thereof.

5. Section 24(a) of the Rights Agreement is hereby

modified and amended by deleting the phrase "at any time after

the occurrence of a Trigger Event" from the first sentence

thereof and substituting therefor the phrase "at any time after

any Person becomes an Acquiring Person".

6. Section 24 of the Rights Agreement is hereby

modified and amended by deleting paragraph (c) thereof in its

entirety, relettering paragraphs (d) and (e) thereof as para-

graphs (c) and (d), respectively, and amending and modifying

the newly relettered paragraph (c) thereof to read in its en-

tirety as follows:

In the event that there shall not be sufficient Common

Shares issued but not outstanding or authorized but

unissued to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated

in accordance with this Section 24, the Company shall take

all such action as may be necessary to authorize addi-

tional Common Shares for issuance upon exchange of the

Rights. In the event the Company shall, after good faith

effort, be unable to take all such action as may be nec-

essary to authorize such additional Common Shares, the

Company shall substitute, for each Common Share that would

otherwise be issuable upon exchange of a Right, a number

-5-<PAGE>

of Preferred Shares or fraction thereof such that the

current per share market price of one Preferred Share

multiplied by such number or fraction is equal to the

current per share market price of one Common Share as of

the date of issuance of such Preferred Shares or fraction

thereof.

7. Section 27 of the Rights Agreement is hereby

modified and amended by changing the percentage "15%" in the

last sentence thereof to "10%". 

8. This Amendment to the Rights Agreement shall

be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of

the State of Delaware and for all purposes shall be governed

by and construed in accordance with the laws of such State

applicable to contracts to be made and performed entirely

within such State.

9. This Amendment to the Rights Agreement may be

executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be

an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute

one and the same instrument. Terms not defined herein shall,

unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings as-

signed to such terms in the Rights Agreement.

10. In all respects not inconsistent with the terms

and provisions of this Amendment to the Rights Agreement, the

-6-<PAGE>

Rights Agreement is hereby ratified, adopted, approved and

confirmed. In executing and delivering this Amendment, the

Rights Agent shall be entitled to all the privileges and im-

munities afforded to the Rights Agent under the terms and

conditions of the Rights Agreement.

11. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction

of this Amendment to the Rights Agreement is held by a court of

competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void

or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,

covenants and restrictions of this Amendment to the Rights

Agreement, and of the Rights Agreement, shall remain in full

force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or

invalidated.

-7-<PAGE>

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused

this Amendment to be duly executed and attested, all as of the

date and year first above written.
