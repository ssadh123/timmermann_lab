Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

On December 13, 1993, Oshkosh B'Gosh, Inc. engaged the
accounting firm of Ernst & Young as the independent auditors
to audit the Company's financial statements for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 1993, replacing the firm of
Schumaker, Romenesko & Associates, S.C., which was the
independent public auditors for the Company's most recent
consolidated financial statements. The change was approved
by the Board of Directors.

In connection with the audits of the two fiscal years ended
December 31, 1992, and the subsequent interim periods
preceding the engagement of Ernst & Young, there were no
disagreements with Schumaker, Romenesko & Associates, S.C.
on any matters of accounting principles or procedures.

Schumaker, Romenesko & Associates, S.C.'s report on the
financial statements for the prior two years contained no
adverse or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The
Company has requested that Schumaker, Romenesko &
Associates, S.C. furnish it with a letter addressed to the
SEC stating whether it agrees with the above statements.

A copy of the Schumaker, Romenesko & Associates, S.C.'s
letter to the SEC is filed as an addendum hereto.
